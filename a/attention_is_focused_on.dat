5|$|September's {{counterpart}} to Sundance, the Toronto International Film Festival, is {{held at the}} end of the month. The film community's <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the Canadian city. Critics gather to see potential Oscar contenders among the many independent films on the program and studio executives look to line up distribution deals with the same prize in mind. Some of the best are released within a week or so, ending the September dump period.|$|E
5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent species are.|$|E
25|$|This {{is similar}} to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> {{everything}} in existence. A constant concern for Allah (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.|$|E
50|$|After Guadalcanal, <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> Europe, where Italy was taken, heavy {{bombing was}} {{hammering}} Germany, and the Red Army was steadily advancing west.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system. Northern <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> racial issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|R
50|$|Much <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> {{the issue}} of {{government}} funding for universities, with Oxford facing the effects of cuts in its funding, leading to several chairs being left unfilled.|$|R
25|$|In many of Kengo Kuma’s projects, <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the {{connection}} spaces; on the segments between inside and outside, and one {{room to the}} next. The choice of materials stems not so much from an intention to guide {{the design of the}} forms, but to conform to the existing surroundings from a desire to compare similar materials, yet show the technical advances that have made possible new uses.|$|E
25|$|The flux {{through the}} portion of the path from the brush at the rim, through the outside loop and the axle {{to the center of the}} disc is always zero because the {{magnetic}} field is in the plane of this path (not perpendicular to it), no matter what is rotating, so the integrated emf around this part of the path is always zero. Therefore, <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> {{the portion of}} the path from the axle across the disc to the brush at the rim.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{claims that}} he can solve the mystery within twenty-four hours simply by {{interviewing}} the suspects. During these interviews he establishes a timeline that seems impossible: Sarah King places {{the time of death}} considerably before the times at which various of the family members claim last to have seen the victim alive. <b>Attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> a hypodermic syringe that has seemingly been stolen from Dr. Gerard’s tent and later replaced. The poison administered to the victim is believed to be digitoxin, something that she already took medicinally.|$|E
40|$|Particular <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> {{the methods}} of heat {{transfer}} intensifications.

25|$|Whereas {{statistical}} mechanics proper involves dynamics, here the <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focussed</b> <b>on</b> statistical equilibrium (steady state). Statistical equilibrium {{does not mean}} that the particles have stopped moving (mechanical equilibrium), rather, only that the ensemble is not evolving.|$|R
25|$|June 14, 1940 – While world <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> {{the fall}} of Paris to Nazi Germany a day earlier, Molotov accuses the Baltic {{countries}} of conspiracy against the Soviet Union and delivers an ultimatum to Lithuania {{for the establishment of}} a government the Soviets approve of. On the same day, the Soviet blockade of Estonia went into effect. According to eyewitness accounts pieced together by Estonian and Finnish investigators, two Soviet bombers downed Finnish passenger airplane Kaleva flying from Tallinn to Helsinki carrying three diplomatic pouches from the U.S. legations in Tallinn, Riga and Helsinki. The US Foreign Service employee Henry W. Antheil Jr. was killed in the crash.|$|E
25|$|Human's {{attention}} on words is impacted by emotion grasping vocabulary. Negative and positive words are better recalled than neutral {{words that are}} spoken. Many different ways that <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> hearing what the speaker has to say is the inflection of the presenter's voice in a sad, content, frustrated sound or {{in the use of}} words that are close to the hear. A study was conducted to observe if the use of emotional vocabulary was a key receptor of recall memory. The groups were put into the same lecture halls and given the same speakers, but the results came back to determine that the inflection and word choice recalled by the listeners concluded that emotional words, phrases, and sounds are more memorable than neutral speakers.|$|E
500|$|Moralistic {{judgments}} implying wrongness or badness on {{the part}} of people who don't act in harmony with our values. Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticisms, comparisons, and diagnoses are all said to be forms of judgment. (Moralistic judgments are {{not to be confused with}} value judgments as to the qualities we value.) The use of moralistic judgments is characterized as an impersonal way of expressing oneself that does not require one to reveal what is going on inside of oneself. This way of speaking is said to have the result that [...] "Our <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather than on what we and others need and are not getting." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} sociological {{analysis}} of social control, {{considered as a}} set of responses provided or carried out against a behavior considered deviant in order to restore social order. In particular, <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> establishing prison, reconstructing first the historical path that has anticipated the birth of modern and in second-order phase marked by the current crisis of the ideal rehabilitation. In addition, <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the Italian situation, looking in particular to prison reform, its basic principles and the professional educator penitentiary. Finally, the work examines two of the most important and sensitive fields related to social control, in view of their relevance: the electronic bracelet and chemical castration...|$|R
500|$|Results May Vary was {{released}} on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the clown {{jumping up and down}} and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?" [...] The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, [...] "At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto [...] But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?" [...] Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No.3 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Results May Vary was mainly negative. The album received [...] "generally unfavorable reviews" [...] on Metacritic, {{with a score}} of 33 out of 100. This is the second lowest score on Metacritic, above only Kevin Federline's album Playing with Fire. According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the clown {{jumping up and down}} and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that {{can only be described as}} abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent throughout your new album—consistently crappy." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn't have bothered [...] having seen Limp Bizkit's 'other side', you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back". Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "Results May Vary has a few highlights — 'Almost Over' (very Everlast) and 'Phenomenon' (very Primus) — but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent".|$|E
2500|$|A lot of <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> nature: ravines, mountains, {{flowering}} forests at night, {{the quiet}} {{sound of water}} lapping over seaweed. [...] Animals and other creatures fill his lines: birds, horses, bees, lions, reptiles, even crawling insects.|$|E

50|$|For {{almost three}} years, media <b>attention</b> <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> Atlanta, Georgia, where {{the bodies of}} young {{children}} were discovered in lakes, marshes, and ponds along roadside trails.

2500|$|Ronstadt {{eventually}} {{tired of}} playing arenas. She {{had ceased to}} feel that arenas, where people milled around smoking marijuana cigarettes and drinking beer, were [...] "appropriate places for music". She wanted [...] "angels in the architecture"a reference to a lyric in the Paul Simon song [...] "You Can Call Me Al" [...] from the 1986 album Graceland. (Ronstadt sang harmony with Simon on a different Graceland track, [...] "Under African Skies". The second verse's lyrics pay tribute to Ronstadt: [...] "Take this child, Lord, from Tucson, Arizona...."). Ronstadt has said she wants to sing in places similar to the theatre of ancient Greece, where the <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the stage and the performer.|$|E
2500|$|Atlatls, {{consisting}} of a weighted stick with a flexible spear or dart, are one example of primitive weapons that are commonly used today. In the U.S., the Pennsylvania Game Commission has given preliminary approval [...] for the legalization of the atlatl for hunting certain animals. The animals that {{would be allowed to}} atlatl hunters have yet to be determined, but <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> deer. There are some who object, stating that the atlatl is rarely capable of a clean kill, resulting in undue suffering for the sport animal. As of 2007, only Alabama allowed the use of the atlatl for deer hunting, with a few other states allowing its use for rough fish (rather than food or sport species), as well as some game birds and non-game mammals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} this church {{has set a}} pattern for Jesuit churches that lasted into the twentieth century; its {{innovations}} require enumerating. Aesthetics across the Catholic Church as a whole were strongly influenced by the Council of Trent. [...] Although the Council itself said little about church architecture, its suggestion of simplification prompted Charles Borromeo to reform ecclesiastical building practise. Evidence of attention to his writings {{can be found at}} the Gesù. There is no narthex in which to linger: the visitor is projected immediately into the body of the church, a single nave without aisles, so that the congregation is assembled and <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the high altar. In place of aisles there are a series of identical interconnecting chapels behind arched openings, to which entrance is controlled by decorative balustrades with gates. Transepts are reduced to stubs that emphasize the altars of their end walls.|$|E

2500|$|Van Gogh's use {{of color}} is {{intended}} to be symbolic. [...] The audience is drawn in by his use of contracting patterns and colors that bring in an energy and intensity to the work. Complementary shades of blue and orange, a stylistic deviation from colors of Impressionist paintings that he acquired during his exploration in Paris, stand out against the spring-like pale green in the background. [...] La Mousmé's outfit is a blend of modern and traditional. Her outfit is certainly modern. The bright colors of skirt and jacket are of the southern region of Arles. [...] Regarding Van Gogh's painting of her features, his greatest <b>attention</b> <b>is</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the girls face, giving her the coloring of a girl from Arles, but with a Japanese influence. [...] The young lady's posture mimics that of the oleander. [...] The flowering oleander, like the girl, is in the blossoming stage of life.|$|E
