5|$|King Henry and King Stephen {{recognised}} Pain as {{the legitimate}} holder of the lands acquired through his wife Sybil. Her kinsman Gilbert de Lacy {{was the son}} of Roger de Lacy, who had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated; he had though retained his properties in Normandy. Roger's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy, from whom Sybil had inherited them. On Roger's death Gilbert inherited the lands in Normandy, <b>and</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>his</b> claim to the family's former English estates. Coplestone-Crow speculates that the uncertainty hanging over the inheritance was one reason why Pain endeavoured to secure more lands around Ludlow.|$|E
5|$|By July 1943, the 7th Division {{was on its}} {{way back}} to Port Moresby. Vasey flew up to work out {{arrangements}} with Herring and the air commander in New Guinea, Major General Ennis Whitehead of the US Fifth Air Force. Probably inspired by his experience on Crete, Vasey proposed using paratroops, <b>and</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>his</b> superiors for an entire regiment instead of the battalion he was originally allotted. The new campaign opened in spectacular fashion on 5 September 1943 with a parachute drop of the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment in broad daylight to seize the airstrip at Nadzab in the Markham Valley. They were soon reinforced by Australian and Papuan troops that had advanced overland from Wau, and then by the 7th Division's 25th Infantry Brigade, which flew in by air.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} {{alternating}} succession {{broke down in}} 1764, when Álvaro XI, a Kinlaza, drove out the Kimpanzu king Pedro V and took over the throne. Pedro and his successor in Luvata maintained a separate court at Sembo, and never acknowledged the usurpation. A regent of Pedro's successor claimed the throne in the early 1780s <b>and</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>his</b> claims against a José I, a Kinlaza from the Mbidizi Valley branch of the royal family. José won the showdown, fought at São Salvador in 1781, a massive battle involving 30,000 soldiers on José's side alone. To show his contempt for his defeated rival, José refused to allow the soldiers of the other faction to receive Christian burial. José's power was limited, as he had no sway over the lands controlled by the Kinlaza faction of Lemba and Matari, {{even though they were}} technically of the same family, and he did not follow up his victory to extend his authority over the Kimpanzu lands around Luvota. At the same time, the lands around Mount Kibangu, Pedro IV's original base, was controlled—as it had been for the whole eighteenth century—by members of the Água Rosada family, who claimed descent from both the Kimpanzu and Kinlaza.|$|E

500|$|The {{appointment}} {{was described as}} [...] "sending an armoured car into an orchard of apple trees" [...] and Henson had doubts about accepting a mainly rural diocese rather than ministering to the urban poor. Nevertheless, the clergy and laity of Hereford gave him a warm welcome, and he enjoyed working with the incumbents of country parishes. They appreciated his delicacy in not intruding unduly into local church concerns, and it was remarked that [...] "he treated all the world as his equals". During his brief time at Hereford he published only one book, Christian Liberty (1918), a collection of sermons. There was regret in the diocese that his tenure there was brief. In 1920 the see of Durham became vacant {{on the death of}} Bishop Moule. Davidson wanted Thomas Strong, Dean of Christ Church, to be appointed <b>and</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>his</b> claims on Lloyd George, but the prime minister took the view that the area needed Henson's practical skills and common touch rather than Strong's academic scholarship.|$|E
500|$|With Walls and Bridges {{coming out}} first, Lennon had reneged on his deal with Levy, and Levy {{threatened}} to refile his lawsuit, but Lennon explained to Levy what had happened, and {{assured him that}} the covers album was indeed in the works. Levy gave Lennon use of his farm in upstate New York to rehearse material. Lennon then recalled the session musicians from Walls and Bridges to complete the oldies tracks. Several tracks never made it past the rehearsal stage: [...] "C'mon Everybody", [...] "Thirty Days", [...] "That'll Be the Day" [...] – the band also played a few impromptu jams. On 21 October, Lennon went into Record Plant East, completing the oldies tracks in a few days. Lennon wanted the musicians {{to stay close to}} the original arrangements of the songs, apart from [...] "Do You Wanna Dance?". Mixing and editing lasted until mid-November. To assure him progress was being made, Lennon gave Levy a rough tape of the sessions to review. Levy took the tapes <b>and</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>his</b> own version of the album called [...] on his record label, Adam VIII, then proceeded to sue Lennon, EMI and Capitol for $42 million for breach of contract. Capitol/EMI quickly sought an injunction. After two trials, in which Lennon had to convince the court of the difference between a rough version and a final take, Levy won $6,795 in damages, and Lennon won $144,700, in February 1976. The album was originally scheduled for release in April 1975, however, in February 1975, Capitol Records rush-released the official Rock 'n' Roll as a Capitol [...] "budget" [...] album (prefix code SK—one dollar cheaper than the usual releases) to counteract sales of the Levy album.|$|E

50|$|His {{leadership}} decisions, {{most importantly}} his retreat from Mexico City, {{contributed to his}} defeat. Historians can only speculate about the result if Hidalgo had pushed into Mexico City in November 1810.

Filipović, however, left the Balkan {{newcomers}} in January 2010 when his contract expired. During his time, Montenegro rose to 73rd {{position in the}} FIFA rankings.|$|R
