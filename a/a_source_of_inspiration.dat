5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century five cast iron lamp columns with {{decorative}} scrollwork were added.

5|$|American filmmaker Eli Roth has {{cited the}} film as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> to promote his 2002 horror film Cabin Fever {{through the use of}} the Internet. The Blair Witch Project was among the films {{included}} in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.|$|E

5|$|El Greco's {{personality}} and work were <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913) was based directly on El Greco's Immaculate Conception. Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco {{and wrote a}} tribute to the Cretan-born artist.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{served as}} <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for Walter DuBois Richards, an artist, for over forty years. Since 1935, swimmers have been competing {{annually in the}} Arthur J. Ladrigan Swim Race, a one-mile (1.6km) race from the lighthouse to Bayley Beach in the Rowayton section of Norwalk.|$|E
5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} {{as a character}} to provide a non-human perspective for the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> as a control freak caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E
5000|$|The work of Christian Pontus Andersson {{balances}} between kitch and stringent form, {{creating a}} {{contrast between the}} extravagant homoerotic appearances of the figures and the fragile material {{of which they are}} made. <b>As</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration,</b> Andersson mentions Czech artist Alphonse Mucha, and his work also resembles Matthew Barney and Jeff Koons.|$|R

5|$|El Greco's {{dramatic}} and expressionistic style {{was met with}} puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco {{is regarded as a}} precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.|$|E
5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration.</b> This examination {{extended to}} {{in some cases}} copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested {{to be the result}} of defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit different sizes, with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E
5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done? (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> throughout her life.|$|E

5|$|In modern history, orators such as Henry Clay would mimic Demosthenes's technique. His {{ideas and}} {{principles}} survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements of our times. Hence, he constituted <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for {{the authors of}} The Federalist Papers (a series of 85 essays arguing for the ratification of the United States Constitution) and for the major orators of the French Revolution. French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau {{was among those who}} idealised Demosthenes and wrote a book about him. For his part, Friedrich Nietzsche often composed his sentences according to the paradigms of Demosthenes, whose style he admired.* P. J. M. Van Tongeren, Reinterpreting Modern Culture, 92.|$|E
5|$|The album title {{derives from}} the Dutch art {{movement}} of the same name; common elements of the De Stijl aesthetic are demonstrated on the album cover, which sets the band members against an abstract background of rectangles and lines in red, black and white. The White Stripes have cited the minimalist and deconstructionist aspects of De Stijl design as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for their own musical image and presentation. The album was dedicated to furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld of the De Stijl movement, {{as well as to}} the influential Georgia bluesman Blind Willie McTell.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example of}} his final stage {{can be seen in}} a simple but very ingenious building, the Sagrada Família schools, a small school for the workers' children. Built in 1909, it has a {{rectangular}} ground plan of , and contained three classrooms, a vestibule and a chapel. It was built of exposed brick, in three overlapping layers, following the traditional Catalan method. The walls and roof have an undulating shape, giving the structure a sense of lightness but also strength. The Sagrada Família schools have set an example of constructive genius and have served as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for many architects, such is their simplicity, strength, originality, functionality and geometric excellence.|$|E
50|$|Parliament-Funkadelic leader George Clinton has cited Mumbo Jumbo as <b>a</b> primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for his P-Funk mythology.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} Greek {{philosophers}} mentioned above, Polybius was also <b>an</b> important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for Cicero's political views.|$|R

5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's leadership skills {{during the course of}} his association with the project remained <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.|$|E
5|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{is one of}} {{only two}} films {{directed}} by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular, used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black (2005) and Saawariya (2007), said that he and others in his field look to Mughal-e-Azam as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for art direction. It has also been used {{as a model for the}} perfect love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing to her heart condition, and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway.|$|E
5|$|Since its release, Dragon Ball {{has become}} one of the most {{successful}} manga and anime series of all time. The manga's 42 volumes have sold over 156 million copies in Japan and more than 240 million copies worldwide, making it the second best-selling manga series in history. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humor of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest manga series ever made, with many manga artists citing Dragon Ball as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly Dragon Ball Z, is also highly popular in various countries and was arguably one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture.|$|E

50|$|A hiker, Lavadour's {{exploration}} of the mountain regions of his home continue to serve as <b>a</b> major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for his work today.|$|R
5|$|The {{authors have}} named several other authors {{as sources of}} {{inspiration}} when writing the novels. In an online author chat, Cherith Baldry listed the authors that inspire her as including Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Shakespeare. In the same chat, Victoria Holmes stated that Jacqueline Wilson, Kathy Reichs, and J. K. Rowling {{are some of the}} authors that inspire her. According to the official website, other authors who have inspired the writers include Enid Blyton, Lucy Daniels, Ellis Peters, Tess Gerritsen, Kate Ellis, Lisa Gardiner, and Meg Cabot. The authors have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration. The New Forest in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place. Other influential locations include Loch Lomond, as well as the Scottish Highlands. Nicholas Culpeper, a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, also had an influence on the Warriors series. His book, Culpeper's Herbal, is used as a source by the authors for the herbal remedies that the cats use in the books. In addition, the authors suggested that they may use some fan-created names in future books. Also mentioned as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> was the film series Rambo.|$|E
5|$|Development on Crash: Mind over Mutant began {{immediately}} {{after the completion of}} Crash of the Titans. The idea of preserving a titan for later use came from the play testing sessions of Crash of the Titans, in which the testers were found to be reluctant to leave the titans behind after an epic battle was won. Fans of the series were also <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for Crash: Mind over Mutant, having such wishes as a free-roaming environment, Coco Bandicoot being a playable character and the return of the character Doctor Nitrus Brio. Full camera control was considered for the game, but was rejected for graphical reasons and to avoid having to insert a split-screen view in the cooperation mode. Online gameplay was also considered as a feature in the finished game, but was omitted due to the brief development schedule. Coco Bandicoot as a playable character was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory. The Wii version of Crash: Mind over Mutant was created first, with the graphics scaled up for the Xbox 360, and scaled down for the PlayStation 2. A PlayStation 3 version of the game was rumored, but was promptly debunked by Radical Entertainment as a mistake on many press sites' behalf.|$|E
