Thereafter, it underwent a sharp decline (down by 2,099 inhabitants over a 30-year period), with signs of recovery only in the very last few years. Nevertheless, with 6,112 inhabitants, Cortina d'Ampezzo is the seventh most populous place in the province following Belluno (36,509), Feltre (20,688), Sedico (9,734), Ponte nelle Alpi (8,521), Santa Giustina (6,795) <b>and</b> <b>Mel</b> (6,272).

5|$|For {{the role}} of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose {{popularity}} was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator. Cameron was dubious about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even bigger to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone <b>and</b> <b>Mel</b> Gibson were offered the Terminator role, but both turned it down. The studio suggested O. J.

5|$|While {{the bill}} had been {{proposed}} by Republican Senators Rick Santorum <b>and</b> <b>Mel</b> Martinez, {{it also had}} the support of Democratic Senator Tom Harkin due to disability rights concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left; however, in the Schiavo case they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise. According to Marilyn Golden, Harkin's support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.|$|E

5|$|Boycott's {{eight seasons}} of {{captaincy}} were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club {{failed to win}} any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The {{beginning of the end}} of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews in which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan <b>and</b> <b>Mel</b> Ryan, said that a change in leadership was needed. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his first year as captain, he scored 2,503runs at an average of 100.12, included a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Friedman was lured back {{halfway through}} the 1931 season, and, but the Giants {{struggled}} the next two seasons, finishing with a combined record of 11–12–3. They rebounded in 1933 finishing 11–3, and narrowly losing to the Chicago Bears 23–21 in the championship game. New York's resurgence was led {{by some of the}} league's best linemen, such as Ray Flaherty, and future Hall of Famers Red Badgro, <b>and</b> <b>Mel</b> Hein. Hein, the team's center, was acquired in 1931, and also played the linebacker position. He would go on to a fifteen-year NFL career in which, as a center, he became an All-NFL first team selection eight times, and the only offensive lineman ever named league MVP. They also were aided by strong seasons from halfbacks Ken Strong, whose 64 points paced the team, and Kink Richards who averaged 6.8yards per carry on the season.|$|E
5|$|Mel learns {{from her}} spy Azmus that {{northern}} mercenaries {{have been seen}} near the border – allies of the Marquise of Merindar – and that other allied forces are planning on eradicating the Hill Folk to take their colorwoods for payment. Mel sends Azmus to tell Shevraeth and rides out to warn the Hill Folk, but is shocked to encounter Shevraeth already on the road. Initially, he assumes she is plotting with Merindar against him, but lets her go when she tells him about the plans against the Hill Folk. An outnumbered Mel bravely tries to stop a group of mercenaries marching towards nearby forests, and is only saved by forces sent by Shevraeth. The Hill Folk now safe, Mel returns to Shevraeth, where she learns that he successfully put down Merindar's revolt. She also learns {{that he has been}} her secret admirer. After finally calling him by his first name, Vidanric, they kiss. The two return to Remalna-city, and find that Flauvic has secretly bewitched the entire capitol. As Flauvic prepares to complete his victory, the Hill Folk come to Mel's rescue and turn him into a tree. With the realm now secure, Shevraeth <b>and</b> <b>Mel</b> marry and are crowned as king and queen.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} was {{for most of}} the filming a closed set, with great measures taken to maintain the secrecy of the plot. Scripts were numbered and lists kept of who received each copy. The press was told nothing about the story and only a few production stills were allowed to be published. During construction one young visitor to a soundstage stole a copy of blueprints for the bridge set and sold duplicates of them to any fans who would pay him $75; Paramount reported the matter to the FBI, who turned the case over to the Los Angeles Police Department. The police arrested, convicted, and fined the culprit $750; it was later discovered that the stolen plans were not the final copies. Visitor's badges were created to keep track of guests, and due to the limited number were constantly checked out; among the visitors included friends of the cast and crew, the press, fan leaders, and actors such as Clint Eastwood, Tony Curtis, Robin Williams, <b>and</b> <b>Mel</b> Brooks. Security swept cars leaving the lots for stolen items; even the principal actors were not spared from this inconvenience.|$|E
