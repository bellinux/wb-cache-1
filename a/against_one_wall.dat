25|$|All monastic orders {{required}} handwashing before meals. A lavatorium {{was therefore}} provided near the refectory, either <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> of the cloister {{with a long}} trench basin, or as a free-standing building with a circular or octagonal basin in the centre. An example of the first type, dating to the 14th century, survives at Gloucester Cathedral, and has a towel cupboard nearby. At Durham Cathedral, the lavatorium was a square building with a circular basin which was replaced in 143233 with one of marble. At Wenlock Priory, the octagonal lavatorium, now ruined, was decorated with late-12th-century carved panels including one of Jesus with the apostles at the Sea of Galilee. There were sometimes taps; at Wenlock Priory, the water spouted from animal heads mounted on the central pillar.|$|E
500|$|The GQG {{established}} {{its physical}} headquarters at Vitry-le-François, in the Marne department, on 5 August. [...] The location {{had been chosen}} as it was halfway between Paris and Nancy and roughly equidistant (at around 80 to 90 miles) to the headquarters {{of each of the}} five French armies. [...] The staff occupied a school building with the second bureau located in the classrooms and the third bureau in the gymnasiu, with the sports equipment pushed up <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall.</b> [...] The staff at GQG had the use of a detachment of the 8th Engineer Regiment, a company of the 19th Railway Squadron, two companies of the 68th Territorial Infantry Regiment, a company of Forestry Chasseurs, two anti-aircraft sections, up to two carrier pigeon units, a unit of cyclist messengers, a medical detachment and a military police escort squadron.|$|E
60|$|The {{little man}} resented her words, and flew {{into such a}} passion that he seized the nun, beat her, and threw her first <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> and then against the other. When he had nearly killed her he left her lying on the floor, and hastily {{walked out of the}} house.|$|E
50|$|Australian {{handball}} is a {{sport in}} which players hit a ball <b>against</b> <b>one</b> or more <b>walls.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was a {{courtyard}} {{at the back}} of the house. They found their way to it. A bench was placed <b>against</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>walls.</b> They sat down.|$|R
60|$|The night passed off quietly. The first work {{at which}} the Major set the {{garrison}} in the morning was to form six wooden stages <b>against</b> the <b>wall.</b> <b>One</b> by the gate, <b>one</b> <b>against</b> the <b>wall</b> at the other end, and two {{at each of the}} long sides of the inclosure. They were twelve feet in height, which enabled those upon them to stand head and shoulders above the level of the wall.|$|R
60|$|There were {{places in}} New York where Billy would find acquaintances. One in {{particular}} he recalled--a little, third-floor gymnasium not far {{distant from the}} Battery. Thither he turned his steps now. As he entered the stuffy room in which two big fellows, stripped to the waist, were sparring, a stout, low-browed man sitting in a back-tilted chair <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> looked up inquiringly. Billy crossed over to him, with outstretched hand.|$|E
60|$|Against the wrinkly mirror stood {{pictures}} of General Kitchener, William Muldoon, the Duchess of Marlborough, and Benvenuto Cellini. <b>Against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> was a plaster of Paris plaque of an O'Callahan in a Roman helmet. Near {{it was a}} violent oleograph of a lemon-coloured child assaulting an inflammatory butterfly. This was Dulcie's final judgment in art; but {{it had never been}} upset. Her rest had never been disturbed by whispers of stolen copes; no critic had elevated his eyebrows at her infantile entomologist.|$|E
6000|$|... "I met O'Connor in a boarding-house on the West Side. He {{invited me}} to his hall-room to have a drink, and we became like a dog and a cat that had been raised together. There he sat, a tall, fine, {{handsome}} man, with his feet <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> and {{his back against the}} other, looking over a map. On the bed and sticking three feet out of it was a beautiful gold sword with tassels on it and rhinestones in the handle.|$|E
50|$|During {{the working}} life (end of the 19th century) {{of the nearby}} {{limestone}} quarry, a small hut was built <b>against</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>walls</b> which was believed to house the blasting materials.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly {{the young}} {{officers}} took their posts <b>against</b> the <b>wall,</b> <b>one</b> {{on either side}} of the gate, and with their swords drawn awaited the coming of a messenger to the Red Captain.|$|R
5000|$|After Cyprus gained her independence, {{the area}} became a {{national}} monument where thousands visit. A sign proclaiming [...] "Του ανδρειωμένου ο θάνατος, θάνατος δεν λογιέται" [...] - [...] "The brave man's death is no death at all" [...] was put up <b>against</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>walls.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then he {{followed}} Martin-Roget {{into the room}} and closed the door behind him. The room was scantily furnished with a square deal table in the centre, two or three chairs, a broken-down bureau leaning <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> and an iron stove wherein a meagre fire sent a stream of malodorous smoke through sundry cracks in its chimney-pipe. From the ceiling there hung an oil-lamp the light of which was thrown down upon the table, by a large green shade made of cardboard.|$|E
60|$|The two {{men were}} {{standing}} in front of a small safe, which stood <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> of the Doctor's room. St. James held the old man by the wrist, and he had twisted his arm round in order to force him to produce the key. My little head master, white but resolute, was struggling furiously in the grip of the burly athlete. The bully glared over his shoulder at me with a mixture of fury and terror upon his brutal features. Then, realising that I was alone, he dropped his victim and made for me with a horrible curse.|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} later Philip went to London. The curate had {{recommended}} rooms in Barnes, and these Philip engaged by letter at fourteen shillings a week. He reached them in the evening; and the landlady, a funny little old woman with a shrivelled body and a deeply wrinkled face, had prepared high tea for him. Most of the sitting-room was {{taken up by the}} sideboard and a square table; <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> was a sofa covered with horsehair, and by the fireplace an arm-chair to match: there was a white antimacassar over the back of it, and on the seat, because the springs were broken, a hard cushion.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Dick had grappled with Pelter and {{was holding the}} rascally broker <b>against</b> the <b>wall.</b> <b>One</b> of the policemen already held Fogg, who was trembling {{from head to foot}} in sudden panic.|$|R
2500|$|An off-center {{stamping}} {{will apply}} a slow 0.56Hz modulation to the playback, affecting pitch {{due to the}} modulating speed that the groove runs under the stylus. The effect becomes gradually more acute during playback as the stylus moves closer {{to the center of}} the record. It also affects tonality because the stylus is pressed alternately <b>against</b> <b>one</b> groove <b>wall</b> and then the other, making the frequency response change in each channel. This problem is often called [...] "wow", though turntable and motor problems can also cause pitch-only [...] "wow".|$|R
50|$|On October 8, 2011, {{the museum}} was {{temporarily}} closed after demonstrators associated with the Occupy D.C. demonstration attempted to enter the museum. Some protesters were pepper sprayed by museum security after a guard was pinned <b>against</b> a <b>wall.</b> <b>One</b> woman was arrested.|$|R
60|$|There was one window, dim and unwashed, {{facing the}} street. It had a thick shade, now raised. Originally {{the room had}} been square, and rather crudely {{plastered}} and wallpapered, but a wooden partition had afterward been erected to cut the room into two, so that the portion she had entered was long and narrow. Its sole furniture consisted of the round table, quite bare, two or three wooden-bottomed chairs, and <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> a rack filled with books. During the interview she noted that these books were mostly directories of the inhabitants of various prominent cities in the United States, and such a collection astonished her and aroused her curiosity.|$|E
60|$|The {{city was}} unusually hot {{when he reached}} it, but he fancied that alone did {{not account for the}} crowded state of the saloons he passed. It also seemed to him that the groups of men who stood here and there on the {{sidewalks}} talking animatedly must have found some unusually interesting topic; but he had his own affairs to think of, and, as they appeared sufficient for him just then, he walked on quietly until he reached Jordan's office. It was not elaborately furnished. In fact, there was very little in it besides a table, a safe, a chair or two, and an American stump-puller standing <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall.</b> Jordan sat reading a newspaper, with a cigar, which had gone out, in his hand, but he looked up and threw the paper on the table when Jimmy came in.|$|E
60|$|They made an {{excellent}} meal, and then Vane {{drew up a}} wicker chair to the fire for Evelyn and sat down opposite her. The room was low and shadowy, and partly paneled. <b>Against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> stood a black oak sideboard, with a plate-rack above it, and a great chest of the same material with ponderous hand-forged hinge-straps stood opposite it. A clock with an engraved metal dial and a six-foot case, polished to a wonderful luster by the hands of several generations, ticked in one corner; and here and there the firelight flickered upon utensils of burnished copper. There was little in the place that looked less than a century old, for there are nooks in the North that have still escaped the ravages of the collector. Outside, the rain dripped from the massy flagstone eaves, and {{the song of the}} river stole in monotonous cadence into the room.|$|E
5000|$|Type Writer: Hitting {{the ball}} at the wall, then {{continually}} hitting the ball without it touching the floor until the hitter sees fit to let the ball rotate to the next player by hitting the ball <b>against</b> the <b>wall</b> <b>one</b> last time with force. Type Writer should not exceed 5 seconds.|$|R
60|$|While the Renshaws had {{contented}} {{themselves with}} stoves, Mr. Atherton {{had gone to}} the expense and trouble of having a great open fireplace, with a brick chimney outside the wall. Here, even on the hottest day, two or three logs burnt upon old-fashioned iron dogs. On the wall above was a sort of trophy of oriental weapons. Two very large and comfortable easy chairs stood {{by the side of the}} hearth, and in the centre of the room stood an old oak table, richly carved and black with age. A book-case of similar age and make, with its shelves well filled with standard works, stood <b>against</b> the <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> unoccupied by the divan.|$|R
60|$|The barn {{was both}} dark and dismal. In {{one of the}} dark corners an {{intermittent}} dripping betrayed {{the presence of a}} gap in its ancient roof. A rat scurried across the floor. The dripping stopped and began again. George struck a match and looked at his watch. He was early. Another ten minutes must elapse before he could hope for her arrival. He sat down on a broken wagon which lay on its side <b>against</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>walls.</b>|$|R
60|$|Dusk was not {{far away}} when the boys, {{stumbling}} down a low hillside, came into sight of an oblong clearing in the forest with a wooden house standing {{on one side of}} it. That was all Frank noticed, for he found it difficult to keep himself on his feet, and his sight seemed hazy. Indeed, he fell down once or twice in the steeper places, and had some trouble in getting up; and after that he had only a confused recollection of crossing an open space and entering a dwelling. A man shook hands with him, and a woman in a print dress made him sit down in a low chair before she set out a bountiful meal. Soon after he had eaten a considerable share of it Harry led him into a very little room where a bed like a shelf with a side to it was fixed <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall.</b> Five minutes later he was blissfully unconscious of his recent painful experience.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} scantily furnished, and, though {{very few of}} the {{bachelor}} farmers in that country live luxuriously, she fancied that Sproatly, who had evidently very rudimentary ideas on the subject of house-cleaning, had not brought back all the sundries he had thrown out into the snow. It contained a table, a carpenter's bench, and a couple of chairs. There were still smears of dust upon the uncovered floor. The birch-log walls had been rudely paneled half-way up, but the half-seasoned boards had cracked with the heat, and exuded streaks of resin to which the grime and dust had clung. A pail, which contained potato peelings, stood amid a litter of old long-boots and broken harness <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall.</b> The floor was black and thick with grease all round the rusty stove. A pile of unwashed dishes and cooking utensils stood upon the table, and the lamp above her head had blackened the boarded ceiling.|$|E
60|$|Men {{working on}} the prairie or in the bush of Canada are usually boarded by their {{employers}} at a weekly charge, {{and there were a}} good many of them engaged on the track. As a result of it, the iron shack was partly filled with provisions, and when Slaney and the trooper entered by the front they had seen a pile of cases and flour-bags apparently built up <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall.</b> It was, however, growing dark then, and neither of them had noticed that there was a narrow space behind the provisions which had been left to facilitate the entrance of the cook. Winthrop, it was clear, had slipped out through it in the darkness, and the shack had prevented either of the watchers from seeing him crawl away across the prairie. It occurred to Slaney that from the position of the tents it was scarcely likely he had got away quite unnoticed, but he had reasons for believing that {{it would be difficult to}} elicit any reliable information on that point from the man's comrades.|$|E
60|$|Small hands seized Philip, and he {{was dragged}} towards the hut. He went in and struck a match. There was no {{furniture}} in it; and beside a tin box, in which clothes were kept, {{there was nothing but}} the beds; there were three of them, <b>one</b> <b>against</b> each <b>wall.</b> Athelny followed Philip in and showed them proudly.|$|R
60|$|A second {{table was}} set <b>against</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>walls.</b> Our {{boiling water for}} the tea was kept there, in a silver kettle heated by a spirit-lamp. I next {{observed}} a delicate little china vase which held the tea, and a finely-designed glass claret jug, with a silver cover. Other men, possessing that beautiful object, {{would have thought it}} worthy of the purest Bordeaux wine which the arts of modern adulteration permit us to drink. This man had filled the claret jug with water.|$|R

It then contained a table, a carpenter's bench, and a couple of chairs, and there were still smears of dust upon the uncovered floor. The birch-log walls had been rudely panelled with match-boarding half-way up, which was a somewhat unusual luxury, but the half-seasoned boards had rent with the heat, and exuded streaks of resin to which the grime and dust had clung. A pail, which apparently contained potato peelings, stood amidst a litter of old long boots and broken harness <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall,</b> and the floor was black and thick with grease all round the rusty stove.

60|$|I crept {{round to}} the front of the altar. At the angle a candle-branch protruded, {{standing}} no higher than my head. It held some three or four tapers, and was so placed to enable the priest to read his missal at early Mass on dark winter mornings. I plucked one of the candles from its socket, and hastening down the church, I lighted it from one of the burning tapers of the bier. Screening it with my hand, I retraced my steps and regained the chancel. Then turning to the left, I made for a door that I knew should give access to the sacristy. It yielded to my touch, and I passed down a short stone-flagged passage, and entered the spacious chamber beyond. An oak settle was placed <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall,</b> and above it hung an enormous, rudely-carved crucifix. Facing it against the other wall loomed a huge piece of furniture, half-cupboard, half-buffet. On a bench in a corner stood a basin and ewer of metal, whilst a few vestments hanging beside these completed the furniture of this austere and white-washed chamber. Setting my candle on the buffet, I opened one of the drawers. It was full of garments of different kinds, among which I noticed several monks' habits. I rummaged to the bottom only to find some odd pairs of sandals.|$|E
60|$|These suits {{of armor}} were very costly, {{and the boys}} for whom they were made were, of course, filled with {{feelings}} of exultation and pride when they put them on; and, heavy and uncomfortable as such clothing must have been, {{they were willing to}} wear it, and to practice the required exercises in it. When actually made of steel, the armor was very expensive, and such could only be afforded for young princes and nobles of very high rank; for other young men, various substitutes were provided; but all were trained, either in the use of actual armor, or of substitutes, to perform a great number and variety of exercises. They were taught, when they were old enough, to spring upon a horse with as much armor upon them and in their hands as possible; to run races; to see how long they could continue to strike heavy blows in quick succession with a battle-axe or club, as if they were beating an enemy lying upon the ground, and trying to break his armor to pieces; to dance and throw summersets; to mount upon a horse behind another person by leaping from the ground, and assisting themselves only by one hand, and other similar things. One feat which they practiced was to climb up between two partition walls built pretty near together, by bracing their back <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>wall,</b> and working with their knees and hands against the other. Another feat was to climb up a ladder on the under side by means of the hands alone.|$|E
50|$|A lean-to {{addition}} is a shed with {{a sloping}} roof and three walls that abuts {{the wall of}} another structure. This form of lean-to is generally provisional; it is an appendix to an existing building constructed to fulfill a new need. Sometimes they cover external staircases, {{as is the case}} with the lean-to building built in the 15th century <b>against</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>walls</b> of the large chapter room of the cathedral of Meaux. Sometimes, they are built to protect entrances or to establish covered markets around certain large civic buildings.|$|R
60|$|In {{a little}} log house {{containing}} {{a single room}} sparely and rudely furnished, crouching on the floor <b>against</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>walls,</b> was a woman, clasping to her breast a child. Outside, a dense unbroken forest extended for many miles in every direction. This was at night {{and the room was}} black dark: no human eye could have discerned the woman and the child. Yet they were observed, narrowly, vigilantly, with never even a momentary slackening of attention; and that is the pivotal fact upon which this narrative turns.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} Roman period the Iron Age site was altered with the {{construction}} of ditches and sub-rectangular pits; finds included 1st and 2nd-century samian pottery and Roman coins dating from the period between Vespasian and Commodus. In the 3rd century a building, possibly an aisled barn, was constructed on the western half of the site; it was 34 m long, 12 m wide and had flint footings 0.9 m wide. More Roman coins were found here, dating from the period between Gordian I and Tacitus. Around 300 AD a substantial building was constructed on the eastern half of the site; it was 38.3 m long and 5.5 m wide and divided into four rooms, with a granary built <b>against</b> <b>one</b> external <b>wall</b> and a corridor or outbuildings <b>against</b> another. <b>One</b> of the rooms had plaster walls and a floor made of shale from Kimmeridge. The building was occupied for about sixty years.|$|R
