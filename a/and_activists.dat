5|$|During {{the years}} of legal proceedings, {{disability}} rights groups <b>and</b> <b>activists</b> closely monitored and involved themselves in the case. In March 2003, twelve disability rights groups, led by Not Dead Yet, along with four other amici, filed an amicus curiae brief in which they opposed the removal of Schiavo's feeding tube. They also used the Schiavo case to advocate for federal review in cases where third parties decide to withdraw life support from patients unable to give consent.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{government}} censorship was commonplace. Magazines {{were routinely}} confiscated under the anti-obscenity Comstock laws; permits for labor rallies were often denied; {{and virtually all}} anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, <b>and</b> <b>activists</b> that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to read the First Amendment during an Industrial Workers of the World rally.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} between 1918 and 1928, the WFL in Swansea {{produced}} two prominent activists in Emily Frost Phipps and her close friend Clara Neal, who were founder members of their branch.

5|$|After the war, {{the tribes}} were better {{represented}} in the republican government. In 1969, sheikhs were brought into the National Assembly and in 1971 into the Consultative Council. Under Iryani, the sheikhs, particularly the ones who fought for the republicans and were close to the mediation attempt. By {{the end of the}} war there was a breach between the older and more liberal politicians and republican sheiks, and certain army sheiks <b>and</b> <b>activists</b> from South Yemen. In the summer of 1972, a border war broke and ended with a declaration from both North Yemen and South Yemen that they would reunite, but they did not. There were complaints in North Yemen about foreign influence by Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|During the Obama presidency, some {{progressive}} lawyers <b>and</b> <b>activists</b> {{called for}} Ginsburg to retire so Obama {{would be able}} to appoint a like-minded successor, particularly while the Democratic Party held control of the U.S. Senate.

She affirmed her wish to remain a justice as long as she was mentally sharp enough to perform her duties. Moreover, Ginsburg opined that the political climate would prevent Obama from appointing a jurist like herself.|$|E

5|$|Fearing the Dutch {{would attempt}} to re-establish their {{authority}} over Indonesia, the new Republican Government and its leaders moved quickly to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in Java (where focused at all). It was rarely and loosely {{in contact with the}} outer islands, which had more Japanese troops (particularly in Japanese naval areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders <b>and</b> <b>activists.</b> In November 1945, a parliamentary form of government was established and Sjahrir was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Wałęsa {{held his}} {{position}} until 13 December 1981, when General Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law in Poland. Wałęsa {{and many other}} Solidarity leaders <b>and</b> <b>activists</b> were arrested; he was incarcerated for 11 months until 14 November 1982 at Chylice, Otwock, and Arłamów; eastern towns near the Soviet border. On 8 October 1982 Solidarity was outlawed. In 1983 Wałęsa applied {{to return to the}} Gdańsk Shipyard as an electrician. The same year, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He was unable to accept it himself, fearing Poland's government would not let him back into the country. His wife Danuta accepted the prize on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by the {{establishment}} of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of anti-fascism, and {{was close to the}} French Communist Party (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by Kurt Schwitters in Hanover, works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, ration stamp with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he briefly left France and joined the Republican forces. Alongside Soviet reporter Ilya Ehrenburg, Tzara visited Madrid, which was besieged by the Nationalists (see Siege of Madrid). Upon his return, he published the collection of poems Midis gagnés ("Conquered Southern Regions"). Some of them had previously been printed in the brochure Les poètes du monde défendent le peuple espagnol ("The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors <b>and</b> <b>activists,</b> Nancy Cunard and the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. Tzara had also signed Cunard's June 1937 call to intervention against Francisco Franco. Reportedly, he and Nancy Cunard were romantically involved.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 1986, 225 Polish {{political}} prisoners were released—the last of those connected with Solidarity, and arrested {{during the previous}} years. Following amnesty on September 30, Wałęsa created the first public, legal Solidarity entity since the declaration of martial law—the Temporary Council of NSZZ Solidarność (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność)—with Bogdan Borusewicz, Zbigniew Bujak, Władysław Frasyniuk, Tadeusz Janusz Jedynak, Bogdan Lis, Janusz Pałubicki and Józef Pinior. Soon afterwards, the new Council {{was admitted to the}} International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many local Solidarity chapters now broke their cover throughout Poland, and on October 25, 1987, the National Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarność (Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarność) was created. Nonetheless, Solidarity members <b>and</b> <b>activists</b> continued to be persecuted and discriminated, if less so than during the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, a rift between Wałęsa's faction and a more radical Fighting Solidarity grew as the former wanted to negotiate with the government, while the latter planned for an anti-communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|Political {{tensions}} {{came to a}} head as {{elections to}} the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954. The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition United Front coalition, which—led by A. K. Fazlul Huq and the Awami League—wanted greater provincial autonomy. Several United Front leaders <b>and</b> <b>activists</b> were arrested. A meeting of parliament's Muslim League members, chaired by prime minister Muhammad Ali Bogra, resolved to give official recognition to Bengali. This decision was followed by a major wave of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages. Proponents of Urdu such as Maulvi Abdul Haq condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali. He led a rally of 100,000 people to protest against the Muslim League's decision. Consequently, the implementation failed and the United Front won a vast majority of seats in the legislative assembly, while the representation of the Muslim League was reduced to a historic low.|$|E
5|$|Women's role in Pre-colonial social {{structures}} reveals that feminism was theorised differently in India {{than in the}} West. In India, women's issues first began to be addressed when the state commissioned {{a report on the}} status of women to a group of feminist researchers <b>and</b> <b>activists.</b> The report recognised the fact that in India, women were oppressed under a system of structural hierarchies and injustices. During this period, Indian feminists were influenced by the Western debates being conducted about violence against women. However, due to the difference in the historical and social culture of India, the debate in favour of Indian women had to be conducted creatively and certain Western ideas had to be rejected. Women's issues began to gain an international prominence when the decade of 1975–1985 was declared the United Nations Decade for Women.|$|E
