5|$|During November 1908, Maeda went to Paris, France, {{apparently}} {{to see his}} friend Akitaro Ono. From Paris, he went to Havana, arriving there on December 14, 1908, and his twice-a-day wrestling act quickly proved to be very popular. On July 23, 1909, Maeda left Havana for Mexico City. His debut in Mexico City {{took place at the}} Virginia Fabregas Theater on July 14, 1909. This show was a private demonstration for some military cadets. Shortly afterwards, Maeda began appearing at the Principal Theater. His standing offer was 100 pesos (US $50) to <b>anyone</b> he could not throw, and 500 pesos (US $250) to <b>anyone</b> who could throw him. The Mexican Herald did not record <b>anyone</b> taking his money.|$|E

5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if <b>anyone</b> figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever.

5|$|The Upanishad {{asserts that}} <b>anyone</b> can renounce – this choice is entirely {{up to the}} individual, {{regardless}} of which Ashrama (stage of life) he is in. The Jabala Upanishad seems to justify suicide as an individual choice in certain circumstances, a view opposed by earlier Vedic texts and Principal Upanishads. Those too sick may renounce the worldly life in their mind. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that one who truly renounces lives an ethical life, which includes not injuring <b>anyone</b> in thought, word or deed. Such a sannyasi (renunciate) abandons all rituals, is without attachments to anything or <b>anyone,</b> and is one who {{is devoted to the}} oneness of Atman and Brahman.|$|E
