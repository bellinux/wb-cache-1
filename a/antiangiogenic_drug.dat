50|$|The use of cell {{encapsulated}} microcapsules {{towards the}} treatment of several forms of cancer has shown great potential. One approach undertaken by researchers is through the implantation of microcapsules containing genetically modified cytokine secreting cells. An example of this was demonstrated by Cirone et al. when genetically modified IL-2 cytokine secreting non-autologous mouse myoblasts implanted into mice showed a delay in the tumor growth with an increased rate of survival of the animals. However, the efficiency of this treatment was brief due to an immune response towards the implanted microcapsules. Another approach to cancer suppression is {{through the use of}} angiogenesis inhibitors to prevent the release of growth factors which lead to the spread of tumors. The effect of implanting microcapsules loaded with xenogenic cells genetically modified to secrete endostatin, an <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drug</b> which causes apoptosis in tumor cells, has been extensively studied. However, this method of local delivery of microcapsules was not feasible in {{the treatment of}} patients with many tumors or in metastasis cases and has led to recent studies involving systemic implantation of the capsules.|$|E

40|$|Background. In metastatic {{colorectal}} cancer (mCRC), continuing <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> beyond progression might provide clinical benefit. We synthesized {{the available evidence}} in a meta-analysis. Patients and Methods. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies investigating the use of <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> beyond progression. Eligible studies were randomized phase II/III trials. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were the impact of continuing <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> (i) in subgroups, (ii) in different types of compounds targeting the VEGF-axis (monoclonal antibodies versus tyrosine kinase inhibitors), and (iii) on remission rates and prevention of progression. Results. Eight studies (3, 668 patients) were included. Continuing antiangiogenic treatment beyond progression significantly improved PFS (HR 0. 64; 95 %-CI, 0. 55 - 0. 75) and OS (HR 0. 83; 95 %-CI, 0. 76 - 0. 89). PFS was significantly improved in all subgroups with comparable HR. OS was improved in all subgroups stratified by age, gender, and ECOG status. The rate of patients achieving at least stable disease was improved with an OR of 2. 25 (95 %-CI, 1. 41 - 3. 58). Conclusions.

40|$|International audienceAntiangiogenic {{drugs were}} {{developed}} {{with the aim}} to inhibit the formation of intratumoral blood vessels and in consequence the growth of solid tumors. As these drugs are generally combined with classical cytotoxic drugs {{in the treatment of}} cancer patients, finding the optimal combinations remains a complex challenge due to possible interactions of the antiangiogenic compound with the hemodynamic property of the treated tumor. To analyze this problem, we developed a multi-scale model of vascular tumor growth combining a molecular model of VEGF signaling pathways and a tissue model of the tumor expansion including the dynamics of cellular and tissue processes of tumor growth and response to treatments. We addressed the potential impact of <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drug</b> by defining a new index of vasculature quality which depends on the balance between stable and unstable vessels within the tumor mass. Our goal was to investigate the interactions between a chemotherapy and a antiangiogenic treatment, and, by simulating the model, to identify the optimal delay of chemotherapy delivery after the administration of the antiangiogenic compound.

40|$|Background: neo - {{adjuvant}} {{therapy is}} usually indicated in locally advanced tumors, {{the aim is}} to decrease the tumoral burden and enhance overall survival. Renal cell carcinoma is a chemo and radio resistant neoplasm and this type of approach is not as effective as in other solid tumors. On the other hand immunotherapy is indicated in metastatic disease, demonstrating a better overall survival. Sorafenib is an <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drug</b> approved for locally advanced or metastatic RCC.

40|$|Angiogenesis is a {{hallmark}} of tumor development and metastasis {{and is now a}} validated target for cancer treatment. However, the survival benefits of <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> have thus far been rather modest, stimulating interest in developing more effective ways to combine <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> with established chemotherapies. This review discusses recent progress and emerging challenges in this field; interactions between <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> and conventional chemotherapeutic agents are examined, and strategies for the optimization of combination therapies are discussed. <b>Antiangiogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> such as the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab can induce a functional normalization of the tumor vasculature that is transient and can potentiate the activity of coadministered chemoradiotherapies. However, chronic angiogenesis inhibition typically reduces tumor uptake of coadministered chemotherapeutics, indicating a need to explore new approaches, including intermittent treatment schedules and provascular strategies to increase chemotherapeutic drug exposure. In cases where antiangiogenesis-induced tumor cell starvation augments the intrinsic cytotoxic effects of a conventional chemotherapeutic drug, combination therapy may increase antitumor activity despite a decrease in cytotoxic drug exposure. As new angiogenesis inhibitors enter the clinic, reliable surrogate markers are needed to monitor the progress of antiangiogenic therapies and to identify responsive patients. New targets for antiangiogenesis continue to be discovered, increasing the opportunities to interdict tumor angiogenesis and circumvent resistance mechanisms that may emerge with chronic use of these drugs.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments in medical oncology practice has been the approval of various antiangiogenic drugs for the treatment of a number of different malignancies. These drugs include bevacizumab (AvastinÂ®), the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. Thus far, bevacizumab appears to induce clinical benefit in patients who have advanced metastatic disease only or primarily when it is combined with conventional chemotherapy. The reasons for the chemo-enhancing effects of bevacizumab are unknown, and this is a subject that we have been actively studying along with additional ways that antiangiogenic drugs may be combined with chemotherapy. In this respect, we have focused much of our effort on metronomic low dose chemotherapy. We have been studying the hypothesis that some chemotherapy drugs at maximum tolerated doses or other cytotoxic- like drugs such as acute "vascular disrupting agents" (VDAs) can cause an acute mobilization of proangiogenic cells from the bone marrow which home to and colonize the treated tumors, thus accelerating their recovery. These cells include endothelial progenitor cells. This systemic process can be largely blocked by a targeted <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drug,</b> e. g. anti-VEGFR- 2 antibodies. In addition, metronomic chemotherapy, i. e., close regular administration of chemotherapy drugs at low non-toxic doses with no breaks, over prolonged periods of time not only prevents the acute CEP bone marrow response, but can even target the cells. This potential antiangiogenic effect of metronomic chemotherapy can also be boosted by combination with a targeted antiangiogenic agent. Treatment combinations of metronomic chemotherapy and an <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drug</b> have moved into phase II clinical trial testing with particularly encouraging results thus far reported in metastatic breast and recurrent ovarian cancer. Oral chemotherapy drugs such as cyclophosphamide (CTX), methotrexate are the main chemotherapeutics used for such trials. Oral 5 -FU prodrugs such as UFT would also appear to be highly suitable based on long term adjuvant therapy studies in patients. Recent preclinical results using metronomic cyclophosphamide and metronomic UFT in models of advanced metastatic breast cancer suggest that this type of combination might be particularly promising for metronomic chemotherapy in this indication, particularly when combined with a targeted <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drug...</b>|$|E

However, although an anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab) is the only option currently available, its efficacy is limited and it is not cost effective for use in all patients. Therefore, the development of a novel <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drug,</b> especially composed of small-molecule compounds, could be a powerful armament for ovarian cancer treatment. As NF-kB signaling has the potential to regulate VEGF expression, we determined to identify wheth-er VEGF expression is associated with NF-kB activation and to investigate the possibility of a novel IKKb inhibitor, IMD- 0354 (IMMD Inc.), as an <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>drug.</b> Tissue microarrays from 94 ovarian cancer tissues were constructed and immu-nohistochemical analyses performed. We revealed that IKK phosphorylation is an independent prognostic factor (PFS: 26. 1 vs. 49. 8 months, P 0. 011), and is positively correlated with high VEGF expression. In in vitro analyses, IMD- 0354 robustly inhibited adhesive and invasive activities of ovarian cancer cells without impairing cell viabilities. IMD- 0354 sig-nificantly suppressed VEGF production from cancer cells, which led to the inhibition of angiogenesis. In a xenograft model, the treatment of IMD- 0354 significantly inhibited peritoneal dissemination with a marked reduction of intratu-moral blood vessel formation followed by the inhibition of VEGF expression from cancer cells.

Methods: Between August 2008 and August 2011, 53 patients (29 male and 24 female) were treated with bevacizumab in the combination with chemotherapy at the Oncological Department, University Hospital in Krakow, Poland. Efficacy of bevacizumab was assessed {{on the basis of the}} computer tomography scans performed every 3 months within the period of 12 months. Concurrently, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was evaluated and correlated to the response of the treatment. Results: The percentage increase of MCV compared to baseline at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months was 3. 7 %, 9. 2 %, 8. 7 % and 11. 8 % respectively. The mean value of baseline MCV was 85. 3 fl. The mean value of MCV at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months was 90. 5 fl, 93 fl, 91. 8 fl and 93. 1 fl respectively. Macrocytosis did not occur in our study but an increase of MCV was observed within bevacizumab therapy. It was closely related to the response of the treatment. It seems that an increase of MCV can be a predictive agent of bevacizumab response. Conclusion: Bevacizumab does not induce macrocytosis. Increased MCV after treatment with bevacizumab is related to the treatment response. MCV can be a predictor of the response during bevacizumab treatment.
