5|$|Solo {{was born}} in Richland, Washington on July 30, 1981 to Judy Lynn (née Shaw) and Jeffrey Solo. Her father, an Italian-American Vietnam War veteran, who was in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life {{as a child and}} teenager, taught her how to play soccer at a young age. When Solo was seven, her father picked her and her brother Marcus up to go to a {{baseball}} game in the nearby city of Yakima, but ended up driving over three hours west to Seattle, where they stayed for several days at a hotel. Solo described how it seemed like a vacation at first, but soon realized it was not. Police later found them at a downtown bank and arrested Jeffrey for alleged kidnapping. Although her parents had divorced when she was six and she lived with her mother, Solo maintained a close relationship with her father after reconnecting with him during her college years at the University of Washington. He continued to be a major influence in her life until his death {{of a heart attack in}} June 2007.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Weinrich was ever represented by a commercial gallery and it is likely that she made her sales via exhibitions <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> studio. She did not usually provide date, name, place, or subject on her works and kept few records of what she produced. For these reasons, and because (a) they were not inventoried by art dealers in her lifetime and (b) she made a lot of art that was not sold, there is often doubt about the provenance of any given piece.|$|E
25|$|Part of Duffy's talent– besides her ear for {{ordinary}} eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety– is her ventriloquism. Like {{the best of}} her novelist peers... she slides in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> characters' lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, {{she is also a}} time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets– that is, she makes it look easy.|$|E

She is introduced in the first Max Payne game as the [...] "evil twin" [...] of her younger sister Lisa, the abused wife of the Mafia boss Angelo Punchinello. Mona is captured by Punchinello's assassins before she could kill him, but manages to escape. It is revealed that she was employed by Nicole Horne, the renegade member of the secret society calling themselves the Inner Circle who has left the organization and manages the Aesir Industries, a mysterious corporation that is behind the drug Valkyr. Horne ordered to murder Punchinello since he wanted to act independent <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> orders, a job Mona took because it was personal to her. By {{the end of the}} first game, Mona disappears in the Aesir headquarters elevator after being shot in the head by mercenaries for refusing an order to kill Max.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hidden Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs, but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine. The video consists of close-up shots panning around Björk's face, as fluids flow in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> facial orifices. M/M (Paris) explained the concept behind the video:We always wanted to get as close to her as we could, as we all felt {{she had never been}} portrayed as the [...] "real" [...] and beautiful woman she is. This is somehow taboo, to observe a pop star with no makeup from a distance of half an inch. Then the idea of the liquid works as a visualization of all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain. The loop idea was a main point for us as well, trying to extend the usual time frame of pop video super-fast editing, to make it hypnotising, mesmerising and irritating, like an eternally burning fireplace.|$|E

[...] Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun called [...] "Unusual You" [...] "a surprisingly subtle and effective moment" [...] and speculated {{that it was}} [...] "surely a future single." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today described [...] "Unusual You" [...] as [...] "saccharin", adding that [...] "she sounds much better in the dance tracks." [...] Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star called it the album's one [...] "moment of [...] ". Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized [...] "Unusual You" [...] as [...] "shamelessly Madonna-aping." [...] Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press commented that Spears's most personal and emotional moments of Circus are in the slower tracks, most notably in [...] "Unusual You". Moody continued, [...] "Though she didn't write the song, it's hard not to wince in empathy {{when you think about}} the string of users who have filtered in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life." [...] Pete Paphides of The Times said [...] "Unusual You" [...] would [...] "find a home with anyone whose love of melancholy Europop is fatal enough to take in Limahl's 'Never Ending Story.'" [...] In 2015, Gregory Hicks of MTV named [...] "Unusual You" [...] Spears's best song that was not released as a single. On December 18, 2008, [...] "Unusual You" [...] managed to peak at number eighty on the US Billboard Pop 100 due to strong digital sales.|$|E

500|$|The album {{begins with}} a gentle piano-and-glockenspiel {{instrumental}} before segueing into [...] "Lawn of Dawns", which introduces Nico's harmonium [...] "of undulating motion weaving against her voice". The song is engulfed in [...] "weird clattering and tintinnabulating", while a [...] "dark twangy guitar... stumbles to a subdued halt in [...] final seconds". It features what may be Nico's first lyrics, inspired by her peyote visions with Jim Morrison: [...] "He blesses you, he blesses me/The day the night caresses,/Caresses you, caresses me,/Can you follow me?/I cannot understand the way I feel/Until I rest on lawns of dawns—/Can you follow me?" [...] Nico explained the peyote-induced experience which inspired the lyrics: [...] "The light of the dawn was a very deep green and I believed I was upside down {{and the sky was}} the desert which had become a garden and then the ocean. I do not swim and I was frightened when it was water and more resolved when it was land. I felt embraced by the sky-garden." [...] The lyrics of the next song, [...] "No One Is There", have been described as [...] "in all probability influenced by Jim Morrison" [...] ("Some are calling/Some are sad/Some are calling mad") and are sung over Cale's classical quartet of violas darting in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> unusual vocal tempo. [...] "Ari's Song" [...] was dedicated to Nico's young son, Christian Aaron [...] "Ari" [...] Boulogne, her only child with French actor Alain Delon, and has been called [...] "the least-comforting lullaby ever recorded". It begins with the harmonium's clipped, whistling tones as she sings softly, [...] "Sail away/Sail away my little boy". [...] "Facing the Wind" [...] is supported by [...] "Cale-banged piano clusters, scraping of percussion or walls and off-beat tympani"; Nico's voice sounds filtered (possibly through a Leslie speaker), with the [...] "somnambulistic toiling" [...] of her pipe organ accompanied by viola and strident piano.|$|E
500|$|While in {{the comics}} Shaw's {{absorption}} power was depicted by having him {{grow up to}} ten times his original size, First Class instead does what company Digital Domain called a [...] "kinetic echo", where a digital Kevin Bacon would be rippled, deformed and at times multiplied in repeated [...] "iterations" [...] that appear in a short period, to [...] "see [...] displace and deform in a kinetic and organic way". According to Dykstra, {{the biggest problem with}} Frost's diamond body was depicting it [...] "without looking like she was made of Jell-o or the polygon model of a human being". The morphed Frost, which the visual effects tried to make look more like a faceted crystal than glass, was rotomated into Jones in the live-action plates, while still retaining the actress' eyes and lips. As the character kept on going in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> diamond form, a motion capture tracking suit could not be employed, so instead the effects team used both gray and chrome balls and a jumpsuit covered in mirrors—which also served as a lighting reference. For Angel's digital wings, the animators studied slow-motion footage of dragonflies to create the wing pattern in a realistic way, and the designers added iridescence to [...] "make the wings prettier". The visual of Banshee's screams was done through a digital ring-like structure based on renderings of sound waves such as Schlieren photography. The visual for Havok's blasts employed similar rings, concentrated in beams or rings of light which were then match moved into Till's mimed throwing. For Banshee's flight, the visual effects team used digital doubles only for distant shots, with closer ones employing Jones shot in a special flight rig. Azazel's teleporting was made to resemble the [...] "inky smoky effects" [...] used with Nightcrawler, who appeared in X2 and is Azazel's son in the comics. However, while Nightcrawler only left a smoke trail, the visual effects team had Azazel accompanied by digital fire and smoke [...] "because he was more closely aligned with the devil". The fire was also used [...] "as a mask to hide or reveal the body", according to effects supervisor Matt Johnson. Since the visible part of whirlwinds are the dust and dirt sucked up by them, the ones Riptide produces were made to resemble [...] "a tornado of gas, made out of nothingness" [...] by visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi. The final product was mostly a practical effect made with dry ice, which was augmented by computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team portrayed Mystique's abilities slightly differently due to this being a younger version, with [...] "the scales being slightly longer and the transformation being slightly showier than when she became the more mature Rebecca." [...] For Beast, computer graphics depicted his simian-like feet, the transformation sequence, and a few facial replacements for when Beast opened his mouth wider than the mask on Hoult's face allowed.|$|E

2500|$|Paradise Island - In Northern Ontario, Mike {{comes to}} the aid of a homeowner who had a serious injury in her cottage on an island, {{prompting}} the need of a bathroom renovation with shower bars to help her move in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shower. However, the original contractor, though meaning well, had also taken the opportunity to treat the job {{as if it were a}} vacation, taking a month to do a four-day job, while leaving serious water issues untouched. [...] Mike {{comes to the}} rescue by helping her relocate a hot water heater originally in the exterior of the cottage, while redoing the bathroom and the entrance ramp, as he discovers that the rails are installed on the wrong side (and the more dangerous side remains exposed) - all while noting that, because of their location on an island, any missing supplies will take 30 minutes to recover from their truck at shore, and a trip to the store could take up to three hours.|$|E
