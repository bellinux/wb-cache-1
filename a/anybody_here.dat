He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: [...] "If there is <b>anybody</b> <b>here,</b> will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!" [...] Days later, in a newsagent's in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books.

2500|$|On March 8, 2008, Obama won the Wyoming caucus by {{nineteen}} points. The Clinton camp {{continued to}} suggest that Obama {{would make a good}} vice presidential candidate for Clinton, and former President Bill Clinton made known his support of this as a [...] "dream ticket" [...] which would be an [...] "almost unstoppable force". On March 10, Obama flatly rejected such suggestions. Obama noted that he, not [...] Clinton, held the lead in pledged delegates and that he had won more of the popular vote than Clinton. [...] "I don't know how somebody who is in second place is offering the vice presidency to somebody who is in first place", he said. He told supporters in Columbus, Mississippi, that Clinton's VP suggestion was an example of what he called [...] "the old okey-doke", further stating that the Clinton camp was trying to [...] "bamboozle" [...] or [...] "hoodwink" [...] voters., Biloxi Sun Herald, March 10, 2008 Obama wondered aloud why the Clinton campaign believed him competent for the vice presidency, but said he was [...] "not ready" [...] to be president. Obama stated that the nomination process {{would have to be a}} choice between himself and Clinton, saying [...] "I don't want <b>anybody</b> <b>here</b> thinking that 'Somehow, maybe I can get both'," [...] by nominating Clinton as president and assuming he would be her running mate". Some suggested that it was a ploy by the Clinton campaign to denigrate Obama as less qualified for the presidency.|$|E

5000|$|Smith's {{figure was}} not the only satire target. Her cheery radio sign-on was parodied by comedian Henry Morgan when he {{launched}} his own show in 1942: [...] "Good evening, <b>anybody,</b> <b>here's</b> Morgan," [...] which became his sign-on. Morgan would recall in his memoir, Here's Morgan, that Smith's sign-on struck him as condescending: [...] "I, on the other hand, was grateful if anybody was listening." ...|$|R
