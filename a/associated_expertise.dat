Although useful, these indicators represent composite constructs that embody a number of different variables, only some of which may be strongly associated with the transition to expertise. In identifying an alternative measure of expertise, it is necessary to consider the cognitive processes associated with expert performance, in particular, the role of cue utilization. The present study, conducted in the context of software engineering, was designed to test the relationship between cue utilization and self, peer, and error management indicators of expertise. The results indicated that participants who exhibited relatively higher levels of cue utilization were significantly more likely to self-report engaging in behaviors associated with expert decision making, to be nominated as an expert by their peers, and to demonstrate superior error management when developing solutions to development problems. 16 page(s...|$|R

We conducted 2 {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} studies comparing changes in hemodynamic activity <b>associated</b> with car <b>expertise</b> in a conventional 1 -back task (Experiment 1) and when the task relevance of cars was explicitly manipulated (Experiment 2).

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{dissertation}} is discussions regarding change in museums. Here, I examine and problematize attitudinal shifts present in discussions regarding for instance, definitions of museums and their function in society; audiences, perceptions of museum collections and objects; accessibility and perceptions of knowledge production. The debate tends to become polarized and thus, inefficient. In this thesis, I argue for a balance and a perspective which involves opening up for and accepting variety {{as well as the}} specific in museums. This is discussed in relation to Vänersborg‟s Museum, a unique museum which recently underwent a re-profiling process and which is currently implementing the new approaches and ways of thinking as a result of this. I have reviewed the result of this project and examined it {{in the light of the}} current discussions regarding change and furthermore, attempted to demonstrate that characteristics of the traditional museum can be combined and coexist with characteristics of the reformed museum.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} development of market information technologies in the London Stock Exchange, c. 1945 - 1992. Based on archival research in London, Cambridge and Edinburgh, and 20 semistructured interviews with former technologists, brokers, and marketmakers, my dissertation identifies the social, technological and institutional factors that allowed dealings in bonds and equities to move off the trading floor of the Stock Exchange and onto competing electronic platforms. My dissertation utilises the history of market information technologies as an occasion for producing a multi-layered analysis of the material, social, and regulatory transformations of finance in the City of London between c. 1945 and the mid 1990 s. In particular, my dissertation deals {{with the rise of}} the so-called ‘information age’ in relation to British finance. The analysis is carried out in three parts, each tackling a specific ‘myth’ on the role of information and communication technologies in contemporary finance. The first part (chapters 3 - 4) deals with the dematerialisation of finance, demonstrating the often ignored character of technologies, materialities and their <b>associated</b> <b>expertise</b> in the constitution of the market. The second part (chapter 5) deconstructs the concept of disintermediation by analysing the social history of broking and jobbing in post-war City of London. Specifically, this part argues that changes in financial practices amongst the membership of the Stock Exchange were neither determined by the adoption of computers nor defined by a pre-existing culture of gentlemanly capitalism. Rather, they derived from the adaptation of market participants to a changing economic and social environment. The third part of this thesis (chapter 6) engages with deregulation. In particular, it provides an account of three broad patterns of financial regulation in Britain and the emergence of the current understanding of financial markets as manageable entities. The dissertation finalises by exploring the role of ‘informational metaphors’ in mediating the practices, materialities and regulations of the London Stock Exchange.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the high}} stakes world of International sport even the {{smallest}} change in performance {{can make the difference}} between success and failure, leading sports professionals to become increasingly interested in the potential benefits of neuroimaging. Here we describe evidence from EEG studies that either identify neural signals <b>associated</b> with <b>expertise</b> in sport, or employ neurofeedback to improve performance. Evidence for the validity of neurofeedback as a technique for enhancing sports performance remains limited. By contrast, progress in characterizing the neural correlates of sporting behavior is clear: frequency domain studies link expert performance to changes in alpha rhythms, whilst time-domain studies link expertise in response evaluation and motor output with modulations of P 300 effects and readiness potentials. Despite early promise, however, findings have had relatively little impact for sports professionals, at least in part because there has been a mismatch between lab tasks and real sporting activity. After selectively reviewing existing findings and outlining limitations, we highlight developments in mobile EEG technology that offer new opportunities for sports neuroscience...|$|R

Much less is known, however, about the broader cognitive advantages or costs associated with skills and their concomitant neuroanatomy. In this study we investigated a group of highly skilled navigators, licensed London taxi drivers. We replicated findings from previous studies by showing taxi drivers had greater grey matter volume in posterior hippocampus and less grey matter volume in anterior hippocampus compared to matched control subjects. We then employed an extensive battery of tests to investigate the neuropsychological consequences of being a skilled taxi driver. Their learning of and recognition memory for individual items was comparable with control subjects, as were working memory, retrograde memory, perceptual and executive functions. By contrast, taxi drivers were significantly more knowledgeable about London landmarks and their spatial relationships. However, they were significantly worse at forming and retaining new associations involving visual information. We consider possible reasons for this decreased performance including the reduced grey matter volume in the anterior hippocampus of taxi drivers, similarities with models of aging, and saturation of long-term potentiation which may reduce information-storage capacity...|$|R
