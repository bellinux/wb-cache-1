For the industry some central requirements are essential. - The accounting standard should be supported by a thorough understanding of the business model of the insurance industry, i. e. the new regulations must adequately reflect the principle of a balance of risks within a portfolio and over time. The “risk ” factor, the whole crux of our business, must be considered in the balance sheet via adequate valuation methods. - A new standard must not cause an increase in the volatility of the results shown for each accounting period. Rather the problem of a mismatch between the accounting value of insurance liabilities and the value of investments matching these liabilities has to be faced. The standard should eliminate any <b>accounting</b> <b>mismatch.</b> - Finally, a universal standard should balance the needs of the users of financial statements to receive relevant and reliable information with the industry’s capability to prepare financial statements at a reasonable cost. The latter may be of particular interest for {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises...|$|E

40|$|Using an {{international}} sample of 222 banks from 41 countries, {{this study examines}} whether the fair value option (FVO) affects earnings volatility. Prior empirical studies associate higher levels of earnings volatility with fair value accounting (Barth et al. 1995; Hodder et al. 2006). In contrast, I find evidence that banks applying the FVO to reduce <b>accounting</b> <b>mismatches</b> exhibit lower earnings volatility than other banks. I assign this alternative outcome to the optional characteristic of the FVO. Banks can use the flexibility in accounting to reduce artificial earnings volatility. The cross-sectional results are robust against outliers and several model alterations, including controls for endogeneity bias. Furthermore, I predict and find that banks from countries with high regulatory quality {{are more likely to}} apply the FVO to reduce <b>accounting</b> <b>mismatches.</b> Overall, the findings confirm the IASB’s initial intention on introducing the FVO. Hence, the study contributes to the current debate on the use of fair values in financial reporting...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the recent exodus of foreign {{insurers}} from Taiwan and the local insurers’ outcries against the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 4 Insurance Contracts, we examine the value relevance of financial statements for life insurance firms, with particular interests to the embedded value (EV) disclosure. We find that the EV of equity has an incremental information role for book value of equity, which indicates that the <b>accounting</b> <b>mismatching</b> problem in the insurance industry creates a demand for fair value accounting. The fair value of liabilities under IFRS 4 Phase 2 has been disputed globally by accountants, actuaries, academia and regulators. The EV model is a concept approaching the fair value model.

40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} is presented that generates approximate symbolic expressions for small-signal characteristics of large analog integrated circuits. The method {{is based upon}} the approximation of an expression while it is being computed. The CPU time and memory requirements are reduced drastically with regard to previous approaches, as only those terms are calculated which will remain in the final expression. As a consequence, the maximum circuit size amenable to symbolic analysis has largely increased. The simplification procedure explicitly takes into account variation ranges of the symbolic parameters to avoid inaccuracies of conventional approaches which use a single value. The new approach is also able to take into <b>account</b> <b>mismatches</b> between the symbolic parameters.

40|$|In an {{electrical}} power system there must always be a balance between generation and load of electricity. Any mismatch between generation and load will, in a synchronous system, instantaneously lead to a deviation of the grid frequency from its nominal value in the whole system. It is observed that grid frequency deviations occur at hourly and half-hourly transitions, especially during morning and evening hours when {{the rate of change}} of load is high. The origin of these frequency deviations lies in the economic dispatch of generation which is ever more cost optimized. As generation companies have the obligation to provide a certain amount of energy per trading period (defined as Program Time Unit), they have little (or no) incentive to follow the power demand profile and therefore rather optimize their generation based on this energy constraint, which results in stepwise power generation profiles. The restructuring of the electricity business is considered a plausible cause for this, as it provides an incentive to further optimize the economic dispatch without taking into <b>account</b> <b>mismatch</b> between generation and load within the program time unit...|$|R
