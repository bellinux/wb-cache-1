Historians Arnold W.

5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain.

He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded.
