Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned {{to the spot where}} he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who <b>are</b> <b>examining</b> the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in a spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo.|$|E

25|$|The {{second level}} digital divide, also {{referred}} to as the production gap, describes the gap that separates the consumers of content on the internet from the producers of content. As the technological digital divide is decreasing between those with access to the internet and those without, the meaning of the term digital divide is evolving. Previously, digital divide research has focused on accessibility to the Internet and Internet consumption.

25|$|The {{purpose of}} SafetyLit {{is to provide}} {{information}} to allow users to identify and find articles (both good and poor) that have been published about injury prevention and safety promotion topics... An important part of professionalism is to identify flawed publications and counter the flaws by commenting upon them {{in a letter to}} the editor of the journal where the article was published. Further, the best knowledge today may become outdated tomorrow. Although published corrections and errata are included , the older articles with inaccuracies are not removed from the site.

500|$|American Life became Madonna's final studio {{album with}} Maverick Records, and {{marked the end}} of an eleven-year {{recording}} history with the label. In an interview with VH1, Madonna discussed her motivations behind the record discussing her 20 years in the industry and stating that [...] "material things" [...] were unimportant, stating [...] "I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", in response to the non-materialistic themes of the record. The album has been deemed by some as a concept album featuring political themes based around the United States. [...] " [...] <b>are</b> <b>examining</b> things I valued and things I found myself worrying about, caring too much about, and realizing that those things aren't important and wanting to get out from underneath that cloud, the world of illusion", Madonna stated. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , the main concept of American Life was about [...] "nothing". This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love.

This system, it is argued, makes medical practitioners much more concerned to focus on activities that deliver real health benefits at a lower cost to the system by removing the perversities inherent in the fee-for-service system.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{definitive}} theory {{as to what}} is causing the formation or colour of the storm that is known as the Great Red Spot. Laboratory studies <b>are</b> <b>examining</b> the effects that cosmic rays or UV Light from the Sun are having on the chemical composition of the clouds of Jupiter. In particular whether the Sun's radiation is reacting with ammonium hydrosulfide in the planet's outer atmosphere to create the deep red colour. Research has shown that the storm produces extreme amounts of heat because it is simultaneously generating gravity and acoustic waves. When these turbulent energy waves collide [...] above the red spot, they are creating extremely high temperatures in the planet's upper atmosphere. The effect is described as being like [...] "crashing [...] ocean waves on a beach". The reason the storm has continued to exist for centuries is because of the physical nature of Jupiter. As there is no planetary surface to provide friction (only a liquid core of hydrogen), circulating gas eddies persist {{for a very long time}} in the atmosphere because there is nothing to oppose their angular momentum.|$|E
