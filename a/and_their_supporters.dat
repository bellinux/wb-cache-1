5|$|On 8–9 May 1942, another pro-Chetnik coup {{occurred}} in the recently created Zenica Partisan Detachment, and about 30 communists <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> were killed. About 100 remaining Partisan fighters from the Ozren and Zenica detachments were incorporated into the 3rd East Bosnian Shock Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{domestic}} workers <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters,</b> including {{activists and}} employers, have periodically staged rallies protesting {{what they perceive}} as discriminatory treatment {{on the part of the}} Hong Kong government. Grievances include discrimination, the minimum wage and the two-week stay limit at the end of a domestic worker's employment contract. According to the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor (HKHRM), foreign domestic helpers face discrimination from the Hong Kong government and their employers.|$|E

5|$|Saladin {{released}} Guy of Lusignan {{who joined}} his wife. Guy, Sybilla, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> left Tripoli and laid siege to Acre in August 1189. The siege {{was the first}} sign of a new Christian offensive. Richard I of England could not reoccupy Jerusalem during the Third Crusade, but he ensured the survival of the Kingdom of Jerusalem before leaving the Holy Land on 9 October 1192. Taking advantage of the crusade, Bohemond's father made a ten-year truce with Saladin on 30 October 1192. The truce covered both Antioch and Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the fictional}} Pacific City, the player {{controls}} a biologically enhanced Agent, tasked with defeating three crime lords and their organized crime syndicates. The Agent's abilities improve by defeating both crime lords <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters,</b> {{as well as}} by completing optional activities, such as street races and scavenger hunts. The gameplay is nonlinear: instead of following a rigid mission sequence, players are free to select the approach to completing their missions and activities. The game features a two-player cooperative play mode via Xbox Live.|$|E
5|$|The Twittys <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> criticized a {{perceived}} {{lack of progress}} by Aruban police. The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain silent about the case and using their access to the media to push {{their own version of}} events. The Twittys denied this.|$|E

Matilda, Stephen <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> feature in Ellis Peters's historical detective series about Brother Cadfael, set between 1137 and 1145. Peters paints the Empress as proud and aloof, in contrast to Stephen, a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler. Matilda's martial reputation may also have contributed to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's decision to entitle his 1855 battle poem Maud.|$|E
5|$|With two {{competing}} archbishops, both claiming the see and the Electorate, the contenders <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> gathered the troops. In numbers, Ernst had the advantage. The Pope hired 5,000 mercenaries from the Farnese family {{to support the}} new Elector. Ernst's brother, the Duke of Bavaria, provided an army and Ernst arranged for his brother Ferdinand's army to take possession of the so-called Oberstift, the southern territory of the Electorate; his troops plundered many of its villages and towns.|$|E
5|$|Davison {{grew up in}} {{a middle-class}} family, and studied at Royal Holloway College, London, and St Hugh's College, Oxford, before taking jobs as a teacher and governess. She joined the WSPU in November 1906 and became an officer of the {{organisation}} and a chief steward during marches. She soon became known in the organisation for her daring militant action; her tactics included breaking windows, throwing stones, setting fire to postboxes and, on three occasions, hiding overnight in the Palace of Westminster—including {{on the night of the}} 1911 census. Her funeral on 14 June 1913 was organised by the union. A procession of 5,000 suffragettes <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> accompanied her coffin and 50,000 people lined the route through London; her coffin was then taken by train to the family plot in Morpeth, Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was done}} to either secure or {{indicate}} how his succession was to take place; the Julians <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> had fallen to the wrath of Sejanus, and his own sons and immediate family were dead. Two of the candidates were either Caligula, the sole surviving son of Germanicus, or his own grandson, Tiberius Gemellus. However, only a half-hearted attempt {{at the end of}} Tiberius' life was made to make Caligula a quaestor, and thus give him some credibility as a possible successor, while Gemellus himself was still only a teenager and thus completely unsuitable for some years to come.|$|E
5|$|London was {{the premier}} centre for boxing because the aristocratic {{supporters}} of the sport dispersed to their country estates {{during the summer months}} but tended to congregate in the city for the winter period. Birmingham was often portrayed as second only to London for the sport and in 1789 there were a series of challenges issued by fighters from the Birmingham area to opponents based around London. The challenges were intended to demonstrate the level of organisation and confidence among the Birmingham boxers <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters.</b> Three of these challenges were accepted, including that from Perrins to Tom Johnson. Perrins had already issued a general challenge, offering to fight any man in England for a prize of 500 guineas, having beaten all challengers in the counties around Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Mason, {{along with}} a group of other Advanced Liberals {{supporting}} John Morley, the gladstonian, was one of the founding members of the Reform Club in Manchester, a political club founded in 1867 for Liberals <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters.</b> Despite retiring from local politics because of conflict with the Liberals, by 1878 he was back in favour and Liberal councillors were encouraging Mason to stand for parliamentary election. Although he was a popular candidate, he was initially reluctant to put himself forward. However, he stood for Parliament in the 1880 General Elections. His campaign in March and April 1880 involved vitriolic attacks on the local Conservative Party and on 3April 1880 he was elected MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, beating his opponent, John Ross Coulthart, by 2,966 votes to 2,586.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 1944, Marinić filed {{charges against}} Pulherija and Gaudencija before the Land Commission for the Determination of Crimes by the Occupiers <b>and</b> <b>Their</b> <b>Supporters.</b> Pulherija fled to Austria {{before the end}} of the war, the only one of the nuns to do so. Gaudencija {{remained}} at the Children's Home, eventually moving to Ljubljana. No extradition of Pulherija was ever attempted, and neither nun was ever declared a war criminal. According to Fumić, the inhumane actions of Pulherija and other nuns and their role in the deaths of many children has never been condemned by the Catholic Church. Pulherija died in Austria in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Peasants <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> {{advocated}} {{the notion that}} each family was supposed to receive at least four hectares of land; in their system, which made note of differences in local traditional, peasants living in wetlands were to be assigned 16 pogoane (approx. eight hectares), those living in plains 14 (approx. seven hectares), inhabitants of hilly areas 11 (between five and six hectares), while people inhabiting the Southern Carpathian areas were supposed to receive eight pogoane (approx. four hectares). This program was instantly rejected by many landowners, and the negotiations were ended through a decision taken by Heliade Rădulescu, when it was again decided that the ultimate resolution was a prerogative of the future Assembly. The failure to address this most significant of the problems faced by Wallachians contributed to weakening support for the revolutionary cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Shamrock Rovers supporters originate from the Southside of Dublin, but the club attracts fans {{from across the}} city and country. Since its foundation, the club has maintained a proud Irish identity, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> reflect this in the flags and banners they display. Their support base contains a number of clubs dedicated to supporting the team at away games. It also contains an ultras group, {{which was the first}} formed in Ireland, the SRFC Ultras, who produce choreographed displays of support at games. They have connections with other European groups including supporters of Roma, Hammarby and Panathinaikos.|$|E

25|$|Major League Baseball and {{its owners}} praised the decision, as did many of <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> in the media.

5|$|Emperor Taizu {{developed}} an effective centralized bureaucracy staffed with civilian scholar-officials and regional military governors <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> {{were replaced by}} centrally appointed officials. This system of civilian rule led to a greater concentration {{of power in the}} central government headed by the emperor than had been possible during the previous dynasties. In the early 11th century, there were some 30,000 men who took the prefectural exams per year (see imperial examination), which steadily increased to roughly 80,000 {{by the end of the}} century, and to 400,000 exam takers during the 13th century. Although new municipal governments were often established, the same number of prefectures and provinces were in existence as before the Song came to power. Thus although more people were taking exams, roughly the same number were being accepted into the government as in previous periods, making the civil service exams very competitive amongst aspiring students and scholars.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the {{transition}} to the postwar economy was hard for the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the Jim Crow South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted students of all races. Unlike {{in the rest of the}} state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.|$|E
5|$|It {{resulted}} in an overwhelming victory for the right, with the CEDA and the Radicals together winning 219 seats. Although the political situation was complicated, parties of the right won around 3,365,700 votes, parties of the centre 2,051,500 votes, and parties of the left 3,118,000 according to one estimate. Turnout was around 8,535,200 votes, 67.5% of the electorate. The right had spent far more on their election campaign than the Socialists, who campaigned alone. Women, in their first election, mainly voted for the centre-right. The Communist Party, with perhaps 3,000 members, were at this point not significant. Nationalist Basques won twelve of seventeen Basque seats, a considerable victory. Keeping their promise, the CNT proclaimed a revolution. There were many reasons the Socialists and Republicans lost out; the female vote alone cannot explain the shift. Among them was the disunity of the political left compared to the right, {{in a system that}} favoured broad coalitions. The Radicals <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>supporters</b> had also shifted to the right. Abstentionalism hindered Socialist and Republican candidates. Overall, the political system in Spain had changed dramatically since the last election.|$|E
