5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with his name on it. Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create <b>a</b> <b>paradox</b> that will destroy the building and the Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump off the roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the rise of polio in industrialised {{countries}} in the 20th century has never been fully explained. The disease {{is caused by a}} virus that is passed from person to person by the faecal-oral route, and naturally infects only humans. It is <b>a</b> <b>paradox</b> that it became a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing affluence. Although the virus was discovered {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, its ubiquity was unrecognised until the 1950s. It is now known that fewer than two per cent of individuals who are infected develop the disease, and most infections are mild. During epidemics the virus was effectively everywhere, which explains why public health officials were unable to isolate a source.|$|E
5|$|In the TARDIS, the Doctor {{agrees to}} take Rose {{to the day}} her father died {{so that she can}} be there when it happens. Upon their arrival in London on Saturday 7 November 1987, they witness the {{accident}}, but Rose is unable to move when the Doctor tells her to go comfort her dying father. Rose asks the Doctor if she can try again, and the Doctor allows it but warns Rose to not run until their former selves have left to prevent <b>a</b> <b>paradox.</b> As the accident is about to happen, Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life. The younger versions of the Doctor and Rose vanish. Rose and the Doctor fight about her actions, with the Doctor rebuking her for potentially damaging the timeline. The Doctor takes Rose's TARDIS key back and storms off without her. Rose decides to go with Pete to the wedding, while the Doctor walks back to the TARDIS only to find that it is now an empty shell. Strange flying beasts called Reapers appear and begin consuming people.|$|E

5|$|Moving on to 300 AF Cocoon, {{the pair}} find Snow {{fighting}} a giant paradox-fueled monster that is dissolving the crystal pillar. After resolving the paradox, which delays {{the fall of}} Cocoon until 500 AF, Snow disappears again as an anomaly from another time. The pair {{then go to the}} city of Academia on Gran Pulse in 400 AF where they are attacked by the city's AI, which claims they were killed in 200 AF. Traveling to 200 AF, they discover <b>a</b> <b>paradox</b> whereby a man-made fal'Cie meant to re-levitate Cocoon was able to turn on its creators using the AI that designed it and take over the government. Resolving the paradox, Noel and Serah travel to an alternative 400 AF Academia. In this world, the pair find Hope and Alyssa again, who had put themselves in stasis. They explain their new plan to mechanically float a new Cocoon to hold humanity, which Serah and Noel help with before heading to 500 AF Academia. They are betrayed by Alyssa (revealed to be a living paradox doomed to disappear in the corrected timeline) and trapped by Caius in dream-worlds. Before being trapped, Serah meets the spirit of Yeul, who explains that she is the seeress of Paddra, continually reincarnated throughout history, while Caius is her immortal guardian, gifted with Etro's own heart.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused <b>a</b> <b>paradox</b> that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
5|$|The film {{presents}} {{examples of}} crowd psychology and collective behavior {{which can lead}} to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have {{in the context of a}} pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents <b>a</b> <b>paradox,</b> as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E

Joel Cohen (1986) has shown that continuously distributed lifetimes can never have <b>a</b> Simpson’s <b>paradox.</b> We investigate the same question for discrete random variables to see if <b>a</b> Simpson’s <b>paradox</b> is possible. With discrete random variables, we first look at those that have equally spaced values and show that Simpson’s paradox does not occur. Next, when observing the discrete lifetimes that are unequally space with identical supports, we similarly discover that <b>a</b> Simpson’s <b>paradox</b> still cannot occur. When the two random variables do not have identical supports, which allows for the flexibility to compare {{a broad range of}} different random variables, we discover that <b>a</b> Simpson’s <b>paradox</b> can occur...|$|R

5|$|The game {{opens in}} 3 AF, as the Pulse town Serah lives in is {{attacked}} by monsters. A stranger named Noel appears {{to help fight}} the monsters and {{claims to be a}} time traveler from 700 AF. He arrived in her time via Valhalla, where he claims to have met Lightning as she guarded the throne of the weakened Etro. As part of Lightning's transfer to Valhalla, she was erased from the fall of Cocoon onwards (making everyone except Serah forget her being with them on Gran Pulse), and paradoxes have erupted throughout time, warping the timeline. Serah joins Noel in a journey to resolve these paradoxes by removing items and monsters, which are out of their original time and correct the timeline; she in hopes of finding her sister and he in hopes of changing the bleak future he comes from. While journeying to 5 AF to resolve <b>a</b> <b>paradox</b> on Cocoon, they meet and help Alyssa, an Academy member and survivor of the Purge, a massacre by the Sanctum at the beginning of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{paper is to}} offer an {{understanding}} of home hospice from a perspective of political geography. Informed by critical political theories of care, and recent work on the geographies {{of public and private}} spheres, I explore one set of consequences of the spatial shift towards home death in metropolitan Seattle, Washington. Terminal hospice care done in the home creates an especially paradoxical home space. By blurring public - private boundaries, hospice care produces a political geography of home interpretable through four spatial paradoxes: <b>a</b> normative <b>paradox</b> of home being a good and bad place to die, <b>a</b> territorial <b>paradox</b> of control itself changing the home, <b>a</b> constitutive <b>paradox</b> between heart and welfare politics, and <b>a</b> relational <b>paradox</b> between autonomy and dependency. The implications for political and health geography, as well as political theory and hospice work itself are discussed as a consequence of recognizing these spatial paradoxes. ...|$|R

25|$|A {{great many}} individuals, {{ever since the}} rise of the {{mathematical}} method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer, and his system <b>a</b> <b>paradox.</b> I use the word in the old sense: <b>a</b> <b>paradox</b> is something which is apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. Many of the things brought forward would now be called crotchets, which is the nearest word we have to old paradox. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the paradox of Copernicus and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the deprivation of meaning took place, in England at least.|$|E
