5|$|The Macedonian {{king was}} an autocratic figure {{at the head}} of both {{government}} and society, with arguably unlimited authority to handle affairs of state and public policy, but he was also the leader of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>personal</b> regime with close relationships or connections to his hetairoi, the core of the Macedonian aristocracy. These aristocrats were second only to the king in terms of power and privilege, filling the ranks of his administration and serving as commanding officers in the military. It was in the more bureaucratic regimes of the Hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded Alexander the Great's empire where greater social mobility for members of society seeking to join the aristocracy could be found, especially in Ptolemaic Egypt. Although governed by a king and martial aristocracy, Macedonia seems to have lacked the widespread use of slaves seen in contemporaneous Greek states.|$|E

25|$|Tolkien wrote {{many pieces}} in Sindarin. He {{made an effort}} to give to his Elvish {{languages}} the feel and taste of natural languages. He wanted to infuse in them a kind of life, while fitting them to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>personal</b> aesthetic taste. He wanted to build languages primarily to satisfy his personal urge and not because he had some universal design in mind.|$|E
25|$|M. Pinchon, who {{by certain}} aspects of his method seems to proceed from Monet and Guillaumin, has {{nonetheless}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>personal</b> conception of formal pictorial design that his approach rigorously defines. Imaginative and sensitive, he admits only the visual realities that stimulate sensation. He does not attach significant importance to forms determined by contour lines; these are, in his eyes, the motif upon which the harmonies of color and light are arranged.|$|E

25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>personal</b> and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close {{and listen to what}} she has to say like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is struck by the fact that even as we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{involved the}} Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany. Should kibbutz members turn over income {{that was the}} product of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>personal</b> loss? If Holocaust survivors were allowed to keep their reparation money, what would that mean for the principle of equality? Eventually, many kibbutzim made this one concession to inequality by letting Holocaust survivors keep all or a percentage of their reparations. Reparations that were turned over to the collective were used for building expansion and even recreational activities.|$|E

Coordinating with Brian Bissel, one of Hoffman's friends from his old startup, they plan to use a local public-access television station to hijack Synapse and broadcast their charges against NURV to the world. However, Calighan {{turns out to be a}} double agent, foils Hoffman's plan, and turns him over to Winston.|$|E

25|$|While Copland studied {{conducting}} in Paris in 1921, {{he remained}} essentially a self-taught conductor with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>personal</b> style. Encouraged by Igor Stravinsky to master conducting and perhaps emboldened by Carlos Chavez's efforts in Mexico, {{he began to}} direct his own works on his international travels in the 1940s. By the 1950s, he was also conducting the works of other composers, and after a televised appearance where he directed the New York Philharmonic, Copland became in high demand. He placed a strong emphasis in his programs on 20th-century music and lesser-known composers, and until the 1970s rarely planned concerts to feature his music exclusively. Performers and audiences generally greeted his conducting appearances as positive opportunities to hear his music as the composer intended. His {{efforts on behalf of}} other composers could be penetrating but also uneven.|$|E
25|$|Stagecoach {{was born}} out of {{deregulation}} of the British express coach market in the early 1980s, though its roots {{can be traced back to}} 1976 when Ann Gloag and her husband Robin set up a small motor caravan and minibus hire business called Gloagtrotter. Ann's accountant brother Brian Souter joined the firm and expanded the business into bus hire. Robin Gloag subsequently sold his shareholding in the business and ceased any involvement in 1982 with the collapse of his marriage to Ann. The Transport Act 1980, which freed express services of 35 miles and over from regulation by the Traffic Commissioner, brought new opportunities for the Perth based company and services were launched from Dundee to London using second-hand Neoplan coaches. For a while, they offered <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>personal</b> service with Brian Souter doing the driving and Ann Gloag making up sandwiches and snacks for the passengers.|$|E
25|$|While in France, Frantz Fanon {{wrote his}} first book, Black Skin, White Masks, an {{analysis}} of the impact of colonial subjugation on the African psyche. This book was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>personal</b> account of Fanon’s experience being black: as a man, an intellectual, and a party to a French education. Although Fanon wrote the book while still in France, most of his other work was written while in North Africa (in particular Algeria). It was during this time that he produced his greatest works, A Dying Colonialism and The Wretched of the Earth. In it, Fanon lucidly analyzes the role of class, race, national culture and violence in the struggle for decolonization. In this work, Fanon expounded his views on the liberating role of violence for the colonized, as well as the general necessity of violence in the anti-colonial struggle. Both books established Fanon in the eyes of much of the Third World as one of the leading anti-colonial thinkers of the 20th century. In 1959 he compiled his essays on Algeria in a book called L'An Cinq: De la Révolution Algérienne.|$|E

25|$|Berlioz was {{convinced}} by Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein– {{with whom he}} had corresponded for some time– that he should begin to compose a new opera. This work would eventually become Les Troyens (The Trojans), a monumental grand opera with a libretto (which he wrote himself) based on Books Two and Four of Virgil's Aeneid. The idea of creating an opera based on the Aeneid had already been in his mind several years, by the time Sayn-Wittgenstein had approached him, and despite a long disillusionment, his creative flame seems to have remained lit. Les Troyens proved to be <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>personal</b> work for Berlioz, as it paid homage to his first literary love, whom he still cherished– even after his discoveries of Shakespeare and Goethe. The opera was planned around five acts, similar in size to the grand opera of Meyerbeer. It was composed with the Paris Opéra in mind, a most prestigious venue. Berlioz's chances of securing a production in which his work would receive attention equal to its merits were negligible from the start– a fact he must have been aware of. Despite these grim prospects, Berlioz saw the work through to its completion in 1858.|$|E

500|$|That November, Joe Russo {{stated that}} {{the theme of the}} film was betrayal, calling it [...] "extremely emotional.

The third act is built around <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>personal</b> moment between [...]" [...] The Russos {{spent a great deal of}} time with Markus, McFeely, and Moore to ensure each character's emotional arc tracked through the entire film correctly, though realized that at some point [...] "you have to sacrifice logic for expediency". Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months." [...] They also {{stated that the}} film would be doing [...] "a few reshoots" [...] in mid-to-late January.|$|E
