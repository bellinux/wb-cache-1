500|$|It {{is a great}} {{outlet for}} me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which is one of my most {{personal}} songs and remains one of my favorites. I think [...] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go {{hand in hand with the}} song's composition.|$|E
500|$|While commenting {{in regards}} to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, Rove, Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her [...] "disco stick" [...] metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics {{constituted}} off. [...] "If anything, I happen to think people are frivolously hard on me", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate [...] "lot of youth-oriented pop music" [...] as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. [...] "It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way I move <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> articulate the lyrics. But if I wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' that would be very boring," [...] she concluded.|$|E

On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E

But when that incident happened, it fired up so strong, it had to be over. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was then, the state we'd got into then, {{there was no way she}} was getting that stupid jacket."

2500|$|Haggard {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} TIME on May 6, 1974. He also wrote and performed the theme song to the television series Movin' On, which in 1975 gave him another number-one country hit. During the early to mid-1970s, Haggard's country chart domination continued with songs such as [...] "Someday We'll Look Back," [...] "Grandma Harp," [...] "Always Wanting You," [...] and [...] "The Roots of My Raising." [...] Between 1973 and 1976, he scored nine consecutive number-one country hits. In 1977, he switched to MCA Records and began exploring the themes of depression, alcoholism, and middle age on albums such as Serving 190 Proof <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> Am. Haggard sang a duet cover of Billy Burnette's [...] "What's A Little Love Between Friends" [...] with Lynda Carter in her 1980 television music special, Lynda Carter: Encore! He also scored a number-one hit in 1980 with [...] "Bar Room Buddies," [...] a duet with actor Clint Eastwood that {{appeared on}} the Bronco Billy soundtrack.|$|E

Ibrahimović's parents divorced when he was a child, and although his upbringing was divided between them, he spent more time with his father: 'I had time with my mother but I really lived with my father.' He has said in an 2012 interview with PSG that: [...] "My father is Muslim, my mother is Catholic, but none of that has anything to do with football. I received a special education. I'm me and football is a religion in its own right, and everyone is welcome..." [...] In an interview with CNN on 24 November 2015, he stressed that his Muslim background was [...] "not a factor" [...] in fans' perception of him: [...] "For me, it didn't change (anything) because my father is Muslim and my mother is Catholic... For me it is all about respect. That's how I grew up <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> learned to be. This is what I am." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{a friend}} {{recommended}} English actress Lena Headey for the role, Friedman watched her audition tape, and {{thought she was}} [...] "a tough, tough woman". Having seen The Terminator {{when she was a}} teenager, which [...] "scared the hell out of" [...] her, Headey was aware of the iconic status of the character and in regards to Linda Hamilton's portrayal of the role in the film series, she remarked, [...] "Linda Hamilton will always be the original Sarah Connor and it's a very strong print that she's left, but hopefully people will embrace what I bring to Sarah and see it with fresh eyes". When asked about her approach to the role, Headey said [...] "I'm playing a mother who is a single parent, bringing up a teenage son, who also happens to save the world—as a byline to her life. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> would play that is someone who's passionate and scared and angry and a mother, all these things. So I approach that just trying to be honest within the boundaries of her". However, the choice to cast Headey was criticized by several fans and critics who argued that she bore no resemblance to the athletic, muscular woman established by Hamilton, who transformed her body into that of a muscled warrior for Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The controversy was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Herald, and The Guardian, as well as in online forums.|$|E
2500|$|All Saints {{returned}} in February 2000 {{with the single}} [...] "Pure Shores", written by Shaznay Lewis and William Orbit for the soundtrack of the film The Beach (starring Leonardo DiCaprio). [...] "Pure Shores" [...] was their fifth number-one single in the UK and the second best-selling single of 2000, with 600,000 copies sold; it also became their first and only number-one single in Ireland and was a substantial hit across Europe and Australia. The song won an Ivor Novello Award for Most Performed Work. All Saints performed the song at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards. In October 2000, All Saints released the single [...] "Black Coffee", which became their sixth and final number-one single in the UK, selling 200,000 copies. This preceded their second studio album, Saints & Sinners, which debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums Chart, eventually reaching double platinum certification in the UK for sales of 600,000 copies. The third and final single was [...] "All Hooked Up" [...] in January 2001, which peaked at number seven. In February 2001, All Saints announced that they were to take a break so that they [...] "could clear the air" [...] between themselves. Melanie Blatt said later that year that it was uncertain if they would reform, citing their difficulties with the financial and business aspects of the group. Shaznay Lewis later explained that the catalyst for the break-up was a disagreement over who would wear a certain jacket for a photoshoot: [...] "I would never in a million years have put money on the group ending over a jacket incident.
