40|$|The {{validity}} of an isotropic model for predicting daily irradiation on inclined surfaces was tested by using one-year measured {{data on a}} horizontal, an inclined and four vertical surfaces for Easthampstead (51. 4 "N, 0. 8 "W) and Lenvick (60 PN, 12 W) in the United Kingdom. As a consequence an anisotropic model has been developed. The proposed model treats south-, north- and east/west-facing surfaces differently. The accuracy of the proposed model is {{compared with that of}} the isotropic model by employing a simple technique of error analysis, The usefulness of a good daily inclined surface irradiation model is outlined.

However Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months. He returned to Naval service in 1862 as Commander of , another ironclad.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} his Bond books, Fleming used events or names from his life in his writing. In the 1930s, Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once {{deliberately}} set off down <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> that had been closed because {{of the danger of}} an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond's escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club {{and turned it into a}} research establishment examining the Asiatic races. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld's own centre of Piz Gloria.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the city}} and Amtrak {{attempted}} to fund a second renovation with a private partner, but plans fell through. In 1991, Amtrak constructed a rectangular concrete and glass station building {{on the north side}} of the tracks, in front of the passenger tunnel. Access from the south was blocked off. In 1999, the original station building was renovated at a cost of $7 million for use as commercial space. The front parking lot was expanded on <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> to the west; it covered much of the ground level (similar to the station before 1915). The mechanical building and the covered ramp to the trolley station were removed. A strip mall was built just to the east, with balustrades and archways referencing the historic station. The passageway from the subway station, long closed, was likely buried at this time. The 1901-built station building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 8, 1999.|$|E

5|$|SR750 was {{established}} in 1937, ran from SR257 to its junction with SR 315. In 1997, SR750 was extended eastward from SR315, crossing Olentangy River and US 23 via Powell Road, then following Polaris Parkway around to a new eastern terminus at I-71 in the far northern end of Columbus. Ten years later, a new interchange was built for Gemini Place at I-71, north of SR 750. The interchange would relieve traffic in the area. The next year, SR750's westernmost portion was re-routed to the south, onto an all-new alignment that brought its western terminus {{in line with the}} intersection of SR257 and County Road 126 (Glick Road), after an expansion to the Columbus Zoo. In September 2013, <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> stabilization project began for SR 315, and turn lanes are currently being added for SR 315 and SR 750's intersection.|$|E
5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E
