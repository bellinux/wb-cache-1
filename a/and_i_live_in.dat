6000|$|... "Yes. Out in Wisconsin. My {{people were}} emigrants, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the woods, there, till I began to paint my way out. I began pretty early, but I {{was in the}} woods till I was sixteen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess that's right. I {{was raised}} <b>in</b> the plains, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky a while. There's more doing {{there in a}} day than there is here in a month. Say, how did you fix it with the old man?" ...|$|R
2500|$|That Mitchell and Webb Look took a jab at Leatherhead {{in series}} two, episode four.

6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] I agreed calmly. [...] "My {{last name}} is MacPherson, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Avonlea. As you are NOT curious, {{that will be}} all the {{information}} you will need about me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name," [...] {{replied the}} Woman, [...] "is Truth; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> {{the desert in}} order to be near my worshippers when they are driven from among their fellows. They all come, sooner or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am Prince Fiddlecumdoo, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> {{the next}} valley, {{which is called}} the Valley of Mo. Being {{determined}} to see something of the world, I am traveling for pleasure, and have just dropped in on you for a friendly call." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} {{pleasant}} before hoops--in every way," [...] said Mrs. March. [...] "I was young, then; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Boston, where <b>I</b> {{suppose it was}} always simpler than in New York. I used to sit on our steps. It was delightful for girls--the freedom." ...|$|R
50|$|He's {{got good}} style, too. Yeah, yeah, I {{used to see}} him when he was, like, eleven, twelve years-oldâ€”he <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Lakeland <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Fort Myers, like, three hours away. Yeah, I {{remember}} he killed it, and, ah, everybody knew it, too. He was, he was always great.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the city, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the country, <b>and</b> {{although}} <b>I</b> {{went to her}} whenever <b>I</b> could, <b>and</b> she and {{her mother}} dined several times with my grandmother, there were often long stretches, sometimes extending over the greater part of the day, when I did not see her at all.|$|R
60|$|In my short {{course through}} life (says he in {{confidence}} {{to a friend}} at one-and-twenty), I have never feared an enemy, or failed a friend; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the hope I never shall. For the rest, I have written my heart in my poems; and rude and unfinished and hasty as they are, it can be read there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} wonder, myself, who I am," [...] {{replied the}} many-legged young man; [...] "but, in reality, I am Tommy Kwikstep, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a hollow tree that {{fell to the}} ground with age. I have polished the inside of it, and made a door at each end, and that's a very comfortable residence for me because it just fits my shape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Korak! Why Korak is an ape. I have {{no other}} people. Korak <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the jungle alone since A'ht went to be king of the apes." [...] She had always thus {{pronounced}} Akut's name, for so it had sounded to her when first she came with Korak and the ape. [...] "Korak could have been kind, but he would not." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mary broke in, [...] "That's what <b>I</b> say. <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> {{on a farm}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Castle Rock. When <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> on {{the farm}} I {{wanted to get to}} Castle Rock. When I got to Castle Rock I wanted to get to Madison. Madison made me hone for Chicago, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> had a chance to come, I just dropped my work at the University and put for the city, <b>and</b> here <b>I</b> am <b>and</b> glad of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the Host!" [...] swore {{the false}} Piedmontese. [...] "I am a Christian man myself, Arsenio, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> ignorance of this thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Good-night, however, now--I must stagger (really {{from the}} force of too total an abstinence) to my never-unappreciated couch. (Norris dined on a bottle of soda-water and I on no drop of anything.) I pray you be bearing grandly up, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the light of your noble fortitude. One is always the better for a great example, and I am always all-faithfully yours, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The secret {{trails that}} lead to scared pocket-books! Always, in everything! And I don't {{have any of the}} fine melodrama of fiction: the dictagraphs and speeches by torchlight. I'm merely blocked by stupidity. Oh, I know I'm a fool. I dream of Venice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Archangel and scold because the Northern seas aren't tender-colored. But at least they sha'n't keep me from loving Venice, and {{sometime}} I'll run away----All right. No more." ...|$|E
60|$|In this thankful {{frame of}} mind did I {{afterwards}} continue, while I abode on the island, and for three years did my man <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the greatest enjoyment of happiness. Indeed, I believe the savage was as good a Christian as I; and I hope we were equally penitent; and such penitents as were comforted and restored by God's Holy Spirit; for now we had {{the word of the}} Lord to instruct us in the right way, as much as if we had been on the English shore.|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} was 'Pendennis' <b>I</b> began with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the book to the very last line of it, and made its alien {{circumstance}} mine to the smallest detail. I am still not sure {{but it is the}} author's greatest book, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> speak from a thorough acquaintance with every line he has written, except the Virginians, which I {{have never been able to}} read quite through; most of his work I have read twice, and some of it twenty times.|$|R
40|$|For two years, {{my family}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Cairo, Egypt, while I {{worked at the}} American University in Cairo as an Instruction and Reference Librarian.

This article will discuss jobs in academic and school libraries, including tips on finding and attaining these positions.

60|$|Our house {{stood in}} a highly respectable little square near the Clayton parish church. Mr. Gabbitas, the curate of all work, lodged on our ground floor, and upstairs {{there was an old}} lady, Miss Holroyd, who painted flowers on china and {{maintained}} her blind sister in an adjacent room; my mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the basement <b>and</b> slept in the attics. The front of the house was veiled by a Virginian creeper that defied the Clayton air and clustered in untidy dependent masses over the wooden porch.|$|R
60|$|Dian <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a great palace {{overlooking}} the gulf. There is no glass in our windows, for {{we have no}} windows, the walls rising but a few feet above the floor-line, {{the rest of the}} space being open to the ceilings; but we have a roof to shade us from the perpetual noon-day sun. Perry and I decided to set a style in architecture that would not curse future generations with the white plague, so we have plenty of ventilation. Those of the people who prefer, still inhabit their caves, but many are building houses similar to ours.|$|E
6000|$|My {{address is}} still the same, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a most sweet corner of the universe, sea and fine hills before me, and a rich {{variegated}} plain; and at my back a craggy hill, loaded with vast feudal ruins. [...] I am very quiet; a person passing by my door half startles me; but I enjoy the most aromatic airs, and at night the most wonderful view into a moonlit garden. By day this garden fades into nothing, overpowered by its surroundings and the luminous distance; but at night and when the moon is out, that garden, the arbour, the flight of stairs that mount the artificial hillock, the plumed blue gum- trees that hang trembling, become the very skirts of Paradise. [...] Angels I know frequent it; and it thrills all night with the flutes of silence. Damn that garden;- and by day it is gone.|$|E
60|$|Not that I {{have lost}} so much--I only {{interposed}} between {{my brother and}} his impending fate by the loan of so much. I give myself no airs on this, for it was mere selfishness on my part; I was conscious that the wrong scale of the balance was pretty heavily charged, and I thought that throwing a little filial piety and fraternal affection into the scale in my favour, might help to smooth matters at the grand reckoning. There is still one thing would make my circumstances quite easy--I have an excise officer's commission, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> {{the midst of a}} country division. My request to Mr. Graham, {{who is one of the}} commissioners of excise, was, if in his power, to procure me that division. If I were very sanguine, I might hope that some of my great patrons might procure me a treasury warrant for supervisor, surveyor-general, etc.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jest a {{nice little}} 'ouse," [...] said Kipps. [...] "There's Hughenden, of course. But that's let. Besides being miles too big. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Folkestone again some'ow--not for anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In {{the same}} house, {{but not on}} the old conditions. I have part of it on lease; the farmer now tenanting the {{premises}} found the whole more than he wanted, and the owner allowed me to keep what rooms I chose. I am poor now, you know, Nicholas, and almost friendless. My brother sold the Froom-Everard estate when it came to him, and the person who bought it turned our home into a farmhouse. Till my father's death my husband <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the manor-house with him, so that <b>I</b> have never <b>lived</b> away from the spot.' ...|$|R

60|$|We {{have had}} a blessed {{interval}} of quiet in this beautiful place, of which, as you may suppose, we stood greatly in need, not only by reason of our hard travelling for a long time, but {{on account of the}} incessant persecutions of the people, by land and water, on stage coach, railway car, and steamer, which exceeds anything you can picture to yourself by the utmost stretch of your imagination. So far we have had this hotel nearly to ourselves. It is a large square house, standing on a bold height, with overhanging eaves like a Swiss cottage, and a wide handsome gallery outside every story. These colonnades make it look so very light, that it has exactly the appearance of a house built with a pack of cards; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> bodily terror lest any man should venture to step out of a little observatory on the roof, and crush the whole structure with one stamp of his foot.|$|E
6000|$|I fear my stepson {{will not}} have found {{time to get to}} Paris; he was {{overwhelmed}} with occupation, and is already on his voyage back. We live here in a beautiful land, amid a beautiful and interesting people. The life is still very hard: my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a two- roomed cottage, about three miles and six hundred and fifty feet above the sea; we have had to make the road to it; our supplies are very imperfect; in the wild weather of this (the hurricane) season we have much discomfort: one night the wind blew in our house so outrageously that we must sit in the dark; and as the sound of the rain on the roof made speech inaudible, you may imagine we found the evening long. All these things, however, are pleasant to me. [...] You say L'ARTISTE INCONSCIENT set off to travel: you do not divide me right. 0.6 of me is artist; 0.4, adventurer. First, I suppose, come letters; then adventure; and since I have indulged the second part, I think the formula begins to change: 0.55 of an artist, 0.45 of the adventurer were nearer true. And {{if it had not been}} for my small strength, I might have been a different man in all things, ...|$|E
60|$|The {{heads of}} colleges in our great Universities (who have not the {{reputation}} of being the most mobile of persons) have, in several cases, thought it well that, out of the great number of honours and rewards at their disposal, a few should hereafter be given to the cultivators of the physical sciences. Nay, I hear that some colleges have even {{gone so far as to}} appoint one, or, may be, two special tutors for the purpose of putting the facts and principles of physical science before the undergraduate mind. And I say it with gratitude and great respect for those eminent persons, that the head masters of our public schools, Eton, Harrow, Winchester, have addressed themselves to the problem of introducing instruction in physical science among the studies of those great educational bodies, with much honesty of purpose and enlightenment of understanding; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> hope that, before long, important changes in this direction will be carried into effect in those strongholds of ancient prescription. In fact, such changes have already been made, and physical science, even now, constitutes a recognised element of the school curriculum in Harrow and Rugby, whilst I understand that ample preparations for such studies are being made at Eton and elsewhere.|$|E
