40|$|Laws of aerosol {{particle}} distribution at hygroscopic seeding of convective clouds {{by means of}} <b>antihail</b> rockets are considered. Influence of salt particle dispersion degree on inten-sity of condensation growth of separate cloud droplets on these particles is investigated. Ana-lytical formulae describing variation of radius of NaCl crystal and cloud droplet growing on the salt crystal until its entire dissolution in the droplet are obtained. On the basis of numerical calculations, comparative analysis of salt influence on intensification of condensation growth of droplets in the cloud is carried out. 1. Statement of the problem At present, experiments on seeding of convective clouds with hygroscopic reagents for forced causing or enhancement of precipitation are intensively carried out. Simultaneously, works on optimization of concepts, methods, and facilities for impact on cloud environment are executed. New, more efficient reagents and cheaper facilities for reagent hauling into cloud volumes are actively developed {{in a number of}} countries. Experiments with random sampling on hygroscopic seeding of hail clouds carried out in France [6] have shown positiv...|$|E
40|$|Research {{results of}} global climate changes {{influence}} on hail climatology and evaluation of <b>antihail</b> projects are considered. It is shown that during last 50 years losses from hail and powerful hailstorms frequency in the North Caucasus mountain regions were reduced on the average in 2 times and was increased in adjacent foothill and plain areas by 20 - 30 %. Therefore evaluation of hail suppression (HS) projects is recommended {{to be done with}} taking into account of tendency of hail hazard changes in each region. Ignoring of these changes at estimation of hail suppression and precipitation enhancement (PE) efficiency can lead to overestimation of PE projects efficiency and also to biased efficiency estimation of HS projects. Q, mm a) 1. About climate change tendencies The estimation of HS projects efficiency is usually carried out in the assumption of hail climatology invariance [Guideline document, 2010]. At the same time, global climate warming on the North Caucasus over last 50 years has resulted to increases of air temperature by 0. 36 °С on average (fig. 1), air relative humidity by 6 %, annual precipitation amount by 4 – 16 % depending on regional orography (fig. 2) and also to change of hailstorms frequency both intensity and to high hail danger areas displacement [Abshaev, etc., 2003 b...|$|E
