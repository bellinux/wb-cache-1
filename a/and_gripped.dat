40|$|AbstractAn {{association}} between level of cognitive function <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> strength is well established, whereas evidence for longitudinal associations {{of change in}} the 2 functions is still unclear. We examined associations between cognition <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> strength in levels of performance and in longitudinal change in late life in a population-based sample, aged ≥ 80  years at baseline, followed until death. The sample consisted of 449 nondemented individuals drawn from the OCTO-Twin Study. A test battery assessing 6 cognitive domains <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> strength was administered at 5 occasions with measurements intervals of 2 years. We fitted time to death bivariate growth curve models, adjusted for age, education, and sex which resulted in associations between <b>grip</b> strength <b>and</b> cognition in both levels of performance (across all cognitive domains) and rates of change (in 4 of 6 domains). These results show that cognition <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> strength change conjointly in later life and that the {{association between}} cognition <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> strength is stronger before death than earlier in life...|$|R

40|$|Injuries to the hand, lower arm, and {{shoulder}} are often attributed to inappropriate use or poor design of hand tools. Isometric grip, {{performed with the}} angled handles of pliers was investigated in this study. For this thesis, three factors were studied. They were <b>grip</b> type (traditional <b>and</b> reversed <b>grip),</b> elbow position (0 ∘, 30 ∘, 60 ∘, 90 ∘, and 120 ∘), <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> span (50, 60, and 70 mm). The resultant forces between the jaws of the pliers and finger forces were measured under each condition. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of elbow position <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> span on <b>grip</b> strength <b>and</b> force distribution across the fingers. The results showed that elbow position, <b>grip</b> span <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> type have significant effects on resultant force and finger force. The forces were statistically higher at the fully extended elbow position than at the 30 ∘, 90 ∘ and 120 ∘ elbow positions, and the resultant force was higher at the 60 ∘, 30 ∘, and 90 ∘ positions than at the 120 ∘ position. Regardless of elbow positions <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> type the optimal grip span was found to be 50 mm and forces decreased as grip span increased. The resultant force obtained in a traditional grip exceeded the force obtained in a reversed grip. Also, the finger force varied according to elbow position, <b>grip</b> span <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> type. The influences of these factors also varied according to fingers. Interactions between <b>grip</b> span <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> type were found in index and ring fingers. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

40|$|Objectives: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine sex differences in the initial level and rate of change in physical function <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> strength. Method: The baseline survey included 2, 262 Danes born in 1905 and alive in 1998 and followed-up in 2000, 2003, and 2005. Hence, the authors fully used the power of having a cohort with multiple assessments in late life and virtually complete follow-up of lifespan (through December 2008). Latent growth curve modeling was used. Results: Men had higher initial levels and rates of decline in strength score <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> strength. Lifespan was positively correlated with intercepts and slopes. Discussion: The Danish data suggested that the longest-living individuals have higher initial levels of strength score <b>and</b> <b>grip</b> strength <b>and</b> smaller rate of change.
