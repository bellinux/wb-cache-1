2500|$|Initially {{intended}} {{to assess the}} value of church properties, the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 reckoned the net annual value of Haughmond at £259 13s. 7¼d. [...] The annual income at dissolution was actually reckoned at more than £350, as the new estimate included the abbey site and the granges of Homebarn and Sundorne, missed in earlier calculations. There was a £200 threshold set by the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536, which left Haughmond and Lilleshall in being. However, the precedent and the storm of criticism unleashed by {{the dissolution of the}} majority of religious houses intimidated many of the more successful institutions into surrender. Haughmond took this step in 1539, the year before the Second <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dissolution.</b> The commission to dissolve the abbey was issued from Woodstock Palace on 23 August 1539 and signed by Thomas Cromwell. A deed of surrender was drawn up on 19 September. The abbot, Thomas Corveser, the prior, John Colfox, and nine canons signed it by 16 October, acknowledging Henry VIII as supreme over the Church of England on earth. Each of them received a generous pension: the abbot £40 a year, [...] the prior £8, and the canons either £5 6s. 8d. or £6 each. Two canons did not sign, William Rolfe who received a pension of £7, and Richard Doone, who received only 40 shillings.|$|E

The 64th Amendment Bill was prepared and introduced in the lower house of Parliament. But it got defeated in the Rajya Sabha as non-convincing. He lost the general elections too.

50|$|During these years, Holcroft became {{involved}} in his brother's schemes {{to profit from the}} Dissolution of the monasteries. Together they were appointed receivers for the lands formerly belonging to Lenton Priory, a Cluniac house at Nottingham. The Valor Ecclesiasticus had valued the property at £387 10s. 10½d., well above the threshold of £200 set by the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536. However, unlike other larger houses, Lenton was neither surrendered voluntarily nor dissolved by the Second <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dissolution.</b> Instead, a campaign of allegations and propaganda brought forth accusations of verbal treason against the prior, Nicholas Heath, eight of the monks and four labourers. They were tried and executed in 1538, while the priory was dissolved by attainder, with no pensions paid to any of the survivors. The Holcrofts moved in to receive the property on the king's behalf, presumably profiting greatly themselves: Thomas was notorious for his exploitation of monastic rents.|$|E
50|$|The Dissolution of the Monasteries {{entered a}} final stage with the Second <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dissolution</b> in 1539. The manors Bickford, Whiston and Pillaton were {{technically}} under the overlordship of Burton Abbey. The abbey had never actually managed the estates, and the manorial lords who occupied them paid small rents for the land. Sir Edward Littleton (died 1558) had his seat at Pillaton Hall, while Bickford and Whiston were held by Sir John Giffard (died 1556) of Chillington Hall, near Brewood. Burton Abbey was surrendered by its monks early in 1539 after {{an outbreak of}} Iconoclasm. Overlordship of all three manors passed from the abbey to the Crown, and the Crown later sold it to Sir William Paget a moderate Protestant supporter of the protector Somerset during the minority of Edward VI. Littleton and Giffard both simply transferred payment of their rent to the new overlord and their families continued to prosper throughout the century, the Giffards despite their Catholic Recusancy.|$|E
50|$|Its chantry {{was founded}} in 1324 by Thomas de Littleton, then rector of Harrow, and {{formerly}} rector of Spaxton.

The chaplain was to be appointed by Thomas de Littleton, and after his death by Sir Geoffrey de Perkelee, the rector of Littleton, and his successors. In 1547-48 the chantry was last served by a French priest, Sir Philip Lyniard, who had a house, an orchard, and a little croft or close. However the 1547 <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dissolution</b> of Chantries preceded the Dissolution of the Monasteries the following year and split between the lord of the manor and rector.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> pyrite is {{important}} in the geochemical cycling of iron and sulphur, in the formation of acid mine drainage, and in the extraction of metals by bacterial leaching. Many researchers have studied the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>dissolution,</b> and the rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> has often been found to be half-order in ferric ions or oxygen. Previous work has not adequately explained the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> pyrite. The <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> pyrite is an oxidation-reduction reaction. The kinetics of the oxidation and reduction half-reactions was studied independently using electrochemical techniques of voltammetry. The kinetics of the overall reaction was studied by the electrochemical technique of potentiometry, which consisted of measuring the mixed potential of a sample of corroding pyrite in solutions of different compositions. The kinetics of the half reactions are related to the kinetics <b>of</b> the overall <b>dissolution</b> reaction by the condition that there is no accumulation of charge. This principle is used to derive expressions for the mixed potential and the rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution,</b> which successfully describe the mixed potential measurements and the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> reported in the literature. It is shown that the observations of half-order kinetics and that the oxygen in the sulphate product arises from water are both a direct consequence of the electrochemical mechanism. Thus it is concluded that the electrochemical reaction steps occurring at the mineral-solution interface control the rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution.</b> Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze reaction products formed on the pyrite surface.
