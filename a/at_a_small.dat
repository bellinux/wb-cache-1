5|$|Capacitive discharge: {{this is a}} nonthermal plasma {{generated}} by the application of RF power (e.g., 13.56MHz) to one powered electrode, with a grounded electrode held <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> separation distance {{on the order of}} 1cm. Such discharges are commonly stabilized using a noble gas such as helium or argon.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in California, Wanda Flora went to {{graduate}} school at the University of Indiana, where she was an assistant coach for the women's basketball team and coached the junior varsity team. After a brief stint <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> college in Pennsylvania, she applied for the job at UConn, starting in 1975 and leading the team to a 38–66 record in five seasons. During her tenure, shooting guard Karen Mullins was the first UConn woman to receive a basketball scholarship; that number had increased to 12 by 1980.|$|E

There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself and chronicles the story in a book.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} comply with special UK legislation, there are full {{security}} checks similar to those at airports, scanning both bags and people's pockets. Security checks at Eurostar are comparable to those <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> airport and generally much quicker than at London Heathrow. The recommended check-in time is 30 minutes except for business class where it is 10 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Nigerian guerrillas arrive <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> village, grab a {{young boy}} named Yemi and try {{to force him to}} shoot an old man. The boy hesitates and his older brother, Eko, takes the gun and shoots the man himself, thus saving his brother from the act. The guerrillas are pleased with this, and force him to join their group, tearing his Christian cross from his neck, which is then taken by Yemi.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} days Hoesin repeatedly visits Rasminah, and slowly the two begin {{to fall in}} love. When Rasminah takes her aunt to Batavia to live, Hoesin follows. They begin discussing their future together, but Rasminah insists that she will only marry when her aunt is reunited with Kasimin. After a lengthy search, in which he almost gives up hope, Hoesin finds Kasimin <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> plantation in the hills outside of the city– Hadidjah's long-lost husband previously operated his own orchard, but had been evicted by a conniving and greedy landlord only days before. Kasimin and Hadidjah are reunited, allowing Hoesin and Rasminah to begin their own preparations.|$|E

5|$|So-called superluminal {{motion is}} seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the {{relativistic}} jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these jets are not moving at speeds {{in excess of the}} speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Cindy can be {{attributed}} to a deepening low-pressure area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary over the Atlantic, extending from northern Florida to Bermuda. On July 5, the front spawned a separate cut-off cold-core low off the coast of the Carolinas. This complex scenario resulted in the formation of a tropical depression later during the day, which slowly meandered north-northeastward. Tropical cyclones of this origin typically remain <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> size and evolve slowly, and Cindy complied to this pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of heavy canvas {{was started in}} 1828 by Michael Nairn <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> factory. Influenced by a visit to Bristol, Nairn started to make floorcloth at his new factory at Pathhead in 1847, where his company pioneered the use of ovens to season the floorcloth and reduce production times. When the patent belonging to Frederick Walton expired, Nairn's were able to manufacture linoleum from 1877 onwards. Other factories producing floorcloth and later linoleum were established by former employees of Michael Nairn.|$|E

Alternatively, rotating the POF, {{in combination with}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> f-number, can minimize the part of an image that is within the DOF.|$|R

5|$|The {{restaurant}} carriages of the NSS {{were open}} to everyone, but dining was so expensive that only passengers travelling in first class used the service. Usually, three or four dishes were offered in the restaurant carriages. A four-course dinner cost five Norwegian kroner in the 1920s, which was expensive at the time. Warm dishes, such as soups and sauces, were usually prepared <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> stove in the restaurant carriage's kitchen. On busy days, prepared steaks were delivered from rail depots. The kitchens were staffed by two maids and one attendant. Blocks of ice were often used instead of refrigerators.|$|E
5|$|The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. The softness of the brick has {{caused it to}} weather in a non-uniform fashion. The brick {{is said to have}} been fired <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln Highway bridge. The home stands on a stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish. Construction was completed in 1861 and the home is a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E
5|$|This hamster {{is listed}} as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The {{population}} and distribution size are large, and no major or widespread threats to the species are known. However, {{the increasing number of}} livestock in the areas of distribution, such as the steppes of central Asia, some burrows are <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> risk of being destroyed. In arid areas of distribution, the reduction in the amount of water sources is also a minor concern. These hamsters are conserved in protected areas.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{great number}} of {{techniques}} used in reducing crime. These could be split up into ones <b>at</b> <b>a</b> large scale, such as strategies implemented by a society or community, and others <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> one, such as personal security.|$|R

5|$|Up to 1987, airletters (also {{known as}} aérogrammes) were {{produced}} without any fee applied and were available free from post offices upon payment {{of the appropriate}} rate in force for the postage stamp purchased to mail the airletter. Most airletters with a pre-paid indicia have been sold <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> premium over the then-current aérogramme postal rate.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} was also filmed for the So So Def remix. Directed by Diane Martel, it {{was shot in}} a grainy fashion to {{simulate}} a home video. The video features cameo appearances by Dupri, Tariq and Gunz. It begins with scenes of Carey and Dupri <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> in-home gathering, lounging and enjoying each other's company. As the video progresses, the other two featured hip-hop musicians appear at the house, alongside various other guests. They begin to dance to music, while sipping on cocktails by the pool. As the video reaches its climax, scenes of Carey singing in an outdoor garden are shown, while the others join her on the pool deck.|$|E
5|$|Anita and {{the player}} get drunk {{on a table}} {{while the rest of}} the {{characters}} start dancing and flying across the room. Then the player is taken again to the room where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to the room where both she and Borges were lying shot. The player is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart. They arrive <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> place where the gunfight sequence takes place, followed by the motorcycle ride sequence, which ends with a crash that leads the player into a museum. In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. The player leaves the area and goes into a new one where Bernoulli's principle about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, the player is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.|$|E
50|$|<b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> scale, plant roots extend into voids {{and remove}} water causing the open spaces to increase, thereby {{decreasing}} aggregate size. At the same time, roots, fungal hyphae, and earthworms create microscopic tunnels that break up peds.|$|R
