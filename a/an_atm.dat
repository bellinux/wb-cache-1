5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended {{to be in charge of}} the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing <b>an</b> <b>ATM</b> and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 {{bill from}} <b>an</b> <b>ATM,</b> but he drops it and an updraft carries it {{away to the}} Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so {{that the person who}} lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can {{describe}} it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was going out to the front lines the next day, not realising that he really was shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E

25|$|Credit unions often form cooperatives among {{themselves}} {{to provide services}} to members. A Credit Union Service Organization (CUSO) is generally a for-profit subsidiary {{of one or more}} credit unions formed for this purpose. For example, CO-OP Financial Services, the largest credit union owned interbank network in the US, provides <b>an</b> <b>ATM</b> network and shared branching services to credit unions. Other examples of cooperatives among credit unions include credit counseling services as well as insurance and investment services.|$|E
25|$|One of the downsides {{to having}} no {{physical}} branches was {{the risk of}} deposits getting lost, damaged, or delayed in the mail. Several people complained about NetBank losing or delaying payments to the account {{for a variety of}} reasons. The invention of deposit-taking ATMs alleviated some of this concern because customers could make the deposit in a local ATM, where the check will post and clear very quickly. The widespread nature of NetBank's customers made it difficult to have <b>an</b> <b>ATM</b> handy for all customers, though and many were still required to use mail-in deposits.|$|E
