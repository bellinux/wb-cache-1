50|$|Too old for {{a regular}} commission, on 18 April 1940 Strange {{returned}} to military {{service as a}} 50-year-old pilot officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He was posted to No. 24 Squadron, the RAF's only transport and communications services squadron at that time. On 21 May 1940 Strange arrived in Merville in northern France as No. 24 Squadron's <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Control</b> Officer. The airfield had been evacuated by the RAF fighter squadron stationed there and No. 24 Squadron were tasked with saving what aircraft and equipment they could. Two fighters were patched up and flown back to England. All remaining Hurricanes had been cannibalised, leaving one in flying condition. With no pilot available, Strange took off in an aircraft type he had never flown before, unarmed, and {{with most of the}} instruments missing. Anti-aircraft fire forced Strange up to 8000 ft and the lone fighter was then attacked by several Bf 109s. Surprised by the sound of machine-gun fire, Strange dived the Hurricane to tree-top height and successfully escaped. A month later he was awarded a bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
40|$|The {{air traffic}} control system is a vast network of people and {{necessary}} navigational equipment that ensures the safe operation of commercial and private aircraft throughout the world. Air traffic controller service is responsible for area, approach and <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control.</b> Aircraft fatal accident data for commercial jet airplanes between 1959 and 2008 show that 36 % of the accidents happen in the final approach and landing phase, possibly due to mechanical failure or human error resulting from poor communication between the pilot and {{air traffic control}}ler. This paper presents an integration of a radar system with a GPS-based Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) for approach control separation between all instrument flight rules (IFR) flights and between IFR flights and visual flight rules (VFR) flights operated as controlled flights. The integration is simulated using MATLAB. Results of the simulation show that aircraft separation is easier and safer than relying only on an air traffic controller. We note, however, that the service of air traffic controllers is still required for successful <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control...</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper aims at {{understanding}} crucial {{variables that}} influence the control of visual attention of tower controllers. Novel concepts for <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control</b> of regional airports consider to remotely control two or more airports at a time from one remote center. A simulation experiment was set up where 12 professional tower controllers operated parallel traffic of two airports. Eye gaze recording and questionnaires were used. Two feedback loops are considered to influence the controllers monitoring behavior: The accessibility of the information of the “far-view” and controller strategies. The results show that both variables have a crucial influence on how often the controller updates the information of one airport. This implies that monitoring performance depends on system design and behavioral strategies. These dependencies {{can be applied to}} the design of novel ATC-workplaces...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} book contains in six separate chapters {{contributions to}} the variety of aspects of the interdisciplinary research and development work performed during the recent ten years towards the goal of replacing the conventional airport control tower by a new "Remote Tower" work environment (RTO). As a first step small, low-traffic airports are addressed with the expectation of increasing work efficiency and safety and reducing cost. This revolutionary human-system interface allows for remote <b>aerodrome</b> traffic <b>control</b> without the physical tower building {{and at the same}} time enables the establishment of Remote Airport Traffic Control Centers (RTC) where several airports will be controlled from a central location. Following a preface and an introduction into the subject the ca. 23 separate contributions are grouped into six chapters which cover the following topics: Fundamentals (<b>Aerodrome</b> Traffic <b>Control,</b> visual information / visual cues, aircraft detection/SSO-model), Human-in-the-Loop Simulations for Requirements and Design (work analysis, communication issues, RTO /RTC human-in-the-loop simulations, requirements from two-alternative decision experiments), RTO-Design and Engineering (videopanorama design and engineering, automation, movement detection), RTO-/RTC-Validation (operational issues, shadow-mode tests, data analysis and advanced methods), Alternative Approaches and Perspectives (US-FAA Approach, future perspectives: synthetic vision and VR), and Appendix (practical guidelines on structured work analysis, Questionaires, technical design fundamentals, signal detection theory / Bayes inference for data analysis, RTO/RTC simulator environment). A glossary, authors CV’s and index will complete the volume. ...|$|R
