5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field.

The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions.

The bioaccumulation of {{the heavy}} metals copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) by the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, and the purple urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, were assessed in the laboratory by exposing them to elevated metal concentrations in seawater. Experiments were designed to contrast the uptake of Cu and Zn in isolation (when only one metal concentration was elevated) and in combination (when both metal concentrations were elevated) {{after three days of}} exposure in the meristematic tissue of M. pyrifera and for both the gonad and digestive tissues of S. purpuratus. Experimental concentrations for Cu ranged from 15 ppb (parts per billion) to 480 ppb and Zn ranged from 100 ppb to 600 ppb. Following metal exposure, samples were acid digested and analyzed on an inductively coupled plasma <b>atomic</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (ICP-AES). Results indicated that M. pyrifera accumulated Cu when it was elevated in seawater regardless of Zn concentrations. In contrast, M. pyrifera only accumulated Zn from elevated concentrations in seawater when Cu concentrations were not elevated. This pattern, although not always statically significant, was observed in all experiments, suggesting that Cu inhibits the uptake of Zn, but not vice versa. Results also showed that S. purpuratus was unable to accumulate these metals directly from elevated seawater. Only one treatment showed Zn accumulation in the digestive tissues directly from seawater when both metals were elevated (30 ppb Cu + 100 ppb Zn). In addition, S. purpuratus did not accumulate either Cu or Zn through the consumption of Cu and Zn contaminated M. pyrifera tissues. This study suggests that M. pyrifera may be useful as a bio-indicator species for monitoring heavy metal pollution in coastal environments. Whereas the adult stages of S. purpuratus do not accumulate metals when exposed to concentrations that would be expected following rain events over a period of a few days...|$|R

40|$|Mangrove trees, which develop along {{tropical}} coasts, {{are known}} to use saline water uptake. In French Guiana, the high salinity condition {{is the result of}} seawater evaporation on mud banks formed from the Amazon sediment flumes. In the back mangrove a few kilometres inland, groundwater, soil water and the xylem sap uptake in the trees remain highly salty, and only very tolerant plants like Avicennia germinans can flourish, whereas the less salt-tolerant Rhizophora mangle is more difficult to find. Curiously, the same Avicennia trees propagate on the seafront. However, stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) measurements and ion analysis (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and inductively coupled plasma <b>atomic</b> <b>emission</b> (ICP-AES) <b>spectroscopy</b> reveal that the origin of the water in the back mangrove is not seawater. It is freshwater percolating into the sand bars from the inland marshes and rainwater during the wet season that redissolves a marine evaporite and gives a saline groundwater.

40|$|The {{ability to}} monitor the {{integrity}} of gas volumes is {{of interest to the}} stockpile surveillance community. Specifically, the leak detection of noble gases, at relevant concentration ranges and distinguished from other chemical species that may be simultaneously present, is particularly challenging. Aside from the laboratory-based method of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), where samples may be collected by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) or cryofocusing, the other major approaches for gas-phase detection employ lasers typically operating in the mid-infrared wavelength region. While mass spectrometry can readily detect noble gases - the helium leak detector is an obvious example - laser-based methods such as infrared (IR) or Raman spectroscopy are completely insensitive to them as their monatomic nature precludes a non-zero dipole moment or changes in polarizability upon excitation. Therefore, noble gases can only be detected by one of two methods: (1) <b>atomic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>spectroscopies</b> which require the generation of plasmas through laser-induced breakdown, electrical arcing, or similar means; (2) non-spectroscopic methods which measure one or more physical properties (e. g., mass, thermal conductivity, density). In this report, we present our progress during Fiscal Year 2011 (FY 11) in the research and development of a non-spectroscopic method for noble gas detection. During Fiscal Year 2010 (FY 10), we demonstrated via proof-of-concept experiments that the combination of thermal conductivity detection (TCD) and coating-free damped resonance detection (CFDRD) using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) could provide selective sensing of these inert species. Since the MEMS-based TCD technology was directly adapted from a brassboard prototype commissioned by a previous chemical sensing project, FY 11 efforts focused on advancing the state of the newer CFDRD method. This work, guided by observations previously reported in the open literature, has not only resulted in a substantially measureable increase in selectivity but has also revealed a potential method for mitigating or eliminating thermal drift that does not require a secondary reference sensor. The design of an apparatus to test this drift compensation scheme will be described. We will conclude this report with a discussion of planned efforts in Fiscal Year 2012 (FY 12) ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{description}} of the optical emission spectral features of the plasma produced by laser-matter interaction, from a fundamental point of view. The laser induced plasma emission spectra are discussed in connection with the basic mechanisms that take place in the plasma phase at different time delays from the laser pulse. The laser induced plasma being a dynamic system, the hierarchy of the elementary mechanisms changes continuously because the electron number density and the electron temperature decrease during the expansion. As a consequence of this, over the duration of the plasma's persistence the prevailing emitting species changes from ions to atoms and from atoms to molecules. Both <b>atomic</b> and molecular <b>emission</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> are discussed, to convey a complete description of the temporal evolution of laser induced plasma.

Element selective detection has many {{applications in the}} field of petrochemical, environmental, pesticide and industrial analysis. It affords the analysis of compounds of interest in relatively complex samples, as the element selective response can flag compounds containing specific elements even if such compounds are co-eluting with other compounds. ^ This dissertation research has been focused on the applications of GC-AED coupled with sample derivatization techniques for the analysis of complex petrochemical and industrial samples. Research centers of three different projects. Analysis of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) was done in order to investigate the capability of the <b>atomic</b> <b>emission</b> detection system to produce compound independent elemental specific response. <b>Atomic</b> <b>emission</b> detection (GC-AED) can perform qualitative as well as quantitative analysis of unknown CFCs using only one available standard. Elemental response ratio (empirical formula) information provides the basis for qualitative analysis whereas individual elemental response forms the basis for quantitative analysis. Investigations concerning AED 2 ̆ 7 s compound independent element response were undertaken. It was observed that the reference standard and the sample should be similar with respect to molecular structure, elemental composition and concentration. ^ The determination of olefins in commercial gasolines is critical as it determines the overall quality of gasoline fuel. Since gasoline samples are very complex it is difficult to get an olefin chromatographic profile using conventional single capillary gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization or mass spectroscopic detectors. However, analysis of olefins is possible by GC-AED if a hetero-atom tag is selectively introduced on the olefin molecules. The olefins were selectively and quantitatively brominated without affecting the aromatic and saturated hydrocarbon components of the gasoline. By observing the bromine emission signal by the <b>atomic</b> <b>emission</b> detector, the olefin chromatographic profile for a gasoline sample was obtained, thereby avoiding the interference from the coeluting hydrocarbons. The optimization of the bromination reaction was carried out using a known hydrocarbon mixture that typified the gasoline components. ^ The determination of dicarboxylic acids in water samples has a very broad applicability as organic acids occur in wide variety of samples. Prior to gas chromatography the diacids were esterified by using pentafluorobenzyl bromide as an esterifying agent and tetrahexylammonium hydrogen sulfate as phase transfer catalyst. Esterfication is a single step process that yields diester molecules that contain ten fluorine atoms. By observing the fluorine emission signal from the <b>atomic</b> <b>emission</b> detector one can determine the amount of each diester.

40|$|While many methods {{exist to}} {{separate}} and analyze radionuclides {{from a variety}} of environmental matrices, the performance of all of these methods is often limited by other interfering constituents that are consistently found in most of these samples. The presence of such constituents can significantly reduce the recovery of the radioisotopes of interests and lead to incomplete separations. Strontium has the same oxidation state and a similar atomic radius as calcium and is therefore readily able to substitute for calcium in lattice sites. This similarity in behavior leads to the preferential accumulation of strontium in newly formed bone. The study of radiostrontium uptake and the analysis of bone samples is therefore of great interest for radiation biology, internal dosimetry, and consequence management. The fact that one of the strontium isotopes of greatest biological importance, 90 Sr, is a pure beta-emitter prevents the use of non-destructive assay techniques and necessitates the development of sophisticated separation methods for radiochemical analysis. It has been previously reported in the literature that the matrix constituents present in bone can significantly affect the strontium recovery from bone samples 1. Bone (hydroxyapatite) is of particular interest when evaluating the effect of common environmental interferences due to the high concentrations of calcium and phosphate present. The goal of this work is to determine the major and minor constituents present in various samples of bone ash and to determine their influence on method performance and strontium recovery. The work presented exploited the use of a variety of radioanalytical separation and isotope detection techniques. Focusing on the characterization of the bone ash, Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Powder Diffraction techniques were used to determine the morphology, to verify the crystalline pattern, and to analyze for any contaminants within each unique bone ash sample. The information obtained helped to determine the elements of interest for batch experiments, which were conducted {{in order to determine the}} individual elemental effects that may play a role on the retention of radiostrontium isotopes onto the SR Resin purchased from Eichrom Technologies Inc.
