500|$|Tides are {{the regular}} {{rise and fall}} in water level {{experienced}} by seas and oceans {{in response to the}} gravitational influences of the Moon and the Sun, and the effects of the Earth's rotation. At any given place, the water rises {{over the course of the}} tidal cycle to a maximum height known as [...] "high tide" [...] before ebbing away again to a minimum [...] "low tide" [...] level. As the water recedes, it uncovers more and more of the foreshore or intertidal zone. The difference in height between the high tide and low tide is known as the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> or <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitude.</b> <b>Tidal</b> bores can occur at the mouths of rivers, where the force of the incoming tide pushes waves of seawater upstream against the current.

40|$|Key words: {{nuclear power}} plant, thermal plume, tidal current. Circulation and hydrographic {{variations}} in the inner shelf of a semi-enclosed bay adjacent to {{a nuclear power plant}} of the southern-most Taiwan were analyzed using intensive observation data from 2003 - 2004. The dominant tide in the bay is a mixture of diurnal and semidiurnal components. Currents are dominated by tidal forcing which flows southwestward during flood and northeastward during ebb. The <b>amplitudes</b> of <b>tidal</b> currents <b>range</b> from 0. 2 to 0. 4 m/s. A persistent southwestward subtidal flow is present with a mean veloc-ity of 0. 15 m/s. The upwelled cold deep water in the central bay can intrude to the inner reach near the outlet, causing sudden temperature drops. Thermal discharge from the power plant creates a buoyant plume near the sea surface, which is the most prominent feature in the receiving water around the outlet. The thermal plume is 5 - 7 m thick just outside the outlet and shoals to less than 1 m near the sea surface as it disperses seaward. The thermal plume is usually restricted to within a 1000 m radius around the outlet; tidal currents substantially modulated its shape, stretching it out as a tongue towards the south-west during flood but fanning it out towards the northeast during ebb. The thermal discharge does not recirculate back to the intake...|$|R

Moreover, the salinity and <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> time series were coherent at that period through cross spectrum analysis. Besides, the phase analysis at the period of 14. 22 d showed that, within the estuary, the salinity time series upstream lagged that of the downstream, and the response time of salinity time series to the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> time series was about 9 - 10 d, increasing upstream.

40|$|Tidal embayments are {{characterized}} by {{a wide variety of}} landscape features, often including either complex tidal channel networks or extensive flood-tidal deltas. The origin of these features and the influence of hydrodynamic drivers and initial geological setting on their long-term characteristics are essentially unexplored. A model was applied to simulate the long-term morphological evolution of tidal embayments, with the purpose of providing insight into the environmental conditions that lead to the differences in tidal embayment morphology. Numerical simulations indicated that the interaction between hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and the evolving topography gives rise to the formation of channel networks. The <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> and the depth of the initially unchannelized tidal basin controlled {{the way in which the}} morphology evolved and determined the timescale over which channels and intertidal areas developed. Channel network formation occurred more rapidly when the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> increased and/or when the initial basin depth decreased. Tidal basins with a large initial depth showed the development of a flood-tidal delta and for these deep basins channel incision could remain absent over long timescales. Both <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> and initial bathymetry affected final basin hypsometry and channel network characteristics, including the channel density and the fraction of the basin occupied by the channels. All the simulated morphologies, with different combinations of the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> and depth of the basin, evolved towards a state of less morphodynamic activity for which the relative intertidal area was proportional to the ratio of <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitude</b> to basin depth...|$|R
50|$|The typical <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in {{the open}} ocean is about 0.6 metres (2 feet). Closer to the coast, this range is much greater. Coastal <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> vary {{globally}} and can differ anywhere from near zero to over 11 metres (38 feet). The exact range depends on the volume of water adjacent to the coast, and the geography of the basin the water sits in. Larger bodies of water have higher ranges, and the geography {{can act as a}} funnel amplifying or dispersing the tide. The world's largest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of 16.3 metres (53.5 feet) occurs in Bay of Fundy, Canada, and the United Kingdom regularly experiences <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> up to 15 metres between England and Wales in the Severn Estuary. The top 50 locations with the largest <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> worldwide are listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States.|$|R
50|$|Tides often {{determine}} the range over which sediment is deposited or eroded. Areas with high <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> allow waves to reach {{farther up the}} shore, and areas with lower <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> {{is influenced by the}} size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, tidal bores can erode as the waves surge up river estuaries from the ocean.|$|R
30|$|The {{variations}} in water levels and <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> experienced at the coast are also propagated inland during each <b>tidal</b> cycle. <b>Tidal</b> <b>range</b> {{of the northern}} fringe of the forest {{is higher than the}} southern part. The lowest recorded <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> was 2.74 m and the highest range was 5.12 m (IWM 2003). During spring tide in the monsoon season, the forest area is inundated for a maximum of 3 – 4 h. The pre-monsoon season showed comparatively higher inundation than the dry season, although the entire area of the Sundarbans mangrove forest does not get flooded in these periods. The average current velocities varied from 10 – 20 cm/s. Both deposition and erosion occur {{at the end of the}} monsoon season. The maximum net deposition and erosion at the end of monsoon were found to be around 50 and 19 mm, respectively (IWM 2003).|$|R

Palaeo tidal notches are considered {{as one of the}} most precise sea-level indicators as their formation is closely tied to the local <b>tidal</b> <b>range.</b> We present geometric measurements of modern and palaeo (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 e) tidal notches on Bonaire (southern Caribbean Sea) and results from two tidal simulations, using the present-day bathymetry and a palaeo-bathymetry. We use these two tools to investigate changes in the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> since MIS 5 e. Our models show that the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> changes most significantly in shallow areas, whereas both, notch geometry and models results, suggest that steeper continental shelves, such as the ones bordering the island of Bonaire, are less affected to changes in <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in conditions of MIS 5 e sea levels. We use our data and results to discuss the importance of considering changes in <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> while reconstructing MIS 5 e sea level histories, and we remark that it is possible to use hydrodynamic modelling and notch geometry as first-order proxies to assess whether, in a particular area, <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> might have been different in MIS 5 e with respect to today...|$|R

40|$|We present {{sea level}} {{observations}} {{derived from the}} analysis of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data recorded by five coastal GPS stations. These stations are located in different regions around the world, both in the northern and in the southern hemisphere, in different multipath environments, from rural coastal areas to busy harbors, and experience different <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges.</b> The recorded SNR data show periodic variations that originate from multipath, i. e. the interference of direct and reflected signals. The general assumption is that for satellite arcs facing the open sea, the rapid SNR variations are due to reflections off the sea surface. The SNR data recorded from these azimuth intervals were analyzed by spectral analysis with two methods: a standard analysis method assuming a static sea level during a satellite arc and an extended analysis method assuming a time dependent sea level during a satellite arc. The GPS-derived sea level results are compared to sea level records from co-located traditional tide gauges, both in the time and in the frequency domain. The sea level time series are highly correlated with correlation coefficients {{to the order of}} 0. 89 – 0. 99. The root-mean-square (RMS) difference is 6. 2 cm for the station with the lowest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of 165 cm and 43 cm for the station with the highest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of 772 cm. The relative accuracy, defined as the ratio of RMS and <b>tidal</b> <b>range,</b> is between 2. 4 % and 10. 0 % for all stations. Comparing the standard analysis method and the extended analysis method, the results based on the extended analysis method agree better with the independent tide gauge records for the stations with a high <b>tidal</b> <b>range.</b> For the station with the highest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> (772 cm), the RMS is reduced by 47 % when using the extended analysis method. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the standard analysis method, assuming a static sea level, can be used for stations with a <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of up to about 270 cm, without performing significantly worse than the extended analysis method. <b>Tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and phases are derived by harmonic analysis of the sea level records. Again, a high level of agreement is observed between the tide gauge and the GPS-derived results. Comparing the GPS-derived results, the results based on the extended analysis method show a higher degree of agreement with the traditional tide gauge results for stations with larger <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges.</b> Spectral analysis of the residuals after the harmonic analysis reveals remaining signal power at multiples of the draconitic day. This indicates that the observed SNR data are to some level disturbed by additional multipath signals, in particular for GPS stations that are located in harbors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{inundation}} {{is affected}} {{not only by}} rising mean sea level but also by changing tides. A numerical model is developed to investigate how sea level rise and coastline changes may impact tides in two coastal-plain estuaries, Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. Despite their different tidal characteristics, the two estuaries display similar responses to the sea level rise and shoreline management scenarios. When hypothetic sea walls are erected at the present coastline to prevent low-lying land from flooding, <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> increases, with greater amplification in {{the upper part of}} the two estuaries. When low-lying land is allowed to become permanently inundated by higher sea level, however, <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in both estuaries decreases. Analyses of the tidal energy budget show that the increased dissipation over the shallow water and newly inundated areas compensates for the reduced dissipation in deep water, leading to smaller <b>tidal</b> <b>range.</b> The changes in the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> are not proportional to the changes in the mean sea level, indicating a nonlinear tidal response to sea level rise. The ratio of <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> change to sea level rise varies between − 0. 05 and 0. 1 in Chesapeake Bay and between − 0. 2 and 0. 25 in Delaware Bay. The model results suggest a potential adaptation strategy that uses inundation over low-lying areas to reduce <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> at up-estuary locations.

50|$|Previous {{reports on}} tidal {{power in the}} Severn did not - and did not aim to - provide a {{detailed}} analysis of all <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> technologies. This feasibility study aims to consider all <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> technologies, including barrages and lagoons. The focus is on <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> technologies as this is where the energy potential in the Severn Estuary is the greatest, as opposed to 'tidal flow' which is the current in moving tidal waters. The <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in the Severn Estuary is the second highest in the world and can rise as much as 14 metres, meaning {{it has the potential to}} generate more renewable electricity than all other UK estuaries.

40|$|The North Sea is {{a shallow}} sea on the Eurasian {{continental}} shelf. This study {{focuses on the}} temporal development of the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> {{in the southern part}} of the North Sea. Records of annual <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> data from gauging stations along the Dutch coast show in general an increasing trend perturbed by random fluctuations. Changes in <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> are caused by natural (periodic) processes and anthropogenic effects. To examine the impact of human measures on the <b>tidal</b> <b>range,</b> the natural components are separated from the recorded <b>tidal</b> <b>range.</b> The only natural cycle significantly present in annual mean <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> records is the nodal tide with a period of 18. 6 yr and amplitudes of 0. 2 - 2. 0 %. The short-term (few years) fluctuations are qualitatively similar for different stations with individual peaks occurring at the same time. This indicates that the noisy signal is caused by regional processes and not by measurement errors (as is not expected using annual mean values). The residual <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> shows that apart from noise the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> remained constant form the early 19 th century till circa 1955. During the period 1955 - 1980 a gradual increase in <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> is observed at all stations. Although differences exist between the stations, their trends are very similar. Because the short-term and the long-term developments are similar, it is meaningful to construct an artificial average of the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> records from different stations. In this study the average of the Dutch stations and the average of the German stations are compared. The analysis shows that a similar gradually increasing trend is observed at the Dutch and German coast. The hypothesis that this trend is caused by coastal engineering in the River Rhine delta, is tested. A conceptual model is applied in which the North Sea is schematised to a rectangular basin. Estuaries with tidal prisms corresponding to Zeeland estuaries are included in this model. The model shows that the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> increases at the mouth of the estuary when it is closed. This increase decays along the Dutch coast with a typical length with an order of magnitude of 150 km. The results of the conceptual model are supported by a detailed model study incorporating the shape of the coast line and the bathymetry [LANGENDOEN, E. J. (1987) Onderzoek naar de vergroting van het tijverschil te Vlissingen. Faculteit der Civiele Techniek. Delft, TU Delft]. Both analyses suggest strong evidence that the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> is not significantly affected north of Den Helder after a closure of an estuary in the Zeeland delta. This implies that the observed trend at the Dutch and German coast does not have as common cause coastal engineering in the River Rhine delta. A satisfactory explanation for the trend since 1955 is not given in this report. However, our results suggest that the most likely cause is complex changes in the oceanic and the shelf sea system due to meteorological and astronomic changes. Analyses of tidal spectra based on hourly observations can give more insight into the processes involved. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
