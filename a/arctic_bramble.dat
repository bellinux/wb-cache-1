40|$|Morphological and yield {{differences}} between five <b>arctic</b> <b>bramble</b> (Rubus arcticus L.) strains and the cultivars Pima and Mespi were studied at two locations {{during the growing}} season 1994. Morphological observations and measurements were made on canes, leaves, flowers and berries, adapting the UPOV (Union pour la Protection des Obtentions Vegetales) descriptions for strawberry and raspberry. The plants were also compared with the aid of random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Apart from DNA, the most important distinctive characteristic was yield. Characteristics of the flowers, leaves and berries, such as number, size, shape and colour were used to differentiate between the <b>arctic</b> <b>bramble</b> genotypes. The yield of three new cultivars, named Marika, Muuruska and Elpee, was greater than that of Pima or Mespi. The yield of 'Marika' and 'Elpee' was 2, 4 -times and that of 'Muuruska' 1, 9 -times that of 'Pima' or 'Mespi'. Based on distinctive morphological characteristics, guidelines for the description of <b>arctic</b> <b>bramble</b> are proposed. This description may also be used for hybrids of <b>arctic</b> <b>bramble</b> with Rubus stellatus Sm., i. e. Rubus arcticus L. nothosubsp. stellarcticus G. Larsson. ...|$|E
50|$|Arctic wild berries are distinctively {{featured}} in Finnish cuisine with their strong flavor and high nutrient content. Traditionally, they were eaten fresh {{in summer and}} dried at other times of year. It is still quite common to go picking berries straight from the forests. Wild raspberries, bilberries and lingonberries (cowberries) are found in almost every part of Finland, while cloudberries, cranberries, <b>arctic</b> <b>brambles</b> and sea buckthorns grow in more limited areas. The intensely flavored wild strawberry (metsämansikka) is a seasonal delicacy decorating cakes, served alone, with cream, or with ice cream.|$|R
5000|$|The Coast Guard Cutters Bramble, [...] and [...] were {{selected}} to attempt a forced passage along the northern shore of Canada from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. Preparations for the difficult voyage included fitting Bramble with a stainless steel propeller and strengthening her bow to withstand tremendous pressures created by the <b>Arctic</b> ice pack. <b>Bramble</b> departed for this historic adventure from Miami on 24 May 1957 en route Seattle, Washington via the Panama Canal. On 1 July 1957 the task force departed Seattle for the Atlantic via the Bering Straits and Arctic Ocean. The ships traveled through 4500 nmi km of semi-charted water in 64 days to recross the Arctic Circle into the Atlantic. The success of the mission distinguished the three cutters as the first American surface ships to circumnavigate the North American continent. On 2 December 1957 Bramble returned to Miami.|$|R
40|$|Benzothiadiazole (BTH) induces {{resistance}} to the downy mildew pathogen, Peronospora sparsa, in <b>arctic</b> <b>bramble,</b> but {{the basis for the}} BTH-induced resistance is unknown. <b>Arctic</b> <b>bramble</b> cv. Mespi was treated with BTH to study the changes in leaf proteome and to identify proteins with a putative role in disease resistance. First, BTH induced strong expression of one PR- 1 protein isoform, which was also induced by salicylic acid (SA). The PR- 1 was responsive to BTH and exogenous SA despite a high endogenous SA content (20 – 25 µg/g fresh weight), which increased to an even higher level after treatment with BTH. Secondly, a total of 792 protein spots were detected in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, eight proteins being detected solely in the BTH-treated plants. BTH caused up- or down-regulation of 72 and 31 proteins, respectively, of which 18 were tentatively identified by mass spectrometry. The up-regulation of flavanone- 3 -hydroxylase, alanine aminotransferase, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate oxidase, PR- 1 and PR- 10 proteins may partly explain the BTH-induced resistance against P. sparsa. Other proteins with changes in intensity appear to be involved in, for example, energy metabolism and protein processing. The decline in ATP synthase, triosephosphate isomerase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase and glutamine synthetase suggests that BTH causes significant changes in primary metabolism, which provides one possible explanation for the decreased vegetative growth of foliage and rhizome observed in BTH-treated plants...|$|E

40|$|Following {{previous}} {{work on the}} anti-giardial effect of blueberry polyphenols, a range of polyphenol-rich extracts from berries and other fruits was screened {{for their ability to}} kill Giardia duodenalis, an intestinal parasite of humans. Polyphenol-rich extracts were prepared from berries using solid-phase extraction and applied to trophozoites of Giardia duodenalis grown in vitro. All berry extracts caused inhibition at 166 μg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) /ml phenol content but extracts from strawberry, <b>arctic</b> <b>bramble,</b> blackberry and cloudberry were as effective as the currently used drug, metronidazole, causing complete trophozoite mortality in vitro. Cloudberry extracts were found to be the most effective causing effectively complete trophozoite mortality at 66 μg GAE/ml. The polyphenol composition of the more effective berry extracts suggested that the presence of ellagitannins could be an important factor. However, the potency of cloudberry could be related to high ellagitannin content but also to the presence of substantial amounts of unconjugated p-coumaric acid and benzoic acid. These in vitro effects occur at concentrations easily achievable in the gut after berry ingestion and we discuss the likelihood that berry extracts could be effective anti-giardial agents in vivo. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.

40|$|Sea {{buckthorn}} (SB) {{has been}} a target of scientific investigations at the University of Turku since 1980 s. In addition to taxonomic, chemical and sensory research of the berries, their health effects have deserved special attention. Nutritional effects of both entire berries and of their oil and ethanol soluble fractions have been investigated. Many of the hypotheses were based on Eastern, especially on Chinese traditions, claims and knowledge. Berries in the Scandinavian countries, both cultivated and wild ones, are commonly regarded as health promoting food ingredients also in Finland. The major genera are Vaccinium (bilberry, lingonberry), Rubus (cloudberry, raspberry, <b>arctic</b> <b>bramble),</b> Ribes (currants), Empetrum (crowberry) and Hippophaë (sea buckthorn). Sea buckthorn berries rich in flavonoids, oil soluble antioxidants and vitamin C were shown to lower concentration of the sensitive CRP in plasma. In addition, consumption of the juice indicated increase of the ratio of HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol and elongation of the lag phase of LDL cholesterol oxidation. Berries and especially their ethanol-soluble fraction suppressed the postprandial insulin peak. It was further shown, that the bioavailability of flavonoids was increased by coincide supplementation of sea buckthorn oil. The results of consumption of SB thus indicate possible reduction {{of the risk of}} cardiovascular diseases in healthy people. Sea buckthorn seed and pulp oils have been of special interest. The very recent studies showed the unexceptionally high protective, antioxidative effects of SB oils on the isolated DNA in vitro. The same was the case with DNA of rat liver homogenate in vitro. Whether the positive effects of sea buckthorn oils on dry eyes and atopic skin have the same mechanistic background, is not known. The oils investigated have all been isolated by aseptic CO 2 extraction. vokTyrnimarjan terveysvaikutukset: Kymmenen tutkimuksen tulokset Turun yliopistost...|$|E
