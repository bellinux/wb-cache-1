5|$|In {{creating}} the half dollar, Mora used motifs evoking California {{at the time}} of statehood in 1850. The obverse depicts a Gold Rush-era prospector, kneeling. He washes material with his pan, seeking bits of placer gold. The reverse adapts the Flag of California, known as the Bear Flag, showing <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear.</b> Mora left the fields, or background, of the coin unpolished, giving the piece a textured look.|$|E

5|$|Larger {{animals are}} not as common, but are still present. <b>A</b> <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> was photographed near Cascade pass in October2010, {{and as many as}} twenty grizzlies may be living in the Cascades, south of the Canada–US border. Wolves, pine martens lynx, wolverines, cougars, weasels, and black bears are also present, and are usually {{detected}} by camera traps. During the summer, bears consume up to 30,000 calories a day in preparation for hibernation, in a dietary phase known as hyperphagia. There have also been attempts to re-introduce fishers to the region. Cougars are mainly nocturnal and solitary, and are so secretive that they are seldom seen. Wolves were eradicated from the Cascades by the 1930s, but began re-establishing resident packs at least as early as 1990.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the forest was visited by {{mountain}} men and explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger. Colter {{is the first}} white man known to have visited both the Yellowstone region and the forest, which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Colter requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the Rocky Mountains during their return journey from the Pacific Ocean. Colter teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, Colter then explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole. Colter survived <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who had taken his horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.|$|E

25|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} Fremont area began on June 6, 1795, when Mission San José was founded by the Spaniard Father Fermin de Lasuen. The Mission was established {{at the site of}} the Ohlone village of Oroysom. On their second day in the area, the Mission party killed <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> in Niles Canyon. The first English-speaking visitor to Fremont was the renowned trapper and explorer Jedediah Smith in 1827. The Mission prospered, eventually reaching a population of 1,887 inhabitants in 1831. The influence of the missionaries declined after 1834, when the Mexican government enacted secularization.|$|E
25|$|Mounting a hill near Black Eagle Falls (probably {{where the}} town of Black Eagle is today), Lewis saw that the {{cataracts}} ended and that another large river joined the Missouri {{about two and a}} half miles further upstream. Although it was very late in the afternoon, Lewis rushed forward to see this river and was attacked by <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear.</b> He ran more than 80 yards and launched himself into the Missouri River, and luckily the bear did not follow. The Lewis and Clark Expedition was forced to portage around the Great Falls, an arduous task that took nearly a month.|$|E
25|$|A 1959-1970 bear study {{suggested}} <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> {{population size}} of about 176, later revised to about 229. Later estimates have ranged {{as low as}} 136 and as high as 540; the most recent is a minimum estimate of 236, but biologists {{think there may be}} as many as 1,000 bears in the ecosystem. Although the Greater Yellowstone population is relatively close to recovery goals, the plan's definition of recovery is controversial. Thus, even though the population may be stable or possibly increasing in the short term, in the longer term, continued habitat loss, climate change, and increasing human activities may well reverse the trend.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{historical}} cases of fights between Bengal tigers and lions in captivity, {{a number of}} which were won by the tigers, others by the lions. Titus, the Roman Emperor, had Bengal tigers compelled to fight African lions, and the tigers always beat the lions. A tiger {{that belonged to the}} King of Oude, called 'Gunga', killed thirty lions, and destroyed another after being transferred to the Zoological Garden in London. A British officer saw several fights between lions and tigers, in which the tiger usually won. At the end of the 19th century, the Gaekwad of Baroda arranged a fight between a Barbary lion and a tiger from Shimla, before an audience of thousands. The Gaekwad favoured the lion, had to pay 37,000 rupees after the lion was killed by the tiger, and decided upon another competitor, that is <b>a</b> <b>Grizzly</b> <b>bear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Black bears {{generally}} {{stay out}} of grizzly territory, but grizzlies may occasionally enter black bear terrain to obtain food sources both bears enjoy, such as pine nuts, acorns, mushrooms, and berries. When a black bear sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree. Black bears are not strong competition for prey {{because they have a}} more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the differences in size, habitats, and diets of the bear species. When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself. There is at least one confirmed observation of <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> digging out, killing and eating a black bear when the latter was in hibernation.|$|E
25|$|Custer and his force {{entered the}} Black Hills from the north, {{travelling}} south {{at a slow}} pace {{of no more than}} four or five miles a day on some occasions. On July 31, 1874, the wagon train reached Harney Peak (now Black Elk Peak), and Custer together with Ludlow took three or four men to climb it. In the mean time, the rest of the expedition made camp at the mountain's base at the newly named Custer Park. While the majority of the force remained there, Custer took a small unit with him to locate a suitable site for a new fort. By August 2, 1874 this force had reached a point eight and a half miles south-east of the mountain, to a location they named Agnes Park, having had a number of peaceful encounters with Native American settlements. On August 7 Custer shot and killed <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear,</b> forever claiming this to be his greatest achievement as a hunter.|$|E
