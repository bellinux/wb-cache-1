5|$|Another <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> for Rubin was the {{phenomenon}} of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the rotation {{of the rest of the}} galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E

The algorithms for automatic detection of defects, trained on existing images database with a machine learning software, are able to identify various elements: texture irregularities, pitot probes, rivets, openings, text, defects, corrosion, oil stains. A damage report is sent on the operator's touch pad with each <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and the proposed classification with a probability percentage. After reviewing the images, the verdict is pronounced by a qualified inspector.|$|E

5|$|Leoš Janáček's {{literary}} legacy {{represents an}} important illustration of his life, public work and art between 1875 and 1928. He contributed {{not only to}} music journals, but wrote essays, reports, reviews, feuilletons, articles and books. His {{work in this area}} comprises around 380 individual items. His writing changed over time, and appeared in many genres. Nevertheless, the critical and theoretical sphere remained his main <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is in {{assessing}} whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better}} than Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|Only {{insects that}} live in nests or colonies {{demonstrate}} any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or homing. This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometers' distance. In a phenomenon known as philopatry, insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location {{up to a year}} after last viewing the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the monarch butterfly).|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Julia trace {{back to a}} {{vigorous}} tropical wave, or an equatorward low-pressure area, which emerged into the Atlantic along the western coast of Africa on September11. At the time, the system maintained deep convection and strong easterly winds, prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to commence tracking the system as an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> As the wave moved generally westward at 10 to 15mph (16 to 24km/h), a quick increase in organization {{as well as a}} significant drop in surface pressure became notable. The system continued to organize, and several hours later, the NHC noted only a slight increase would suffice {{for the development of a}} tropical cyclone. By September12, a tropical depression developed, and the NHC initiated advisories at 1500UTC that day. At the time, the cyclone was situated 250mi (400km) southeast of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in cancer research today.|$|E

25|$|All the {{above-mentioned}} methods involve recording tilt series {{of a given}} specimen field. This inevitably results in the summation of a high dose of reactive electrons through the sample and the accompanying destruction of fine detail during recording. The technique of low-dose (minimal-dose) imaging is therefore regularly applied to mitigate this effect. Low-dose imaging is performed by deflecting illumination and imaging regions simultaneously away from the optical axis to image an adjacent region to the area to be recorded (the high-dose region). This area is maintained centered during tilting and refocused before recording. During recording the deflections are removed so that the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is exposed to the electron beam only for the duration required for imaging. An improvement of this technique (for objects resting on a sloping substrate film) is to have two symmetrical off-axis regions for focusing followed by setting focus to {{the average of the}} two high-dose focus values before recording the low-dose <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
25|$|A large <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in {{nanomedicine}} is the {{transdermal patch}} {{because of the}} possibility of a painless application of therapeutic agents with very few side effects. Transdermal patches have been limited to administer a small number of drugs, such as nicotine, because of the limitations in permeability of the skin. Development of techniques that increase skin permeability has led to more drugs that can be applied via transdermal patches and more options for patients.|$|E
