5|$|Although {{most of the}} defences were {{in place}} by the time of Ranulph's death in 1232, there were no living quarters, and neither were there on the death of Ranulph's {{successor}} John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> as a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey.|$|E

5|$|Ames and {{his family}} resided in the house briefly, the Connecticut College {{acquired}} the house in 1949 <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> for faculty housing until 1986. The house {{was in a state}} of disrepair by 1989 and was a hazard due to its construction with asbestos panels. It was slated to be demolished, but Ms. Hendrickson rallied supporter to the save the house after uncovering its history.

5|$|At Christchurch, he {{reduced the}} number of canons serving the church from 25 to 13, through not {{replacing}} clerks who died. Ranulf kept the revenues that would have gone to the missing canons <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to rebuild the church. Some medieval sources claim that in rebuilding the church at Twynham, he not only demolished the church he was replacing, but nine others that were nearby.|$|E
5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E

Over a period of several months in 1909 the building was moved to the Briarcliff Lodge property, where it was adjacent to the Lodge's laundry building. When the Lodge was the campus of King's College from 1955 to 1994, the school called the former boarding house Harmony Hall <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> for classrooms and staff housing.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s, Dælenenga was {{dominated}} by the Workers' Sports Federation (AIF) and served as its main stadium in Oslo. AIF's Grünerløkka chapter was established at Dælenenga <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> as its training ground. Dælenenga was used for major AIF tournaments and the largest tournament took place 5 July 1929, with 500 participants.

5|$|Early on 10 June {{another group}} of thirty-one men arrived at the 9th Parachute Battalion position. These and other stragglers, who had arrived through the night, brought the {{battalion}} strength to around 270 men.

Shortly afterwards the battalion killed around fifty Germans, who had started digging defences {{in full view of the}} British position. Then 'A' Company ambushed a German patrol, causing several casualties. That afternoon a strong force of Germans occupied the Château <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> as a base to start an infantry and self propelled gun assault on the British battalion. With no mortar ammunition left, the British had to use their PIATs and machine-guns to stop the attack.|$|E

5|$|English chemist John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers from 1863 to 1866 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar {{physical and chemical properties}} recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music. This so termed Law of Octaves, however, was ridiculed by Newlands' contemporaries, and the Chemical Society refused to publish his work. Newlands was nonetheless able to draft a table of the elements <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to predict the existence of missing elements, such as germanium. The Chemical Society only acknowledged the significance of his discoveries five years after they credited Mendeleev.|$|E
