25|$|Some {{members of}} the Singapore opposition, {{including}} the Singapore Democratic Party, conducted a protest rally and march on 16 September 2006. The so-called Empower Singaporeans Rally and March was set to start at 11 <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park but was refused to continue to other planned stops at Parliament House, Suntec City, and the Istana. On 11 September, {{it was reported that}} the police had started an investigation against these protest plans. The police reportedly had denied two applications for the planned peaceful protest and therefore confiscated leaflets that were handed out at Raffles City. Dr. Chee Soon Juan, of the Singapore Democratic Party, held a speech at Hong Lim Park. On 17 September, the protesters announced that they would continue their protest until Tuesday morning, 19 September, after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's speech before the WB-IMF meeting.|$|E

They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you doing over here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. I know where I <b>am</b> <b>at.</b> <b>The</b> coach has put me in three times already and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E

500|$|Through {{the summer}} siege, illness {{spread through the}} British camps. [...] In August, Wolfe himself was bedridden, causing already low morale to slump even further among the British troops. With many men in camp hospitals, British {{fighting}} numbers were thinned, and Wolfe personally felt that a new attack was needed {{by the end of}} September, or Britain's opportunity would be lost. In addition, his frustration with Montcalm's defensive stance continued to grow. In a letter to his mother, Wolfe wrote, [...] "The Marquis of Montcalm is {{at the head of a}} great number of bad soldiers, and I <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of a small number of good ones that wish for nothing so much as to fight him; but the wary old fellow avoids an action, doubtful of the behaviour of his army." [...] Montcalm also expressed frustration over the long siege, relating that he and his troops slept clothed and booted, and his horse was always saddled in preparation for an attack.|$|E

500|$|To the north, the 2nd Infantry Brigade, {{who began}} their advance from Biefvillers over ground which favoured the defenders. The brigade had {{artillery}} support, {{in contrast to}} their fellow brigade to the south, as well as 23 tanks, although these were delayed. The 1st Battalion, Canterbury Regiment, {{one of the two}} leading battalions, made good progress and reached their objective for the day by 7:00 <b>am,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intersection of the Albert and Arras Roads. The other leading battalion was the 1st Otago, who struggled. The tanks supporting the Otago men caught up with the advancing infantry but misidentified them as Germans and opened fire. Once this instance of friendly fire was identified, the tanks then began engaging the Germans but were soon knocked out. By then, the tanks had provided the 1st Otago Battalion the opportunity to reach their objective for the day, the Arras Road. They managed to link up with the 37th Division on their left although not with the 1st Canterbury Battalion on their right. To fill the gap, Brigadier General Young ordered up the 2nd Canterbury Battalion and all three battalions consolidated their positions. The German 111th Division attempted to mount a counterattack later in the day but the massing troops were spotted and attacked by British reconnaissance aircraft. The Germans were caught by an artillery barrage covering a hastily arranged advance, to begin at 6:30 pm, by the New Zealanders and the 37th Division. This easier advance cleared Monument Wood and the southern reaches of the village of Favreuil by the conclusion of the day. Among the 2nd Infantry Brigade there were nearly 500 killed, wounded or missing for the day [...] such that the 2nd would play no further role in the battle. Although the planned envelopment of Bapaume had not happened, the day's action resulted in the capture of over 400 prisoners of war along with many machine guns and an artillery piece.|$|E

Noticing that one of the Aramaic {{languages}} translates Spirit as Rucha, a female entity, Merezhkovsky interpreted the Holy Trinity as Father and Son's unity in the higher being, their common godly Mother. It is the latter's Kingdom Come that the Third Testament was supposed to lead to. Seeing both God and man as intrinsically unisexual, Merezhkovsky regarded a male/female schism to be a symptom of imperfection, the cause for primal human being's fatal disintegration.|$|E
