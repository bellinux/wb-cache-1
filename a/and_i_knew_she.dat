60|$|Then I saw {{his wife}} signing to him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to be}} left alone with me.|$|E
60|$|We quarrelled about Havanas--we fought o'er a good cheroot, <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> is exacting, and {{she says}} I am a brute.|$|E
50|$|There's a Burma girl a-settin', <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> thinks o' me".|$|R
3000|$|My {{principal}} {{asked me}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> has confidence in me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am supported from {{my colleagues and}} they trust me. (T. D) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she's</b> of New England ancestry, {{she told}} me so. What I can't make out is, why she joined the I.W.W. That seems so contradictory." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw my mother's lips move, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was murmuring {{a thanksgiving}} {{to the power}} which had {{preserved}} her husband and son through the late struggle.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's so VERY dark," [...] she answered, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> {{had taken}} it. [...] "I can hardly see a step, and poor Mr. March with his glasses--I don't know what he'll do." ...|$|E
6000|$|For a second, perhaps, {{we faced}} {{one another in}} stark understanding. [...] . Then she plumped back to the chest of drawers, and her wet pocket-handkerchief, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> sought refuge from my {{relentless}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|THE PRINCESS. Oh, {{something}} she did. I am {{sure she had}} never done it before; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> would never have done it again, she was so truly contrite and nice about it.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> will {{shine on}} a lady of witchcraft, [...] Gladness and grief to see, [...] Who has taken my heart with her nimble fingers, [...] Calls {{in my dreams}} to me: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} is!" [...] said Charmian. [...] "Everybody works too {{hard at the}} Synthesis. It's {{the ideal of the}} place. We woke her out of a nap, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> was tired to death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea, yea," [...] {{she said}} (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was nodding her head sagaciously); I {{looked out at}} the room window, but all I could see was a man {{wheeling}} an empty barrow down the brae.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} what I had seen, and while I spoke {{she put on her}} bonnet, and I exulted, thinking--and then she took off her bonnet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would not go away with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} anybody that thinks {{now that the}} oil-belt don't extend up this way, I should like to have them come up and take a squint at 'The Harnett.' She's {{spouting}} like a daisy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would, from the first," [...] said Bob, as he came in to breakfast next morning, after having worked all night, his joy so great {{that he did not}} even feel the fatigue.|$|E
6000|$|... "On the avenue, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> {{lives in}} the {{neighborhood}} somewhere, because she was shopping here on the avenue, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could have easily followed her home {{if she had not}} taken the Elevated for down town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Aunt Josephine," [...] said Diana, gasping with laughter. [...] "Oh, Anne, it was Aunt Josephine, however {{she came}} to be there. Oh, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> will be furious. It's dreadful--it's really dreadful--but did you ever know {{anything}} so funny, Anne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never!' {{said the}} girl passionately. 'I shall never do that. Nobody knows that better than Miss Wade, though she taunts me because she has made me her dependent. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am so; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is overjoyed when she can bring it to my mind.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was in a}} {{very bad}} humour with myself as I went off to see about having the well cleaned out. I had {{offended}} Gussie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would not be easily appeased. Nor was she. For a week she kept me politely, studiously, at a distance, {{in spite of my}} most humble advances. Rev. Carroll was a frequent caller, ostensibly to make arrangements about a Sunday school they were organizing in a poor part of the community. Gussie and he held long conversations on this enthralling subject. Then Gussie went on another visit to her friend, and when she came back so did Rev. Carroll.|$|E
60|$|We worked feverishly at {{carrying}} our plunder on {{deck and}} depositing it amidships, so feverishly that Maud, whose strength {{was hardly a}} positive quantity, had to give over, exhausted, {{and sit on the}} steps at the break of the poop. This did not serve to recover her, and she lay on her back, on the hard deck, arms stretched out, and whole body relaxed. It was a trick I remembered of my sister, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would soon be herself again. I knew, also, that weapons would not come in amiss, and I re-entered Wolf Larsenâ€™s state-room to get his rifle and shot-gun. I spoke to him, but he made no answer, though his head was still rocking from side to side and he was not asleep.|$|E
6000|$|To my astonishment {{his face}} brightened. [...] "Yes," [...] said he, [...] "that's it!--I'm of no account! But I always knew it. You see I thought Rattler loved that girl {{as well as}} I did, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> liked him better than she did me, and would be happier I dare say with him. But then I knew that old Robins would have {{preferred}} me to him, as I was better off--and the girl would do as he said--and, you see, I thought I was kinder in the way--and so I left. But," [...] he continued, as I was about to interrupt him, [...] "for fear the old man might object to Rattler, I've lent him enough to set him up in business for himself in Dogtown. A pushing, active, brilliant fellow, you know, like Rattler can get along, and will soon be in his old position again--and you needn't be hard on him, you know, if he doesn't. Good-by." ...|$|E
60|$|GERALD. My {{mother is}} awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> doesn't think <b>I</b> am educated {{enough to be}} your secretary. She is {{perfectly}} right, too. I was fearfully idle when I was at school, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't pass an examination now to save my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "My mother {{ought to}} have known my father better," [...] she {{declared}} sullenly. [...] "I must not criticize her judgment, for her memory is my most precious possession <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> loved me devotedly. But {{there is one thing}} in her history I can never understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; no one!" [...] she exclaimed, {{accepting}} the platitude {{as if it}} were now uttered for the first time. She dried her eyes and smiled. [...] "I will tell Mrs. Bowen how you feel and what you've said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> will appreciate your generosity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, once, {{when we were}} {{crossing}} to Ireland and nurse wouldn't let Wilfred tie our handkerchiefs together and fish over the side, {{and he was very}} angry, and threw her parasol into the sea when she wasn't looking; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would be so cross, that when she asked me if I knew what was become of it, I said 'No,' and thought I didn't, really. But then it came over me, again and again, that I had told a story, and, oh! I was so miserable whenever I thought of it--at church, and saying my prayers, you know; and mamma was poorly, and couldn't come to us at night for ever so long, but at last I could bear it no longer, I heard her say, 'Mysie is always truthful,' and then I did get it out, and told her. And, oh! she and papa were so kind, and they did quite and entirely forgive me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said he, [...] "that's it!--I'm of no account! But I {{always knew}} it. You see, I thought Rattler loved that girl {{as well as}} I did, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> liked him better than she did me, and would be happier, I dare say, with him.

6000|$|I shall always {{remember}} {{the morning he}} came. It so happened that the night before I had been present at a rather cheery little supper, and I was feeling pretty rocky. On top of this I was trying {{to read a book}} Florence Craye had given me. She {{had been one of the}} house-party at Easeby, and two or three days before I left we had got engaged. I was due back at the end of the week, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would expect me to have finished the book by then. You see, she was particularly keen on boosting me up a bit nearer her own plane of intellect. She was a girl with a wonderful profile, but steeped to the gills in serious purpose. I can't give you a better idea of the way things stood than by telling you that the book she'd given me to read was called [...] "Types of Ethical Theory," [...] and that when I opened it at random I struck a page beginning:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl hesitated. [...] "I don't think I {{ought to}} tell you all she said and did. It was really a private {{interview}} between us two, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> would not {{want me to say}} much about it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> don't think you would want to hear everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{let her go}} on the bond," [...] he said at last; [...] "it's splendid of her, but if {{she does}} {{that she will be}} kept here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is crazy to get away, and we must not let her any deeper into this muss of mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am doing}} it entirely on Mrs. Deering's I account," [...] said my wife that evening after tea, {{as we walked}} down the side-street that descended from our place to Broadway. [...] "She has that girl on her hands, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> must be at her wits' end." ...|$|R
60|$|Eustace was {{restless and}} vexed at not being called upon, and anxious to show himself on any occasion, and I was almost equally anxious {{to keep him}} back, {{out of reach of}} mortification. Both he and Harold went to London on business, leaving Dora with me. The charge was less severe than I expected. My first {{attempts}} at teaching her had been frustrated by her scorn of me, and by Harold's baffling indulgence; but one day, when they had been visiting one of the farms, the children had been made to exhibit their acquirements, which were quite sufficient to manifest Dora's ignorance. Eustace had long declared that if she would not learn of me she must either have a governess or go to school, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was fit for neither. Harold, I believe, now enforced the threat, and when he went away, left her a black silk necktie to be hemmed for him, and a toy book with flaming illustrations, with an assurance that on her reading it to him on his return, depended his giving her a toy steam-engine.|$|E
6000|$|And so {{they went}} on chatting, and poor Marget forgot her sorrow for one little while, anyway. It was {{probably}} the only really bright and cheery hour she had known lately. I saw she liked Philip, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would. And {{when he told her}} he was studying for the ministry I could see that she liked him better than ever. And then, when he promised to get her admitted to the jail so that she could see her uncle, that was the capstone. He said he would give the guards a little present, and she must always go in the evening after dark, and say nothing, [...] "but just show this paper and pass in, and show it again when you come out"--and he scribbled some queer marks on the paper and gave it to her, and she was ever so thankful, and right away was in a fever for the sun to go down; for in that old, cruel time prisoners were not allowed to see their friends, and sometimes they spent years in the jails without ever seeing a friendly face. I judged that the marks on the paper were an enchantment, and that the guards would not know what they were doing, nor have any memory of it afterward; and that was indeed the way of it. Ursula put her head in at the door now and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{not believe}} me, Richard, when I say that Miss Dolly ate but little after that, and her colour {{came and went}} like the red of a stormy sunset at sea. 'Here's this dog Richard come to spill all our chances,' I swore to myself. The company had been prodigiously entertained by the tale, and clamoured for more, and when Horry had done I told how you had fought me at Annapolis, and had saved my life. But Miss Manners sat very still, biting her lip, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was sadly vexed that you had not gone to her in Arlington Street. For a woman will reason thus," [...] said his Lordship, winking wisely. [...] "But I more than {{suspected}} something to have happened, so I asked Horry to send his fellow Favre over to the Star and Garter {{to see if you}} were there, tho' I was of three minds to let you go to the devil. You should have seen her face when he came back to say that you had been for three weeks in a Castle Yard sponging-house! Then Horry said he would lend me his coach, and when it was brought around Miss Manners took our breaths by walking downstairs and into it, nor would she listen to a word of the objections cried by my Lady Pembroke and the rest. You must know there is no stopping the beauty when she has made her mind. And while they were all chattering on the steps I jumped in, and off we drove, and you will be the most talked-of man in London to-morrow. I give you Miss Manners!" [...] cried his Lordship, as he ended.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{people would}} fancy so," [...] said his companion, [...] "Lily {{will have a}} good deal of money, by and by, and she is very young. Atterly has nothing but an {{unprofitable}} farm; but he is an honest lad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is very fond of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, indeed I have not," [...] {{repeated}} Margaret, {{struggling to}} retain the unbidden tear which seemed ready to burst out on the slightest occasion. [...] "Do but say to the lady that your brother's god-daughter desires earnestly to speak to her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> will not refuse to see me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure we don't like Jonas {{any more}} than you do, Vincent; but you see mamma has to depend upon him so much. No, I don't think she can like it; but you can't have {{everything}} you like in a man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> thinks he is a very good overseer. I suppose she could get another?" ...|$|R
