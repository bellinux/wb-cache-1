5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E

25|$|Match {{reports were}} scarce in the 1750s but were {{becoming}} {{more common in the}} 1760s and it is known that Hampshire defeated Kent at Broadhalfpenny in 1768, their outstanding batsman John Small scoring more than 140 runs in the match. Scores were higher then than in earlier times and matches were tending to go into a second day. In 1770, a Sussex lawyer called John Baker left an account in his diary of a match between Hambledon and the Surrey club Coulsdon which lasted two days. Baker came from Chichester, a journey of twenty miles taking four hours on horseback. He wrote how he went to Petersfield for overnight accommodation. Baker wrote <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> large crowds which gathered at these matches and the good business done by vendors on site.|$|E

Due to the tight shooting schedule, Wan could not afford to shoot {{more than a couple of}} takes per actor. [...] "It was a really tough struggle for me. Every day, it was me fighting to get the shots I did not get. I had high aspirations, but there's only so much you can do.

500|$|Four {{proposed}} redesigns {{were submitted}} to the General Board on 3 June 1918, along with a letter that requested a formal reconsideration by the Navy that the Lexingtons be armored to protect them only against fire of guns [...] and under. The Board, concerned about the delay incorporating any of the redesigns would have on not just the Lexingtons but the 1916 building program {{in general and the}} subsequent cost, declined all four designs. The Board also feared that producing heavily armored fast battleships such as Hood would make the U.S. Navy's Standard type battleships obsolete, just as HMS Dreadnought made the Royal Navy's pre-dreadnought battleships obsolescent and negated its advantage in numbers over other navies. This did not stop the U.S. Commander in Chief in European waters, Admiral William S. Sims, to argue for the redesigned vessels by pointing out that Hood had already brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> revolution that the Board wished to suppress. [...] Debate continued while the project remained suspended until May 1919, when the Board decided that the battlecruisers should be built as planned, except for a slightly slower version of Design B from C with increased protection for turrets, conning towers, magazines and communications. This amended version, labeled B3, was {{the final version of the}} Lexington battlecruiser design.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{weakness}} of the coupling of gravity to matter, gravitational waves experience very little absorption or scattering, even as they travel over astronomical distances. In particular, gravitational waves are expected to be unaffected by the opacity of the very early universe. In these early phases, space had not yet become [...] "transparent," [...] so observations based upon light, radio waves, and other electromagnetic radiation that far back into time are limited or unavailable. Therefore, gravitational waves are expected in principle to have the potential to provide a wealth of observational data <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> early universe.|$|E

2500|$|Williams was {{the subject}} of a media and press furore in February 2008, {{following}} a lecture he gave to the Temple Foundation at the Royal Courts of Justice on the subject of [...] "Islam and English Law".

He also argued that theology has a place in debates <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> nature of law [...] "however hard our culture may try to keep it out" [...] and noted that there is, in a [...] "dominant human rights philosophy", a reluctance to acknowledge the liberty of conscientious objection. He spoke of [...] "supplementary jurisdictions" [...] to that of the civil law. Noting the anxieties which the word sharia provoked in the West, he drew attention to the fact that there was a debate within Islam between what he called [...] "primitivists" [...] for whom, for instance, apostasy should still be punishable and those Muslims who argued that sharia was a developing system of Islamic jurisprudence and that such a view was no longer acceptable. He made comparisons with Orthodox Jewish practice (beth din) and with the recognition of the exercise of conscience of Christians.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Heelers creator/producer, Hal McElroy, {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} Blue Heelers when he heard that an eighteen-year-old friend was planning to become a police officer. Intrigued, he inquired as to why this young boy, fresh out of school, would {{want to become a}} police officer, as opposed to the many other opportunities he had open to him. McElroy soon discovered that, at the time, a staggering 60% of Australian police officers were under the age of 26. This, coupled with McElroy's desire to create a country cop show, formed the basis of the programme. When this same young officer left the force only a year later due to the shooting death of his colleague, McElroy was even more intrigued to learn <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> fickle, yet rewarding job of policing the community. McElroy continued his quest by asking ex-police officer Michael Winter to write down {{what it was like to}} be a city cop who transferred to a country town. These became the ideas that Blue Heelers was based around. Michael Winter also {{conceived the}} name of the programme by recounting the common names for a country police officer: [...] "tyre-biters"â€”referring to the fact that country cops are often involved in car chasesâ€”and [...] "blue heelers"â€”referring to their blue uniforms and overall similar appearance and persona to a Blue Heeler dog, a protective and intuitive breed of Australian dog. From the time that McElroy's idea was initially conceived, to the time the programme was ready to air, three years passed.|$|E
