5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} had reached such <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully {{argued that the}} Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown {{have argued that the}} pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E

However, they enjoyed Musso to <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> they recast him {{as the voice of}} the character Jeremy Johnson; although Musso no longer voices a title character, his new role allows him more lines. Sangster himself is a British actor and was among several cast members hired that hailed from England.

5|$|In January 2013, a {{privilege}} escalation exploit {{was discovered in}} the Windows kernel that can allow unsigned code to run under Windows RT; the exploit involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by Microsoft to debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow unsigned code to execute (by default, it is set to <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> only allows code signed by Microsoft to execute). Alongside his explanation of the exploit, the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft urging them to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for technical reasons, and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the exploit does not pose a security threat because it requires administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, Microsoft has still indicated that the exploit would be patched in a future update.|$|E
5|$|Samantha Claire Taylor {{was born}} in Amersham, Buckinghamshire on 25 September 1975, {{as part of a}} {{sporting}} family: her father played rugby, and her mother played hockey. She attended Dolphin School in Hurst, Berkshire, where she initially played softball, participating as the only girl in the school team. Taylor did not play cricket until a summer camp at the age of 13, but thereafter improved to such <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> she captained the Dolphin School cricket team, playing alongside the boys. She subsequently moved to The Abbey School, Reading for a short time, and finally Kendrick School. Although she primarily played hockey as a teenager, at which she represented England at Under-17 and Under-19 as a forward, she began playing women's county cricket for Thames Valley, making her debut for the side in May 1993.|$|E
5|$|The French {{opened fire}} on the forts of Salé at 10:00a.m., and the Moroccans retaliated {{instantly}} with forty batteries of artillery weapons.

The French fire intensified, but at 3:30p.m., the damaged batteries {{were removed from the}} city by Moroccan forces; however, resistance did not stop until 5:00p.m. Sané and Gomer, lacking for ammunition, withdrew from the battle, while Henri IV continued its barrage on the city until 7:00a.m. the next morning.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, it was nature, not {{political}} maneuvering, {{that led to}} the filling of New Melones Lake. The winter and spring rainy season of 1982 was one of the wettest recorded in the 20th century. The Stanislaus River swelled to such high levels that it exceeded what could be safely released through the dam's outlets, and the reservoir rapidly surpassed the temporary limit. The winter of 1983 was even wetter and pushed water so high that it reached the lip of the emergency spillway (but did not flow over it), <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> has not been surpassed since. With the lake full, the state of California lifted the temporary limit in March, 1983. A deciding factor in the rescinding of the water-level limit was the prevention of $50 million in damages by New Melones Dam in 1982 and 1983, which demonstrated the dam's value for flood control.|$|E
5|$|When {{the game}} was renamed and changed platforms, the team chose Luminous Studio as the main game engine. The game's {{real-time}} graphics used 5,000 polygons per-frame, bringing its visual quality close to modern CGI cutscenes and to <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> {{would have been impossible}} for the previous generation's hardware. The game's native resolution was 1920 × 1080 pixels (1080p), with a frame rate of 30 frames per second: this was defined as being native to the game as opposed to upscaled games from the previous generation. For polygon models, the combined number of visible and occluded polygons was estimated as being 5,000,000. This number was approximately five times the amount of equivalent detail from last-generation games. Models used over 600 character bones: 150 bones were created for the face, 300 for the hair, and 150 for the body. A bone-based physical simulation technology was applied so that clothing would react to the body's movements. The polygon count for character hair was estimated as 20,000, the same number used in an entire character in last-generation games. All of these were achievable {{due to the fact that}} the eighth-generation console hardware had approximately sixteen times the amount of storage available in the previous generation.|$|E
