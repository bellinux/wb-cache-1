60|$|Various persons may {{concur in}} the same measure on various grounds. They may be various, without being {{contrary}} to or exclusive of each other. I thought the insolent, unprovoked aggression of the Regicide upon our ally of Holland <b>a</b> good <b>ground</b> of <b>war.</b> I think his manifest attempt to overturn the balance of Europe <b>a</b> good <b>ground</b> of <b>war.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> good <b>ground</b> of <b>war</b> I consider his declaration of war on his Majesty and his kingdom. But though I have taken all these to my aid, I consider them {{as nothing more than}} as a sort of evidence to indicate the treasonable mind within. Long before their acts of aggression and their declaration of war, the faction in France had assumed a form, had adopted a body of principles and maxims, and had regularly and systematically acted on them, by which she virtually had put herself in a posture which was in itself a declaration of war against mankind.|$|R

25|$|Operation Barrel Roll was {{a covert}} U.S. Air Force 2nd Air Division (later the Seventh Air Force) and U.S. Navy Task Force 77, interdiction and {{close air support}} {{campaign}} conducted in the Kingdom of Laos between 14 December 1964 and 29 March 1973 concurrent with the Vietnam War. The initial purpose of the operation was {{to serve as a}} signal to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) to cease its support for the insurgency then taking place in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam).

5000|$|During World War II, {{there was}} an air battle waged against the Sakishima Islands' two largest islands that lasted for 82 days in order to {{neutralize}} Kamikaze airfields.

This was the least publicized battle for its size that took place involving the Americans and British during the war. The thirty-two thousand seasoned Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and Naval (IJN) troops on Miyako did not surrender until 27 days after Japan formally surrendered. The amount of ordnance expended against the Sakishima Islands may have exceeded the ordnance spent on the island of Iwo Jima.

5000|$|Michael Chabon, {{occasionally}} {{an author}} of speculative fiction, contributed to the genre with his 2007 novel The Yiddish Policemen's Union. This book explores {{a world in which}} the State of Israel was destroyed in its infancy and many of the world's Jews instead live in a small strip of Alaska set aside by the US government for Jewish settlement. The story follows a Jewish detective solving a murder case in the Yiddish-speaking semi-autonomous city state of Sitka. Stylistically, Chabon borrows heavily from the noir and detective fiction genres, while exploring social issues related to Jewish history and culture. Apart from the alternate history of the Jews and Israel, Chabon also plays with other common tropes of AH Fiction; in the book, Germany actually loses the war even harder than they did in reality, getting hit with a nuclear bomb instead of just simply losing <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>war</b> (subverting the common [...] "what if Germany won WWII?" [...] trope).|$|E
5000|$|On 8 February 1904 destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy {{launched}} a surprise {{attack on the}} Russian Far East Fleet anchored in Port Arthur; three ships - two battleships and a cruiser - were damaged in the attack. The Russo-Japanese war had thus begun. Japan's first objective was to secure its lines of communication and supply to the Asian mainland, enabling it to conduct <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>war</b> in Manchuria. To achieve this, {{it was necessary to}} neutralize Russian naval power in the Far East. At first, the Russian naval forces remained inactive and did not engage the Japanese, who staged unopposed landings in Korea. The Russians were revitalised by the arrival of Admiral Stepan Makarov and were able to achieve some degree of success against the Japanese, but on 13 April Makarov's flagship, the battleship [...] struck a mine; Makarov was among the dead. His successors failed to challenge the Japanese Navy, and the Russians were effectively bottled up in their base at Port Arthur.|$|E

Muga said {{there should have been}} variation amongst certificates of canvass. UNA campaign manager Toby Tiangco said that the percentages couldn't be the same for every place in the Philippines; meanwhile, Team PNoy spokesperson Miro Quimbo said that it [...] "is a result of a great message campaign led by the President himself and <b>an</b> aggressive <b>ground</b> <b>war</b> pursued by local parties allied with the President."

5000|$|Opposition {{to the war}} turns militant and the counter-culture {{rises to}} its peak: 92,000 {{soldiers}} were declared deserters, with tens of thousand fleeing to Canada, France and Sweden; thousands of soldiers organize and participate in Armed Forces Day demonstrations at 19 military bases on May 15, 1971; drug use is rampant and underground radio networks flourish in Vietnam [...] as Black and white soldiers increasingly identify with the antiwar and Black liberation movements; combat refusals and fragging of officers in Vietnam are epidemic. Thousands are jailed for refusing to fight or simply defying military authority, and nearly every U.S. military prison {{in the world is}} hit by riots. Jane Fonda’s antiwar revue, The F.T.A. Show, tours military bases and is cheered by tens of thousands of soldiers; the Pentagon concludes that over half the ground troops openly oppose the war and shifts its combat strategy from <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>war</b> to an air war; the Navy and Air Force are both riddled with mutinies and acts of sabotage. VVAW holds the Winter Soldier Investigation, exposing American war crimes through the testimony of veterans, and stages the most dramatic demonstration of the Vietnam era as hundreds of veterans hurl their medals onto the Capitol steps.|$|E

Evidence is destroyed just before he gets his hands on it, the police redact documents so as to denude them of value. Then, just in the nick of time, a confidential source or secret document arrives. In that sense, the book moves right along, from cliffhanger to cliffhanger." [...] Carr wrote that [...] "There is so much excess and human pathology on display here, it makes Bonfire of the Vanities seem restrained." [...] Carr also criticized the book's subtitle, writing that [...] "...the truth never catches up with Murdoch. True enough, he loves newspapering and has been known to become deeply involved in editorial matters, but no real case is made that he knew the specifics of how his papers were coming up with very private facts about public figures." [...] Carr concludes by opining that [...] "It is, in the best way, an old story. A lone gunslinger takes on a dishonest town, and in the end the bad guys flee. It is both more complicated and a bit less satisfying in reality, but that would be another book, and probably a less enjoyable one." ...|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of Rolling Thunder, American airbases and {{facilities}} needed to be constructed and manned for the aerial effort. The defense of those bases would not be entrusted to the South Vietnamese. So, on March 8, 1965, 3,500 United States Marines came ashore at Da Nang as {{the first wave of}} U.S. combat troops into South Vietnam, adding to the 25,000 U.S. military advisers already in place. On May 5 the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade became the first U.S. Army ground unit committed to the conflict in South Vietnam. On August 18, Operation Starlite began as the first major U.S. <b>ground</b> operation, destroying <b>an</b> NLF stronghold in Quảng Ngãi Province.

50|$|Yoyogi Park {{is one of}} {{the largest}} parks in Tokyo, located in the centre of Shibuya {{directly}} south of Meiji Shrine.

5000|$|<b>As</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>war</b> in Korea ended, Eisenhower sharply {{reduced the}} {{reliance}} on expensive Army divisions, and favored much cheaper nuclear weapons as a deterrent. Historian Saki Dockrill argues that his long-term strategy was to promote the collective security of NATO and other American allies, strengthen the Third World against Soviet pressures, avoid another Korea, and produce a climate that would slowly and steadily weaken Soviet power and influence. Dockrill points to Eisenhower's use of multiple assets against the Soviet Union: Eisenhower knew that the United States had many other assets that could be translated into influence over the Soviet bloc—its democratic values and institutions, its rich and competitive capitalist economy, its intelligence technology and skills in obtaining information as to the enemy's capabilities and intentions, its psychological warfare and covert operations capabilities, its negotiating skills, and its economic and military assistance to the Third World.|$|R

500|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} operation was {{to serve as a}} signal to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) to cease its support for the insurgency then taking place in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). This action was taken within Laos due to the location of North Vietnam's expanding logistical corridor known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese), which ran from southwestern North Vietnam, through southeastern Laos, and into South Vietnam. The campaign then centered on the interdiction of that logistical system. Beginning during the same time frame (and expanding throughout the conflict) the operation became increasingly involved in providing close air support missions for Royal Lao Armed Forces, CIA-backed tribal mercenaries, and Thai Volunteer Defense Corps in <b>a</b> covert <b>ground</b> <b>war</b> in northern and northeastern Laos.
