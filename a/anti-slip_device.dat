50|$|The Working at Height Regulations {{came into}} force in 2005 {{and does not}} ban ladders but merely restricts their use to safe methods, i.e. foot it by person or with a ladderstopper:4.2.2. The feet of {{portable}} ladders must be prevented from slipping during use by securing the stiles at or near their upper or lower ends, by any <b>anti-slip</b> <b>device</b> or by any other arrangement of equivalent effectiveness. Ladders used for access must be long enough to protrude sufficiently beyond the access platform, unless other measures {{have been taken to}} ensure a firm handhold. Interlocking ladders and extension ladders must be used so that the different sections are prevented from moving relative to one another. Mobile ladders must be prevented from moving before they are stepped on.|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} for effective preventive strategies for slips and falls in growing. Much {{remains to be}} done however to prevent slips and falls in the traffic environment. Using an appropriate <b>anti-slip</b> <b>device</b> may reduce the risk of slips and falls on different surfaces outdoors during winter. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the best anti-slip devices of different designs in the Swedish market on a larger group of healthy individuals in different ages on five slippery surfaces as a way to develop a standard method to test anti-slip devices. Evaliuations were done according to subject's perceived walking safety and balance,videorecordings of walking postures and movements,time to take on and off each anti-slip device,advantages and disadvantages and list of priorities for own use. A heel device was preceived to be the most safe on all five surfaces. It was perceived as the most rapid to take on and off and had the highest priority according to walking safety,walking balance and choice f...|$|E
40|$|Injuries from fall {{accident}} on icy or snowy surfaces are frequently occurring in Sweden, 25 - 30 000 per year. This means 2 - 3 injuries/ 1000 inhabitants needing medical care {{are expected to}} occur in Sweden every year. Similar proportions exist in other northerly located countries such as Finland, Norway, Japan, Canada and so on. Outdoor activities are essential for a healthy life, therefore the prevention of slip and fall accidents are important. An intervention study has been performed during Feb-April 2008 among healthy subjects in northern Sweden. The subjects have been divided into three groups: an Intervention Group (N= 25), a Control Group (N= 25) and a Comparison Group (N= 17) with similar distribution of gender and age. The intervention group were equipped with one of three different types of <b>anti-slip</b> <b>devices</b> for their shoes: a Heel-device, a Foot-blade device or a Whole-foot device. Four questionnaires were used: -Background, health, and earlier experiences of falling accidents during the winter 2007 / 2008 -Daily diary of walked distance, walking conditions, occurrence of incidences or falls reported weekly -Detailed accident or fall report used after each occurrence. -Experiences of using <b>anti-slip</b> <b>devices</b> The {{results show that the}} subjects had experienced 24 falls during the winter before the trial period. 64 incidents/accidents took place, without any injuries needing medical care, during the 10 week trial period with more than 2600 reported days. The anti-slip users walked longer compared to non users. An incident or fall among subjects wearing <b>anti-slip</b> <b>devices</b> reduced the walking distance that day. <b>Anti-slip</b> <b>devices</b> prevents from falling. The risk of slipping and falling is reduced for anti-slip users. The users of <b>anti-slip</b> <b>devices</b> will continue to use them and they will also recommend others to do so. The risk of falling as pedestrian during wintertime can thus be reduced by using <b>anti-slip</b> <b>devices.</b> Godkänd; 2009; 20090814 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Falls often {{result in}} soft tissue injuries, dislocations, fractures, longstanding pain and reduced quality of life. Therefore, fall {{preventive}} programmes have been developed. Methods: In this review, we evaluate programmes that in randomized controlled trials (RCT) {{have been shown}} with fall reducing effect. Results: Physical exercise that includes several training modalities, especially balance and strength training, is the only intervention programme that reduces both the number of fallers {{and the number of}} falls in community dwellers. Home hazards modification reduces the fall risk in community-living elderly but has the best effects in high risk groups when the programme is led by occupational therapists. Vitamin D supplement in those with low levels of vitamin D, adjustment of psychotropic medication and modification of multi-pharmacy are drug-related programmes that reduce the fall risk. <b>Anti-slip</b> shoe <b>devices</b> in elderly who walk outdoors during icy conditions and multifaceted podiatry to patients with specific foot disability are interventions targeted at the lower extremities with a fall-reducing effect. First eye cataract surgery and pacemakers in patients with cardio-inhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity are surgical procedures with fall-reducing effect. Multifactorial standardized preventive programmes that include an exercise component and individually-designed subject-specific programmes also reduce the number of falls. Conclusions: Fall preventive interventions should be provided to elderly by a structured approach, especially to high risk groups, as {{to reduce the number of}} falls and fallers...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Approximately 30 % {{of people}} over 65 years of age living in the {{community}} fall each year. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions to {{reduce the incidence of}} falls in older people living in the community. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Current Controlled Trials (all to May 2008). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of interventions to reduce falls in community-dwelling older people. Primary outcomes were rate of falls and risk of falling. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were pooled where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: We included 111 trials (55, 303 participants). Multiple-component group exercise reduced rate of falls and risk of falling (rate ratio (RaR) 0. 78, 95 %CI 0. 71 to 0. 86; risk ratio (RR) 0. 83, 95 %CI 0. 72 to 0. 97), as did Tai Chi (RaR 0. 63, 95 %CI 0. 52 to 0. 78; RR 0. 65, 95 %CI 0. 51 to 0. 82), and individually prescribed multiple-component home-based exercise (RaR 0. 66, 95 %CI 0. 53 to 0. 82; RR 0. 77, 95 %CI 0. 61 to 0. 97). Assessment and multifactorial intervention reduced rate of falls (RaR 0. 75, 95 %CI 0. 65 to 0. 86), but not risk of falling. Overall, vitamin D did not reduce falls (RaR 0. 95, 95 %CI 0. 80 to 1. 14; RR 0. 96, 95 %CI 0. 92 to 1. 01), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels. Overall, home safety interventions did not reduce falls (RaR 0. 90, 95 %CI 0. 79 to 1. 03); RR 0. 89, 95 %CI 0. 80 to 1. 00), but were effective in people with severe visual impairment, and in others at higher risk of falling. An <b>anti-slip</b> shoe <b>device</b> reduced rate of falls in icy conditions (RaR 0. 42, 95 %CI 0. 22 to 0. 78). Gradual withdrawal of psychotropic medication reduced rate of falls (RaR 0. 34, 95 %CI 0. 16 to 0. 73), but not risk of falling. A prescribing modification programme for primary care physicians significantly reduced risk of falling (RR 0. 61, 95 %CI 0. 41 to 0. 91). Pacemakers reduced rate of falls in people with carotid sinus hypersensitivity (RaR 0. 42, 95 %CI 0. 23 to 0. 75). First eye cataract surgery reduced rate of falls (RaR 0. 66, 95 %CI 0. 45 to 0. 95). There is some evidence that falls prevention strategies can be cost saving. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Exercise interventions reduce risk and rate of falls. Research is needed to confirm the contexts in which multifactorial assessment and intervention, home safety interventions, vitamin D supplementation, and other interventions are effective...|$|R
