5|$|After {{three days}} and nights of this battle, C Company of the 35th Infantry and A Company of the 29th Infantry moved up astride the Komam-ni road during the morning of August 20 to bolster A and B Companies on Sibidang. A large {{concentration}} of North Koreans advanced to renew the attack. The US troops directed artillery fire on this force and called in an <b>air</b> <b>strike.</b> Observers estimated that the artillery fire and the <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> killed about 350 North Korean troops, half the attack group.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> and {{artillery}} bombardment pushed North Korean forces off the hill. After the strike, at 15:30, the infantry attacked {{up the hill}} unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies on the hill was about 60 men. The artillery and the <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors fleeing in complete disorder. Two of the massacre survivors making {{their way down the}} hill to meet the counterattacking force were fired upon before they could establish their identity, but not hit. American forces of the 5th Cavalry Regiment quickly discovered the bodies of the American prisoners with machine-gun wounds, hands still bound behind their backs.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the Portuguese Air Force sent 25 {{of their}} {{remaining}} F-84G to Angola. There they formed the Esquadra 91 (91st Squadron), based at Luanda Air Base. From then on, the F-84s {{were engaged in}} the Angolan Theater of the Portuguese Overseas War, being mainly employed in <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> missions against the separatist guerrillas.|$|E
50|$|In {{an address}} to the nation on radio that same evening, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi held that the <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> were a {{declaration}} of war against India and the Indian Air Force responded with initial <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> that very night. These <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> were expanded to massive retaliatory <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> the next morning.|$|R

5|$|The {{next morning}} five North Korean T-34 tanks crossed {{the river and}} moved toward Hamch'ang. Artillery fire from A Battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion knocked out four of the tanks immediately. The fifth moved back across the river, where an <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> later {{destroyed}} it.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} morning, September 3, the North Koreans heavily {{attacked}} Check's men {{in an effort}} to regain the ridge. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire barrages, and an <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> directed from the battalion command post, met this attack. Part of the battalion had to turn and fight toward its rear. After the attack had been repulsed hundreds of North Korean lay dead around the battalion position. A prisoner estimated that during September 2 and 3 the four North Korean battalions fighting Check's battalion had lost 1,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the RAAF {{were also}} {{available}} {{to support the}} landing. The plan for the operation specified that, if required, No. 6 Squadron, reinforced with Beauforts from No. 8 and No. 100 Squadrons, would attack the landing area before 6 am on 4 November. An additional two Beauforts could also observe for any bombardments made by the warships. Prior to the landing, the <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> was cancelled by the RAAF officer who {{was attached to the}} landing force to coordinate air support as no opposition was expected.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July, Iowa {{remained}} off the Marianas supporting <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> on the Palaus and landings on Guam. After a month's rest, Iowa sailed from Eniwetok {{as part of}} the Third Fleet, {{and helped}} support the landings on Peleliu on 17 September. She then protected the carriers during <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> against the Central Philippines to neutralize enemy air power for the long-awaited invasion of the Philippines. On 10 October, Iowa arrived off Okinawa for a series of <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> on the Ryukyu Islands and Formosa. She then supported <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> against Luzon on 18 October and continued this duty during General Douglas MacArthur's landing on Leyte on 20 October.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an address}} to the nation on radio that same evening, then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi held the <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> to be a {{declaration}} of war against India and the Indian Air Force responded with initial <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> the same night, which were expanded to massive retaliatory <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> the next morning. Statements released by both nations the next day confirmed the [...] "existence of a state of war between the two countries", although neither government formally issued a declaration of war.|$|R
50|$|The mountainous {{border between}} Iran and Iraq made a deep ground {{invasion}} almost impossible, and <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> were used instead. The invasion's first waves were {{a series of}} <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> targeted at Iranian airfields. Iraq also attempted to bomb Tehran, Iran's capital and command centre, into submission.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the events}} of , Duke (Channing Tatum) has become {{the leader of the}} G.I. Joe unit, which is framed for {{stealing}} nuclear warheads from Pakistan by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce). The unit is subsequently eliminated in a military <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> with Duke as one of the casualties. The only survivors are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki).|$|E
5|$|Hiryū {{reinforced}} the CAP with launches of 3 more Zeros at 08:25. These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next American <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship Haruna starting around 08:30. Haruna escaped damage and 3 of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, {{they kept the}} Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.|$|E
5|$|In November 1952, Bolt {{transferred}} to squadron VMF-115, {{an element of}} the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing flying F9F Panther fighter-bomber aircraft in South Korea. He flew 94 combat missions with the squadron, all of them in bombing runs and close air support and <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> missions against ground targets. He did not enjoy this duty, preferring instead to fly the Sabre in air-to-air combat. As his squadron headed to Japan for R, he traveled to Seoul to visit the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Kimpo Airfield.|$|E
50|$|Certain targets, such as bridges, {{historically}} {{could be}} attacked only by manually placed explosives. With {{the advent of}} precision-guided munitions, the destructive part of the raid may involve the SF unit controlling <b>air</b> <b>strikes.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>strikes,</b> however, are practical only when U.S. involvement is not hidden.|$|R
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1939-1940, the Advanced <b>Air</b> <b>Striking</b> Force {{underwent}} restructuring; some of the Battle-equipped squadrons were returned to the UK while their place was taken by Bristol Blenheim-equipped squadrons instead. The activities of the Advanced <b>Air</b> <b>Striking</b> Force were principally restricted to training exercises during this time.|$|R
50|$|Opponents {{argue that}} the {{doctrine}} entails a heavy reliance on <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> to replace a lack of ground forces. Beginning with Saddam Hussein, {{there were at least}} 50 <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> aimed at decapitating the Iraqi leadership. Not a single one was successful. However, there were extensive civilian casualties.|$|R
5|$|Japanese carrier {{doctrine}} {{preferred the}} launching of fully constituted strikes rather than piecemeal attacks. Without confirmation of whether the American force included carriers (not received until 08:20), Nagumo's reaction was doctrinaire. In addition, the arrival of another land-based American <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> at 07:53 gave weight {{to the need to}} attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Sebille {{commanded}} the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron at {{the outbreak of}} the Korean War, flying F-51 Mustangs in close air support and <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> missions. On August 5, 1950, he attacked a North Korean armored column advancing on United Nations military units. Though his aircraft was heavily damaged and he was wounded during the first pass on the column, he turned his plane around and deliberately crashed into the convoy at the cost of his life.|$|E
5|$|The CAP {{defeated}} the next American <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> from Midway, shooting down {{three of the}} eleven Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship Haruna unsuccessfully, starting at around 08:30. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, they kept the Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast. Around 08:30 Sōryū launched one of her D4Ys {{on a mission to}} confirm the location of the American carriers.|$|E

5|$|With {{the start}} of the fire preparation, tank hunting detachments—groups of ten {{equipped}} with RPG-7 rockets, RPG-43 grenades, and AT-3 Sagger missiles—crossed the canal to deploy one kilometer deep, quickly occupying the tank ramparts, and proceeded to set up ambushes and lay mines. When the first barrage ended, Egyptian artillery began a second, 22 minute-long barrage, against targets at a depth of 1.5–3kilometers. At this time, 14:20, the first wave of assault infantry, 4,000 men, began crossing the canal. Around 2,500 dinghies and wooden boats were used to transport the troops. Smoke canisters were used at the crossing points to provide cover. During the night of October 5, engineers had blocked the underwater pipes on the opposite bank, preventing the Israelis from releasing flammable oil into the canal and igniting it. The first wave was lightly equipped, armed with RPG-7s, Strela 2 AA missiles and rope ladders to deploy on the sand wall. Among the first wave were combat engineers and several units of Sa'iqa (lightning; these were commando forces), who were tasked with setting up ambushes on reinforcement routes. The Sa'iqa attacked command posts and artillery batteries in order to deny the Israelis control over their forces, while the engineers breached the minefields and barbed wire surrounding Israeli defenses. Immediately following them, military engineers transported the water pumps to the opposite bank and began setting them up. At this time Egyptian aircraft involved in the <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> began returning. Five aircraft were lost, although {{by the end of the}} day this rose to ten. The <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> put the Bir Gifgafa and Bir Thamada air bases out of operation for 48 hours, and damaged the Ras Nasrani and Bir Hasanah airbases. Around ten HAWK batteries, at least two 175mm artillery batteries, an electronic jamming center at Umm Khashib, and various radar stations were destroyed. This allowed the Egyptian Air Force to operate for the rest of the war without any ground-based communications interference, as the only other jamming center in the Sinai was located at el-Arish, considerably behind the front. Over a dozen AS-5 Kelt missiles were fired from Tu-16 bombers as well. Several were shot down, but at least five hit their targets, including two missiles fitted with anti-radiation seekers that knocked out Israeli radars. The success of the <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> caused the Egyptians to cancel a planned second <b>air</b> <b>strike.</b> Another account however states that 18 Egyptian aircraft were lost, and these losses prompted the canceling of a second wave of airstrikes.|$|E
5|$|At dusk, the Japanese {{turned away}} to the {{northwest}} to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. Both sides launched aircraft {{the next day to}} locate each other; Zuihō launched three aircraft at 1200 to search east of the fleet, but they did not discover the Americans. The Americans discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> launched. While they sank one Japanese carrier and damaged two others, Zuihō was not attacked and successfully disengaged that evening. By the end of the battle, Air Group 653 was reduced to two Zero fighters, three Zero fighter-bombers and six torpedo bombers. After reaching Japan on 1 July, the ship remained in Japanese waters until October, training replacements for her air group.|$|E

They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during {{the afternoon of the}} following day and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> launched. They found the ships of the Second Carrier Division and hit Jun'yō with two bombs near her island. The ship was not badly damaged, but flight operations had to be suspended. Air Group 652 claimed seven American aircraft shot down and four more probably shot down, but lost eleven Zeros, plus another three that had to ditch. The air group was disbanded on 10 July with many of its remaining personnel being assigned to Air Group 653.|$|E

5|$|Gategood {{could not}} get through on the radio because the petrol {{generator}} that supplied power to the radios at Mud Bay had broken down, thereby cutting Arnold's link with Mud Bay, Milne Force and Taleba Bay. Arnold launched an attack on Kilia at 09:10, supported by two 3-inch mortars and 100rounds that had been brought up from Mud Bay. A promised <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> failed to arrive. Instead, Japanese aircraft strafed the Australian positions, {{as well as the}} ketch Maclaren King in Mud Bay with wounded men on board, resulting in further casualties. Arnold attempted a flanking movement with A Company, but it became lost in the jungle. The attack then became a frontal one against the main Japanese defences, which Arnold chose not to press.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{inclement weather}} also {{hampered}} the Americans' advance, and until May 15 the recapturing forces were unsure {{of whether the}} Japanese had held their position or retreated. When the fog lifted on that day, {{it became clear that}} the Japanese had retreated further west. However, when the American forces gave chase, they were immediately slowed by an accidental <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> upon them by an American aircraft. By May 29, the Japanese forces numbered only 700–1,000, and these troops attempted to run through the advancing American forces as a last show of defiance against the recapturing forces. By May 30, the Americans had recaptured Attu, and although a few small pockets of Japanese troops remained on the island, the Battle of Attu had essentially concluded.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 1944, the Strachwitz Battle Group {{consisting}} of the German 170th, 11th, and 227th Infantry Divisions and tanks, attacked the flanks of the Soviet 109th Rifle Corps south of the Tallinn railway, supported by an <b>air</b> <b>strike.</b> The tanks led the attack and the East Prussian grenadiers followed, penetrating the fortified positions of the Soviet rifle corps. By {{the end of the}} day, the Soviet 72nd and parts of the 109th Rifle Corps in the Westsack (west sack) of the bridgehead were encircled. The rest of the Soviet rifle corps retreated, shooting the local civilians who had been used for carrying ammunition and supplies from the rear.|$|E

50|$|A 2015 poll {{conducted}} by Jacquelyn Schneider and Julia Macdonald for Center for New American Security qualified {{some of this}} perceived support for drone strikes by giving respondents a chance to choose between drones, manned, neither platform, or both to conduct <b>air</b> <b>strikes.</b> They found that, while the American public {{was more likely to}} support unmanned than manned <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> by approximately 10-15 percentage points, this support for unmanned was much less pronounced than previous polls suggested. In fact, in many cases the U.S. public supported <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> from both manned and unmanned at similar rates.|$|R
