Here he {{emphasizes the importance of}} distinguishing humans from all other species, not to privilege human intelligence but to problematize it. Given that the evolution of H. sapiens began with ancestors who did not yet have [...] "culture," [...] what led them to move away from cognitive, learning, communication, and tool-making strategies that were and continued to be adaptive for most other primates (and, some have suggested, most other species of animals)? [...] Learning symbol systems is more time consuming than other forms of communication, so symbolic thought made possible a different communication strategy, but not a more efficient one than other primates. Nevertheless, it must have offered some selective advantage to H. sapiens to have evolved. Deacon starts by looking at two key determinants in evolutionary history: foraging behavior, and patterns of sexual relations. As he observes competition for sexual <b>access</b> <b>limits</b> the possibilities for social cooperation in many species; yet, Deacon observes, there are three consistent patterns in human reproduction that distinguish them from other species: ...|$|E

Two complementary ways should be favoured: the involvement of the private sector and the reform of the International Monetary Fund.

40|$|The lack of {{year round}} access to many rural {{communities}} {{is a serious}} constraint to social and economic development, and poverty reduction. Poor <b>access</b> <b>limits</b> the effectiveness of agricultural, commercial, educational and health initiatives through unreliable travel and high unit transport costs for crops, goods, services and people. Previous rural transport initiatives have concentrated on the provision of gravel roads for all year rural access. However, experiences have shown that these roads, although relatively cheap to construct, are often an unsustainable maintenance burden for many authorities and rural communities, and are rarely maintained in a serviceable condition. The paper describes recent DFID and World Bank funded research on alternatives to gravel roads in Vietnam and elsewhere. A range of proven, low-cost, rural road paving options is available that are suitable for construction and maintenance by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Most of these paving options require little capital investment, use labour-based techniques and can optimize the use of local materials resources. They can utilize locally made or available simple equipment, thus promoting local manufacturing and appropriate equipmen...|$|E
40|$|The World Wide Web is {{becoming}} {{a source of information}} for researchers, who are more aware of the possibilities for collections of Internet content as resources. Some have begun creating archives of web content for social science and humanities research. However, there is a growing gulf between policies shared between global and national institutions creating web archives and the practices of researchers making use of the archives. Each set of stakeholders finds the others ’ web archiving contributions less applicable to their own field. Institutions find the contributions of researchers to be too narrow {{to meet the needs of}} the institution’s audience, and researchers find the contributions of institutions to be too broad to meet the needs of their research methods. Resources are extended to advance both institutional and researcher tools, but the gulf between the two is persistent.

Open research questions remain regarding landslide recurrence rates, trigger mechanisms, failure dynamics, {{their impact on}} coastal and seafloor infrastructure and their role in causing subsequent effects such as tsunamis. The session C 8 of the 3 rd World Landslide Forum addresses causes and consequences of hazardous mass movements in coastal and marine areas. The session highlights the role of innovative marine-geophysical, -geological, and –geotechnical surveys and site-investigation techniques in coastal and subaquatic landslide research, hazard assessment and mitigation.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Mexican crisis of 1994, and against the backgroundof increased reliance by sovereign debtors on bond financing in the early 1990 ?, theGroup of Ten published in 1996 a report on « The resolution of Sovereign LiquidityCrises». In order to promote a more orderly resolution of such crises, and hence reducethe huge costs involved, the so-called « Rey Report» put much emphasis on the benefitsof including collective action clauses (CACs) in sovereign bond issues through a mar-ket-led process. Since 1996, the world has seen several new large debt crises in emerging economies,constituting serious threats for the international financial stability. The debate on theinclusion of CACs ?what is called now a « contractual approach» ?has regainedconsiderable momentum at the current stage, as has the debate on a « statutoryapproach», which would imply the establishment of a sovereign debt restructuringmechanism. This article recalls experiences with recent debt crises, and analyses thepotential impact of the proposals put forward in the current debate on the behaviour ofcreditors and debtors. Building on that analysis, the point is made that the statutoryand contractual approaches are not only complementary and self-reinforcing, but areeven inextricably interlinked, while presumptive <b>access</b> <b>limits</b> to Fund financing act as acatalyst for the functioning of both. sovereign debt crises, international financial architecture, International Monetary Fund...|$|E
40|$|This {{special report}} {{is based on}} the 2013 China chapter of Freedom House's annual Freedom on the Net survey. Freedom on the Net is a {{comparative}} analysis of internet freedom with a unique methodology, and includes a detailed narrative report and a numerical score for each country assessed. China's numerical score will be published as part of the full report. However, as the home {{of one of the most}} systematically controlled and monitored online environments in the world, it will no doubt retain its place among countries where Freedom House categorizes the internet as Not Free. As the Freedom on the Net 2012 survey noted, China increasingly serves as an incubator for sophisticated new types of internet restrictions, providing a model for other authoritarian countries. For this reason, Freedom House is publishing the 2013 China narrative as a special report, examining key developments during the Freedom on the Net coverage period (May 1, 2012, through April 30, 2013) in the context of the recent leadership change in the Chinese Communist Party.

40|$|The memory <b>access</b> <b>limits</b> the {{performance}} of stream processors. By exploiting the reuse of data held in the Stream Register File (SRF), an on-chip storage, the number of memory accesses can be reduced. In current stream compilers reuse is only attempted for simple stream references, those whose start and end are known. Compiler analysis from outside of stream processors does not directly enable the consideration of other complex stream references. In this {{paper we propose a}} transformation to automatically optimize stream programs to exploit the reuse supplied by loop-dependent stream references. The transformation is based on three results: algorithms to recognize the reuse supplied by stream references, a new abstract expression called the Stream Reuse Graph (SRG) to depict the reuse and the optimization of the SRG for the transformation. Both the reuse between whole sequences accessed by stream references and that between partial sequences are exploited in the paper. In particular, the problem of exploiting partial stream reuse does not have its parallel in the traditional data reuse exploitation setting (for scalars and arrays). Finally, we have implemented our techniques using the StreamC/KernelC compiler for Imagine. Experimental results show a resultant speedup of 1. 14 to 2. 54 times using a range of typical stream processing application kernels...|$|E
