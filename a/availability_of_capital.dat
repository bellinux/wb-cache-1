5|$|In March 2007, Moelis {{announced}} that he was leaving the company, and shortly thereafter founded a new business, Moelis & Company. As he had when joining UBS, Moelis took a large team of senior UBS investment bankers. Moelis's departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> from the bank's balance sheet to pursue large transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts. The bank's apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees. After Moelis, other notable departures included investment banking co-head Jeff McDermott in early 2007 and, as the financial crisis set in, other high-profile bankers such as Oliver Sarkozy in early 2008 and Ben Lorello in 2009.|$|E

25|$|The profits {{the state}} {{made from the}} bank were large; by owning 50% of the bank, and then devaluing the state debts by 50%, the bank was able to turn a high profit. The state {{received}} at least a 500% return on investment, but the profit was {{less than half the}} amount lost on the internal improvements, most of which were never completed or quickly fell into disrepair and became unusable. The state's profits were small in comparison to the enterprise spurred by the bank.

2500|$|The {{technological}} and industrial {{history of the}} United States describes the United States' emergence {{as one of the}} most technologically advanced nations in the world. The availability of land and literate labor, the absence of a landed aristocracy, the prestige of entrepreneurship, the diversity of climate and a large easily accessed upscale and literate free market all contributed to America's rapid industrialisation. The <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> development by the free market of navigable rivers, and coastal waterways, and the abundance of natural resources facilitated the cheap extraction of energy all contributed to America's rapid industrialization. [...] Fast transport by the very large railroad built in the mid-19th century, and the Interstate Highway System built in the late 20th century, enlarged the markets and reducing shipping and production costs. The legal system facilitated business operations and guaranteed contracts. [...] Cut off from Europe by the embargo and the British blockade in the War of 1812 (1807–15), entrepreneurs opened factories in the Northeast that set the stage for rapid industrialization modeled on British innovations.|$|E

40|$|Start-ups mostly {{have only}} limited {{internal}} financing. Post-entry performance should thus strongly {{depend on the}} <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> new external <b>capital.</b> In this study we analyze the impact of financial constraints {{on the performance of}} Swiss start-ups. Since we use cohort data, we have for some start-ups data at different points in time. This allows us to analyze whether the effect <b>of</b> the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> external <b>capital</b> on firm performance changes with increasing age of the firms. To measure the impact <b>of</b> external <b>capital</b> as a whole, we include separate indicators for debt and venture capital constraints. Using different performance measures, we find that debt constraints are not only a problem of the first years. While the negative impact of debt constraints on firm survival disappears with increasing age of the firms, profit is persistently negative affected by debt constraints. Debt constraints, however, do not impact employment growth of the firms, not even in the first years. The <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> venture <b>capital</b> is <b>of</b> lower relevance for the post-entry performance. Surviving and growth of the start-ups is not affected by venture capital constraints. However, firms with limited access to venture capital persistently have problems to attain profit break-even. start-ups, performance, financial constraints, firm age...|$|R

40|$|<b>Availability</b> <b>of</b> {{financial}} <b>capital</b> {{and location}} decisions are variables that influence regional manufacturing output. This study maintains that a region’s manufacturing growth {{depends upon the}} region’s firm-type dominance. That is, the type of firms that dominate the region’s manufacturing output can be classified as non-local (national or foreign - NF) vs. local and large vs. small. Accordingly, for policy analysis, regions can be classified by firm-type dominance. This distinction is important since, invariably, location decision options and <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>capital</b> are more favourable for the larger NF firms than for local firms. In an attempt {{to assess the impact}} of firm-type dominance, this study draws upon the dominant industry model which has established that, in any given region, there is a dominant industry (the driving force of the region) to which a region’s manufacturing growth is linked. The information on the impact of firm-type dominance on a region's manufacturing output may enable policy-makers to design workable (or revise existing) manufacturing diversification policies. ...|$|R
50|$|From 1865 {{to about}} 1913, the U.S. grew {{to become the}} world's leading {{industrial}} nation. Land and labor, the diversity of climate, the ample presence of railroads (as well as navigable rivers), and the natural resources all fostered the cheap extraction of energy, fast transport, and the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> that powered this Second Industrial Revolution. The average annual income (after inflation) of nonfarm workers grew by 75% from 1865 to 1900, and then grew another 33% by 1918.|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, {{there were many}} {{semiconductor}} companies in the area, computer firms using their devices, and programming and service companies serving both.

30|$|Generally, the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> {{financial}} <b>capital</b> {{has been}} directly associated with entrepreneurship (Kim et al., 2013; Rodriguez et al., 2009).
