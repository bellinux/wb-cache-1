30|$|PAF, i.e., CO in the ex vivo {{model and}} MPAP was {{measured}} continuously. The PAF <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> exceed 4.0  l/min, and the MPAP <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> exceed 20  mmHg.|$|R
30|$|As C. C. Li put it, “I <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> teach. I <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> do anything.” “No one was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> talk to me.” “I was persecuted.” (Wohleber, 1991; Srikameswaran, 2003).|$|R
5|$|Treks: {{tourists}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> walk {{inside the}} park, {{but only to}} go trekking around the park {{in the company of}} a guide. The winter season is cold, so tourists should make proper arrangements for their clothing, if they are traveling in the winter season.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} {{elections}} in the UK, Irish and qualifying Commonwealth citizens are entitled to vote. Unlike elections to the Westminster parliament, citizens of other non-Commonwealth EU member states who are resident in Scotland are entitled to vote in elections to the Scottish Parliament. Overseas electors on Scottish electoral registers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> vote in Scottish Parliament elections. From the 2016 election, the franchise for Scottish Parliament elections was expanded to include 16 and 17-year olds.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem {{has three}} bus {{stations}} owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, Hebron, Nahalin, Battir, al-Khader, al-Ubeidiya and Beit Fajjar. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, Tuqu' and Herodium. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.|$|E
50|$|CHP {{followers}} {{also tried}} to establish parties. But they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> use the name CHP and <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> elect the well known pre-1980 politicians to party posts. So they had to introduce new politicians.|$|R
50|$|Immediately a “deadlock” {{system was}} put into effect until October 16, 1978. Prisoners <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> leave their cells for any reason. Their meals were brought to them; all {{recreational}} time and work assignments were cancelled. The prisoners <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> shower until October; family visits were banned until October 14 and they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> make phone calls to their families until September 30. The officials of the prison began searching the prisoners for weapons on October 2 and ended October 13.|$|R
25|$|A boxer <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> bite.|$|R
5|$|In addition, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the GRC scheme merely provides an appearance of a united, multiracial Parliament. In fact, minority representatives are required to vote according to their party line; they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> vote specifically in the interests of their racial groups. The multiracial element in Parliament has been artificially imposed by way of a racial quota to ensure that the minorities are represented.|$|E
5|$|The United States also observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they {{have a great deal of}} autonomy, but also like the states, tribes <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E
5|$|The puffball {{was used}} by the Chippewa people of North America as a charm, and medicinally as a hemostat. In British Columbia, Canada, it is used by {{livestock}} farmers who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> use conventional drugs under certified organic programs. The spore mass of the puffball is applied to bleeding hoof trimming 'nicks', and then wrapped with breathable first-aid tape. It is also similarly used on bleeding areas resulting from disbudding, and wounds resulting from sternal abscesses.|$|E

5|$|Tintin and Captain Haddock {{are walking}} through the {{countryside}} of the fictional Marlinshire when they come across a Romani community camped in a garbage dump, and reunite a lost little girl named Miarka with her family there. The Romani explain that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> camp anywhere else so Haddock invites them to the grounds of his estate, Marlinspike Hall.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E
5|$|As good fluids are {{supposed}} to be transferable, the Antoinist dress used during the worship is often placed on the bed of a suffering person to help his recovery; similarly, some faithful put a request on a paper in a box under the platform so that the wish happen, others buy a photo of Antoine at a ceremony to be protected. To prevent negative fluids to enter the temple, several rules were established: for example, those who perform the worship <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> wear jewelry or makeup in the building.|$|E

50|$|In Singapore, the songkok <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worn in {{government}} schools {{as part of}} the uniform as Singapore is officially a secular state and all religious headgear <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worn. It is part of the standard uniform at madrasahs (Islamic religious schools).|$|R
5|$|Drivers had two hours, split {{over two}} days, Friday and Saturday, to {{register}} the fastest possible time. The driver who could register the fastest time would start on pole position, giving them a headstart of eight metres over the second-fastest driver, who started {{on the opposite side}} of the track. Third place would start eight metres behind the second-fastest driver and on the side of the track where the first placed car is. This practice continues until twenty-sixth place, and the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth placed cars <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> race.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tournament}} is {{restricted}} to casino employees, {{most of the big}} name poker professionals and previous bracelet winners <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> participate. Therefore, even though the Casino Employee Championship is a World Series of Poker bracelet event, it has typically received relatively little coverage. Despite this perception, the Casino Employee Championship event does involve numerous recognized names in the poker world. The 2009 tournament included two time bracelet winner Pat Poels, WSOP vice president Ty Stewart, Bellagio Tournament Director/Former WSOP Director Jack McClelland, and Woman Poker Hall of Famer Marsha Waggoner.|$|E
50|$|Seven figure skaters from Kuwait, Malaysia, Macau and a speed skater from Turkmenistan <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> compete {{as their}} {{respective}} nations <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{members of the}} International Skating Union. However, competitors were later <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> compete, but their results <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> count towards the official rankings.|$|R
25|$|During Leopold's reign {{other social}} changes were enacted into law. Among {{these were the}} right of workers to form labour unions and the {{abolition}} of the livret d'ouvrier, an employment record book. Laws against child labour were passed; children younger than 12 <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> work in factories, children younger than 16 <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> work at night, and women younger than 21 years old <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> work underground. Workers gained the right to be compensated for workplace accidents, and were given Sundays off.|$|R

5|$|Stallions must be {{registered}} New Foresters, and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> run free {{all year round}} on the Forest. They normally are turned out only for a limited period {{in the spring and}} summer, when they gather several groups of mares and youngstock into larger herds and defend them against other stallions. A small number (usually fewer than 50) are turned out, generally between May and August. This ensures that foals are born neither too early (before the spring grass is coming through), nor too late (as the colder weather is setting in and the grazing and browsing on the Forest is dying back) in the following year.|$|E
5|$|The center teaches {{classes in}} four-month semesters {{occurring}} {{three times per}} year. Each semester costs $10,815. Students {{are required to take}} a small orientation course online before entering the center and are interviewed individually. Application requirements state that students must have attended at least two semesters (including the semester immediately preceding the trip abroad) at BYU, BYU-Hawaii, or BYU-Idaho, have a GPA of at least 2.5, and sign an agreement not to proselytize. Married students <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> attend.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} team must {{line up in}} a legal formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> move until the snap of the ball.|$|E
