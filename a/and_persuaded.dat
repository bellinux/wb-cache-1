5|$|The Achaean League {{was upset}} {{that one of}} its members had {{remained}} under Spartan occupation <b>and</b> <b>persuaded</b> the Romans to revisit their decision to leave Sparta's territorial gains intact.

5|$|The Fort Vancouver Centennial Corporation {{hoped to}} sell {{commemorative}} half dollars at the planned celebration, <b>and</b> <b>persuaded</b> Representative Albert Johnson of Washington state to introduce {{legislation in the}} House of Representatives. In May 1924, he and Senator Wesley Jones, also of Washington state, introduced legislation in their houses of Congress for a half dollar commemorating the centennial of Fort Vancouver. The bills were not given any hearings. Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, {{the chairman of the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, met with Johnson <b>and</b> <b>persuaded</b> him to introduce a bill for a medal instead. Vestal reasoned that the Treasury Department was opposing more commemorative coin issues, as these were finding their way into circulation and confusing the public. On February 3, 1925, Jones introduced a bill for a medal, and on the 12th, Johnson did the same.|$|E
5|$|According to the Life of St. Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus {{fell into}} a Persian ambush but was able to escape. In 604/605, he also {{surrounded}} Narses and his troops, <b>and</b> <b>persuaded</b> him to surrender on guarantees of his personal safety. Phocas, nonetheless, had Narses executed by burning him alive. At about the same time, Dara, an important Byzantine city in Mesopotamia, fell to the Persians. Khosrau was encouraged to cease simply raiding the Byzantine provinces, instead attempting to conquer them. In 607, he launched concurrent invasions on Mesopotamia and Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond of Tripoli {{regarded}} himself his father's lawful heir, {{because he}} was Bohemond's elder surviving son. He came to Antioch {{at the end of}} 1198 <b>and</b> <b>persuaded</b> the commune to accept his rule. Before long, the younger Bohemond returned to Tripoli, enabling his father to re-take control of state affairs, suggesting that the elder Bohemond had tacitly supported his son's coup. LeoI of Cilicia appealed to the Holy See to protect Raymond-Roupen's interest, but the Knights Templar submitted a complaint against him for refusing to restore Bagras to them.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{influence}} <b>and</b> <b>persuade</b> others at work has become an increasingly important managerial skill to achieve work goals and objectives to drive businesses forward in today’s demanding and competitive work environments. This paper investigates and provides {{a deeper understanding of}} what positive effects knowledge and application of the concepts of influencing amd persuasion can have on managers, the people they manage and the organisations they work for. The results show that the performance of managers is positively influenced by how they influence <b>and</b> <b>persuade</b> people at work. The outcome of a literature review suggests that there is no conclusive evidence of what makes an effective manager at work that is good at influencing <b>and</b> <b>persuading</b> others. Outputs from face to face and a focus group meeting with final year social psychology students from the Universidad de Oriene in Santiago de Cuba closed this gap by suggesting an effective influencing and persuasion skills set that, when applied appropriately, could guide managers how to influence <b>and</b> <b>persuade</b> others successfully. The outcome of this research is applicable and relevant to managers in any working environment such as Telecommuncations, Utilities, Banking or Automotive. The proposed skills set of what makes an effective influencing <b>and</b> <b>persuading</b> manager at work can be applied globally although the prevailing cultural diversities in different countries should be considered...|$|R

He was initially assigned to Fort Washington, the present-day site of Cincinnati, in the Northwest Territory, where the army was engaged in the ongoing Northwest Indian War.|$|E
5|$|In 1713, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI {{established}} {{a line of}} succession that gave precedence to his own daughters over the daughters of his deceased older brother, Emperor Joseph I. To protect the Habsburg inheritance, he coerced, cajoled, <b>and</b> <b>persuaded</b> the crowned heads of Europe to accept the Pragmatic Sanction. In this agreement, they acknowledged any of his legitimate daughters as the rightful Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and Archduchess of Austria – {{a break from the}} tradition of agnatic primogeniture.|$|E

In June 1970 {{he became the first}} actor to be created a peer for services to the theatre.

5|$|In 1996 John Sykes {{decided to}} reactivate Thin Lizzy, {{presenting}} the band {{as a tribute}} to Phil Lynott's life and work. He decided to take on the role of lead vocals himself in the absence of Lynott, <b>and</b> <b>persuaded</b> Scott Gorham, Brian Downey and Darren Wharton to return to the fold. To complete the line-up, Marco Mendoza continued in Lynott's role as bass player. They received criticism for using the Thin Lizzy name without Lynott being present, but the band only played hits from Thin Lizzy's back catalogue, and did not compose any new material.|$|E
5|$|In Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, Lúthien was {{the most}} {{beautiful}} of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and forsook her immortality for her love of the mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the Dark Lord Morgoth, Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking wolfhound Huan. Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf Carcharoth, Lúthien, like Orpheus, approached the Valar, the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), <b>and</b> <b>persuaded</b> them to restore her beloved to life.|$|E

James had previously expressed antislavery sentiments, but Maria urged him towards more active expression and involvement. His second volume of poems Miscellaneous Poems expressed these antislavery thoughts, and its 1,500 copies sold well.|$|E
5|$|Prior to independence, {{there had}} only been a few {{scattered}} Dutch farmers settled on the Hudson above Albany. In 1787, a group of New Englanders headed west <b>and</b> <b>persuaded</b> one Jacob Vanderhyden to sell them a large tract which they then subdivided and named Troy.
