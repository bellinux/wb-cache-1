40|$|Copiamycin, an {{antibiotic}} agent, has shown in vitro activity against Candida albicans, Torulopsis glabrata, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Local administration of copiamycin to mice inoculated intraperitoneally with protozoa reduced the per cent of infection {{as measured by}} decreased abscess formation. This antibiotic has {{had little effect on}} the glucose oxidation by protozoa. Its action on anaerobic glucose metabolism in these organisms was equal to that of <b>aminitrozole</b> and azalomycin F. From these results we conclude that copiamycin is an effective antifungal and antitrichomonal agent equivalent in activity to azalomycin F...|$|E
