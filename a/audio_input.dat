5|$|The {{development}} of commercial sound cinema had proceeded {{in fits and}} starts before The Jazz Singer, and the film's success did not change things overnight. Not until May 1928 did the group of four big studios (PDC had dropped out of the alliance), along with United Artists and others, sign with ERPI for conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. Initially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well. However, even with access to both technologies, most of the Hollywood companies remained slow to produce talking features of their own. No studio besides Warner Bros. released even a part-talking feature until the low-budget-oriented Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) premiered The Perfect Crime on June 17, 1928, eight months after The Jazz Singer. FBO had come under the effective control of a Western Electric competitor, General Electric's RCA division, which was looking to market its new sound-on-film system, Photophone. Unlike Fox-Case's Movietone and De Forest's Phonofilm, which were variable-density systems, Photophone was a variable-area system—a refinement in the way the audio signal was inscribed on film that would ultimately become the standard. (In both sorts of systems, a specially-designed lamp, whose exposure to the film is determined by the <b>audio</b> <b>input,</b> is used to record sound photographically as a series of minuscule lines. In a variable-density process, the lines are of varying darkness; in a variable-area process, the lines are of varying width.) By October, the FBO-RCA alliance would lead to the creation of Hollywood's newest major studio, RKO Pictures.|$|E
25|$|Some {{independent}} stereo manufacturers including JVC, Pioneer, Kenwood, Alpine, Sony, and Harman Kardon {{also have}} iPod-specific integration solutions. Alternative connection methods include adapter kits (that use the cassette deck or the CD changer port), <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> jacks, and FM transmitters {{such as the}} iTrip—although personal FM transmitters are illegal in some countries. Many car manufacturers have added <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> jacks as standard.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the focus}} of this work being the {{translation}} for LIBRAS and its evaluation for DTV, we believe that the proposal would be adaptable to other platforms (e.g., Web, Mobile, Digital Cinema) with minor modifications (although we have not evaluated it yet). For example, we believe that we could adapt the solution for the Web platform just by running all LibrasTV components on a Web server. It is also interesting to investigate the use of <b>audio</b> <b>inputs</b> for machine translation to LIBRAS from BP speech. Thus, a proposal of future work is to adapt the proposed solution for <b>audio</b> <b>inputs</b> and other platforms.|$|R

25|$|For the 2010 model year, the CR-V {{received}} style, powertrain, {{and equipment}} changes. The exterior changes included a redesigned front fascia {{with a new}} horizontal-slat chrome grille and honeycomb-designed lower front grille, new front bumper, and revised taillights. The rear bumper was redesigned, {{as well as new}} five split-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels for EX and EX-L models. The interior received minor changes, including seat fabrics, as well as wider driver and front-passenger armrests. The audio head unit controls were altered and the information display backlighting in the gauges was changed to blue, instead of the previous black. A USB <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> became standard in the EX-L trim while hands-free Bluetooth connectivity was exclusive to the EX-L trim equipped with navigation system. In 2011, a mid-level SE trim debuted with a 6-disc CD changer and 17-inch 7-spoke alloy wheels that came from the pre-facelift EX and EX-L trims.|$|E

25|$|MPEG-2 doubles {{the number}} of {{sampling}} rates which are supported and MPEG-2.5 adds 3 more. When this was written, the suggested implementations were quite dated. Implementers of the standard were supposed to devise their own algorithms suitable for removing parts of {{the information from the}} <b>audio</b> <b>input.</b> As a result, many different MP3 encoders became available, each producing files of differing quality. Comparisons were widely available, so it was easy for a prospective user of an encoder to research the best choice. Some encoders that were proficient at encoding at higher bit rates (such as LAME) were not necessarily as good at lower bit rates. Over time, LAME evolved on the SourceForge website until it became the de facto CBR MP3 encoder. Later an ABR mode was added. Work progressed on true variable bit rate using a quality goal between 0 and 10. Eventually numbers (such as -V 9.600) could generate excellent quality low bit rate voice encoding at only 41kbit/s using the MPEG-2.5 extensions.|$|E
25|$|For 2010, {{the last}} year of {{production}} for the PT Cruiser, there was only one trim level available: the PT Cruiser Classic.

Features such as satellite radio, a premium sound system by Boston Acoustics with external amplifier and subwoofer, and U Connect hands-free Bluetooth for compatible cell phones also became available in 2006. The standard audio system now included an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player and 3.5-millimeter auxiliary <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> jack with six speakers, replacing a cassette player and four speakers. The turbocharged 2.4L four-cylinder engine was available in [...] or [...] "High-Output" [...] versions.
