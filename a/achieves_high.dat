500|$|Tennessine may {{be located}} in the [...] "island of stability", a concept that {{explains}} why some superheavy elements are more stable compared to an overall trend of decreasing stability for elements beyond bismuth on the periodic table. The synthesized tennessine atoms have lasted tens and hundreds of milliseconds. In the periodic table, tennessine {{is expected to be a}} member of group 17, all other members of which are halogens. Some of its properties may significantly differ from those of the halogens due to relativistic effects. As a result, tennessine is expected to be a volatile metal that neither forms anions nor <b>achieves</b> <b>high</b> oxidation states. A few key properties, such as its melting and boiling points and its first ionization energy, are nevertheless expected to follow the periodic trends of the halogens.|$|E

Flowing downward through cracked rock at about one foot per year, the meteoric water migrates to estimated minimum depths of [...] and <b>achieves</b> <b>high</b> temperatures in the deep section of the flow path before rising along fault and fracture conduits. Under artesian pressure, the thermal waters rise and emerge through the Hot Springs Sandstone between the traces of two thrust faults, along several northeast-trending lineaments. [...] Some rainwater from near the springs mixes with the deep hot water before discharge. The trip down takes about 4,000 years while the hot water takes about a year to reach the surface.|$|E

Insteadofmanuallyproducinghigh-covering test inputs that <b>achieve</b> <b>high</b> structural coverage, testers or developers can employ tools built based on automated testgeneration approaches, such as Pex, to automatically generate such test inputs. Although these tools can easily generate test inputs that <b>achieve</b> <b>high</b> structural coverage for simple programs, when applied on complex programs in practice, these tools face various problems, such as the problems of dealing with method calls to external libraries or generating method-call sequences to produce desired object states. Since these tools are currently not powerful {{enough to deal with}} these various problems in testing complex programs, we propose cooperative developer testing, where developers provide guidance to help tools <b>achieve</b> <b>higher</b> structural coverage. In this demo, we present Covana, a tool that precisely identifies and reports problems that prevent Pex from <b>achieving</b> <b>high</b> structural coverage. Covana identifies problems primarily by determining whether branch statements containing not-covered branches have data dependencies on problem candidates...|$|R
