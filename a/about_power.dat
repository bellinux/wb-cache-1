Team-mate Ken Barnes described him as a player who was [...] "more <b>about</b> <b>power</b> than guile", and called him a [...] "born leader" [...] who was [...] "brilliant in the air". Paul's approach to captaincy was to ensure that every player gave as much effort as possible, mixing the respect of his colleagues with the occasional attempt to frighten them into action; in the tunnel prior to the 1956 FA Cup Final his last action before leading out his team was to hold up his fist and shout [...] "If we don't fucking win, you'll get some of this".|$|E

500|$|Parables for Wooden Ears {{received}} a moderate response from reviewers. Juice reviewer John Encarnacao enjoyed the rock {{elements of the}} album, drawing comparisons to Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice In Chains. He thanked producer Tony Cohen for the [...] "big sound" [...] of the album, {{and said that the}} musicians on the album [...] "not only know <b>about</b> <b>power</b> and restraint, but also play tastefully". Encarnacao stated that Fanning [...] "lays the emotion on thick and usually more than gets away with it." [...] The review was summarised by stating that the album may have been [...] "a bit like the retro-rock that the big corporations want you to buy", but that nonetheless it was a good album.|$|E
500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world...

I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me?

500|$|The song {{deals with}} a feminist theme of the war of the sexes. It is a [...] "feminist plea about women's place in history" [...] with the title {{referring}} to the [...] "cowardice of men". In the song, Farmer [...] "reverses the roles", and [...] "presents women as warriors". In the first couplet, she evokes [...] "the {{role of women in}} History", recalling that [...] "all the great men had on their side a woman to support, assist and advise them". However, the singer said that [...] "all this was done to the detriment of women and cites as example, Mary, Jesus Christ's mother, a symbol of martyrdom and self-sacrifice". She denounces [...] "the hypocrisy and the chatter of men who think only <b>about</b> <b>power</b> and sex". In the refrain, she advises women to rebel by taking up arms.|$|E

500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy praised [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] {{and called}} it a [...] "masterful return effort". He {{additionally}} wrote that the single is [...] "brave, brilliantly-realized and bizarre enough to distance" [...] the singer from the other pop or R performers like Lady Gaga. According to Levine, the song is her best vocal performances and shows Rihanna growing {{in front of the}} audience's eyes. Will Hines of Consequence of Sound called the song a worth centerpiece and further wrote that it stands out from other tracks on the album which proves that Rated R [...] "was a cathartic process for the singer". Todd Martens of Los Angeles Times wrote that although is hard to imagine the song to be played in a car or a club, it's [...] "attention-grabbing stuff, standing in stark—emphasis on stark—contrast to much of the current pop landscape." [...] Alibhe Malone of NME wrote that Rated R is an album <b>about</b> <b>power</b> and control in which [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] sets the agenda.|$|E
500|$|According to Heather Phares of AllMusic, [...] "Pioneers" [...] and [...] "Price of Gas" [...] {{exemplify the}} {{political}} undercurrent on Silent Alarm, the latter including the explicit chant [...] "War/ War/ War/ War". [...] "Helicopter" [...] focuses in equal measure on America's [...] "red states" [...] and on UK apathy and [...] "the people queueing for the McDonald's by [...] house". [...] "Positive Tension" [...] concerns boredom and its dangers, focusing {{on how it}} [...] "can lead you into dark places", while [...] "Banquet" [...] details [...] "how sex is <b>about</b> <b>power,</b> submission, domination and real rapacious desire". The lyrics in the chorus of [...] "She's Hearing Voices", [...] "Red pill / Blue pill / Milk of amnesia", are {{in reference to the}} medications a friend of Okereke's took to relieve the symptoms of schizophrenia. The lyricist has described the moment in [...] "This Modern Love" [...] when the backing vocals enter the mix before the second chorus as [...] "perfect", because it evokes the idea of [...] "two people on the telephone, who can't touch each other, and as the song and the conversation progress, everything amplifies".|$|E
500|$|When U.S. troop {{training}} began for World War I, {{many white}} Southerners were alarmed {{at the thought}} of arming black soldiers. A confrontation regarding the rights of black soldiers culminated in the Houston Riot of 1917. German propaganda encouraged black soldiers to turn against their [...] "real" [...] enemies: American whites. Rumors reached the U.S. that French women had been sexually active with black American soldiers, which University of Florida historian David Colburn argues struck at the heart of Southern fears <b>about</b> <b>power</b> and miscegenation. Colburn connects growing concerns of sexual intimacy between the races to what occurred in Rosewood: [...] "Southern culture had been constructed around a set of mores and values which places white women at its center and in which the purity of their conduct and their manners represented the refinement of that culture. An attack on women not only represented a violation of the South's foremost taboo, but it also threatened to dismantle the very nature of southern society." [...] The transgression of sexual taboos subsequently combined with the arming of black citizens to raise fears among whites of an impending race war in the South.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{opinion of}} the music video was {{generally}} favorable. Entertainment Weeklys columnist Jim Farber gave the music video an A rating, and called the close-ups of D'Angelo's physique a [...] "measure of the video's smarm-free joy {{that even though the}} camera puts the viewer in the pleasure-giving position, we feel in no way manipulated or debased". Farber also lauded the video's depiction of sexuality, stating [...] "it feels like a privilege to be part of such a comfortable act of carnality. Was it good for you, too?". A columnist for Billboard magazine shared a similar sentiment about the video, writing that [...] "it's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it. The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year". However, David Thigpen of Time magazine criticized the vanity of the video, stating [...] "It's a good song, but I thought he was preening pretty heavily in the video". Thigpen also compared it to the music video for singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette's [...] "Thank U" [...] (1998), which features Morissette appearing nude, and stated [...] "Nakedness is usually an expression of vulnerability — that was the point of the Alanis Morissette video. But in this case, it's really <b>about</b> <b>power,</b> an in-your-face form of masculinity". Douglas Century of The New York Times called it [...] "the most controversial music video to air in years", and favored the video's unconventional concept, writing that [...] "'Untitled' breaks a long-established pattern in hip-hop and R videos in which male artists are often dressed in roughneck gear — baggy jeans, Timberland boots and baseball caps — surrounded by shimmying women in thong bikinis".|$|E

The religion and society, which have traditionally structured human morality, are, in Pinter's plays, the immoral agents that destroy the individual."
