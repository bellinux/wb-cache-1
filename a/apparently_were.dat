5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> {{present in}} the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped {{by the fact that}} there is a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|In December 1990, the NHL held {{a meeting}} in Palm Beach, Florida, to {{consider}} expansion applications. The NHL executives were reportedly impressed by the Ottawa presentation, including Finnigan's participation, the several hundred fans and the marching band who traveled to Palm Beach, but <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> more impressed {{at the fact that}} the group {{was one of the few}} applicants willing to pay the $50 million franchise fee without reservations. On December 6, 1990, the Terrace group was approved to purchase one of the two franchises (along with the Tampa Bay Lightning) to start play in the 1992–93 season.|$|E

5|$|Slavery was not {{abolished}} {{even after}} the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen {{and most of them}} on the same plantation, doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or {{on the streets of the}} cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{seemingly}} {{loved his}} young wife, lavishing gifts on her. On {{the occasion of}} their first New Year in 1386, {{he gave her a}} red velvet palfrey saddle, trimmed with copper and decorated with an intertwined K and E (for Karol and Elisabeth), and he continued to give her gifts of rings, tableware and clothing. The uncles too, <b>apparently,</b> <b>were</b> pleased with the match, which contemporary chroniclers, notably Froissart and Michel Pintoin (the Monk of St. Denis), describe similarly as a match rooted in desire and based on her beauty. The day after the wedding, Charles went on a military campaign against the English, and Isabeau went to Creil to live with his step great-grandmother Queen Dowager Blanche, who taught her courtly traditions. In September she took up residence at the Château de Vincennes, where {{in the early years of}} their marriage Charles frequently joined her, and which became her favorite home.|$|E

Swallow was the EIC's most {{successful}} fast-sailing packet.|$|E
25|$|The article at {{the link}} {{describes}} them and shows a twin Brunsviga (side-by-side machines). Twin machines were relatively rare, and <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> used for surveying calculations (The CORDIC algorithm was invented later, but these machine {{might be able}} to execute it.) At least one triple machine (Brunsviga(?)) was made. It is likely that a given accumulator could be engaged with either half of the twin.|$|E
25|$|On her {{way back}} to the Delaware River, Andrew Doria {{encountered}} the sloop HMS Racehorse, of 10 guns, and under the command of Commander James Jones. A two-hour single-ship action ensued before Racehorse struck. Andrew Doria had lost four men killed and eight wounded; casualties on Racehorse <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> higher. Andrew Doria returned to Philadelphia where the Continental Navy acquired Racehorse, which it renamed Surprise.|$|E

Microsoft provided troubleshooting instructions that <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> initially not easily accessible to many users. For updates KB2769165 and KB2770917, which caused similar issues on some laptop computers, Microsoft did not immediately release workarounds.|$|E
25|$|To the {{northeast}} {{it appears that}} the Tungri's district reached into {{the northern part of the}} Netherlands province of Limburg, which is where the districts of the pagus Vellaus and the pagus Catualinus <b>apparently</b> <b>were.</b> It may even have stretched over the Meuse in places. On the other hand, in this direction also lay the Civitas Traianensis, inhabited by the Cugerni, and apparently also the Baetasii, which may have also stretched into this same region of the modern Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Venice {{developed}} {{methods of}} mass-producing warships in the Arsenal, including the frame-first system {{to replace the}} Roman hull-first practice. This new system was much faster and required less wood. At the peak of its efficiency in the early 16th century, the Arsenal employed some 16,000 people who <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> able to produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly built galley with standardized parts on a production-line basis not seen again until the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{two small}} Western Australia populations <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> {{able to survive}} because both areas have many hollow logs that may serve as refuge from predators. Being diurnal, the numbat is much more {{vulnerable}} to predation than most other marsupials of a similar size: its natural predators include the little eagle, brown goshawk, collared sparrowhawk and carpet python. When the Western Australia government instituted an experimental program of fox baiting at Dryandra (one of the two remaining sites), numbat sightings increased {{by a factor of}} 40.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 {{she moved}} back to New York without McCarthy, and the two <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> {{divorced}} sometime that year. She began plans for a portfolio of African Americans and interviewed several families in Harlem with whom she hoped to live while documenting their lives. While there she encountered painter Wallace Putnam, whom she had met {{the last time she}} lived in New York. Within three months they were married. They spent part of their honeymoon visiting Alfred Stieglitz at his home at Lake George.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} {{would have}} to be by the Confederation itself. The chiefs <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> not able to persuade King Min Bin of Arakan to stay in the alliance; Mrauk-U did not contribute any troops. By December 1543, the seven chiefs of the Confederation had assembled a large army (16,000 army troops, 1000 horses, 120 elephants) and a large navy (12,000 troops, 300 large war boats, 300 fast war boats, 500 cargo boats). They planned to take Prome with their massive naval and land forces; fortify Prome; launch an attack on Toungoo; and launch a joint attack on Pegu.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the evidence about the waitoreke is from sightings. However some alleged physical evidence does exist. Several unidentified tracks have been found. They were described as being a few inches long and showing webbing. Otter footprints show a little webbing but beaver footprints show full webbing. In 1868 Julius von Haast obtained an alleged waitoreke pelt. It was in very bad condition and was not conclusively identified. Described as being brown and having white spots, {{it seems to have}} approximately that of quolls which are not present in New Zealand (and <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> never: Antoni & Wodzicki 1984).|$|E
25|$|Much {{speculation}} {{has taken}} place {{about the nature of}} destriers and about the size they attained. They <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> not enormous draft types. Recent research undertaken at the Museum of London, using literary, pictorial and archeological sources, suggests war horses (including destriers) averaged 14–15 hands, and differed from a riding horse in their strength, musculature and training, rather than in their size. An analysis of medieval horse armour located in the Royal Armouries indicates the equipment was originally worn by horses of 15 to 16 hands, about the size and build of a modern field hunter or ordinary riding horse.|$|E
25|$|Most of Beauregard's brigades {{remained}} on the Confederate right, since Beauregard still hoped to launch {{an attack on the}} Union left wing. However, because of contradictory and confusing orders, some of which <b>apparently</b> <b>were</b> never delivered to the intended recipients, the attack was never launched. The brigades on this part of the field never fought at all or participated in only minor skirmishing. David R. Jones and James Longstreet crossed Bull Run and attempted to organize an attack but following a brief skirmish Jones' brigade was thrown back due to heavy artillery fire. Both brigades subsequently withdrew back to Bull Run.|$|E
