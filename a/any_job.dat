Aiming to bring the troupe to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 when the news arrived that a total ban was about to be placed on Yiddish theater in Russia.|$|E

He becomes acquainted with Gopal, with whose {{recommendation}} he becomes Raju's personal house servant. When Sathyamurthy displays his mother's photograph at his house to pray for her, it is revealed that Sathyamurthy {{is the son of}} Raju and Parvathi. Parvathi had survived the accident, was cared for by Murugan and died a few years after giving birth to Sathyamurthy without divulging the identity of Raju to Sathyamurthy and Murugan. Sathyamurthy improves his reading and writing skills with the help of Sundaram's daughter, Gowri (Bharathi Vishnuvardhan) and the two fall in love. When Raju learns of their love, he approves of their marriage. Gopal comes to know that Sathyamurthy is Raju's son, but dies of a sudden heart attack before revealing it.|$|E

5|$|Within certain conditions, {{characters}} {{can perform}} Special Moves, customizable powerful moves tied to Jobs: after a Special Move is performed, the entire party is granted buffs {{for a limited}} period. This period is represented with a specific tune that plays over normal battle music. Various elements {{can be added to}} Special Moves, such as granting elemental properties, launching status ailments at enemies, recovering HP and MP, and temporary status ailment immunity to the party. The customization of Special Moves is directly tied to the creation of specialist shops during the reconstruction of Norende. Experience points acquired {{at the end of a}} battle enable characters and their assigned Jobs to level up, unlocking new abilities and boosting character stats such as available HP and MP. Bonuses are gained if the party fulfilled certain conditions. Job abilities and levels can also be borrowed from online friends, in a feature called Abilink. <b>Any</b> <b>Job</b> can be borrowed from available players regardless of their current level.|$|E
5|$|While {{reports by}} owners of fitting names are of interest, some {{scientists}} have questioned their value {{in deciding whether}} nominative determinism is a real effect. Instead, {{they argue that the}} claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham et al. for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham et al. to find people named Dennis to have <b>any</b> <b>job,</b> not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.|$|E

25|$|About 15 {{families}} from Bosnia settled in St. Louis in 1960 and 1970.

25|$|Music scholar Martha Hume wrote:When you shake all the {{stardust}} {{off this}} tale, {{what you must}} begin with is an uneducated child {{from one of the}} most isolated cultures in the United States who was given in marriage to a man some six years her senior, a man who was a violent and sometimes brutal alcoholic, who was similarly uneducated and without <b>any</b> <b>job</b> skills to speak of. Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where the child had no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that there were times when the family had nothing to eat but dandelion greens, and you have a situation that might well have led to murder. But what actually happened was so improbable, so unimaginable, that the lives of Loretta and Mooney Lynn became one of the great legends of the twentieth century.|$|E

500|$|In battle, JP {{are rewarded}} for every {{successful}} action. JP {{are used to}} learn new abilities within each job class. Accumulating enough JP results in a job level up; new jobs are unlocked by attaining a certain level in the current job class (for instance, to become a Priest or Wizard, the unit must first attain Job Level 2 as a Chemist), which also allows the character to gain more JP in that class in battles. Once all the abilities of a job class have been learned, the class is [...] "Mastered". A soldier in a specific Job always has its innate skill equipped (Wizards always have [...] "Black Magic," [...] Knights always have [...] "Battle Skill") but a second job-skill slot and several other ability slots (Reaction, Support, and Movement) can be filled with any skill the particular soldier has learned from <b>any</b> <b>job</b> class.

500|$|As a boy, Rabi was {{interested}} in science. He read science books borrowed from the public library and built his own radio set. His first scientific paper, {{on the design of}} a radio condenser, was published in Modern Electrics when he was in elementary school.

[...] As a compromise with his parents, for his Bar Mitzvah, which was held at home, he gave a speech in Yiddish about how an electric light works. He attended the Manual Training High School in Brooklyn, from which he graduated in 1916. Later that year, he entered Cornell University as an electrical engineering student, but soon switched to chemistry. After the American entry into World War I in 1917, he joined the Student Army Training Corps at Cornell. For his senior thesis, he investigated the oxidation states of manganese. He was awarded his Bachelor of Science degree in June 1919, but since at the time Jews were largely excluded from employment in the chemical industry and academia, he did not receive <b>any</b> <b>job</b> offers.

30|$|To {{capture the}} {{differences}} in the labour market situation between East and West Germany, we split the sample by region (Table  5). We find that One-Euro-Job announcements increase job search and application activities in West Germany, but not in East Germany.

As the initial willingness to look for <b>any</b> possible <b>job</b> is lower in West Germany [25 % compared to 35 % (East)], there might be more scope for adjustments due to treatment.
