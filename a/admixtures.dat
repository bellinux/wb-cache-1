5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied <b>admixtures</b> of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E

40|$|Admixed {{populations have}} been used for {{inferring}} migrations, detecting natural selection, and finding disease genes. These applications often use a simple statistical model of <b>admixture</b> rather than a modeling perspective that incorporates a more realistic history of the <b>admixture</b> process. Here, we develop a general model of <b>admixture</b> that mechanistically accounts for complex historical <b>admixture</b> processes. We consider two source populations contributing to the ancestry of a hybrid population, potentially with variable contributions across generations. For a random individual in the hybrid population at a given point in time, we study the fraction of genetic <b>admixture</b> originating from a specific one of the source populations by computing its moments as functions of time and of introgression parameters. We show that very different <b>admixture</b> processes can produce identical mean <b>admixture</b> proportions, but that such processes produce different values for the variance of the <b>admixture</b> proportion. When introgression parameters from each source population are constant over time, the long-term limit of the expectation of the <b>admixture</b> proportion depends only on the ratio of the introgression parameters. The variance of <b>admixture</b> decreases quickly over time after the source populations stop contributing to the hybrid population, but remains substantial when the contributions are ongoing. Our approach will facilitate the understanding of <b>admixture</b> mechanisms, illustrating how the moments of the distribution of <b>admixture</b> proportions can be informative about the historical <b>admixture</b> processes contributing to the genetic diversity of hybrid populations...|$|R

40|$|Several {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} to calculate the relative contributions of parental populations in single <b>admixture</b> event scenarios, including Bayesian methods. In many breeds and populations, it may be more realistic to consider multiple <b>admixture</b> events. However, no approach has been developed to date to estimate <b>admixture</b> in such cases. This report describes a program application, 2 BAD (for 2 -event Bayesian <b>ADmixture),</b> which allows the consideration of up to two independent <b>admixture</b> events involving two or three parental populations and a single admixed population, depending on the number of populations sampled. For each of these models, it is possible to estimate several parameters (<b>admixture,</b> effective sizes, etc.) using an approximate Bayesian computation approach. In addition, the program allows comparing pairs of <b>admixture</b> models, determining which is the most likely given data. The application was tested through simulations and was found to provide good estimates for the contribution of the populations at the two <b>admixture</b> events. We were also able to determine whether an <b>admixture</b> model was more likely than a simple split model...|$|R
25|$|Mineral <b>admixtures</b> are {{becoming}} more popular in recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are fly ash, a by-product of coal-fired power plants, ground granulated blast furnace slag, a byproduct of steelmaking, and silica fume, a byproduct of industrial electric arc furnaces. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the mineral <b>admixtures</b> act as a partial cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while {{reducing the amount of}} industrial waste that must be disposed of. Mineral <b>admixtures</b> can be pre-blended with the cement during its production for sale and use as a blended cement, or mixed directly with other components when the concrete is produced.|$|E

40|$|Genetic <b>admixture</b> of {{divergent}} intraspecific lineages {{is increasingly}} suspected {{to have an}} important role in the success of colonising populations. However, <b>admixture</b> is not a universally beneficial genetic phenomenon. Selection is typically expected to favour locally adapted genotypes and can act against admixed individuals, suggesting that there are some conditions under which <b>admixture</b> will have negative impacts on population fitness. Therefore, it remains unclear how often <b>admixture</b> acts as a true driver of colonisation success. Here, we review the population consequences of <b>admixture</b> and discuss its costs and benefits across a broad spectrum of ecological contexts. We critically evaluate the evidence for a causal role of <b>admixture</b> in successful colonisation, and consider that role more generally in driving population range expansion...|$|R

The <b>admixtures,</b> {{which include a}} dye, rubber, rosin, resin and colophony, adjust the hardness of the wax to tailor the effectiveness of its grip for specific, discrete temperature ranges (from approximately -25°F to +35°F); waxes are graded and color-coded according to these temperature ranges. Harder grip waxes are designed for colder snow temperatures, but grip poorly in warm temperatures. Conversely, softer waxes in cold temperatures create enough friction and melting that the melt layer may accumulate and promote frozen accretion of snow.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe genetic <b>admixture</b> is {{a dynamic}} and dia- chronic process, taking place during {{a great number of}} generations. Consequently, a sole <b>admixture</b> rate does not {{represent}} such an event and several estimates could help to take into account its dynamics. We developed an Admix- ture Indicative Interval (AII) which gives a mathematical key to avoid this problem by integrating several <b>admixture</b> estimators and their respective accuracy into a single metric and provides a trend in genetic <b>admixture.</b> To illustrate AIIs interests in <b>admixture</b> studies, AII were calculated using seven estimators on two sets of simulated SNPs data generated under two different <b>admixture</b> sce- narios and were then calculated from several published admixed population data: a Comorian population and several Puerto-Rican and Colombian populations for recent <b>admixture</b> events as well as European populations repre- senting the Neolithic/Paleolithic <b>admixture</b> for an older event. Our method provides intervals taking properly the variability and accuracy of <b>admixture</b> estimates into account. The AII lays in the intuitive interval in all actual and simulated datasets and is not biased by divergent points by the mean of a double-weighting step. The great quantity of heterogeneous parental contributions is synthesized by a few AII, which turn out to be more manageable and meaningful than aplenty variable point estimates. This offers an improvement in <b>admixture</b> study, allowing a better understanding of migratory flows. Furthermore, it offers a better assessment of <b>admixture</b> than the arithmetic mean, and enhances comparisons between regions, sam- ples, and between studies on same population...|$|R

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) is often employed to test for population admixture; however, its power is generally unknown. Through analytical and simulation approaches, we quantify {{the power of the}} HWE test for population <b>admixture</b> and the effects of population <b>admixture</b> on increasing the type I error rate of association studies under various scenarios of population differentiation and <b>admixture.</b> We found that (1) the power of the HWE test for detecting population <b>admixture</b> is usually small; (2) population <b>admixture</b> seriously elevates type I error rate for detecting genes underlying complex traits, the extent of which depends on the degrees of population differentiation and admixture; (3) HWE testing for population <b>admixture</b> should be performed with random samples or only with controls at the candidate genes, or the test can be performed for combined samples of cases and controls at marker loci that are not linked to the disease; (4) testing HWE for population <b>admixture</b> generally reduces false positive association findings of genes underlying complex traits but the effect is small; and (5) with population <b>admixture,</b> a linkage disequilibrium method that employs cases only is more robust and yields many fewer false positive findings than conventional case-control analyses.

25|$|Decisions can be complex <b>admixtures</b> {{of facts}} and values.

A person may identify himself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited. The fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications may either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization.

In the presence of recombination, this linkage disequilibrium declines with time, a fact that is often ignored when considering haplotypes of closely linked systems [e. g., Gm serum group (gamma globulins), HLA, and, more recently, restriction fragment length polymorphisms]. Recombination alters haplotype frequencies over time, and the haplotype-derived measures of <b>admixture</b> proportions from haplotype frequencies in generations following the <b>admixture</b> event become progressively more biased. The direction and extent of this bias can be predicted only when the history of <b>admixture</b> is known. Numerical illustration suggests that this bias is problematic whenever rt greater than 0. 05, where r is the recombination rate between linked loci and t is the time (in generations) that has elapsed since the <b>admixture</b> event.
