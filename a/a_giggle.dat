500|$|Michel {{has spoken}} out against entertainment-type cooking {{shows such as}} the 1990s cooking gameshow Can't Cook, Won't Cook, saying that [...] "The way these people handle food is a crime. They don't even know the basics. Little {{attention}} is paid to detail. Instead, they are intent on having <b>a</b> <b>giggle</b> and a joke. They can do this without involving food." [...] The Roux brothers had a BBC television show in the early eighties.|$|E
500|$|... "Wannabe" [...] was {{completed}} in thirty minutes—mainly because the group had written and composed parts of the song beforehand—in what Brown describes as a [...] "sudden creative frenzy." [...] During the session, Brown and Bunton {{came up with the}} idea of including a rap near the end of the song. At this point the group got very motivated, and incorporated the word [...] "zigazig-ha" [...] into the lyrics. Chisholm told Billboard magazine: [...] "You know when you're in a gang and you're having a laugh and you make up silly words? Well we were having <b>a</b> <b>giggle</b> and we made up this silly word, zigazig-ha. We were in the studio and it all came together in this song." ...|$|E
500|$|Apu sells Homer a beer keg for the American Civil War reenactment of the Battle of Springfield.

After the battle, Homer brings the empty, dented keg back to Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart {{in an attempt to}} get the deposit. There, he hears <b>a</b> <b>giggle</b> coming from a closet and finds Apu making love with the woman who delivers Squishees to Kwik-E-Mart. He then walks backwards in shock all the way home to his bed and then dreams about walking backwards when he falls asleep.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{warehouse}} {{is eight}} or ten miles out of town, so I am not much bothered by visitors, which is a relief. Such <b>a</b> <b>giggling,</b> sniggering lot you never saw! ...|$|R
60|$|In <b>a</b> <b>giggling</b> peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy {{your other}} eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high {{piercing}} notes.|$|R

It drew <b>a</b> <b>giggle</b> from the audience, including Priscilla.|$|E
2500|$|In Davidson's first {{autobiography}} The Full Monty (1993), {{he talked}} about his violent and abusive behaviour towards his wife in a light-hearted manner: [...] "We’re like a couple of boxers. On the first occasion, I poked her in the eye by accident. I actually went for the mouth. Thank heaven I missed, I’d have fallen in. I just took a playful punch. Unfortunately I caught her completely wrong. The second time I gave her a shiner. I threw a bunch of keys which whacked her in the eye. Just for <b>a</b> <b>giggle</b> she kept blackening it up to make it look worse." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the anime Hetalia, a zashiki warashi {{appeared}} as <b>a</b> <b>giggling</b> spirit.

60|$|Mr. Lowten, with <b>a</b> distant <b>giggle,</b> {{replied in}} the affirmative.|$|R
6000|$|... "Carrie" [...] was, in {{the less}} {{desirable}} aspects of both, at once matronly and spinsterish. She was perhaps forty; her hair was an unconvincing ash-blond; and if her chest was flat, her hips were ponderous.

60|$|A sound {{suspiciously like}} <b>a</b> <b>giggle</b> {{came from the}} landing and fell heavily on Gale's ears. He {{closed his eyes and}} tried to think.|$|E

60|$|She meant this {{assertion}} {{to be very}} impressive, {{but it did not}} seem to affect the man in the least. She sighed, and Flo, with <b>a</b> <b>giggle,</b> broke an awkward pause.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My daughter's your wife, Mr Quilp, certainly,' {{said the}} old lady with <b>a</b> <b>giggle,</b> meant for satirical and to imply {{that he needed to}} be {{reminded}} of the fact; 'your wedded wife.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Again {{they were}} silent. A puff of wind ruffled the leaves; the night, for a moment, seemed full of whispering; {{then the sound}} of <b>a</b> <b>giggle</b> jarred out and a girl's voice: ...|$|E
60|$|Here <b>a</b> smothered <b>giggle</b> from Amanda {{caused the}} old lady to say 'Bless you!' {{thinking}} the dear girl had sneezed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{guess you}} can," [...] said Ephraim, and hobbled {{confidently}} {{in at the}} doorway. There we will leave {{him for a while}} conversing in an undertone with a floor-walker, and follow Jethro.

60|$|This {{attempt at}} a jest was {{attended}} by <b>a</b> hysterical <b>giggle,</b> which poor Sir Arthur intended should sound as an indifferent laugh.|$|R
50|$|Edmund's next {{strategy}} is {{to get out of}} the marriage by marrying someone else. He sends Percy to find a suitable fiancée while Baldrick kidnaps a priest to perform the ceremony.
