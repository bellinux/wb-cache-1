25|$|In 1261, the Empire of Nicaea {{was ruled}} by John IV Laskaris, <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>of</b> ten years. However, John IV was overshadowed by his co-emperor, Michael VIII Palaiologos.

25|$|William Gilbert Puckey {{arrived with}} his parents in 1819, then joined the CMS in 1821. He helped build, then served as the mate of the 55-foot {{schooner}} Herald. He went to Sydney {{with his parents}} in 1826 {{then returned to the}} Bay of Islands the following year. He and Joseph Matthews established the Kaitaia Mission in 1834. As he had become fluent in the language since arriving as <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>of</b> 14, he was a useful translator for the CMS mission, including collaborating with William Williams on the translation of the New Testament in 1837 and its revision in 1844.|$|E
25|$|The town (not {{counting}} the Roman villages now within its boundaries) {{is believed to}} have been founded by Anglo-Saxons around AD 600. In AD 853, Æthelswith (sister to Alfred the Great) married King Burgred of Mercia at Chippenham. Alfred was then <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>of</b> four and the wedding was held on the site of St Andrew's church. According to Bishop Asser's Life of King Alfred, Chippenham was, under Alfred's reign, a royal vill; historians have also argued, from its proximity to the royal forests at Melksham and Barden, that it was probably a hunting lodge. Alfred's daughter was also married in Chippenham.|$|E
25|$|The first {{documented}} case of child-snatching {{and murder}} concerns <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>of</b> twelve called Jeudon (first name unknown), an apprentice to the furrier Guillaume Hilairet. Gilles de Rais' cousins, Gilles de Sillé and Roger de Briqueville, asked the furrier to lend them {{the boy to}} take a message to Machecoul, and, when Jeudon did not return, the two noblemen told the inquiring furrier that they were ignorant of the boy's whereabouts and suggested he had been carried off by thieves at Tiffauges to {{be made into a}} page. In Gilles de Rais' trial, the events were testified to by Hillairet and his wife, the boy's father Jean Jeudon, and five others from Machecoul.|$|E

25|$|Durova's {{youthful}} appearance {{hurt her}} chances for promotion. In {{an era when}} Russian officers were expected to grow a mustache she looked like <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>of</b> sixteen. She transferred away from the hussars to the Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment {{in order to avoid}} the colonel's daughter who had fallen in love with her. Durova saw action again during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. She fought in the Battle of Smolensk. During the Battle of Borodino a cannonball wounded her in the leg, yet she continued serving full duty for several days afterward until her command ordered her away to recuperate. She retired from the army in 1816 with the rank of stabs-rotmistr, the equivalent of captain-lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|A crisis {{over the}} issue of abdication emerged. Bowing to {{increasing}} pressure from the West and general civil discontent, Cixi did not forcibly remove the Guangxu Emperor from the throne, although she attempted to have Pujun, <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>of</b> 14 who was from a close branch of the imperial family, installed as crown prince. The Guangxu era nominally continued until his death in 1908, but the emperor lost all respect, power, and privileges, including his freedom of movement. Most of his supporters, including his political mentor Kang Youwei, fled into exile, and the six prominent reformers including Tan Sitong and Kang's younger brother, were publicly beheaded. Kang continued to work for a constitutional monarchy while in exile, remaining loyal to the Guangxu Emperor and hoping eventually to restore him to power. His efforts would prove to be in vain.|$|E
25|$|Soon, Villeneuve's uncle, Jacques Sr., {{enrolled}} {{him at the}} Jim Russell Racing Driver School in Mont Tremblant, Quebec. Villeneuve's course lasted {{three days}} {{and in that time}} the Canadian demonstrated a great amount of concentration for <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>of</b> his age. At the end of his course, the young Canadian received his diploma and chief instructor Gilbert Pednault declared Villeneuve as the best student he'd ever seen. During the summer of 1987, Villeneuve attended a racing school set up by former instructor Richard Spenard. In return for helping in the garage, the Canadian received guidance in terms of race craft as he attempted to hone his skills. At the age of seventeen, Villeneuve was too young to obtain a racing license in both his native Canada and Italy and so, with help from the Canadian Automotive Federation, got a license from Andorra.|$|E

25|$|The tours {{provided}} Ruskin {{with the}} opportunity to observe and to record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant if largely conventional poetry, some of which was published in Friendship's Offering. His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>of</b> his age. He was profoundly affected by a copy of Samuel Rogers's poem, Italy (1830), which was given to him as a 13th birthday present. In particular, he admired deeply the accompanying illustrations by J. M. W. Turner, and much of his art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and Samuel Prout whose Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, Copley Fielding and James Duffield Harding. Gradually, he abandoned his picturesque style in favour of naturalism.|$|E
500|$|As <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>of</b> {{just two}} or three, Gaius {{accompanied}} his father, Germanicus, on campaigns {{in the north}} of Germania. The soldiers were amused that Gaius was dressed in a miniature soldier's outfit, including boots and armour. He was soon given his nickname Caligula, meaning [...] "little (soldier's) boot" [...] in Latin, after the small boots he wore. Gaius, though, reportedly grew to dislike this nickname.|$|E
