40|$|IT {{may still}} not be widely {{appreciated}} that {{a broad spectrum}} of persistent, or relapsing, mental abnormality can occur in <b>avitaminosis</b> B 12 in the absence of anaemia, megaloblastic erythropoiesis, or any clinical evidence of subacute combined degeneration of the cord. Langdon first drew attention to such a possibility in 1905, long before either the pathogenesis of pernicious anaemia was understood, or marrow biopsy was established as an investigation. His paper, 'Nervous and Mental manifestations of pre-pernicious anaemia', was initially much criticized, but subsequently McAlpine (1929) confirmed that the cerebral manifestations sometimes 'preceded the characteristic changes in the blood by many months'. Despite these early papers and recent advances in our know-ledge, there are still very few reports in which the possibility that mental abnor-mality was 'Addisonian ' in type had been considered before haematological or spinal-cord abnormality had developed. In 1956 Holmes renewed interest in this problem by reporting 14 patients with 'encephalopathy due to vitamin B 12 deficiency'. In only one of his cases, however, was the diagnosis made in th...|$|E

Electroretinography in cases of vitamin A deficiency in children and adults has been extensively studied by Dhanda (1952 - 1956). As vitamin A deficiency occurs mainly in children with severe malnutrition, it was considered desirable to study the retinal electrical potential in severely undernourished children so as to assess whether the features reported earlier could be considered as specific of <b>avitaminosis</b> A or not.

The specificity and cure of the cardiac manifestations of this <b>avitaminosis</b> recently were reaffirmed by Hashimoto, 1 who reported {{a case in}} which dramatic recovery followed the intravenous ad-ministration of minute quantities of purified and concentrated vitamin Bx. The condition may manifest itself in a ' dry ' type, characterized by muscle wasting and peripheral neuritis, or a ' wet ' type in which generalized edema and cardiovascular disturbances predominate. The combination of an acute form of one type with a mild form of the other is uncommon, and likewise the pres-ence of a severe form of both types in the same individual is rare. 2 A low standard of living, derangements of pregnancy resulting in poor food intake or utilization and chronic alcoholism are instances in which the outstand-ing factor is the inability or reluctance of the patient to obtain or to utilize a diet adequate in vitamin requirements. * Received for publication August 3, 1938...|$|E

Since then, recorded history reports the frequent recurrence of epidemics of edema in periods of famine. 1 The condition particularly attracted the attention of the medical profession in Central Europe during its outbreak in the First World War, when it became known as "War Edema.,, These observers were the first to appreciate the importance of the dietary factor in the etiology of this disease. They excluded infectious factors and considered <b>avitaminosis</b> unlikely in the etiology. Knack and Neumann, 2 Lippman, 3 and Schittenhelm and Schlecht 4 were the first to carry out serum protein determinations on patients with war edema (by refractometric methods).

40|$|GOOD {{nutrition}} depends {{not only}} on the intake of sufficient amounts of all the substances required for normal metabolic processes but also on their adequate absorption, storage and utilization. In the case of most of the vitamins it is probable that optimal intake varies with the demands of the body for energy production, repair or growth. The requirements for some members of the B group are definitely dependent on the composition of the diet and it is likely that there are interrelations or synergistic reactions be-tween vitamins which further condition the requirements. 1, 2 ' 3 ' 4 The development of <b>avitaminosis</b> is due to the failure or perversion of normal biochemical reactions which can be completed only when adequate supplies of vitamins are available.
