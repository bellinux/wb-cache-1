5|$|By July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN's) {{remaining}} large warships {{were unable}} to put to sea due to shortages of fuel and the dangers of attack from Allied aircraft and submarines. While most of these warships were anchored near the major naval base at Kure and other locations in the Seto Inland Sea, Nagato and several smaller warships were stationed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Tokyo Bay. At this time the battleship was moored alongside a pier facing northwest and covered in camouflage that was intended to make her difficult for aircraft to spot. All of Nagatos secondary armament and about half her anti-aircraft guns had been removed and emplaced on nearby hills from where they could provide protection to the naval base. Although the battleship's boilers were not lit, she received steam and power from the submarine chaser Fukugawa Maru No.7 and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>boiler</b> located on the pier. The destroyer Ushio was also docked nearby {{in a position where}} she was able to protect the battleship with her 25mm anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
25|$|Tarmo {{had five}} {{coal-fired}} boilers {{for the main}} engines in two boiler rooms and a small <b>auxiliary</b> <b>boiler</b> for heating, deck equipment and electricity generation. Her midship fuel stores could hold 450 tons of coal, which was fed to the fireboxes {{at a rate of}} 3–4 tons per hour by six stokers and was enough for roughly one week of sailing in ice.|$|E
25|$|Sampo was {{powered by}} two triple-expansion steam engines, one driving a {{propeller}} in the stern {{and the other}} a second propeller in the bow. The main function of the bow propeller was to reduce friction between the hull and the ice, although the exact details of the icebreaking process were not known at that time. The stern engine produced 1,600 ihp at 110 rpm and the bow engine 1,400 ihp at 115 rpm. During the sea trials the maximum indicated output of the two steam engines was 3,052 ihp and when the engines were producing 2,500 ihp, the icebreaker could maintain a speed of 12.4 knots in open water. Sampo had five coal-fired boilers for the main engines in two boiler rooms and a small <b>auxiliary</b> <b>boiler</b> for heating, deck equipment and light generator in the foremost boiler room. The fuel stores could hold 350 tons of coal that was fed to the fireboxes at a rate of 2.4–3.2 tons per hour. Like all icebreakers of her age, Sampo was also equipped with sails although they were rarely, if ever, used.|$|E

500|$|An <b>auxiliary</b> <b>boiler</b> {{was added}} to provide steam for the engines that powered the turrets, fans and {{steering}} and little to nothing was done to reinforce the hull to withstand {{the weight of her}} armor and turrets. The deck beneath each [...] turret was reinforced by a series of stanchions that transferred their weight to the ship's bottom, which was not reinforced to handle their weight. The stress caused Roanoke to leak around [...] per day {{by the end of the}} war. In her new configuration, her crew numbered 347 officers and men.|$|E
500|$|The sixth, {{ninth and}} thirteenth salvos were {{straddles}} and two decisive hits {{were made on}} Bismarck. One shell holed her bow and caused Bismarck to lose 1,000 tons of fuel oil, mostly to salt-water contamination. The other fell short, and entered Bismarck below her side armour belt, the shell exploded and flooded the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>boiler</b> machinery room and forced the shutdown of two boilers due to a slow leak in the boiler room immediately aft. The loss of fuel and boiler power were decisive factors in the Bismarcks decision to return to port. In Prince of Wales, [...] "A1" [...] gun ceased fire after the first salvo due to a defect. Sporadic breakdowns occurred until the decision to turn away was made, and during the turn [...] "Y" [...] turret jammed.|$|E
500|$|Königsberg {{was hit by}} {{at least}} five [...] bombs, which caused serious damage to the ship. One {{penetrated}} her thin deck armor, went through the ship, and exploded in the water, causing significant structural damage. Another hit destroyed the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>boiler</b> room. Two more bombs exploded in the water next to the ship; the concussion from the blasts tore large holes in the hull. She took on a heavy list almost immediately, and the captain ordered the crew to abandon the ship. It took slightly less than three hours {{from the start of}} the attack for the ship to completely capsize and sink, which gave the crew enough time to evacuate many of the dead and wounded. They also had time to remove a significant amount of ammunition and equipment from the stricken cruiser. Only eighteen men were killed in the attack. The wreck was raised on 17 July 1942, and slowly broken up for scrap thereafter. By 1943, the wreck had been completely dismantled in situ.|$|E

2500|$|The Alexander Chaplin & Co. distilling {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} initially {{for use on}} board steam vessels where it could be supplied with steam from either the main boiler or a donkey boiler with cooling water circulation from a pump driven from the main engine or an auxiliary. The subsequent addition of a steam powered circulating pump integral with the apparatus meant it could then {{also be used as}} a standalone apparatus on any vessel equipped with an existing donkey (<b>auxiliary)</b> <b>boiler,</b> such as a sailing ship equipped with steam winches. The apparatus consisted of a coiled condensing pipe approximately [...] in length placed inside a cylindrical casing filled with constantly changed cooling water. The casing was cast iron and the coils were made of copper. The coils were supplied with steam either from the exhaust of the engine, or from a feed directly from the boiler. A circulating pump, either driven from the main engine on a steam ship, or integrated with the apparatus on a sailing ship, supplied a constant stream of cooling water flowing through the condenser. A covered brass cup with small adjustable holes around the circumference was fitted at {{the upper end of the}} steam coil. In operation, a steam jet drew air in from the circumferential openings in the cup and filled the coils with a mixture of air and steam, both cooling the steam and reducing its pressure. As it passed down the coil, the air/steam mixture was further cooled by the surrounding water, and condensed as water droplets on the walls of the coil. The aerated water would collect as a clear, bright and odourless liquid at a temperature of about [...] at the bottom of the coil, to be drawn off for use. The machine could supply approximately [...] of water per hour.

2500|$|King George V was {{the first}} ship of the class to join the Home Fleet on 11 December 1940 and her first action was {{providing}} distant cover for Operation Claymore in February 1941, before escorting Atlantic convoys, HX 114-115 during March. Owing {{to the threat of}} the German battleship Bismarck, the Home Fleet sent King George V and the newly completed Prince of Wales on 22 May to help locate Bismarck, along with the battlecruiser [...] and six destroyers. On 24 May, Prince of Wales and Hood made contact with Bismarck and opened fire at 26,000 yards. Prince of Wales sixth salvo straddled Bismarck and it was during this salvo, and one other, that she landed two decisive hits, holing Bismarcks bow, flooding a generator room and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>boiler</b> room, and forcing the critical shutdown of two of her boilers, which led to Bismarck making the fateful decision to attempt to return to port. During this time the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen had been solely targeting Hood and at 06:01 she blew up and sank, with the loss of all but three of her complement of 1,419 officers and men. Following this, Captain Leach (Prince of Wales′s captain) gave the order to disengage, laying a heavy smokescreen to facilitate the retreat. Prince of Wales would attempt to reengage Bismarck on two more occasions, but owing to the distance being in excess of 20,000 yards was unable to land any more hits and was forced to return to Iceland to refuel and would play no further part in actions against Bismarck. Meanwhile, King George V on 24 May was still 300 to 400 miles away from Bismarck and it wasn't until 27 May that King George V and [...] were able to engage Bismarck, due to a Swordfish torpedo bomber disabling Bismarck's steering gear on 26 May. During the engagement King George V and Rodney were able to relatively quickly disable the main armament turrets and fire-control systems of Bismarck, rendering her unable to effectively engage the British ships; later they closed to point-blank range. After 32 min of firing King George V had fired 335 14-inch shells at Bismarck, scoring multiple hits that contributed to Bismarck sinking soon after.|$|E
