We conclude, among other things, that visibility of the policy process, accountability of politicians and policy makers vis-a`-vis their stakeholders and the EU, division of responsibilities for policy formulation vs. implementation and the involvement of the public explain the level of ambition in EU implementation to a considerable extent. Thus, the Lundqvist variables turn out to be useful for both classifying and explaining differences in EU implementation processes. [URL] Economics, Extension and Rural Developmen...|$|R

40|$|Planning {{faces the}} predicament that as {{recommendations}} become bolder possibilities for implementation deteriorate. This is imputed to society's {{transition from a}} Fordist and modern to a post-Fordist and postmodern era. On the one hand, postmodern values account for more public participation and heightened environmental sensitivity, which translate into proposals for alternative forms of urban development. On the other hand, the implementation of these proposals is impaired by reduced public sector resources {{as a result of}} the economic instablity associated with post-Fordism. Another impediment is the difficulty to achieve sufficient support for planning objectives in the postmodern context. This context is marked by a fragmentation of values, attachment to the existing built environment, and suspicion between social groups. The empirical focus is on Toronto's bold metropolitan planning proposals. Most recent planning documents call for reurbanization efforts, a compact urban form, and reduced reliance on the car. In this paper I cast doubts, however, on the eventual actualization of these proposals by highlighting weaknesses in the of present and <b>anticipated</b> <b>implementation</b> context. These are tied to factors that are specific to Toronto, but also to a greater extent to the post-Fordist and postmodern environment. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of management science models has typically {{been studied in}} time frames of less than two years. Recommendations of government decisionmakers for improving the likelihood of successful model development, diffusion, and adoption {{have been based on}} these studies. Yet some factors important to the use of models do not emerge in the short term. This study examines model use over a longer time frame, and draws some policy implications. A survey was taken of 17 police departments live years after they implemented PCAM, the Patrol Car Allocation Model. Utilization (extent of use) and institutionalization (extent of organizational adaptation) were evaluated. Overall, there were few signs that use of PCAM had a major impact on the state of police patrol allocation. PCAM was found to be operational in six departments, and fully institutionalized in two. Based on patterns of use and nonuse, recommendations are made to enhance the long-term impact of future modeling projects. Among them are to survey user needs and give them a larger role in model development, to design models capable of an expanded range of tasks and of running on personal computers, and to include performance evaluation and feedback in all model-building projects.

The project is particularly timely, since facility upgrades are currently underway at the High Flux Isotope Reactor. A new neutron optical device, a multicrystal analyzer, was designed and built to take maximum advantage of the increased flux that the upgraded beamlines at HFIR will provide. This will make possible detailed studies of the magnetic structure of thin films, multilayers, and interfaces that are not feasible at present. We performed studies of the antiferromagnetic order in thin films and crystals using neutron scattering, determined magnetic structures at interfaces with neutron reflectometry and measured order in magnetic dispersions using small angle neutron scattering.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to {{describe}} the technological and computational shifts in the study of criminology and criminal justice as well as highlight the significances of dual computer-criminology degree programs. The FSU program description was used to provide an example of an ongoing dual computer-criminology program at both the undergraduate and graduate level. It is anticipated that some of the master’s students in computer-criminology will decide to continue their studies for a Ph.D., given the growing discipline and policy importance of cyber-crime. FSU is currently involved in discussions on the structure, content, and requirements for a Ph.D. in computer criminology. The expansion of the program would push for the advancement of research that informs public policy. For instance, compared to a master's degree that trains students to be informed, knowledgeable users of scientific research, the Ph.D. prepares students to conduct their own original research to generate new insights on issues of scientific and public policy importance. This necessarily emphasizes comprehensive training in theory, research methods, and statistics that would be specific to the study of cyber-crime. Thus, the goal of a Ph.D. program in computer criminology would be to produce Ph.D. graduates who could generate the new research needed to inform policymakers and the scientific community on the causes and consequences of cyber crime and the appropriate legal and extra-legal responses to it. In addition to the Ph.D. program, FSU is also currently involved is discussions on including the dual computer-criminology degree program with the FSU distance learning program to expand {{the number of students who}} are able to learn from the best researchers and instructors in the fields of criminology and computer science.

In this study, we examined 348 rotavirus strains obtained in 1996 to 1997 from children with diarrhea in 10 U. S. cities. Strains were characterized for P and G types, subgroups, and electropherotypes by using a combination of monoclonal antibody immunoassay, reverse transcription-PCR, and hybridization. The four strains most commonly found worldwide comprised 83 % of the isolates (P[8]G 1, 66. 4 %; P[4]G 2, 8. 3 %; P[8]G 3, 6. 9 %; P[8]G 4, 1. 4 %), but 9. 2 % were unusual strains (P[6]G 9, 5. 5 %; P[8]G 9, 1. 7 %; P[6]G 1, 1. 4 %; and P[4]G 1 and P[8]G 2, 0. 3 % each). Strains not typeable for P or G type accounted for 5. 5 % of the total, while 2. 3 % of the strains had more than one G type (mixed infections). All P[6]G 9 strains tested had short electropherotypes and subgroup I specificity and were detected in 4 of 10 cities, while P[8]G 9 strains had long electropherotypes and subgroup II VP 6 antigens. Both sequence analysis of the VP 7 open reading frame (about 94 to 95 % amino acid identity with the VP 7 gene of G 9 prototype strain WI 61) and binding to a G 9 -specific monoclonal antibody strongly suggest that U. S. G 9 strains belong to serotype G 9. The high detection rates of unusual rotaviruses with G 9 (7. 2 %) or P[6] (6. 9 %) specificity in multiple U.

40|$|Masters in Public Administration - MPAThe Namibian Government has {{recently}} embarked on {{the formulation of}} an empowerment strategy similar to South Africa’s Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) policy - the Transformation of Economic and Social Empowerment Framework (TESEF) for Namibia. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) more specifically, results-based M&E has also recently emerged worldwide as an important tool in public sector management reform and {{is focused on the}} attainment of outcomes and development results at project, programme and policy levels. The problem being investigated in this study concerns the shortage of evidence in BBBEE policy and legislative documentation of a coherent M&E framework inclusive of a set of indicators that can measure BBBEE progress against its set objectives and anticipated outcomes. Through an investigation on the state of an M&E framework for BBBEE and South Africa’s good experiences regarding the development of a Government-wide (including all sectors) coherent M&E system a number of lessons of experience have been drawn for the <b>anticipated</b> <b>implementation</b> and M&E framework of TESEF and the establishment of a Government-wide M&E system in Namibia. The study reveals that there is currently (May 2009) no comprehensive M&E framework inclusive of set of indicators in effect to measure BBBEE progress towards its objectives and anticipated outcomes. The suitability of available indicators to measure BBBEE derived from the South African Development Indicator framework (SADI) and the Compendium of Indicators for the Provincial Growth and Development Strategy (CIPGDS) of the Western Cape are assessed and the potential for indicator development has been explored. Through an appropriate methodology a comprehensive set of indicators that address the objectives and anticipated outcomes of BBBEE are developed and suggested in this study. The study found that while Namibia sees herself in the final phase of TESEF formulation with the release of the latest TESEF Draft Strategy Document (April 2008) the country also sets out plans in its National Development Plan (NDP 3) for period 2007 / 08 – 2011 / 12 for the establishment and institutionalisation of a government-wide M&E system dedicated to the results-based M&E approach. The study finds valuable lessons for Namibia in South Africa’s Government-wide M&E (GWM&E) system drawn from South Africa’s development of: a Policy Framework for GWM&E system; a comprehensive set of national development indicators across prioritised clusters (the South African Development Indicator framework); and the established public sector capacity building and M&E support organs such as the Public Administration Leadership and Management Academy (PALAMA) formerly known the South African Management Development Institute (SAMDI) and the South African Monitoring and Evaluation Association (SAMEA). Apart from the potential indicators to measure BBBEE developed as part of the study’s recommendations, the study also recommends that an M&E framework for TESEF is developed upon finalization of the policy’s objectives and anticipated outcomes and that this framework is included in the final TESEF design to guide its effective implementation...|$|E
40|$|Cold climate {{heat pump}} (HP) {{technology}} {{is relevant to}} {{a substantial portion of}} the U. S. population, especially with more than one-third of U. S. housing stock concentrated in colder regions of the country and another 31 % in the mixed-humid climate region. Specifically, it is estimated that in 2010 almost 1. 37 million heating equipment units were shipped to the cold/very cold climate regions and that 1. 41 million were shipped to the nation s mixed-humid region. On a national level, the trend in the last decade has indicated that shipments of gas furnaces have grown at a slower rate than HPs. This indicates a potential opportunity for the cold climate HP, a technology that may be initially slow to penetrate its potential market because of the less expensive operating and first costs of gas furnaces. <b>Anticipated</b> <b>implementation</b> of regional standards could also negatively affect gas furnace shipments, especially with the higher initial cost for more efficient gas furnaces. However, as of 2011, the fact that there are more than 500 gas furnace product models that already achieve the expected efficiency standard indicates that satisfying the regional standard will be a challenge but not an obstacle. A look at the heating fuel and equipment currently being used in the housing stock provides an insight into the competing equipment that cold climate HPs hope to replace. The primary target market for the cold climate HP is the 2. 6 million U. S. homes using electric furnaces and HPs in the cold/very cold region. It is estimated that 4. 75 % of these homeowners either replace or buy new heating equipment in a given year. Accordingly, the project team could infer that the cold climate HP primary market is composed of 123, 500 replacements of electric furnaces and conventional air-to-air HPs annually. A secondary housing market for the cold climate HP comprises homes in the mixed-humid region of the country that are using electric furnaces. Homes using gas furnaces across both the cold/very cold and mixed-humid regions represent another secondary market for the cold climate HP. The cold climate HP could also target as a secondary market homes across both the cold/very cold and mixed-humid regions that use propane and fuel oil as their primary heating fuel. The combined total of homes in these three secondary markets is 46 million, and we can also infer that about 2. 2 million of these systems are replaced annually. When comparing heating equipment stock in 2001, 2005, and 2009 in the cold/very cold region of the country, it appears that gas furnaces are slowly losing market share and that electric furnaces and HPs are making gains. The fact that electricity-dependent heating equipment is rising in preference among homeowners in the colder regions of the country shows that future penetration of the cold climate HP holds promise. Accordingly, cold climate HP technology could achieve an attractive position, given certain favorable market conditions such as reaching a competitive cost point, strong federal incentives, a consistent level of reliable performance, and a product rollout by a credible market leader. The project team relied on payback analysis to estimate the potential market penetration for the cold climate HP in each of its primary and secondary markets. In this analysis, we assumed a $ 250 price premium for the cold climate HP over the baseline HP. Electricity and gas prices and emissions were based on the 2010 Buildings Energy Data Book. The average heating load was calculated as 25. 2 MMBTU per year in the cold/very cold and mixed-humid regions of the United States. Typical installed costs were obtained from the technical document supporting the U. S. Department of Energy rulemaking. The analysis showed that the cold climate HP will have a 2. 2 year payback period when replacing an existing electric HP in the colder regions of the nation. The cold climate HP will have a 6 year payback period when replacing gas furnaces in the same climate regions. Accordingly, we estimated that the cold climate HP will have a penetration ratio ranging between 5 % and 35 % in its potential primary and secondary markets, resulting in a total annual estimated shipment of 298, 000 units to both targeted regions of the nation. Once the cold climate HP technology meets its potential market penetration, it would contribute to annual site energy savings of 3, 664, 405 MMBTU and a CO 2 emission reduction of 470, 000 Ton...|$|E

40|$|Phenomenon: Peer {{learning}} has many benefits and can assist students in gaining the educational skills required {{in future years}} when they become teachers themselves. Peer learning may be particularly useful in clinical learning environments, where students report feeling marginalized, overwhelmed, and unsupported. Educational interventions often fail in the workplace environment, as they are often conceived in the "ideal" rather than the complex, messy real world. This work sought to explore barriers and facilitators to implementing peer learning activities in a clinical curriculum. APPROACH: Previous peer learning research results and a matrix of empirically derived peer learning activities were presented to local clinical education experts to generate discussion around the realities of implementing such activities. Potential barriers and limitations of and strategies for implementing peer learning in clinical education were {{the focus of the}} individual interviews. FINDINGS: Thematic analysis of the data identified three key considerations for real-world implementation of peer learning: culture, epistemic authority, and the primacy of patient-centered care. Strategies for peer learning implementation were also developed from themes within the data, focusing on developing a culture of safety in which peer learning could be undertaken, engaging both educators and students, and establishing expectations for the use of peer learning.
