5|$|After {{the events}} of the {{original}} Clock Tower, central protagonist Jennifer Simpson was adopted by Helen Maxwell, an assistant professor of criminal psychology in Oslo, Norway. She begins undergoing treatment at a university research building in order {{to learn more about the}} Scissorman murder case at Barrows Castle and help her cope with her trauma. Over a year has passed, and now a series of brutal murders have made headline news. It appears that the Scissorman has returned. Having heard the details of Jennifer's original encounters with the Scissorman, Helen begins searching for information that could put an end to the seemingly immortal killer. The scenarios that follow, including the player characters and settings, <b>are</b> <b>vastly</b> different depending on player actions throughout the game.|$|E

For starter, in control theory a true closed-loop feedback pump will have to infuse not just rapid-acting insulin for positive errors, but also infuse glucagon for negative errors. For managing complex life situations, the pump will need several MEMS-based sensors to monitor more than just glucose, for example heart rate, breathing, ECG, temperature, CO2, blood pH, dissolved O2, etc.|$|E
25|$|Although Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR are {{constituents}} of China, they maintain their own immigration policies, which <b>are</b> <b>vastly</b> {{different from those}} of Mainland China, and individual border controls, which separate the territories from the Mainland. The Chinese government, however, does not consider Chinese nationals with resident status of Hong Kong and Macau travelling to China as international travelers, and hence the SAR passports or British National (Overseas) passports cannot be used when entering or transiting through China, regardless of whether they are arriving from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan or from overseas.|$|E
25|$|Food {{shipments}} {{in case of}} dire local shortage {{are generally}} uncontroversial; but as Amartya Sen has shown, most famines involve a local lack of income rather than of food. In such situations, food aid—as opposed to financial aid—has the effect of destroying local agriculture and serves mainly to benefit Western agribusiness which <b>are</b> <b>vastly</b> overproducing food {{as a result of}} agricultural subsidies. Historically, food aid is more highly correlated with excess supply in Western countries than with the needs of developing countries. Foreign aid has been an integral part of African economic development since the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary mission}} of the Viking probes of the mid-1970s was to carry out {{experiments}} designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil because the favorable conditions {{for the evolution of}} multicellular organisms ceased some four billion years ago on Mars. The tests were formulated to look for microbial life similar to that found on Earth. Of the four experiments, only the Labeled Release (LR) experiment returned a positive result, showing increased 14CO2 production on first exposure of soil to water and nutrients. All scientists agree on two points from the Viking missions: that radiolabeled 14CO2 was evolved in the Labeled Release experiment, and that the GCMS detected no organic molecules. However, there <b>are</b> <b>vastly</b> different interpretations of what those results imply.|$|E
25|$|At one time, {{theories}} {{advocating the}} lunar origin of tektites enjoyed considerable support {{as part of}} a spirited controversy about the origin of tektites that occurred during the 1960s. Starting with the publication of research concerning lunar samples returned from the Moon, the consensus of Earth and planetary scientists shifted in favor of theories advocating a terrestrial impact versus lunar volcanic origin. For example, one problem with the lunar origin theory is that the arguments for it that are based upon the behavior of glass melts use data from pressures and temperatures that <b>are</b> <b>vastly</b> uncharacteristic of and unrelated to the extreme conditions of hypervelocity impacts. In addition, various studies have shown that hypervelocity impacts are likely quite capable of producing low volatile melts with extremely low water content. The consensus of Earth and planetary scientists regards the chemical, i.e. rare-earth, isotopic, and bulk composition evidence as decisively demonstrating that tektites are derived from terrestrial crustal rock, i.e. sedimentary rocks, that are unlike any known lunar crust.|$|E
500|$|Some jumping spiders of {{the genus}} Portia hunt other spiders in ways that seem intelligent, {{outflanking}} their victims or luring them from their webs. Laboratory studies show that Portias instinctive tactics are only starting points for a trial-and-error approach from which these spiders learn very quickly how to overcome new prey species. However, {{they seem to be}} relatively slow [...] "thinkers", which is not surprising, as their brains <b>are</b> <b>vastly</b> smaller than those of mammalian predators.|$|E

500|$|The {{remaining}} group, people born {{in foreign}} countries with no French citizenship at birth, are those defined as immigrants under French law. According to the 2012 census, 135,853 residents {{of the city of}} Paris were immigrants from Europe, 112,369 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 70,852 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 5,059 from Turkey, 91,297 from Asia (outside Turkey), 38,858 from the Americas, and 1,365 from the South Pacific. [...] Note that the immigrants from the Americas and the South Pacific in Paris <b>are</b> <b>vastly</b> outnumbered by migrants from French overseas regions and territories located in these regions of the world.|$|E
500|$|Assimilation is a {{particularly}} difficult process for Hispanic Americans because they have [...] "old countries that are neither old nor remote. Even those born in North America travel to their parents' homeland, and constantly face a flow of friends and relatives from 'home' who keep the culture current. This constant cross-fertilization makes assimilation a more complicated process for them than for other minority groups". Julie Barak confirms Gonzalez Echevarria’s assertions regarding Latin American immigration and continues on to demonstrate how the privileged, wealthy existence led by the García girls in the Dominican Republic serves to further complicate their process of assimilation. The girls <b>are</b> <b>vastly</b> unaware of their good fortune until they {{are faced with the}} economic hardships of immigration in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Stunt car {{coordinator}} Rémy Julienne {{described the}} car chase between the Aston Martin DB5 and the Ferrari F355 as between [...] "a perfectly shaped, old and vulnerable vehicle and a racecar." [...] The stunt {{had to be}} meticulously planned as the cars <b>are</b> <b>vastly</b> different. Nails had to {{be attached to the}} F355 tyres to make it skid, and during one take of the sliding vehicles, the two cars collided. The largest stunt sequence in the film was the tank chase, which took around six weeks to film, partly on location in St. Petersburg and partly at Leavesden. A Russian T-54/55 tank, on loan from the East England Military Museum, was modified with the addition of fake explosive reactive armour panels. To avoid destroying the pavement on the city streets of St. Petersburg, the steel off-road tracks of the T-54/55 were replaced with the rubber-shoed tracks from a British Chieftain tank. The T-55 Tank used in the film is now on permanent display at Old Buckenham Airport where the East England Military Museum is based.|$|E

500|$|The {{dismissal}} raises tension at the Simpson household, with Homer and Marge {{siding with}} Lisa and Bart, respectively. Homer believes that Lisa {{needs to do}} what is good to the team, while Marge thinks she should reconsider, since the family comes first. Under Lisa's leadership, the team advances to the championship against Capital City. On the day of the game, Marge takes Bart to an amusement park; while they ride the roller coaster, Lisa calls Bart to beg for his help, but he brushes her off. Mike Scioscia, manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, pops up in the seats behind Marge and Bart and tells him that the best players listen to their managers, pointing out his three World Series wins [...] two as player, one as manager. Marge takes Bart to the game, which is now in its last inning with the Isotots down 11-10. Bart puts aside his differences with Lisa and offers to pinch-run from first base, then ignores her signs and steals both second and third. As he begins to steal home, Lisa realizes the odds <b>are</b> <b>vastly</b> against him, then decides to ignore the numbers and cheer him on anyway. He is tagged out at the plate, costing the Isotots their championship bid, but Lisa thanks him for helping her learn to love baseball as a game, and the team cheers them for resolving their differences.|$|E
