The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the <b>asset</b> <b>allocation</b> mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing the discount rate assumption).

500|$|According to Joe Flaherty, {{senior vice}} {{president}} at MFS Investment Management, [...] "the idea of risk parity goes back to the 1990s". In 1996, Bridgewater Associates launched a risk parity fund called the All Weather <b>asset</b> <b>allocation</b> strategy. [...] Although Bridgewater Associates was the first to bring a risk parity product to market, they did not coin the term. Instead the term [...] "risk parity" [...] was first used by Edward Qian, of PanAgora Asset Management, when he authored a white paper in 2005. In 2008 the name Risk Parity (short for Risk Premia Parity) was given to this portfolio investment category by Andrew Zaytsev at the investment consulting firm Alan Biller and Associates. Soon, the term was adopted by the asset management industry. In time, other firms such as Aquila Capital (2004), Northwater, Wellington, Invesco, First Quadrant, Putnam Investments, ATP (2006), PanAgora Asset Management (2006), BlackRock (2009 - formerly Barclays Global Investors), 1741 Asset Management (2009), Neuberger Berman (2009), AllianceBernstein (2010), AQR Capital Management (2010), Clifton Group (2011), Salient Partners (2012), Schroders (2012), Natixis Asset Management (2013) and Allianz Global Investors (2015) began establishing risk parity funds.|$|E

[...] In 1989, Brinson led a US$100million management buyout of his firm from First Chicago Corporation and over the next five years built up the firm to approximately US$36billion of assets under management. [...] SBC paid US$750million to acquire Brinson Partners, which resulted in a profit to Brinson and his partners of US$460million on the sale of their 75% stake in the company. [...] Following the acquisition of Brinson Partners, Gary Brinson ran SBC's asset management business and after the merger with UBS, Brinson was named chief investment officer of UBS Global Asset Management.|$|E

[...] Major reasons to accumulate assets include, purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement. Achieving these goals requires projecting what they will cost, and {{when you need to}} withdraw funds that will be necessary to be able to achieve these goals. [...] A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or inflation. [...] Using net present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in a variety of investments. [...] In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks. [...] Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using <b>asset</b> <b>allocation,</b> which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity. [...] This <b>asset</b> <b>allocation</b> will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks (either preferred stock or common stock), bonds (for example mutual bonds or government bonds, or corporate bonds), cash and alternative investments.
