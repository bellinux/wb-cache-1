What do the students learn at the <b>after-school</b> <b>centre</b> according to themselves, and what type of activities do they speak about? What do the students learn at the <b>after-school</b> <b>centre</b> according to the guardians? What do the students learn at the <b>after-school</b> <b>centre</b> according to the principals, and in what way do they think the teachers are working with the students learning? I have chosen to examine all this from a sociocultural perspective, using a qualitative method. In total, three teachers, ten students, five guardians and three principals have been interviewed. The results have been analyzed using the available pedagogical knowledge within the field and key concepts inherent in the sociocultural perspective. Some of the most important results show that in the centre, education {{comes in the form of}} social and linguistic learning as well as in the natural sciences. The results also shows that learning in regard to the development of the students identity and gender is being overshadowed. One conclusion that can been drawn is that both the teachers and the principals are well aware of the learning capabilities of the after-school center. Another is that the exact type of learning that happens can be hard to pinpoint for both the students and their guardians. ...|$|E

The conditions for children’s learning at preschools, preschool classes and <b>after-school</b> <b>centres</b> cover studies of the learners themselves (the “who”), the act of learning (the “how”) and the subject matter (the “what”) in their institutional, historical and societal settings.

The discussion section advances three conditions for societal struc- turing as being of special importance to children’s learning at preschools, positioning in the education system of the voluntary types of school. Research has shown that the positions of the preschools and <b>after-school</b> <b>centres</b> and their suborder in the education system influence teaching practice and set their stamp on it. The second condition is the institutional historical tradition which discursively impacts on teaching practice. The third condition is the societal function and status of the voluntary types of school.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to explore the {{expectations}} of the primary school on the activities of the pre-school. In order to limit the study I have chosen to compare the expectations found in two different schools. In the first case, the pre-school is integrated with the <b>after-school</b> <b>centre</b> and grade one to three (primary school), into the same building. In the other case, the pre-school share localities with the <b>after-school</b> <b>centre</b> in a separate building, with its own yard, within the primary school area. Since the purpose is rather comprehensive, it has been divided into sub-themes with separate set of questions. The sub-themes chosen are in themselves factors, which I believe to be of importance for the main purpose. I have used a qualitative method, why the answer may not be generalised, but give us {{a deeper understanding of the}} main question in my research, I have interviewed teachers and pre-school teachers as well as used curriculums and existing research, in order to shed light on the main question from different scientific perspectives. The result of this study shows, that the integration of the pre-school within the primary school, may be of great importance for cooperation and communication. The primary school’s expectations, however, seems to be more the result of the teacher’s and preschool teacher’s interpretations of the curriculums...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to analyse and compare the {{specifics}} of the social integration of pupils with disabilities at the lower school age, in the classroom and in after-school centres. In the first chapter of the analytical section, I address the specific notion of social integration, its definition and references to various possible explanations of this term. Further on, I characterized the process of integration of the individual into society and introduced some documents which are key to this process. The methodology for support of the development of the school curriculum in leisure and hobby training responds to the need to further develop the school curriculum within the school organisation. Because the success of social integration can be affected by a number of factors, it was necessary in this thesis to define them more closely. The second chapter dealt with the specifics of social integration of the pupil in the classroom and in the <b>after-school</b> <b>centre.</b> I address especially the possibility of use of support measures, diversity in the quality of schools and school organisations and of the teachers operating in them and others. After analysis of the above specifics, I moved onto to the realization of qualitative research. Research sample included pupils with visual impairments, Down syndrome and atypical autism. To obtain the data, I used the method of in-depth semi structured interviews, passive observation and the sociometric questionnaire B- 4. Based on the collected data, I created three case studies. In each of them I compared the specifics of social integration in the classroom and in the <b>after-school</b> <b>centre</b> individually. To meet the objectives of the work I subsequently undertook a comprehensive comparison of these specifics. In some cases, the <b>after-school</b> <b>centre</b> and school class were the same. This was especially the case in the number of pupils. A higher number seems to be unfavourable for both facilities and limiting to successful integration. Also, the quality of teachers in both cases played a big role. I got very different results in the areas of the possibilities for pupils to self-realise and develop self-confidence. Although in both cases the initial possibilities and capabilities of the individual were the same, the possibility for self-realisation was provided much more effectively by the <b>after-school</b> <b>centre.</b> Within freely chosen leisure activities the integrated pupil has the opportunity to achieve success and fulfil its goals. This leads to classmates having a more positive perception of it and to easier integration. One of the surveyed areas was social interaction and space available for its implementation. For both facilities a teacher and their willingness to offer space is a precondition. Yet I {{came to the conclusion that}} the <b>after-school</b> <b>centre</b> offers this space more naturally and widely. This is due to the format and content of after-school centres, within which individuals have the possibility of constantly interacting and practicing their social skills. On the other hand, a major difficulty can be presented by children's hobby clubs. This is due to the numbers of pupils which are now attending these hobby clubs in place of after-school centres. After an overall comparison of the different specifics, it can be stated that it is not possible to say with certainty which facility offers better conditions for social integration. It always depends on the many factors which enter the process. These factors, of course, in the case of after-school centres play an even more significant role. Due to this variability, after-school centres can offer social integration a large space. Likewise they can to a large extent make integration of a pupil difficult or even impossible. The acquired outcomes of this thesis could be used by primary school teachers and educators in after-school centres as an incentive for addressing and improving the quality of integration of pupils with disabilities...|$|E

The target of this intervention was two-fold: the team of educators from the “Homework and so on" Centre, an <b>after-school</b> <b>centre</b> for neglected children; and the children. The core of the intervention with the educators was fostering community resilience and making educators become “resilience tutors”, producing positive effects for the individual. Consistent with this purpose, educators attended some training meetings during which they learned the meaning of resilience, the referenced theoretical models, and the development of tools for measuring and monitoring the children's resilience. The purpose for the intervention with the children was to foster their resilience by after-school activities at the “Homework and so on” Centre. The intervention's implementation, consequences, and evaluation focused on 4 areas: self, relationships, family and school.

Research {{in the field is}} in terms of conversational styles and roles but is not so much linked to the after-school centre'ssnack time. The present study has been intended to distinguish and exemplify the social interaction that is taking place in the after-school centre's snack time. Focus off interest has been how pupils talk and listen to each other and whether it is possible to discover in the conversation whether the conversation can be linked to school skills. Based on Sociocultural perspective on learning as well as Goffman's dramaturgical perspective as a frame, four recorded and observed conversations at two different after-school centres have been analysedwith an abductive approach. The purpose of this work is to identify the learning situations that occur during the after-school centre's snack, as well as describe how the students talk to each other. The roles that emerged in the result were categorized into five qualitatively distinct roles called; the conversation leader, listener, co-driver, clown and expert. The conversation leader is dependent on both the listener and the co-driver while the other roles are more independent of each other.

40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{is aimed}} at exploring the utilization of select works by children's book author Markéta Zinnerová in literary education. The selected texts all feature a child protagonist in a difficult life situation with regards to their immediate or wider family circle. The vantage point was primarily the ouvre of M. Zinnerová, particularly the titles Indiáni z Větrova ('The Indians from Větrov'), Tajemství proutěného košíku ('The Secret of the Woven Basket'), and Kde padají hvězdy ('Where Stars Fall'). The dissertation is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part contains first {{a description of the}} general characteristics of narrative prose from the life of children with an emphasis on the issues of personal and social education. Furthermore, it focuses in detail on the utilisation of prose in literary education in primary schools, the methodology and different types of literary analysis and the insertion of all these activities into the relevant curriculum. The practical part deals with concrete classical and activising methods of application with regards to select texts from M. Zinnerová's works. The aim of the dissertation was to create work sheets based on excerpts from the prose of this author and to test them in practice in the environment of an <b>after-school</b> care <b>centre</b> where primary school children were to engage with them. This part of the dissertation describes said work sheets as well as the procedural methodology and the reasoning behind their creation. The work sheets were used when working with 3 rd -grade school children in an <b>after-school</b> care <b>centre.</b> The ways in which they cooperated with us and were captivated by the texts, as well as the precise way in which the activities involved in working with the proposed sheets proceeded are described in the following chapter of the practical part. The concluding reflection upon the utilisation of the work sheets proposes certain possible corrections, expansions or other possible uses of these work sheets...|$|R

In 1974, she was elected the first black president of the Mother’s Union. Her life became a commitment to selfless community service, embracing mainly the marginalised groups in society, namely, abandoned children, women and widows. After the 1976 unrest, Nkwe resigned from her nursing work to spearhead the drive to save the Orlando Children’s Home, which was a sanctuary for abandoned black children. Through her tireless initiatives, the Orlando Children’s Home was renovated. She cared for the children and focused on giving them the kind of life of which they were deprived. In 1990, Nkwe and her husband moved to Matlosane where she established a Women’s Desk, whose aim was to foster self-worth and restore the dignity of marginalised and abused women, and also to start sustainable self-help programmes.
