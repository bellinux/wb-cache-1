5000|$|The Seventh Amendment {{does not}} {{guarantee}} or create any right to a jury trial; rather, it preserves the right to jury trial in the federal courts that existed in 1791 at common law. In this context, common law means the legal environment the United States inherited from England. In England <b>in</b> 1791, civil <b>actions</b> were divided into actions at law and <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>equity.</b> <b>Actions</b> at law {{had a right to}} a jury, <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> did not. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 2 says [...] "there is one form of action—the civil action," [...] which abolishes the legal/equity distinction. Today, <b>in</b> <b>actions</b> that would have been [...] "at law" [...] in 1791, there is a right to a jury; <b>in</b> <b>actions</b> that would have been [...] "in equity" [...] in 1791, there is no right to a jury. However, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(c) allows a court to use one at its discretion. To determine whether the action would have been legal or equitable in 1791, one must first look at the type of action and whether such an action was considered [...] "legal" [...] or [...] "equitable" [...] at that time. Next, the relief being sought must be examined. Monetary damages alone were purely a legal remedy, and thus entitled to a jury. Non-monetary remedies such as injunctions, rescission, and specific performance were all equitable remedies, and thus up to the judge's discretion, not a jury. In Beacon Theaters v. Westover, , the US Supreme Court discussed the right to a jury, holding that when both equitable and legal claims are brought, the right to a jury trial still exists for the legal claim, which would be decided by a jury before the judge ruled on the equitable claim.|$|R
50|$|The {{consequence}} was that, {{with these}} and certain statutory exceptions (e.g., actions on policies of insurance), an action on an assigned chose <b>in</b> <b>action</b> {{must have been}} brought at law {{in the name of}} the assignor, though the sum recovered belonged <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> to the assignee. All choses <b>in</b> <b>action</b> being <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> assignable, except those altogether incapable of being assigned, <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> the assignee might have sued in his own name, making the assignor a party as co-plaintiff or as defendant. The Judicature Acts made the distinction between legal and equitable choses <b>in</b> <b>action</b> of no importance. The Judicature Act of 1873, s. 25 (6), enacted that the legal right to a debt or other legal chose <b>in</b> <b>action</b> could be passed by absolute assignment in writing under the hand of the assignor. This was later updated by the Law of Property Act 1925 s136.|$|R

40|$|M. A. The {{study is}} about the concept of Affirmative <b>Action</b> <b>in</b> the Employment <b>Equity</b> Act of South Africa, however it traces the history of Affirmative Action from the United States of America and Malaysia. These two {{countries}} {{are found to be}} leading the world <b>in</b> Affirmative <b>Action.</b> The term ‘Affirmative Action’ originated from the United States of America to prohibit unfair discrimination against certain groups of people because of non-job-related characteristics in terms of Civil Rights Act of 1960. Malaysia introduced Affirmative Action to develop education and employment opportunities of the Bumiputra. Bumiputra is one of the ethnic groups in Malaysia that have suffered unfair discrimination. Affirmative Action is a concept that became topical with attempts in South Africa to increase the participation of previously disadvantaged groups in the workplace. This concept, which is accepted constitutionally, is still controversial in its meaning and practice. It {{is for this reason that}} the study attempts to dispel misunderstandings about the concept. The study distinguishes Affirmative Action from related concepts such as equal employment opportunity and reverse discrimination. In order to develop the idea of Affirmative Action, the study also makes a distinction between descriptive definitions and normative definitions. This study opted for normative definitions in order to develop an ideal of what Affirmative Action is supposed to be. The study looks at how Affirmative <b>Action</b> is conceptualised <b>in</b> the Employment <b>Equity</b> Act of South Africa. Through the evaluation of the concept of Affirmative <b>Action</b> <b>in</b> the Employment <b>Equity</b> Act <b>in</b> terms of my normative definition of Affirmative Action, it was found that Affirmative <b>Action</b> <b>in</b> the Employment <b>Equity</b> Act complies with the normative definition of Affirmative Action. The following are my conclusion: - Affirmative Action is not similar to reverse discrimination or equal employment opportunities. - Affirmative <b>Action</b> <b>in</b> the Employment <b>Equity</b> Act is another form of discrimination though not unfair - It redresses injustices experienced by groups who have been disadvantaged in the past. - It eliminates unfair discrimination and develops the skills of those who did not have opportunities - It promotes equal opportunities in employment and thus it is a temporary intervention in the workplace. The findings of the study concluded that Affirmative Action is essential to the economic and skills development of the disadvantaged groups in particular and the South African society in general.

40|$|On May 7, 1952, Ernest and Mabel Bahm, Theodore Sohl, and Willy and Alvina Wischmann {{obtained}} a decree enjoining Ralph Raikes from diverting {{the flow of}} certain creeks onto plaintiffs’ lands. This judgment was affirmed by the Nebraska Supreme Court. On June 10, 1954, the Wischmanns brought an action against Raikes to recover monetary relief for damages done to their property by defendant’s diversion of water. The case was tried before a jury and a verdict was returned in favor of plaintiffs for $ 10, 000. This verdict was reversed and remanded {{on the ground that}} the evidence did not sustain plaintiffs’ pleaded cause of action. Upon rehearing, the court concluded that they were in error in the original opinion, and substituted another in its place. Held: Where multiple party plaintiffs bring a suit for an injunction and such an injunction is issued, one of the original plaintiffs may not bring a subsequent suit for damages sustained prior to the issuance of the injunction by the thing enjoined. The court’s holding stems from the rule that a plaintiff may not split his cause of action. This rule has been exhaustively discussed, and the reasons for it have been summarized by one authority as being to prevent harassment of defendants, wasting the court’s time, and multiplicity of suits. However, where this “splitting” involves an <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> and a subsequent action at law, as in the subject case, the authorities have been far from unanimous.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} is a {{close examination}} of the changes and continuities in law applied to prostitutes, bawdy houses, {{and the application of}} state police power by cities to segregate both into municipal vice districts. Throughout American history, moral reformers and social commentators recognized prostitution as a social, moral, and urban problem. The debate over the best policy to deal with prostitution was never louder than in the Progressive Era when states passed red-light abatement acts, when newspapers reported on white slavery, when purity crusaders were in full voice, and when cities shut down their vice districts. But prostitution as a criminal offense within the legal context of the courts and the legal traditions of American law has not been explored. If a moral reform group hired a lawyer to do something about a local prostitution problem, the lawyer would find <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> criminal law against prostitution and the keeping of disorderly and bawdy houses and he would find <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> to stop and prevent the immoral use of property for disorderly and bawdy purposes. And how did the red-light abatement acts change the law's procedures and standards against bawdy houses and how effective were the acts in closing bawdy houses, vice districts, or stopping prostitution? Furthermore, the turn-of-the-century lawyer might have found himself confronted with a city's policy of districting its bawdy houses and prostitutes into a specific area of the city. The seven chapters of the dissertation begin with a review of some of the writings on prostitution control in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Then the prostitute-as-vagrant, the theory used against prostitution, is examined. Disorderly houses [...] the property used for an immoral purpose [...] provides the focus for chapter three while how the courts actually dealt with disorderly house cases is reviewed in the fourth chapter. Municipalities using state police power to district their immoral houses and women, especially St. Louis and New Orleans, is considered in the fifth chapter, with Houston's decision to district its houses (and to later segregate by race those houses) provides the topic for chapter six. In 1917, Houston closed its vice district and chapter seven covers the reasons for the closing and the events leading to the shutting off the red-lights in Houston...|$|R

We address these issues with a household survey in two communities; and survey and ethnographic data on the six-community organisation - the Natural Resource Committee of the Upper Chinantla (CORENCHI). We suggest that the Mexican common property agrarian system greatly facilitates payments to entire communities of rights holders who then have the potential to build on existing social capital through having to make decisions about the use of their common property. Much of the work on social capital, distributional equity, and poverty alleviation has been theoretical or speculative but our study provides empirical support for part of this work. We find that PES in these communities has strengthened social capital and collective <b>action,</b> including <b>in</b> the emergence of regional collective <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the inter-community organisation. We also find that the PES payments are perceived as fair by the communities because of the high degree of participation in distributional policies, with a modest positive effect on a multidimensional measure of poverty...|$|R
