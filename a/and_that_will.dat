5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{understand}} this formula {{is to use the}} fact that the determinant of two vectors on the plane will give the area of the parallelogram they form. Therefore, if the determinant equals zero then the parallelogram has no area, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> happen when two vectors are on the same line.|$|E
25|$|Humphrey left a will dated 1 May 1534, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> was proved 26 January 1535. While {{the year}} of his death is well known, how he died and where are disputed. Some sources claim he lived comfortably in an estate near Welshpool until he died, and others claim he died of illness in his cave.|$|E

25|$|The Sumerian verb {{also makes}} a binary {{distinction}} according to a category that some regard as tense (past vs present-future), others as aspect (perfective vs imperfective), <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> be designated as TA (tense/aspect) in the following. The {{two members of the}} opposition entail different conjugation patterns and, at least for many verbs, different stems; they are theory-neutrally referred to with the Akkadian grammatical terms for the two respective forms – ḫamṭu (quick) and marû (slow, fat). Finally, opinions differ on whether the verb has a passive or a middle voice and how it is expressed.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

500|$|I {{saw many}} signs in this campaign, {{some of them}} were not friendly; some were very friendly. But the one that touched me the most was one that I saw in Deshler, Ohio, {{at the end of a}} long day of whistle-stopping. A little town.

500|$|A {{couple of}} years before, Marcus had {{identified}} different roots underlying the band's merger of music and politics, arguing that they [...] "have absorbed from reggae and the Rastas {{the idea of a}} culture that will make demands on those in power which no government could ever satisfy; a culture that will be exclusive, almost separatist, yet also messianic, apocalyptic and stoic, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> ignore or smash any contradiction inherent in such a complexity of stances." [...] Critic Sean Campbell has discussed how Lydon's Irish Catholic heritage both facilitated his entrée into London's reggae scene and complicated his position vis-à-vis the ethnically English working class—the background his bandmates had in common.|$|E

Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that he [...] "preferred this episode of 30 Rock" [...] compared to the previous episode, [...] "SeinfeldVision". Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly asked his readers [...] "do you feel like Liz Lemon took a back seat, and if so, did you mind?", adding that [...] " [...] Baldwin and [...] Morgan get the laughs, but like the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine , 30 Rock requires three distinct flavors. Don't be afraid to sprinkle in the Lemon." ...|$|E
500|$|The art {{direction}} of the album was handled by Chris Bilheimer with photography from Marina Chavez and Karl Koch. The album cover was shot between band practices and featured Mikey Welsh, Rivers Cuomo, Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson standing left to {{right in front of}} a plain, lime-green backdrop {{in a manner similar to}} the band's debut album. This was done as a tribute to Ric Ocasek, who had also produced their first album, and also to symbolize the band's back-to-basics approach they took while recording the album. This approach is alluded to in a quote in the liner notes of the album: [...] "Torniamo all'antico e sarà un progresso", from Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi that means [...] "Let us return to old times <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> be progress." ...|$|E
