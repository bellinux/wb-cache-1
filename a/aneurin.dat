25|$|In October 1946, <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan, who was Minister for Health at the time, {{flew into}} the base from Croydon to attend a conference in Stoke-on-Trent.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950 general election, Lindsay made {{a speech}} at Wellington, Shropshire in which he prophesied that <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan would soon take over as Prime Minister after Clement Attlee retired.|$|E
25|$|The {{period was}} {{dominated}} by infighting between the Labour Party's right wing, led by Hugh Gaitskell, and its left, led by <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan. Many Labour MPs felt that Attlee should have retired after the 1951 election and allowed a younger man to lead the party. Bevan openly called for him to stand down {{in the summer of}} 1954. One of his main reasons for staying on as leader was to frustrate the leadership ambitions of Herbert Morrison, whom Attlee disliked for both political and personal reasons. At one time, Attlee had favoured <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan to succeed him as leader, but this became problematic after Bevan almost irrevocably split the party.|$|E

25|$|Health care {{services}} {{are provided by}} the <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan Health Board, part of the National Health Service. Following the closure of Monmouth Hospital in 2006, health services are provided at the Monnow Vale Integrated Health and Social Care Facility.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} an Open University, to give adults who had missed out on tertiary education a second chance through part-time study and distance learning. His political commitment included assigning implementation responsibility to Baroness Lee, the widow of <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan. By 1981, 45,000 students had received degrees through the Open University. Money was also channelled into local-authority run colleges of education.|$|E
25|$|In Clement Attlee's post-war government, Key was {{appointed}} Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health. He shared responsibility for passing the National Health Service Act with <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan; the contrast in their styles, with Bevan's exuberant manner of speech differing markedly from Key's homespun wisdom, was noted. Unfortunately it was Key's successor, John Edwards, {{who had the}} honour of finally abolishing the Poor Law.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, New Line gave Bryan Singer the green-light {{to begin}} {{pre-production}} work on Jack the Giant Killer, with production {{scheduled to begin}} the following spring. In November 2010, Singer began screen-testing for {{the male and female}} leads. Aaron Johnson, Nicholas Hoult, and <b>Aneurin</b> Barnard were considered for the role of the young farmhand, and Adelaide Kane, Lily Collins, and Juno Temple tested for the princess role.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{had never}} made much secret that his support of the left-wing <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan was opportunistic. When Bevan {{resigned}} from the Shadow Cabinet (elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) in spring 1954 over Labour's support for the setting-up of SEATO, Wilson, who had been runner-up in the elections, stepped up to fill the vacant place. He was supported in this by Richard Crossman but his actions angered Bevan and the other Bevanites.|$|E
25|$|Many Conservative {{politicians}} of generations following Macleod recalled {{him as a}} highly effective speaker. His bald head and piercing gaze gave him a striking physical presence, {{and he was one}} of the most powerful platform speakers of his generation, in the league of Churchill or <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan. He was also a superb negotiator with a grasp of detail. Never one to suffer fools, by middle age his disability made him very short-tempered and impatient with people.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} was less successful in housing, {{which was the}} responsibility of <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built. Nevertheless, millions of people were rehoused {{as a result of}} the Attlee government's housing policies. Between August 1945 and December 1951, 1,016,349 new homes were completed in England, Scotland, and Wales.|$|E
25|$|The post-war Labour Government {{set up a}} Joint Negotiating Committee for Hospital Staffs in {{preparation}} for the National Health Service in 1946, and Linstead was appointed as chairman. At the time of the dispute between Health minister <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan and representatives of doctors, Linstead called for arbitration between the two, which was involved in all other professions who were {{to become part of the}} new service. When the NHS started in 1948 he became chairman of the Wandsworth Group Hospital Committee.|$|E
25|$|At the BBC, Orwell {{introduced}} Voice, {{a literary}} programme for his Indian broadcasts, {{and by now}} was leading an active social life with literary friends, particularly on the political left. Late in 1942, he started writing regularly for the left-wing weekly Tribune directed by Labour MPs <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan and George Strauss. In March 1943 Orwell's mother died and {{around the same time}} he told Moore he was starting work on a new book, {{which turned out to be}} Animal Farm.|$|E
25|$|Attlee's Health Minister, <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan, {{fought hard}} against the general disapproval of the medical establishment, {{including}} the British Medical Association, by creating the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. This was a publicly funded healthcare system, which offered treatment free of charge for all {{at the point of}} use. Reflecting pent-up demand that had long existed for medical services, the NHS treated some 8½million dental patients and dispensed more than 5million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation.|$|E
25|$|His term {{of office}} saw the Malayan Emergency and {{the early stages of}} Korean War, which began in June 1950 and to which British troops were deployed. Shinwell was {{responsible}} for the rearmament programme which precipitated the resignation of <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan from the Cabinet in the spring of 1951, although Gaitskell actually gave him less defence spending than he wanted. In the summer of 1951 the Cabinet blocked him from sending British troops to Abadan when the oil refineries were nationalised by the Iranian government.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the defeat}} of 1951 the party spent 13 years in opposition. The party {{suffered}} an ideological split, between the party's left-wing followers of <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan (known as Bevanites), and the right-wing of the party following Hugh Gaitskell (known as Gaitskellites) while the postwar economic recovery and the social effects of Attlee's reforms made the public broadly content with the Conservative governments of the time. The ageing Attlee contested his final general election in 1955, which saw Labour lose ground, and he retired shortly after.|$|E
25|$|In a {{symbolic}} act of defiance against the travel ban, labor unions in the United States and Canada organized a {{concert at the}} International Peace Arch {{on the border between}} Washington state and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Robeson returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953, and over the next two years, two further concerts were scheduled. In this period, with the encouragement of his friend the Welsh politician <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan, Robeson recorded a number of radio concerts for supporters in Wales.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aneurin</b> Bevan {{also joined}} the Tredegar {{branch of the}} South Wales Miners' Federation and became a trade union activist: he was head of his local Miners' Lodge at only {{nineteen}} years of age. Bevan became a well-known local orator and was seen by his employers, the Tredegar Iron Company, as a troublemaker. The manager of the colliery found an excuse to get him sacked. But, {{with the support of}} the Miners' Federation, the case was judged as one of victimisation and the company was forced to re-employ him.|$|E
25|$|For the 1959 general election, Morris' {{seat was}} one of the most {{high-profile}} marginal seats in the country. He had <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan to open his campaign, and attacked the Conservative Government for increasing unemployment. However, the Conservatives also had high-profile support including from Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. Local people were thought to be against nationalisation and Swansea Council had embarked on a controversial plan of comprehensive education to which Morris was tied by virtue of his high rank within the council leadership. An energetic young Conservative candidate, Hugh Rees defeated Morris by 403 votes.|$|E
25|$|The Union cellars {{were opened}} on 30 October 1954 and Heseltine persuaded the visiting Sir Bernard and Lady Docker to {{contribute}} to the considerable cost. Debates over which he presided included censorship of the Arts (no vote taken), welcoming the decline of British Imperialism (defeated 281–381) and calling for a “change in the principles and practice of British Trade Unions” (carried 358-200). Guest speakers that term included Palme Dutt, Lady Violet Bonham Carter, his old headmaster John Wolfenden and Jacob Bronowski, whilst <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan addressed a packed meeting of the University Labour Club, chaired by Anthony Howard, in the Union Chamber.|$|E
25|$|As Prime Minister, Attlee {{appointed}} Hugh Dalton as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ernest Bevin as Foreign Secretary, and Herbert Morrison as Deputy Prime Minister, with {{overall responsibility}} for nationalisation. Additionally, Stafford Cripps was made President of the Board of Trade, <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan became Minister of Health, and Ellen Wilkinson, {{the only woman}} to serve in Attlee's government, was appointed Minister of Education. The Attlee Government proved itself to be a radical, reforming government. From 1945 to 1948, over 200 public Acts of Parliament were passed, with eight major pieces of legislation placed on the statute book in 1946 alone.|$|E
25|$|Housing was {{an issue}} the Conservatives were widely {{recognised}} to have made their own, after the Churchill government of the early 1950s, with Harold Macmillan as Minister for Housing, gave housing construction far higher political priority than it had received under the Attlee administration (where housing had been attached to the portfolio of Health Minister <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan, whose attention was concentrated on his responsibilities for the National Health Service). Macmillan had accepted Churchill's challenge to meet the latter's ambitious public commitment to build 300,000 new homes a year, and achieved the target a year ahead of schedule.|$|E
25|$|This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours was {{the first}} number 1 of the band in the UK, {{remaining}} {{at the top of}} the albums chart for 3 weeks, selling 136,000 copies in the first week and spending a total of 74 weeks in the Album Chart. The title is a quotation taken from a speech given by <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan, a Labour Party politician from Wales. Its working title was simply Manic Street Preachers. The cover photograph was taken on Black Rock Sands near Porthmadog, Wales. Around the world the album also peaked at number 1 in countries like Sweden and Ireland, and it sold over five million copies worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Despite these problems, one of {{the main}} {{achievements}} of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce. In fact labour shortages proved {{to be more of a}} problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built.|$|E
25|$|Shinwell is {{best remembered}} as the Minister of Fuel and Power in Clement Attlee's Cabinet who nationalised coal mining in 1946. He {{was in charge of}} Britain's coal supply during the {{extremely}} harsh winter of January to March 1947, during which the supply system collapsed, leaving Britain to freeze and close down. He became unpopular with the public and was sacked in October 1947. He then served as Secretary of State for War and then as Minister of Defence in the early 1950s. The high defence spending which he demanded, partly to pay for Britain's involvement in the Korean War, was a major factor causing Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Gaitskell to impose NHS charges, prompting the resignation of <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan from the Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|From 1945 Touche was Chairman of the Committee of Selection {{responsible}} for picking Members for other committee service. As a senior Member, {{he was often}} delegated to take the chair in Standing Committees on Bills. He was knighted in 1952, and in November 1956 was made Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means (second Deputy Speaker). This took {{him out of the}} normal party political fray as the Deputy Speaker did not speak, although in December 1958 he was involved in a row over a defence debate. After a Conservative filibuster, Touche passed over <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan and called Christopher Soames to close the debate, but Bevan also insisted on speaking. Touche insisted that he had no choice, while Bevan and Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell objected; eventually the Speaker took the chair and endorsed his Deputy's actions.|$|E
25|$|A {{brilliant}} Commons performance {{made his}} career. On 27 March 1952, having been called {{fifth in the}} debate rather than third as originally scheduled, he spoke after former Health Minister <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan. Beginning his speech with the words “I wish to deal closely and with relish with the vulgar, crude and intemperate speech to which the House of Commons has just listened”, he attacked Bevan with facts and figures and commented that a health debate without Bevan would be like “Hamlet without the first gravedigger”. Churchill, who had been getting up to leave, stayed to listen and was heard to ask the Chief Whip, Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, who the promising young backbencher was. When summoned to 10 Downing Street on 7 May {{he claimed to have}} been half-expecting a reprimand for his refusal to serve a second term as a British representative at the Council of Europe, a job he found boring, but he was instead appointed Minister of Health, which was not a Cabinet position at that time.|$|E
25|$|Orwell left London for Jura on 10 April 1947. In July {{he ended}} the lease on the Wallington cottage. Back on Jura {{he worked on}} Nineteen Eighty-Four and made good progress. During that time his sister's family visited, and Orwell led a {{disastrous}} boating expedition, on 19 August, which nearly led to loss of life whilst trying to cross the notorious gulf of Corryvreckan {{and gave him a}} soaking which was not good for his health. In December a chest specialist was summoned from Glasgow who pronounced Orwell seriously ill and a week before Christmas 1947 he was in Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride, then a small village in the countryside, on the outskirts of Glasgow. Tuberculosis was diagnosed and the request for permission to import streptomycin to treat Orwell went as far as <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan, then Minister of Health. David Astor helped with supply and payment and Orwell began his course of streptomycin on 19 or 20 February 1948. By the end of July 1948 Orwell was able to return to Jura and by December he had finished the manuscript of Nineteen Eighty-Four. In January 1949, in a very weak condition, he set off for a sanatorium at Cranham, Gloucestershire, escorted by Richard Rees.|$|E
25|$|Eden, {{who faced}} {{domestic}} pressure from his party to take action, {{as well as}} stopping the decline of British influence in the Middle East, had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} the Second World War, and had assumed the US would automatically endorse whatever action taken by its closest ally. At the 'Law not War' rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, Eden was ridiculed by <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan: 'Sir Anthony Eden has been pretending that he is now invading Egypt to strengthen the United Nations. Every burglar of course could say the same thing; he could argue that he was entering the house to train the police. So, if Sir Anthony Eden is sincere in what he is saying, and he may be, then he is too stupid to be a prime minister'. Public opinion was mixed; some historians think that the majority of public opinion in the UK was on Eden's side. Eden was forced to bow to American diplomatic and financial pressure, and protests at home, by calling a ceasefire when Anglo-French forces had captured only 23 miles of the Canal. With the US threatening to withdraw financial support from sterling, the Cabinet divided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan threatening to resign unless an immediate ceasefire was called, Eden was under immense pressure. He considered defying the calls until the commander on the ground told him it could take up to six days for the Anglo-French troops to secure the entire Canal zone. Therefore, a ceasefire was called at quarter past midnight on 7 November.|$|E
500|$|In 1948 the Minister for Health, <b>Aneurin</b> Bevan, {{conducted}} the symbolic inauguration of the National Health Service at Davyhulme's Park Hospital, now renamed Trafford General Hospital. The area {{was home to}} the first District heating system in England. [...] In operation by 1948, a boiler house supplied hot water to 200homes on a newly built housing estate. [...] The water was heated with low-grade fuels such as peat and coke, with houses built in groups of four for better efficiency.|$|E
