40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, imaging sensors and {{detectors}} have developed tremendously. This technology has {{found its way into}} a number of areas, such as space missions, synchrotron light sources, and medical imaging. Nowadays, detectors and custom ICs are routine in high-energy physics applications. Electronic readout circuits have become a key part of every modern detector system. Many sensing circuits in detectors depend upon accumulating charge on a capacitor. The charge uncertainty on the capacitor when it is reset causes a signal error known as reset noise. Therefore, low noise readout circuitry capable of driving high input capacitance is essential for detector systems. A low noise pre-amplifier/amplifier readout circuitry has been designed and fabricated in 0. 13 um IBM CMOS 8 RF process technology. The pre-amplifier/ amplifier chain employs correlated double sampling at the input to suppress the kTC noise without any additional circuitry. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, capacitive matching is used at the amplifier input. The experimental results of the signal processing chain employing capacitive matching and correlated double sampling show more than 60 times improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio over the same circuit without these improvements. In this dissertation a novel <b>auto-zeroing</b> technique is introduced as well. This technique uses a nulling point other than the amplifier's input and output to perform the <b>auto-zeroing</b> operation. The <b>auto-zeroing</b> is performed by taking advantage of emitter degeneration in the input transistor pair of the differential pair. For testing purposes this technique is implemented on a telescopic cascode differential amplifier. The auto-zeroed telescopic cascode differential amplifier has also been designed and fabricated in 0. 13 um IBM CMOS 8 RF process technology.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a Precision Instrumentation Amplifier using a Current Feedback Instrumentation Amplifier topology (CFIA). CFIAs are attractive for sensor readout, because of their high CMRR and their ability to interface with ground-referenced sensors. Several chopping and <b>auto-zeroing</b> techniques have been developed to reduce the offset and 1 /f noise of such amplifiers to the ?V level. As a result, their dominant source of error is now gain error, which is limited by mismatch to at best 0. 1 %. This paper describes a CFIA that applies dynamic element matching (DEM) to achieve a gain error of less than 0. 04 %. Moreover, it presents the first silicon implementation of the ping-pong-pang (PPP) <b>auto-zeroing</b> scheme, which enables a 3. 5 × reduction in power consumption and 2. 5 × improvement in gain error as compared to state-of-the-art ping-pong auto-zeroed CFIAs.

The best bipolar amplifiers offer offset voltages of 25 µV and 0. 1 µV/ºC drift. Offset voltages less than 5 µV with practically no measurable offset drift are obtainable with choppers, albeit with some penalties. A basic chopper amplifier circuit is shown in Figure 1 below. When the switches are in the "Z" (<b>auto-zero)</b> position, capacitors C 2 and C 3 are charged to the amplifier input and output offset voltage, respectively.
