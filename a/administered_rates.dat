50|$|The third {{component}} of the scheme of monetary regulation recommended by the committee and which marks an important departure from the prevailing Monetary Policy practice in India relates to significant relaxations in the prevailing system of <b>administered</b> <b>rates</b> of Interest. The committee {{does not support the}} idea of pricing Credit too low for both the government and the commercial borrowers in public or Private Sector. This is attributable to the fact that low rates of Interest, encourages too much monetisation of Government debt, leaves too little for the Reserve Bank of India's refinance of banks, discourages effective use of Credit by borrowers, discourages financial savings and reduces profitability of Banks and other Financial institutions.|$|E

40|$|First draft: do not quote This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} entry of formal lenders {{on the size of}} the informal credit market in terms of a model consisting of m ILs and n FLs. Each IL enjoys local monopoly power, on account of his informational advantage, over a group of entrepreneurs (e), and would not lend outside his known group of entrepreneurs. The FLs however do not enjoy any such informational advantage with regard to particular groups and are willing to lend to borrowers from any group. All the agents are risk neutral and are interested in maximising their expected profits. The FLs optimally choose the number of loans, given the <b>administered</b> <b>rate</b> of interest. In case of project failure, the FLs acquire the collateral. Unlike the FLs the ILs are unregulated and optimally choose both the interest rate and the collateral. It is shown that at a high <b>administered</b> interest <b>rate</b> entry is less effective in reducing size of informal credit market. Entry of FLs cannot eliminate the informal credit market altogether, although it will be relatively more effective compared to deregulation of the interest rate...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{interest}} rate risk of banking accounts such as deposits and loans, this paper extends the value at risk (hereafter, VaR) analysis framework, which is useful for the risk evaluation of trading accounts. In order to apply the VaR concept derived from trading accounts to banking accounts, we should {{take into account the}} following issues: (1) the longer risk evaluation period because of the inflexibility of adjustability of banking account positions; (2) the evaluation of risk included in the <b>administered</b> <b>rates</b> (the long-term prime rate and the short-term prime rate); and (3) the prepayment risk (associated with housing loans, etc.). Therefore, in this paper we first construct a VaR model including a term-structure model to express the stochastic process of market rate, the administered rate model, and the prepayment function model. Then, we perform a simulation using an imaginary portfolio to analyze the factors determining interest rate risk. In conclusion, it has been proved that the factor of <b>administered</b> <b>rates</b> increases interest rate risk both in single products and in a portfolio. Taking into account the behavior of customers who want better interest rate conditions, the factor of prepayment decreases the present value, which is itself the basis of calculating risk. Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis of model parameters to show the magnitude of model risk. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} data on deposit rates set by the Hong Kong Association of Banks {{to see if there}} is any {{forecasting}} content in the spread between short-term and longer term interest rates on bank deposits in Hong Kong over the period from 1982 - 1993. By forecasting content, we mean whether a future change in an interest rate can be forecast with any degree of confidence from a set of currently observable prices. We examine only within-sample data. The period chosen covers the life of the “Interest Rate Agreement ” by the Hong Kong Association of Banks under which the association set rates of interest that members should pay to deposits with various maturities within one year. We find statistically significant coefficients in only two of the ten regressions that we estimated. Thus, our data do show that there was some information regarding forward changes in rates from yield differentials administered by the cartel. One possible explanation is that the cartel had better information than the market regarding its future course of action but chose not to reveal this information through <b>administered</b> <b>rates.</b> In concluding, we reflect briefly on this interesting line of research and its promise in the field of financial analysis in future years...|$|E

40|$|Most {{long-term}} credit {{in developing countries}} is allocated through negotiated agreements between government institutions and financial intermediaries or fi-nal borrowers, and often at <b>administered</b> <b>rates.</b> Yet many developing countries have no {{long-term credit}} market whose interest rates {{can be used as}} benchmarks for these loans. If credit is priced improperly, it will be allocated inefficiently and the development of capital markets may be stunted. In light of the generally dis-appointing experience with conventional methods of allocating development credit, some countries have introduced credit auctions as an alternative. Among the advantages are greater transparency and fairness, lower transaction costs, and increased competition and efficiency. Among the disadvantages are a greater vulnerability to collusion, which can lead to lower interest rates and revenue, and a tendency to attract the least desirable participants (adverse selection) and to lend for riskier projects (moral hazard), which can lead to lower repayment rates and a higher probability of default. All these factors can lead to inefficiency in the allocation of funds. This article suggests ways to lessen these negative ef-fects and presents various elements of auction design that affect the efficiency of credit auctions and their suitability to specific circumstances. When properly de-signed, auctions {{can be used in a}} variety of environments to allocate develop-ment credit more efficiently than current methods do.

40|$|The study {{examines}} the theoretical considerations and empirical {{results of the}} switch to market borrowing, i. e. bond financing of the fiscal deficit, with correspondingly low monetisation, as part of India’s structural reforms initiated in 1991. It basically concludes that despite the sharp deterioration in State finances and persistently large market borrowing programme of the Centre, the move to market borrowings to finance the deficit {{is proving to be}} beneficial when viewed in relation to broader movements in the major fiscal variables over time. The study makes a clear distinction between the consequences of borrowing at market interest rates versus those of non-market liabilities. In preference to recent econometric approaches to test the Government’s long run debt profile, the study proposes a simple necessary condition, popularly known as the Domar condition, to evaluate the prospects for debt stability under which GDP growth should exceed the interest rate on Government debt. Based on the premises that in the long run, {{it is not possible to}} trade growth for inflation (although such a trade off may be possible in the short run) and that the central bank is unable to influence real variables (real output and real interest rates) in the long run, the study simulates different short and long run consequences of alternative combinations of bond and money financing of budget deficits on interest rates, growth, inflation, the debt-to-GDP ratio and measures of the interest burden. Empirical evaluation of the Domar debt-stability condition reveals that Central Government debt, under certain assumptions, may remain stable at prevailing levels of the primary deficit and monetised deficit. High <b>administered</b> <b>rates</b> in the Small Savings and Provident Fund Schemes, i. e., due to non-market based borrowing, however, pose problems for debt sustainability in future. The study argues that bond financing of the fiscal deficit has contributed to fiscal consolidation by inducing the Government to reduce primary expenditures. This conclusion holds even for the combined finances of the Central and State Governments. Robust evidence indicates that non-government borrowing costs have come down relative to those of the Government, and credit conditions for non-government borrowers are now easier, after the move to bond finance. Further, some evidence suggests that private capital formation has surged in recent years, contradicting the view that the anti-inflation policy of bond finance has crowded out private investment and adversely affected growth. However, the stability in market debt notwithstanding, the overall fiscal situation is critical because of potential instability in non-market debt and due to unfunded and contingent liabilities of the Central and State Governments. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{emotional}} impact of intractable epilepsy on family members is a neglected topic, {{with the majority}} of studies confined to childhood epilepsy.

40|$|Non-motor {{symptoms}} such as neuropsychiatric {{and cognitive}} dysfunction {{have been found to}} be common in Parkinson’s disease (PD) but the relation between such symptoms is poorly understood. We focused on alexithymia, an impairment of affective and cognitive emotional processing, as there is evidence for its interaction with cognition in other disorders. Twenty-two non-demented PD patients and 22 matched normal control adults (NC) were <b>administered</b> <b>rating</b> scales assessing neuropsychiatric status, including alexithymia, apathy, and depression, and a series of neuropsychological tests. As expected, PD patients showed more alexithymia than NC, and there was a significant association between alexithymia and disease stage. Alexithymia was associated with performance on non-verbally mediated measures of executive and visuospatial function, but not on verbally mediated tasks. By contrast, there was no correlation between cognition and ratings of either depression or apathy.

Contrary to the findings of previous studies, caregivers of patients with additional illnesses or learning disabilities were not more distressed than caregivers of patients with epilepsy only. Demographic characteristics and other medical and social factors associated with the psychosocial well-being of the carers of people with epilepsy were discussed.

40|$|Prevalence {{estimates}} {{of depression in}} chronic kidney disease (CKD) vary widely in existing studies. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to summarize the point prevalence of depressive symptoms in adults with CKD. We searched MEDLINE and Embase (through January 2012). Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms. We also limited the analyses to studies using clinical interview and prespecified criteria for diagnosis. We included 249 populations (55, 982 participants). Estimated prevalence of depression varied by stage of CKD and the tools used for diagnosis. Prevalence of interview-based depression in CKD stage 5 D was 22. 8 % (confidence interval (CI), 18. 6 - 27. 6), but estimates were somewhat less precise for CKD stages 1 - 5 (21. 4 % (CI, 11. 1 - 37. 2)) and for kidney transplant recipients (25. 7 % (12. 8 - 44. 9)). Using self- or clinician- <b>administered</b> <b>rating</b> scales, the prevalence of depressive symptoms for CKD stage 5 D was higher (39. 3 % (CI, 36. 8 - 42. 0)) relative to CKD stages 1 - 5 (26. 5 % (CI, 18. 5 - 36. 5)) and transplant recipients (26. 6 % (CI, 20. 9 - 33. 1)) and suggested that self-report scales may overestimate the presence of depression, particularly in the dialysis setting. Thus, interview-defined depression affects approximately one-quarter of adults with CKD.
