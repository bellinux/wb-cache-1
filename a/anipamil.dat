50|$|<b>Anipamil</b> is a {{calcium channel}} blocker, {{specifically}} of the phenylalkylamine type. This type is separate from its more common cousin Dihydropyridine. <b>Anipamil</b> is an analog {{of the more}} common drug verapamil, {{which is the most}} common type of phenylalkylamine style calcium channel blocker. <b>Anipamil</b> has been shown to be a more effective antiarrhythmic medication than verapamil because it does not cause hypertension as seen in verapamil. It is able to do this by bonding to the myocardium tighter then verapamil.|$|E
40|$|Two analogues of verapamil, {{ronipamil}} and <b>anipamil,</b> {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to reduce arrhythmias induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in conscious rats. Only <b>anipamil</b> (50 and 150 mg kg- 1 orally) produced a statistically significant reduction in arrhythmias; it was most effective against ventricular fibrillation. Ronipamil at the same doses had limited antiarrhythmic actions. Only <b>anipamil</b> delayed the development of ECG signs of ischaemia, while both drugs reduced the magnitude of such changes. <b>Anipamil</b> has a more favourable ratio of antiarrhythmic to hypotensive effects when compared with verapamil...|$|E
40|$|Rats {{were given}} <b>anipamil</b> (5 mg/kg) or glucose, intraperitoneally twice daily for 5 days. During this period the mean {{arterial}} {{blood pressure and}} heart rate were measured daily. The heart was then isolated and perfused. Energy metabolism and intracellular pH were monitored by 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy during 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, with a simultaneous isovolumetric measurement of left ventricular contraction. Myocardial norepinephrine and glycogen were assayed immediately after excision of the heart, after 15 minutes oxygenated perfusion, {{at the end of}} ischemia {{and at the end of}} reperfusion. Metabolic and functional recovery during reperfusion were significantly better in hearts pretreated with <b>anipamil</b> (p less than 0. 0005 vs controls). However, protection was not preceded by an effect on mean arterial pressure or heart rate in vivo, or a negative inotropic effect during control perfusion of the isolated hearts. There was no energy sparing effect during ischemia; but intracellular pH during ischemia stabilized at a higher level (p less than 0. 0005 vs controls). Myocardial norepinephrine and glycogen stores were not decreased by pretreatment with <b>anipamil,</b> and their release or degradation due to ischemia and reperfusion were also not different from controls. Commonly known mechanisms of myocardial protection by calcium antagonists fail to explain the protection by pretreatment with <b>anipamil</b> as observed in our experiments, and alternative mechanisms are to be considered...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{assess whether}} the {{prophylactic}} administration of <b>anipamil,</b> a new calcium antagonist, protects the heart against {{the effects of}} ischemia and reperfusion, rats were injected intraperitoneally twice daily for 5 days with 5 mg/kg body weight of this drug. The heart was then isolated and perfused by the Langendorff technique. Phosphorus- 31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to monitor myocardial energy metabolism and intracellular pH during control perfusion and 30 min of total ischemia (37 Â°C), followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Pretreatment with <b>anipamil</b> altered neither left ventricular developed pressure under normoxic conditions nor the rate and extent of depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate during ischemia. Intracellular acidification, however, was attenuated. On reperfusion, hearts from anipamil-pretreated animals recovered significantly better than untreated hearts with respect to replenishment of ATP and creatine phosphate stores, restitution of low levels of intracellular inorganic phosphate and recovery of left ventricular function and coronary flow. Intracellular pH recovered rapidly to preischemic levels, whereas in untreated hearts a complex intracellular inorganic phosphate peak indicated the existence of areas of different pH within the myocardium. It is concluded that <b>anipamil</b> pretreatment protects the heart {{against some of the}} deleterious effects of ischemia and reperfusion. Because this protection occurred {{in the absence of a}} negative inotropic effect during normoxia, it cannot be attributed to an energy-sparing effect during ischemia. Therefore, alternative mechanisms of action are to be considered...|$|E
