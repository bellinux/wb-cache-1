50|$|The 1st Arkansas Infantry <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> District Southwest Missouri, Dept. Missouri to December, 1863. The 1st Arkansas <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> 2nd Brigade, District of the Frontier, Dept. Missouri, to January, 1864. The {{regiment}} <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> 2nd Brigade, District of the Frontier, 7th Army Corps, Dept. of Arkansas, to March, 1864. The regiment <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> 1st Brigade, District of the Frontier, 7th Army Corps, to February, 1865. 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, 7th Army Corps, to August, 1865.|$|R
5|$|Ski boots <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the ski {{only at the}} toe, {{leaving the}} heel free. Depending on application, boots may be {{lightweight}} (performance skiing) or heavier and more supportive (back-country skiing).|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{surrounded}} by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak wall of connective tissue called septum separates the glands from the kidneys. The adrenal glands are directly below the diaphragm, and <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
50|$|Its {{posterior}} margin <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the pectineal line, and is continuous {{with the}} pectineal ligament. Its anterior margin <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the inguinal ligament.|$|R
5000|$|A CO and B CO 1-509th Infantry Deployed in June 2004 {{in support}} of OIF to Baghdad, Iraq. The two {{airborne}} infantry companies <b>were</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. A CO <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> 2-14 IN and B CO <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> 4-31 IN. Both Companies returned from combat in March 2005.|$|R
50|$|Gathering is {{a sewing}} {{technique}} for shortening {{the length of}} a strip of fabric so that the longer piece can <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a shorter piece. It is commonly used in clothing to manage fullness, as when a full sleeve <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the armscye or cuff of a shirt, or when a skirt <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a bodice.|$|R
5|$|Heterodimeric {{antibodies}} have {{a greater}} range in shapes they can take and the drugs that <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the arms don’t {{have to be the}} same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E
5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) {{can be generated}} by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the male}} frog, the two testes <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels {{on through the}} ureters, which are {{consequently}} known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.|$|E
50|$|In 1923, Alexandretta <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the State of Aleppo, and in 1925, it <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the {{combined}} State of Syria, still with special administrative status.|$|R
50|$|The {{regiment}} <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> 1st Division, 7th Corps, Dept. of Arkansas, to January, 1865. The regiment <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> Colored Brigade, 7th Corps, until February, 1865.|$|R
50|$|Spielberg <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> direct an {{adaptation}} of American photojournalist Lynsey Addarios memoir Its What I Do. Jennifer Lawrence <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> star in the lead role.|$|R
5|$|Like other insects, {{cockroaches}} breathe {{through a}} system of tubes called tracheae which <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> openings called spiracles on all body segments. When the carbon dioxide level in the insect rises high enough, valves on the spiracles open and carbon dioxide diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in. The tracheal system branches repeatedly, the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to each cell, allowing gaseous exchange to take place.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{have two}} sets of affixes that <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a verb to indicate the person of its arguments. One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set A) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of transitive verbs. They {{can also be used}} with adjective or noun predicates to indicate the subject.|$|E
50|$|IDA-1 <b>was</b> planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> Node-2's forward PMA. IDA-2 was {{originally}} planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> Node-2's zenith PMA. But following {{the loss of}} IDA-1, IDA-2 <b>was</b> instead <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> Node-2's forward PMA (PMA-2). IDA-3, a replacement for IDA-1, is planned to be installed at Node-2's zenith PMA (PMA-3).|$|R

50|$|General Lek and General Vellajally {{attacked}} Firozabad in 1802. In {{the beginning}} of British regime Firozabad was in Etawah district but after some time it <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> Aligarh district. When Sadabad was created as a new district in 1832, Firozabad <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> it. Later on, in 1833 Firozabad <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> Agra district. In 1847, the business of lac was flourishing at Firozabad.|$|R
5|$|Once in the station, riders board a train sitting down, in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and a lap bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the harness locks into place. After a train is fully locked and checked, riders are raised into the flying position and the train departs the station. Since being rethemed to Galactica for 2016, riders {{have the option of}} wearing virtual reality headsets, which <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the restraints.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} of early evolutionary {{history is the}} structure of the antennal heart, a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae, or vesicles, that <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the frontal cuticle to the bases of the antennae. These features have not been found in other insects. An independent organ exists for each antenna, consisting of an ampulla, attached to the frontal cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin-walled sac with a valved ostium on its ventral side. They pump blood by elastic connective tissue, rather than muscle.|$|E
5|$|The body {{is divided}} into a thorax of three {{segments}} and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The wings <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> {{the second and third}} thoracic segments. The tegmina, or first pair of wings, are tough and protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins.|$|E
2500|$|Sensors {{have been}} made using QD as [...] donors and a small {{molecule}} or gold nanoparticle (dark quencher) as acceptors. An example of the former, is Loeb’s sensil, an optic fibre {{system in which the}} quantum dot <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> ConA whilst tetramethylrhodamine <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> cyclodextran, which in turn <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the PEG diacrylate scaffold. An example of the latter is Tang with QDs-ConA-beta-CDs-AuNPs.|$|R
50|$|The enzyme splits {{pyruvate}} into {{carbon dioxide}} and a 2-carbon fragment which <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> its cofactor TPP. This 2-carbon fragment <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the five membered TPP ring in its ylid form.|$|R
25|$|Those towed tank {{destroyer}} battalions <b>were</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> US Army divisions {{to improve}} their anti-tank capabilities. Most often, a complete battalion <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> an infantry division. In some cases, towed TD battalions <b>were</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> armored or airborne divisions; sometimes, companies of the same battalion were given to different divisions; and sometimes a single division had several TD battalions - including a mix between towed and self-propelled - at once.|$|R
5|$|The {{three pairs}} of legs are sturdy, with large coxae and five claws each. They <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> {{each of the three}} {{thoracic}} segments. The front legs are the shortest and the hind legs the longest, providing the main propulsive power when the insect runs. The spines on the legs were earlier considered to be sensory, but observations of the insect's gait on sand and wire meshes have demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain. The structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legs.|$|E
5|$|Two {{antennae}} ("feelers") <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the head; these organs detect chemicals, air currents, and vibrations; {{they also}} are used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the mandibles, used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence. In some species, a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, {{so it may be}} passed to other ants or their larvae.|$|E
5|$|X-ray diffraction, {{electron}} diffraction, and {{neutron diffraction}} give {{information about the}} structure of matter, crystalline and non-crystalline, at the atomic and molecular level. In addition, they <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the properties of all materials, inorganic, organic or biological. Due to the diffraction importance and variety of application of diffraction by crystals, {{a large number of}} Nobel Prizes were presented to studies involving X-ray.|$|E
50|$|Each booster <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the {{external}} tank at the SRB's aft frame by two lateral sway braces and a diagonal attachment. The forward {{end of each}} SRB <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> {{the external}} tank at the forward end of the SRB's forward skirt. On the launch pad, each booster also <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the mobile launcher platform at the aft skirt by four frangible nuts that were severed at lift-off.|$|R
50|$|None of {{the many}} USAS squadrons in the UK were flying units. When squadrons arrived from the States, pilots <b>were</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> British units for further {{training}} and some <b>were</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> operational squadrons in France. The ground crews <b>were</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> British training units to learn maintenance procedures. A considerable number of USAS squadrons were construction squadrons and had no flying or maintenance personnel; they were charged with aerodrome construction.|$|R
