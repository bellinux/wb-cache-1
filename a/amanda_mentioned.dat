5000|$|In season three, Alex went on {{the mission}} to get Amanda, however, their cover is quickly blown thanks to Alex's altercation with Amanda's henchman that was twice her size, and the raid became a free-for-all. Alex reinjured her arm, but she and Michael recover the key. They have had no {{interaction}} so far in season three, however, Amanda knows the way to hurt Nikita is to go after Alex. On [...] "Black Badge," [...] Alex and Amanda had their first interaction since they last met. Amanda calls the phone she left behind for Nikita. Alex asks what lesson Amanda is trying to teach them now. Amanda responds by say, [...] " [...] Alex? So nice to hear your voice." [...] Before the conversation is over on the phone <b>Amanda</b> <b>mentions</b> that Alex was right, the lesson is that every operative is expendable. In 3x13, Nikita and Amanda talk about Alex at length. Amanda compares Alex, herself, and Nikita. She claims she made Nikita, like Nikita made Alex; {{and that in the}} end, Alex will betray Nikita (like Nikita betrayed Amanda). This may be what Amanda intends to do to Alex, turn her against Nikita. At the end of the episode, Nikita goes to retrieve Alex (who had surrendered to the police to by time for Stefan and Krieg to escape) before the police can process Alex. Another police car approaches and sirens Alex's police driver to pull over, Alex smiles at the notion thinking Nikita has come to get her. The officer leaves the car to talk to the other officer. Alex hears a shot from the police car and it is shown the officer has shot Alex's police driver. Alex is in shock as the person appears to get closer to her car, after shooting the police officer again. Amanda appears behind the glass in a police officers uniform, Alex then trembles {{to get out of the}} car. But it is no use, as it is a police car. Amanda gets in the car as Alex trembles in shock, Amanda then smirks at Alex and says, [...] " [...] Looks like I won't be leaving Geneva empty handed after all." [...] She then proceeds to say, [...] " [...] Let's see how well she taught you," [...] and speeds off with Alex in the back (effectively capturing her).|$|R
5000|$|Experimental {{research}} {{has attempted to}} measure the effects of exposure to rap music. Numerous studies have found a correlation between consumption of misogynistic hip hop music and negative beliefs about women. Webster et al. found that men who listened to sexually violent gangsta rap lyrics {{were significantly more likely}} than controls to express [...] "adversarial sexual beliefs," [...] like the belief that men should dominate women. However, they noted that gangsta rap did not influence men's other attitudes toward women. Other studies showed that rap videos which contain images of women in sexually subordinate roles increase female subjects' acceptance of violence against women, and that listening to misogynistic hip hop increases sexually aggressive behavior in men. [...] Women and men are more likely to accept sexist and demeaning messages about gender relations after listening to music with sexually degrading music. However, college students who listen to this music are even more likely to say that they find these lyrics to be accurate and acceptable portrayals of romantic and sexual relationships. Guillermo Rebollo-Gil and <b>Amanda</b> Moras <b>mention</b> many critics condemn rap lyrics for promoting violence, hypermasculinity, sexism, and homophobia.|$|R
40|$|Marking the 40 th {{anniversary of}} Jean Devanny’s death, the Vulgar Press is republishing her most {{successful}} and influential novel, Sugar Heaven, the latest Vulgar Working Classic. Set in the steamy tropical canefields of Far North Queensland, Sugar Heaven {{tells the story}} of Dulcie a ‘southerner’ who comes to Innisfail to be with Hefty, her cane cutter husband. She learns the hard way about class and sexual politics in the heart of an industrial dispute over deadly Weil’s disease in the Cane. Sugar Heaven is “one of the few early Queensland novels worth reading for itself”. Judith Wright Nothing more intense or convincing has been written about ‘work’ in Australia than Jean Devanny’s description of the cutting of the cane. Daily Telegraph Nowhere in my reading had I encountered such a realistic and unpatronising representation of women’s sexuality, or one informed by such generosity of spirit. Even today, when there is a greater appreciation of Devanny’s work, I am still surprised as to why the erotic character of the book is rarely <b>mentioned.</b> <b>Amanda</b> Lohrey The present edition is a corrected text of the first edition and includes a new introduction by the editor, Nicole Moore, as well as Devanny’s own essay on Australian radical working class writing. Essays by Carole Ferrier and Amanda Lohrey are also included to make this edition appeal to both casual and scholarly readers...|$|R
40|$|Children {{treated for}} acute lymphoblastic leukemia, {{the most common}} cancer in childhood, {{are at risk for}} {{learning}} problems, including decreased IQ scores and deficits in mathematics, attention, and memory, both during their treatment phase and after cure. Psychosocial problems, particularly behavioral problems and social skills deficits, are reported as well. These problems occur across all age ranges but are most frequent in children who are less than 4 {{years old at the time}} of diagnosis. Up to two thirds of these children may have edu-cational difficulties. To examine these issues more closely, the litera-ture on developmental and psychosocial outcomes of childhood leukemia is reviewed, with particular attention to studies reporting on preschool-age children. Studies are categorized according to outcome measures used: (a) IQ or scholastic achievement tests, (b) neuropsychological performance tests, (c) memory or attention tests, and (d) psychosocial evaluation measurements. In each of these categories, evidence exists that preschool children treated for leuke-mia are at high risk for developmental difficulties. Suggestions are offered for developmental surveillance and educational interventions. Amanda was an active 3 -year-old who had always been healthy, with the exception of mild asthma. She had been coughing more than usual for several days, so her mother took her to the pediatrician. While the doctor was examining <b>Amanda,</b> her mother <b>mentioned</b> that lately <b>Amanda</b> had been complaining of abdominal pain and had been bruising easily. Her pediatrician found that Amanda had an enlarged spleen and several groups of bruises on her neck and back. She ordered a complete blood count, whic...|$|R
