5|$|For air defense, Hezbollah has {{anti-aircraft}} {{weapons that}} include the ZU-23 artillery and the man-portable, shoulder-fired SA-7 and SA-18 surface-to-air missile (SAM). One {{of the most effective}} weapons deployed by Hezbollah has been the C-802 <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 2007, {{both the}} Sea Eagle <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missile</b> and the ALARM {{anti-radiation}} missile that previously equipped the RSAF's Tornados had been withdrawn from service. As of 2010, Saudi Arabia has signed several contracts for new weapon systems to be fitted to their Tornado and Typhoon fleets, {{such as the}} short range air-to-air IRIS-T missile, and the Brimstone and Storm Shadow cruise missiles.|$|E
50|$|Later {{upgraded}} to either two C-301 supersonic <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missiles,</b> or four C-101 supersonic <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missiles.</b> An upgraded version, {{capable of carrying}} four YJ-8 (C-801) <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missiles</b> is currently under development. Initially designated H-6IV.|$|R
50|$|<b>Anti-ship</b> <b>{{missiles}}</b> {{are guided}} missiles {{that are designed}} for use against ships and large boats. Most <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missiles</b> are of the sea skimming variety, and many {{use a combination of}} inertial guidance and active radar homing. A good number of other <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missiles</b> use infrared homing to follow the heat that is emitted by a ship; it is also possible for <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missiles</b> to be guided by radio command all the way.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missiles</b> can be {{launched}} {{from a variety}} of weapons systems including surface warships (they can then be referred to as ship-to-ship missiles), submarines, bombers, fighter planes, patrol planes, helicopters, shore batteries, land vehicles, and conceivably, even by infantrymen firing shoulder-launched missiles. The term surface-to-surface missile (SSM) is used when appropriate. The longer-range <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missiles</b> are often called <b>anti-ship</b> cruise <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Royal Navy Lynxes {{worked in}} {{combination}} with US Seahawks during the Gulf War. The American helicopters lacked an effective <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missile,</b> but had superior surveillance capability compared to the British Lynx. They would locate hostile boats for the British helicopters, which would then attack the target with its Sea Skua missiles. In total, Lynx helicopters flew nearly 600sorties during the Gulf War, while their crews and engineers maintained flying rates three times their norm.|$|E
5|$|Although no flight-deck cruisers {{were ever}} {{built by the}} U.S. Navy, the Soviet Union's , {{developed}} in the 1970s, is remarkably {{similar to that of}} the original flight-deck cruiser design, featuring an angled flight deck aft with <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missile</b> launchers forwards. In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the installation of a flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end a much more modest conversion, lacking the flight deck, was carried out.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the order made by the Luftwaffe, the German Navy's Marineflieger also received 112 of the IDS variant in the anti-shipping and marine reconnaissance roles, again replacing the Starfighter. These equipped two wings, each with a nominal strength of 48 aircraft. The principal anti-ship weapon was the AS.34 Kormoran <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missile,</b> which were initially supplemented by unguided bombs and BL755 cluster munitions, and later by AGM-88 HARM anti-radar missiles. Pods fitted with panoramic optical cameras and an infrared line scan were carried for the reconnaissance mission.|$|E
50|$|The Type 024 {{missile boat}} is a Chinese built small missile boat armed with two <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missiles</b> {{and there were}} two {{versions}} developed. Although most have been placed in reserve, dozens remain in active service. Those in active service have been rearmed with C-101 supersonic <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R

5|$|Two hardpoints {{are present}} on the {{underside}} of the airframe on which the HM1 model can carry four Sting Ray torpedoes or Mk 11 Mod 3 depth charges. Some customers have chosen to deploy the Marte <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missile</b> on the AW101; as of 2011, the Royal Navy is considering equipping their Merlin fleet with an anti-surface missile. The Mk1, Mk3 and Mk3A variants can mount general purpose machine guns in up to five locations in the main cabin, aimed out of both door and window apertures. AgustaWestland has examined the integration of rockets and additional ground-attack weapons.|$|E

25|$|China's first {{completely}} indigenous <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missile</b> {{program was}} the YJ8 series. This missile externally appears {{similar to the}} French Exocet and American Harpoon, but is essentially a Chinese designed weapon system. The basic YJ8 appeared in the early 1980s, with a short range of 22 miles (40 or so kilometers). It was successful in its test launches however, hitting and sinking targets of up to 10,000 tons with a high hit probability. Unlike older designs, the YJ8 could attack targets at low altitudes to reduce its vulnerability to CIWS, and has greater Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) to prevent enemy jamming. The YJ8 entered widespread service, becoming the standard <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missile</b> on most second and third generation Chinese built warships, ranging from destroyers and frigates, to missile craft and submarines. The missile can also be launched from shore platforms and aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Kh-31 missile was {{developed}} by Zvezda-Strela in the Soviet Union starting in 1977 for service as a long-range <b>anti-ship</b> <b>missile</b> and anti-radiation missile, first being flown in 1982. Derived from the P-270 Moskit missile, the Kh-31 is conventional in shape, and has cruciform fins made from titanium, with a rocket-ramjet propulsion system providing thrust.|$|E
