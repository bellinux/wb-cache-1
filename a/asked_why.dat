5|$|A Washington Post {{editorial}} <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> {{an apparently}} unstable Army private {{had been able}} to access and transfer sensitive material in the first place. According to her biographer, Manning's sexuality came into play by illustrating for the far right that gay people were unfit for military service, while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying.|$|E
5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted {{that there was little}} hard evidence for the origins of Islam and <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> it took several decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts. Arguing that there was little evidence for how the faith was born, he suggested that the city of Mecca {{may not have been the}} real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's existence as a real historical figure– claimed that much of the Islamic origin story was later developed in the early years of the Arab Empire.|$|E
5|$|As a redshirt {{freshman}} for the 2015 Wolverines, Speight began {{the season as}} a backup to Jake Rudock and Shane Morris. Speight made his Michigan debut on September 12, 2015, taking kneel-down snaps in the closing minutes of a victory over Oregon State. <b>Asked</b> <b>why</b> he played Speight instead of Morris {{at the end of}} the Oregon State game, head coach Jim Harbaugh explained that he did not want to burn Morris's redshirt year on a meaningless snap, emphasizing that Morris remained his No. 2 quarterback.|$|E

[...] We <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> a caterpillar should suffer such cruel punishment. We <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> digger wasps couldn't first kill caterpillars {{to save them}} from a prolonged and agonizing torture. We <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> a child should die an untimely death. And we <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> we should all grow old and die.|$|R

5|$|For the 2009 remake, {{stuntman}} Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried {{about his ability to}} portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them {{he would be able to}} perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> they should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.|$|E
5|$|Freed, Desha left Kentucky, {{traveling}} {{down the}} Ohio and Mississippi rivers. According to legend, {{he attempted to}} rob a flatboat skipper near Vicksburg, Mississippi. It happened the skipper was a longtime acquaintance of Desha, named G. W. Crawford. Crawford recognized Desha and <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> {{he would try to}} rob him. Desha confessed that he had been living as an outlaw since his father's pardon. Crawford urged Desha to abandon his illegal activities and offered to give him free passage to New Orleans, Louisiana. Desha accepted, telling Crawford that he planned to travel on to a distant place, assume a new name, and seek a fresh start.|$|E
5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E

5|$|Matsueda {{is noted}} for her jazzy style, which she often {{incorporated}} into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was {{responsible for most of}} the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are important factors in composition. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> she creates music, Matsueda replied that she feels it is an appropriate way to express herself.|$|E
5|$|Nana is {{then asked}} to take Nunung out with her, {{in the hopes that}} the eldest sister will meet a marriageable young man. At a party, while Nana mingles with several men, Nunung sits out every dance and {{eventually}} leaves with Herman. <b>Asked</b> <b>why</b> she has returned home, Nunung tells her grandmother that she felt too old among the younger party-goers and asks why she was told to go. Nenny, again eavesdropping, shouts out that their grandmother is hoping to find her a husband. Though Nunung is initially angered, she understands her grandmother's good intentions.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff at}} Cherry Springs State Park {{did not intend}} for it to become an {{attraction}} for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a telescope at the park at about 1AM. When Harrison <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> the man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, {{one of the best}} locations east of the Mississippi River for stargazing.|$|E

5|$|When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> {{she did not}} {{immediately}} inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said {{she had not seen}} any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her of the importance of his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|With the {{resumption}} of hostilities after the Peace of Amiens, Murray returned to sea {{in command of the}} 74-gun , but word soon reached him that Nelson had requested him to be his captain of the fleet in the Mediterranean. Murray was initially reluctant to accept the offer, and on being <b>asked</b> <b>why,</b> replied that the nature of the service was such, as very frequently terminated in disagreement between the admiral and the captain; and he should be extremely unwilling to hazard any possible thing that should diminish the regard and respect which he should ever entertain for his lordship.|$|E
5|$|Young Penny would {{accompany}} {{her father to}} the hotels and check the cleanliness of the ladies restrooms. In 1972, Don died suddenly {{of a heart attack}} when Penny was 13years old. Following Don's death, Sue began battling depression, requiring Penny to at times care for her mother and her younger brothers. At age 16, Penny wrote a letter to her grandfather, and head of the family business empire, A.N. Pritzker, in which she <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> he talked business with the men in the family and not with her. Finally realizing Penny's interest in business, A.N. provided her with a summer course in accounting.|$|E

5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on scale models, which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: {{one has a}} red strip for the whole length of the train, with the window backgrounds painted grey. The other is more similar to the final result, but {{the front of the}} train includes more red and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled to a combination of both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. The bottom of the carriages is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey. Red colouring {{at the end of each}} car forms red parallelograms when the carriages are combined. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> the trains were not blue and white, VR's CEO answered that red and white fits the train and its design the best.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{historian}} Josiah Bunting III {{noted that}} Grant was never {{put on his}} guard when Secretary Belknap came to the White House in a disturbed manner or even <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> Belknap wanted to resign in the first place. Bunting argues that Grant should have pressed Belknap into {{an explanation for the}} abrupt resignation request. Grant's acceptance of the resignation indirectly allowed Belknap, after he was impeached by the House of Representatives for his actions, to escape conviction, since he was no longer a government official. Belknap was acquitted by the Senate, escaping with less than the two-thirds majority vote needed for conviction. Even though the Senate voted that it could put private citizens on trial, many senators were reluctant to convict Belknap since he was no longer Secretary of War. It has been suggested that Grant accepted the resignation in a Victorian impulse to protect the women involved.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{entered the}} Lutheran Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium in 1911. This {{was one of}} the best schools in Budapest, part of a {{brilliant}} education system designed for the elite. Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one gymnasium. Despite being run by the Lutheran Church, the majority of its pupils were Jewish. The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, that included Theodore von Kármán (b. 1881), George de Hevesy (b. 1885), Leó Szilárd (b. 1898), Dennis Gabor (b. 1900), Eugene Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908), and Paul Erdős (b. 1913). Collectively, they were sometimes known as Martians. Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> the Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses, Wigner, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, replied that von Neumann was the only genius.|$|E
5|$|Another {{explanation}} surmised is that Wagner did not consent {{because he}} felt he was not receiving just compensation from the ATC for his baseball card. Wagner had a history of being a tough negotiator; he had announced his retirement from baseball in December 1907, but returned shortly {{before the start of the}} 1908 baseball season after receiving a $10,000 contract, double his salary from the 1907 season. This theory has its flaws, however, since Wagner sent Gruber a check for $10 to compensate him for the fee ATC would have paid him if Wagner had given permission to create his baseball card. Michael O'Keeffe and Teri Thompson, authors of The Card: Collectors, Con Men, and the True Story of History's Most Desired Baseball Card, <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> Wagner would compensate Gruber for $10, a substantial amount of money at the time (approximately equal to $275 in 2016), if he refused authorization for monetary reasons. The ATC had already produced a number of T206 Honus Wagner baseball cards; the exact number is unknown, but is speculated to be between 50 and 200. They stopped production of the card, however, after Wagner denied authorization.|$|E
