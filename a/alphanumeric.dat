5|$|After Victoria {{converted}} to <b>alphanumeric</b> route markers the Victorian section was signed as B23. In 2013 the NSW and ACT conversion to <b>alphanumeric</b> routes occurred {{and the remainder}} of the highway (south of Hindmarsh Drive in the ACT) was then also signed as B23. This violates the convention in New South Wales, where numbered routes below 50 are prefixed with an 'A' and 'B' routes are numbered above 50; the violation was allowed so the number and letter would be consistent across state lines.|$|E
5|$|On October 2010, these {{versions}} {{were given}} <b>alphanumeric</b> designations with the INS/GPS version becoming the SBU-38 (SBU=Smart Bomb Unit), the INS/GPS/IIR version becoming the SBU-54 and the INS/GPS/SALH version becoming the SBU-64; {{the system as}} a whole was renamed Hammer to make it more appealing to export customers.|$|E
5|$|In July 1920, she was {{assigned}} the hull code of DD-52 under the US Navy's <b>alphanumeric</b> classification system. In May 1921, Nicholson was reactivated with a reduced complement. She remained active {{for about a}} year, until she was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 26 May 1922. The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 7 January 1936, and on 30 June was sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|In July 1920, she was {{assigned}} the hull code of DD-53 under the US Navy's <b>alphanumeric</b> classification system. Winslow was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 5 June 1922. On 1 July 1933, {{she dropped the}} name Winslow to free it for a new destroyer of the same name, becoming known only as DD-53. The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 7 January 1936, and, on 30 June, was sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|Route markers {{were first}} {{introduced}} in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled {{out to the}} various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route numbering scheme. Previous to the NSW conversion to <b>alphanumeric</b> routes in 2013, the highway was signed as National Route 18 shield along its entire length. In addition to this, {{the section of the}} Monaro Highway between Cooma and Steeple Flat was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length within NSW; this kind of arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the highway from end to end. The Snowy Mountains Highway was allocated the <b>alphanumeric</b> route B72 as part of New South Wales' 2013 conversion. The route duplex along the Monaro Highway remains intact with B72 used in addition to B23 between Cooma and Steeple Flat.|$|E
5|$|The Monaro Highway {{initially}} {{bore the}} National Route 23 route markers along its entire length, excluding the Eastern Parkway extension, which was instead part of Alternate National Route 23. Now that each jurisdiction has converted to <b>alphanumeric</b> markers, it instead carries the B23 route marker along almost its entire length, breaking the NSW convention of all 'B' routes having numbers above 50.|$|E
5|$|Type {{safety is}} {{variable}} in COBOL. Numeric data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and <b>alphanumeric</b> {{data can be}} placed in any data item that can be stored as a string, including numeric and group data. In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may be restricted to a certain type.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, Cushing {{remained}} in French waters. She towed , which had grounded on rocks in a French harbor, into Brest on 3 December. However, Cushing departed for the United States on 21 December, arriving in New York on 6 January 1919. She {{was placed in}} reduced commission on 1 July, and transferred to the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 6 April 1920. In July, she was assigned the hull code of DD-55 under the U.S. Navy's <b>alphanumeric</b> classification system. Cushing was decommissioned on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|Product {{activation}} {{was introduced}} in this release. After installation, users are allowed a 15-day grace period to activate their copy of Norton Internet Security 2004. The program will not work after the deadline without the 24-character product key. The product key used to activate a copy of Norton Internet Security ties in with an <b>alphanumeric</b> code based on a computer's hardware configuration. Users may activate their product five times with the same product key, however licensing terms dictate users are allowed only to install Norton Internet Security 2004 on one computer.|$|E
5|$|The notes had 150 minor marks that {{acted as}} {{security}} measures to identify forgeries. These were often {{assumed to be}} printing errors, and were changed between issues of notes. Each note bore an <b>alphanumeric</b> serial designation and the signature of the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. Prior {{to the release of}} any notes by the Bank of England, all serial numbers were recorded in ledgers so the bank could verify its liabilities; these numbers were checked when the notes circulated back through the bank.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the signing}} of the Armistice on 11 November which ended all fighting, Balch {{received}} orders to sail for home and she departed Ireland on 16 November. She arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, via Ponta Delgada, Azores, on 1 January 1919 and was placed in ordinary. Returned to commission in early April, the destroyer sailed to the West Indies for three weeks of maneuvers out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Balch then returned to Norfolk on 28 April for an overhaul. In July 1920, she was assigned the hull code of DD-50 under the US Navy's <b>alphanumeric</b> classification system. Postwar funding shortages kept the destroyer in port until late 1921, when Balch briefly cruised with the Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, before financial considerations led to her inactivation.|$|E
5|$|Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and {{the game}} ends {{immediately}} if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an <b>alphanumeric</b> code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues {{as to what the}} player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien language.|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an <b>alphanumeric</b> display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis {{married in}} 1977. Soon after, {{while living in}} Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft. When they began work on Ravenloft, they felt the vampire {{archetype}} had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it {{with a group of}} players every Halloween for five years before it was published in 1983 by TSR. The plot combined elements of the horror genre with Dungeons & Dragons conventions for the first time. At the time of Ravenlofts release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an <b>alphanumeric</b> code indicating the series to which it belonged. Ravenloft was labeled I6: the sixth in a series of intermediate-level modules for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). It consisted of a 32-page book, with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario.|$|E
5|$|Lexus {{production}} models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The first letter indicates relative {{status in the}} Lexus model range (ranking), and the second letter refers to car body style or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied {{by a factor of}} one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport' (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV. On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the <b>alphanumeric</b> designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, 't' for turbocharged), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive). On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the postal}} code systems are numeric; {{only a few}} are <b>alphanumeric</b> (i.e., use both letters and digits). <b>Alphanumeric</b> systems can, given {{the same number of}} characters, encode many more locations. For example, while a 2 digit numeric code can {{represent}} 100 locations, a 2 character <b>alphanumeric</b> code using ten numbers and twenty letters can represent 900 locations.|$|E
25|$|The BBAN must be of a {{fixed length}} {{for the country}} and {{comprise}} case-insensitive <b>alphanumeric</b> characters. It includes the domestic bank account number, branch identifier, and potential routing information. Each country can have a different national routing/account numbering system, up to a maximum of 30 <b>alphanumeric</b> characters.|$|E
25|$|Tasmania {{introduced}} an <b>alphanumeric</b> route numbering system in 1979, {{based on the}} British system from 1963. The new system aimed to upgrade the signing of destinations, including previously unmarked roads, and to simplify navigation by allowing visitors to follow numbered routes. National Highway1 was retained as the only route without an <b>alphanumeric</b> designation.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} National Routes and National Highways, State Routes are being phased out {{in most states}} and territories in favour of <b>alphanumeric</b> routes. However, {{despite the fact that}} Victoria has fully adopted <b>alphanumeric</b> routes in {{regional}} areas, state route numbers are still used extensively within the city of Melbourne as a part of its Metropolitan Route Numbering Scheme.|$|E
25|$|This <b>alphanumeric</b> {{scheme was}} {{significantly}} different from the current system used for SMS messages.|$|E
25|$|Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) – up to 30 <b>alphanumeric</b> {{characters}} that are country-specific.|$|E
25|$|Motorola's {{low-cost}} mobile phone, the Motorola F3, uses an <b>alphanumeric</b> black-and-white electrophoretic display.|$|E
25|$|Bonds {{are often}} {{identified}} by its international securities identification number, or ISIN, {{which is a}} 12 digit <b>alphanumeric</b> code that uniquely identifies debt securities.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the English machines, which were given <b>alphanumeric</b> names, the French tunnelling machines were all named after women: Brigitte, Europa, Catherine, Virginie, Pascaline, Séverine.|$|E
25|$|Roads {{routes in}} Australia assist drivers {{navigating}} roads throughout the country, by identifying important through-routes. The first route marking system {{was introduced to}} Australia in the 1950s. National Routes were assigned to significant interstate routes – the most important road links in the country. National Route 1 was designated to a circular route around the Australian coastline. A state route marking system was designed to supplement the national system, for inter-regional and urban routes within states. When the National Highway system was introduced, National Routes along it became National Highway routes with the same numbers, but with distinctive green and gold route markers. <b>Alphanumeric</b> routes were introduced in Tasmania in 1979, and during the 1990s, planning began for nationally consistent route markings, using the <b>alphanumeric</b> system. <b>Alphanumeric</b> routes have been introduced in most states and territories in Australia, partially or completely replacing the previous systems.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas where}} speeds are lower {{and there are}} a number of routes which can be taken, <b>alphanumeric</b> (also called theatre-style) route {{indicators}} are used to display a number or a letter (e.g. a platform number or line designation) to denote the route the train is to take. They may be located above or beside the relevant signal. When a route is set and the signal is cleared, the relevant letter or number is shown. On shunting signals, where speeds are much lower, a miniature version of the <b>alphanumeric</b> route indicator is used.|$|E
25|$|The Motor Car Act 1903, {{which came}} into force on 1 January 1904, {{required}} all motor vehicles to be entered on an official vehicle register, and to carry <b>alphanumeric</b> plates. The Act {{was passed in}} order that vehicles could be easily traced {{in the event of}} an accident or contravention of the law. Vehicle registration <b>alphanumeric</b> plates in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law. Front plates are white, whereas back plates are yellow.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, filenames {{allowed only}} <b>alphanumeric</b> {{characters}}, {{but as time}} progressed, the number of characters allowed increased. This led to compatibility problems when moving files from one file system to another.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{development}} of alternative input devices, such as the mouse, touchscreen, pen devices, character recognition and voice recognition, the keyboard remains {{the most commonly used}} device for direct (human) input of <b>alphanumeric</b> data into computers.|$|E
25|$|The colour and <b>alphanumeric</b> {{codes for}} each {{direction}} of travel remained unchanged, except that {{with the opening of}} the Woodlands Extension (connecting Yishun station to Choa Chu Kang station), the Jurong East – Choa Chu Kang Branch Line ceased to exist. As such, the formerly Northbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in khaki travelled southbound to Marina Bay & as such were denoted as red while the formerly Southbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in brown originated from Marina Bay, hence having travelled northbound it was denoted as yellow. The <b>alphanumeric</b> codes for these stations were also replaced. After Sembawang it is N14-N18, N20-N23, with the exception of N13 (Canberra) and N19 (Sungei Kadut). The B1-B3 was renumbered to N21-N23.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s Victoria and South Australia also {{overhauled}} their systems. While South Australia discarded the National and State Route Numbering Systems, those shield-based schemes {{were retained}} in the Melbourne metropolitan area as the Metropolitan Route Numbering Scheme. The route numbers used in the <b>alphanumeric</b> schemes were generally inherited from the original National Route Numbering System, {{with only a few}} exceptions, and prefixed with letters denoting their grade. For example, Western Freeway is M8 until Ballarat and continues beyond as A8 Western Highway. They are not used extensively in the Melbourne metropolitan area where the blue-shield metropolitan route system is retained for most routes. The National Highways were retained, until 2013, but with the route numbers changed to <b>alphanumeric</b> designations.|$|E
25|$|Packet {{scanning}} is not {{an effective}} method since it can only prevent known attacks {{and there are many}} ways that a NOP-sled can be encoded. Shellcode used by attackers can be made <b>alphanumeric,</b> metamorphic, or self-modifying to evade detection by heuristic packet scanners and intrusion detection systems.|$|E
25|$|Atoms: Atoms {{are used}} within {{a program to}} denote {{distinguished}} values. They are written as strings of consecutive <b>alphanumeric</b> characters, the first character being lowercase. Atoms can contain any character if they are enclosed within single quotes and an escape convention exists which allows any character to be used within an atom.|$|E
25|$|The IBAN {{consists}} {{of up to}} 34 <b>alphanumeric</b> characters comprising: a country code; two check digits; and a number that includes the domestic bank account number, branch identifier, and potential routing information. The check digits enable a sanity check of the bank account number to confirm its integrity before submitting a transaction.|$|E
25|$|Vehicle {{registration}} {{plates are}} the mandatory <b>alphanumeric</b> plates used {{to display the}} registration mark of a vehicle, and have existed in the United Kingdom since 1903. It is compulsory for motor vehicles used on public roads to display vehicle registration plates, {{with the exception of}} vehicles of the reigning monarch used on official business.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} code produced by any key press {{is determined by}} the keyboard driver software. A key press generates a scancode which is interpreted as an <b>alphanumeric</b> character or control function. Depending on operating systems, various application programs are available to create, add and switch among keyboard layouts. Many programs are available, some of which are language specific.|$|E
