5|$|In October 2006, Coldplay {{began work}} on their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and <b>All</b> <b>His</b> <b>Friends,</b> with {{producer}} Brian Eno. Taking a break from recording, the band toured Latin America in early 2007, finishing the Twisted Logic Tour by performing in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. After recording in churches and other venues in Latin America and Spain during their tour, the band said the album would likely reflect Hispanic influence. The group {{spent the rest of}} the year recording most of the album with Eno.|$|E
5|$|In Viva la Vida or Death and <b>All</b> <b>His</b> <b>Friends,</b> the group's {{style was}} moving towards art rock, being {{influenced}} by the bands Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine. The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras, honky-tonk pianos and further so. Mylo Xyloto carries the concept album format from the love and war-induced Viva la Vida. It also expands the spectrum by including electronic & acoustic elements, featuring upbeat tones {{for the first time}} and predominantly being a pop rock album, in stark contrast to the band's previous works. Lyrical influences were taken from graffiti and the German resistance group White Rose.|$|E

60|$|Then {{he dragged}} him away to their Eyry--it had been many {{a long day}} since they had been there--and to <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>friend's</b> speeches, to <b>all</b> <b>his</b> {{wondering}} questions, he answered never a word until they had climbed the stairs, and so come to their old haunt. Then he spoke.|$|R

5|$|Hip hop artist Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III is the highest-selling {{album of}} 2008 in the US, selling 2.874 million copies since its release. The album {{attained}} the most sales in a week, netting {{over one million}} units {{after a week of}} release, a feat previously accomplished in 2005. The second best-selling album of the year is alternative rock band Coldplay's Viva la Vida or Death and <b>All</b> <b>His</b> <b>Friends</b> with 2.144 million copies sold, followed by Swift's Fearless with 2.112 million.

5|$|Kenshin first {{appeared}} in two chapters of Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, the pilot chapters of the manga, in which he arrives in Tokyo and defeats several groups of villains attacking families. In these stories, Kenshin is given a similar personality to the one {{he has in the}} series, but his name is not mentioned. Following the original series' ending, Watsuki wrote two shorts where Kenshin makes brief appearances; in Yahiko no Sabato Kenshin and Kaoru entrust Yahiko with taking care of a dojo whereas in Haru ni Sakura he reunites with <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> and learn about the place where Saito left and learn of his friend Sagara Sanosuke through a letter after he left Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers had interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors {{for the film}} and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. However, Woodroof did lose <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> after they {{found out he was}} HIV-positive. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to a rethinking of his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people. Other people who knew him said that he did not harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. Also, while a rodeo enthusiast, he never rode any bulls himself. Although the film shows Woodroof diagnosed in 1985, he told Borten that a doctor had informed him he might have had the disease well before that; Woodroof believed that he may have been infected in 1981, something that was briefly alluded to in a flashback in the film.|$|E
6000|$|Big Waller {{had a deep}} {{reverence for}} the {{supposed}} wisdom of <b>his</b> <b>friend</b> Bounce. He listened to his lucubrations with earnest attention at all times, and, when he understood them, usually assented to <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>friend</b> said. When Bounce became too profound for him, as was not infrequently the case, he contented himself with nodding his head, as though to say, [...] "I'm with you in heart, lad, though not quite clear in my mind; but it's all right, I'm quite sartin." ...|$|R
60|$|Dick was in {{a quandary}} as to how he was to treat <b>all</b> of <b>his</b> <b>friends,</b> and called Sam and Tom to him for consultation.|$|R

5|$|The {{setback for}} the reformers was short-lived. By September, Henry was displeased {{with the results}} of the Act and its promulgators; the ever-loyal Cranmer and Cromwell were back in favour. The king asked his {{archbishop}} to write a new preface for the Great Bible, an English translation of the Bible that was first published in April 1539 under the direction of Cromwell. The preface was {{in the form of a}} sermon addressed to readers. As for Cromwell, he was delighted that his plan of a royal marriage between Henry and Anne of Cleves, the sister of a German prince was accepted by the king. In Cromwell's view, the marriage could potentially bring back contacts with the Schmalkaldic League. Henry was dismayed with Anne when they first met on 1 January 1540 but married her reluctantly on 6 January in a ceremony officiated by Cranmer. However, the marriage ended in disaster as Henry decided shortly thereafter that he would request a royal divorce. This resulted in Henry being placed in an embarrassing position and Cromwell suffered the consequences. His old enemies, including the Duke of Norfolk, took advantage of the weakened Cromwell and he was arrested on 10 June. He immediately lost the support of <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends,</b> including Cranmer. However, as Cranmer had done for Anne Boleyn, he wrote a letter to the king defending the past work of Cromwell. Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleves was quickly annulled on 9 July by the vice-gerential synod, now led by Cranmer and Gardiner.|$|E

25|$|The artwork for Viva la Vida or Death and <b>All</b> <b>His</b> <b>Friends</b> was {{designed}} by Coldplay and Tappin Gofton; the latter designed the X cover three years earlier. The design style for the album took months to be completed; it was initially developed from a set of large-scale sketches and paintings of expressive typo. Lyrics and song titles were boldly painted across old maps, books, copies of old paintings, newspapers and various sorts of second-hand things. The final work was photographed and later some additional typography was added by computer.|$|E

25|$|Meyer {{was very}} up front {{throughout}} his life about being too selfish {{to be a father}} or even a caring partner or husband. Yet he is also said to have been very generous with <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> and acquaintances, and never isolated friends from one another. Biographers have attributed most of his brutish and eccentric nature {{to the fact that he}} was abandoned by his father, an Oakland police officer and overly coddled by his mother, Lydia, who was married six times. Meyer had a half sister, Lucinda, who was diagnosed in her 20s with paranoid schizophrenia and was committed to California State mental institutions until her death in 1999. Mental illness ran in his family and was something he secretly feared. During his entire life Russ Meyer spoke with only the highest reverence for his mother and sister.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of post-war austerity, U Hla {{continued}} to publish using any kind of paper {{that he could get}} hold of including coloured matchbox packing paper and used office paper with printing on one side. He would also still manage to send his new books as gifts, about 200 on each occasion, to <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> in Rangoon at a time when communication lines and road and rail transportation had all but broken down. It was in 1945 that he launched the fortnightly Ludu (The People) Journal with his wife as assistant editor. The following year saw the launch of the Ludu Daily newspaper and subsequently the couple {{came to be known as}} Ludu U Hla and Ludu Daw Amar. Their incisive political commentaries and analyses made a significant contribution to the country's yearning for independence and unified struggle against colonial rule. Their publications had never carried advertisements for alcohol, drugs to enhance sexual performance or gambling, nor racing tips, salacious affairs and gossip. U Hla had to be persuaded to make an exception of film advertisements for the survival of the paper.|$|E
