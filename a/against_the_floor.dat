While there, she became involved with, then married, one of the anarchists she met: Cornelius (Iwan) Dirk de Bruin. Soon after they were married, she said, de Bruin began to abuse her severely, punching and kicking her, burning her with cigarettes, beating her on her legs with a wooden beam, and banging her head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> until he knocked her unconscious.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen {{standing in front of}} a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that this}} kinematical {{discussion}} does not {{delve into the}} mechanism by which the required forces are generated. That {{is the subject of}} kinetics. In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker's shoes and the friction they need to generate <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the carousel, or perhaps the dynamics of skateboarding, if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: you must have a certain temperature to be comfortable, but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.|$|E

25|$|Another {{clarification}} {{needed is}} that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means {{there is a constant}} force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.|$|E
500|$|When told by Dr. Lynn of her husband's death, Ono started sobbing and said, [...] "Oh no, no, no, no... tell me it's not true!" [...] Dr. Lynn {{remembers that}} Ono {{lay down and}} began hitting her head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> but calmed down when a nurse gave Lennon's wedding ring to her. In a state of shock, she was led away from Roosevelt Hospital by Geffen Records' president, David Geffen.|$|E

50|$|The {{magazines}} {{retain the}} spur {{at the front}} of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> plate, common to both the M1934/5 and M1951, as is common for many pistols with a European-style magazine release (a hinged latch in the bottom of <b>the</b> grip <b>against</b> <b>the</b> magazine's <b>floor</b> plate), and also some compact pistols as a means of extending the grip surface while keeping the profile of the pistol small.|$|R
60|$|Less {{than three}} minutes later, there came to Chauvelin's {{expectant}} ears the soft sound made by a woman's skirts <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>floor.</b> During those three minutes, which had seemed an eternity to his impatience, he had sat silently watching the slumber--affected or real--of his enemy.|$|R

2500|$|Then, {{while the}} gleeful billionaire cheers her on, she bangs {{his face and}} head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> saying that she would stop only when he hollered [...] "Enough" [...] (which he does after a time) or until she gave out, (she taunted him by saying [...] "An' I feel real strong yet, see?!"). This sends Mrs. Warbucks in, upset and {{hovering}} over Selby (she cries, [...] "My DARLING!", which she also did, after Oliver threatened Selby with a thrashing).|$|E
2500|$|A third passenger, a 15-year-old Chinese girl, died of her {{injuries}} at San Francisco General Hospital {{six days}} after the accident[...] She had been wearing her seatbelt and was seated in 42A which is the last row of passenger seats {{on the left side}} of the aircraft and was immediately forward of door 4L. During the crash the back of her seat rotated back and <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> leaving her exposed. Her injuries were likely due to being struck by door 4L which separated during the airplane’s final impact.|$|E

50|$|The {{album cover}} was {{designed}} by actor Dean Stockwell, who had also written the screenplay that inspired After the Gold Rush.

5000|$|Cattle have dichromatic vision, {{rendering}} them red-green colorblind and falsifying {{the idea}} that the color red makes them angry; they just respond to the movements of the [...] "muleta".

60|$|When the captain, {{followed}} by a half-dozen seamen rushed down the companionway, he found Billy sitting astride the prostrate form of the mate. His great fingers circled the man's throat, and with mighty blows he was dashing <b>the</b> fellow's head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> hard <b>floor.</b> Another moment and murder would have been complete.|$|R
2500|$|As {{with the}} exterior, the {{interior}} was completely redesigned with a more conservative style, although some features from the previous cars were carried over. The dashboard had a more linear appearance, instead of curving around the driver. The [...] "Integrated Control Panel" [...] was carried over but enlarged, reshaped, {{and placed in the}} center of the dash instead of being tilted toward the driver. The Flip-Fold center console was also carried over but it was revamped as well. When folded out, it now rested <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> instead of the dashboard, and had different cupholders and storage areas. Unlike previous Tauruses, this one offered rear cupholders that either slid or folded out of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} was also completely redesigned {{with a more}} conventional shape, although some features from the previous Taurus generations were carried over. The dashboard was given a squarer design instead of curving around the driver {{as in the previous}} generation. The [...] "integrated control panel" [...] concept was carried over but redesigned, with a bigger, squarer shape, and it was placed {{in the center of the}} dash instead of being angled toward the driver. The flip-fold center console was also carried over from the previous generation, although it was revamped as well. When folded out, it now rested <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> instead of the dashboard, and had reworked cup holders and storage areas. In another change from previous versions, the fourth generation offered rear cup holders that either slid or folded out of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with.|$|E
2500|$|A {{standing}} back handspring {{begins with}} a three phase sequence known as [...] "up, sit, jump". In the up phase, the gymnast stands up straight on flat feet, with arms in front at an angle slightly above horizontal. In the sit phase, the gymnast swings the arms down by {{the sides of the}} torso, bends knees, and sits back as if sitting in a chair; while in this position, the gymnast is unbalanced. Together, the sit and jump phases impart angular momentum to the body, causing it to rotate. In the jump phase, the gymnast swings both arms up by the ears and jumps into the air while transitioning to an arch position, with the head in a neutral position, arms and legs straight, and feet together; this body shape is maintained until the hands contact the floor. With hands on the floor, the body's angular momentum is used to transform the gymnast's body shape from an arch, through a linear shape, to a [...] "hollow" [...] shape. The hands are then pushed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> causing the body to lift off from the floor while the body continues its feet-first rotation. Finally, the feet land on the floor, behind the body's center of gravity, and the remaining angular momentum is depleted as it carries the gymnast to a stationary standing position.|$|E
50|$|In {{the course}} of setting {{the record for the}} most number of sit ups in one hour, Bibhuti {{suffered}} a brain hemorrhage and spent three days in a coma {{due to the lack of}} any padding underneath his head and in the process hit the back of his head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> concrete <b>floor</b> 1,448 times.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is a {{good bit}} of steel, Dick,' said one, putting <b>the</b> point <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>floor,</b> and {{pressing}} down until he touched it with the handle.

6000|$|Presently one {{of those}} who was being forced unwillingly within hit upon a happy scheme for {{learning}} first the precise nature of the danger which menaced him from the silent interior.

60|$|Chauvelin {{pressed his}} lips together. Truly now {{he felt that}} a retort from him would have been undignified, more {{especially}} as just at this moment there came from the guard room the sound of men's voices talking and laughing, the occasional clang of steel, or of a heavy boot <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tiled <b>floor,</b> <b>the</b> rattling of dice, or a sudden burst of laughter--sounds, in fact, that betokened {{the presence of a}} number of soldiers close by.|$|R
5000|$|Professor Ibrahim Lipumba, {{leader of}} the Civic United Front visited the site as well where he said, “Innocent lives have been {{shuttered}} down.

60|$|The buzz of talk died down, giving {{place to}} respectful murmurs.

60|$|I nodded. Then she bade {{the priests}} {{put on the}} ray-proof armour that we had discarded, and told us to go without the chamber and lie in the {{darkness}} of the passage with our faces <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{walls were}} whitewashed, and, as Cecilia knew, came off on anybody who leaned <b>against</b> them. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> was stained, {{and had no}} carpet. There was a little gas cooking-stove, with cooking things ranged on it; a small bare table; and one large cupboard. No draperies, no pictures, no {{ornaments}} of any kind; but by the window an ancient golden leather chair. Cecilia could never bear to sit in that oasis; its colour in this wilderness was too precious to her spirit.|$|R
50|$|The {{specimen}} {{is preserved}} on two counter slabs broken originally into four pieces.
