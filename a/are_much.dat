5|$|Flying {{squirrels}} {{and sugar}} gliders <b>are</b> <b>much</b> alike in their body plans with gliding wings stretched between their limbs, but flying squirrels are placental mammals while sugar gliders are marsupials, widely separated within the mammal lineage.|$|E
5|$|For example, the hardness, {{electrical}} and thermal conductivity <b>are</b> <b>much</b> higher within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, {{the properties of}} c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous and isotropic.|$|E

5|$|In {{a passive}} ALF, the input {{frequency}} must correspond almost exactly {{to the natural}} absorption lines of the vapor cell. Active ARFs <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more flexible, however, as the vapor may be stimulated {{so that it will}} absorb other frequencies of light.|$|E
5|$|Of Jupiter's moons, eight are regular {{satellites}} with prograde {{and nearly}} circular orbits {{that are not}} greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets {{if they were in}} direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites <b>are</b> <b>much</b> smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits <b>are</b> <b>much</b> farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. Eighteen of the irregular satellites have not yet been named.|$|E

5|$|Saturn's {{atmosphere}} {{exhibits a}} banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands <b>are</b> <b>much</b> fainter and <b>are</b> <b>much</b> wider near the equator. The nomenclature {{used to describe}} these bands {{is the same as}} on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the Voyager spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.|$|E

50|$|It {{is similar}} to Lophostethus dumolinii, but smaller and {{the margin of the}} {{forewings}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> less crenulated, the ground colour <b>is</b> <b>much</b> darker and more purplish and the stigmata is smaller and more golden. It <b>is</b> also <b>much</b> less heavily marked below.|$|R
5|$|The chromosphere, {{transition}} region, and corona <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{hotter than}} {{the surface of}} the Sun. The reason is not well understood, but evidence suggests that Alfvén waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.|$|E
5|$|The mesoglea {{contains}} {{small numbers}} of amoeba-like cells, and muscle cells in some species. However, the number of middle-layer cells and types <b>are</b> <b>much</b> lower than in sponges.|$|E
5|$|There are exoplanets that <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{closer to}} their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, {{and there are also}} exoplanets that <b>are</b> <b>much</b> farther from their star. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 AU, takes 88-days for an orbit, but the {{shortest}} known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. Kepler-70b. The Kepler-11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury's, all of them much more massive than Mercury. Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of AU from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit, e.g. 1RXS1609 b.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{additional}} alkali and alkaline neptunium oxide compounds such as Cs4Np5O17 and Cs2Np3O10 have been characterized with various production methods. Neptunium has also been observed to form ternary oxides with many additional elements in groups 3 through 7, although these compounds <b>are</b> <b>much</b> less well studied.|$|E
5|$|A {{vampire bat}} has front teeth that are {{specialized}} for cutting {{and the back}} teeth <b>are</b> <b>much</b> smaller than in other bats.

5|$|According to the anti-nuclear movement, {{most of the}} {{problems}} with nuclear power today <b>are</b> <b>much</b> the same as in the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E

Political integration will also <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more difficult because North Korea is almost completely isolated {{from the rest of}} the world, whereas the East Germans all watched West-German television and were quite well aware of what was going on in the Federal Republic.|$|R

5|$|All bovids {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with a blunt end, {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and a tail varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) <b>are</b> <b>much</b> smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E
5|$|All have paddle-like {{tails and}} many have {{laterally}} compressed bodies that give them an eel-like appearance. Unlike fish, {{they do not have}} gills and must surface regularly to breathe. Along with whales, they are among the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this group are species {{with some of the most}} potent venoms of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, but others <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more aggressive. Currently, 17genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 62 species.|$|E
5|$|Although Ferugliotherium teeth <b>are</b> <b>much</b> lower-crowned {{than those}} of the Sudamericidae, they share an {{essentially}} similar pattern on the occlusal (chewing) surface of mf1 and mf2, similar incisors, backward jaw movement during chewing, and enamel with small prisms. Ferugliotherium is thought to have been a small animal, with a body mass of about 70g (2.5oz), and may have eaten insects and plant material. Its remains have been found in two geological formations of southern Argentina, where {{it is part of a}} mammal fauna that also includes the sudamericid Gondwanatherium and a variety of dryolestoids.|$|E

50|$|There were {{different}} definitions of what made a hime kaidō, as some detours just went around one difficult area, while others <b>were</b> <b>much</b> longer and avoided {{most of the}} dangerous routes. Because of the various definitions, the Nakasendō was {{sometimes referred to as}} a hime kaidō, because the distance <b>was</b> <b>much</b> greater and the danger <b>was</b> <b>much</b> less than that of the Tōkaidō, which started and ended at the same location.|$|R
