After being armed with the witches magic weapons, Arvalan travels to Kailyal's location. He is prevented from reaching the place. However, Kehama completes a ritual {{at the same time}} that grants him power and the ability to invade the Hindu first heaven, and Ladurlad and Kailyal flee. They start a new life until a group of individuals kidnap Kailyal to marry her off to the god Juggernaut. During a ritual involving the sacrifice of worshippers, Arvalan possesses various priests who attempt have their way with Kailyal. Ereenia tries to save her, but he is stopped by Lorrinite and taken away. Left with no options, Kailyal attempts suicide by burning herself in a fire. She is rescued by Ladurlad who, because of the curse, is immune to fire.|$|E
500|$|Nurmi's {{achievements}} and training methods inspired future track stars of many generations. Emil Zátopek chanted [...] "I am Nurmi! I am Nurmi!" [...] when he {{trained as a}} child, and based his training system on what he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> about Nurmi's methods. Lasse Virén idolized Nurmi and was scheduled to meet {{him for the first}} time on the day that Nurmi died. Hicham El Guerrouj was inspired to become a runner so that he could [...] "repeat the achievements of the great man of whom his grandfather spoke." [...] He became the first man after Nurmi to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the same Games. Nurmi's influence stretched further than running on the Olympic arena. At the 1928 Olympics, Kazimierz Wierzyński won the lyric gold medal with his poem Olympic Laurel that included a verse on Nurmi. In 1936, Ludwig Stubbendorf and his horse Nurmi won the individual and team gold medals in eventing.|$|E

[...] Like them, she looked back into regional history to find what she saw as [...] "the traditions of a culture rooted to the soil" [...] before [...] "the ravages of the Industrial Revolution". She did not romanticise Britain's culinary past: [...] "Farm and factory labourers, artisans and clerical workers, still lived on a very restricted diet... their cooking facilities were so primitive and their equipment so scanty that only the most basic forms of cookery could be attempted". But her constant benchmarks were honest ingredients and uncomplicated cooking. She condemned—and explained the alternatives to—the artificial, the ersatz, the [...] "notorious Chorleywood bread", and [...] "all synthetic aids to flavouring... Nobody has ever been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> why the English regard a glass of wine added to a soup or stew as a reckless extravagance {{and at the same time}} spend pounds on bottled sauces, gravy powders, soup cubes, ketchups and artificial flavourings".|$|E

In {{addition}} to Eugene, Bessie M. Anderson and Clarence Derricotte had two other sons, Bruce (b. June 22, 1928) and Raymond. [...] Gene married Jeanne E. Hagans and had a son Robert. [...] Years later, Gene Derricotte would tell a reporter friend of his that he always wondered about his ancestry. [...] He knew his name was French, but he was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> much more about his roots. [...] One thing he must have known was that despite living under segregation, other members of the Derricotte family had distinguished themselves as educated professionals. A black newspaper, the Philadelphia Tribune, did a tribute to the family in November 1944, mentioning that Eugene's father was a veteran of World War I where he fought in France before returning to Defiance to open his business, marry and raise a family. [...] Eugene had an uncle (J. Flipper Derricotte) who was an attorney in Washington DC, and an aunt Juliette who had been a dean at Fisk College in Nashville TN before dying tragically after an automobile accident, when the nearby white hospital refused to admit her.

2500|$|In {{the years}} between the wars, feminists fought {{discrimination}} and establishment opposition. In Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, Woolf describes {{the extent of the}} backlash and her frustration at the waste of so much talent. By now, the word [...] "feminism" [...] was in use, but with a negative connotation from mass media, which discouraged women from self-identifying as such. In 1938, Woolf wrote of the term in Three Guineas, [...] "an old word ... that has much harm in its day and is now obsolete". When Rebecca West, another prominent writer, had been attacked as [...] "a feminist", Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment [...] "I myself have never been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute." [...] Woolf's writing also examined gender constructs and portrayed lesbian sexuality positively.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, at {{a banquet}} {{hosted by the}} US Olympic Committee, a {{reporter}} was interviewing Hal Haig Prieste who had won a bronze medal in platform diving {{as a member of}} the 1920 US Olympic team.

[...] At the end of the Antwerp Olympics, spurred on by teammate Duke Kahanamoku, he climbed a flagpole and stole the Olympic flag. For 77 years the flag was stored away in the bottom of his suitcase. The flag was returned to the IOC by Prieste, by then 103 years old, in a special ceremony held at the 2000 Games in Sydney. The original Antwerp Flag is now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, with a plaque thanking him for donating it.|$|E
