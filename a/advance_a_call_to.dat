5000|$|Mike {{finds himself}} getting {{involved}} in the drug work once more when Nacho hires him to assassinate Tuco. Not only is Nacho fearful that Tuco will discover his secret deals, but he also distrusts Tuco's erratic behavior. Mike ultimately decides against doing the hit, as he realizes that Tuco's death would draw {{the attention of the}} cartel. Instead, Mike and Nacho set up Tuco into going to prison. As part of the plan, Mike makes <b>an</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> the police from a payphone across the street from a restaurant where Tuco does accounting with his dealers. After making the call, he drives over and deliberately swipes Tuco's car in plain view of Tuco, enraging him. Acting like a clueless fool, Mike goads Tuco to beat him senseless just as the police arrive. As a result, Tuco is arrested and is imprisoned for assault and robbery, putting him out of the picture for five years. Nacho asks Mike why he went through all the trouble to avoid killing Tuco, for half the payoff, but Mike refuses to answer.|$|R
40|$|WHETHER {{or not to}} {{telephone}} sample members in <b>advance</b> to schedule <b>an</b> appointment for a personal interview is a common di-lemma for survey researchers. On the one hand <b>an</b> <b>advance</b> phone <b>call</b> can reduce unproductive visits. On the other hand it may be easier for a sample member to refuse an interview when the initial contact is made by telephone rather than by personal visit. The choice depends on {{the magnitude of the}} tradeoffs; that is, how much greater will the refusal rate likely be and what will the savings be, if advance phone calls are used? Related Research We found only two earlier studies, both conducted during the 1960 s and showing conflicting results.

As part of the survey, an experiment was conducted {{in each of the three}} survey sites to determine the effects of <b>an</b> <b>advance</b> telephone <b>call</b> <b>to</b> schedule <b>an</b> appointment for a personal inter-view. One random half sample in each site was sent a lead letter, followed by <b>a</b> telephone <b>call</b> <b>to</b> schedule <b>a</b> personal interview. The other half sample was sent a lead letter followed by a personal contact, with no intervening telephone <b>call.</b> Telephoning <b>to</b> arrange <b>an</b> appointment for a personal interview resulted in a 20 percent saving in data collection costs with only a 1 percent decrease in response rate...|$|R
