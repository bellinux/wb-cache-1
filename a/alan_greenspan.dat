5|$|Due to {{the dot-com}} boom, stable {{monetary}} policy under <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001. Beginning in 1994, the U.S. {{entered into the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has soared since NAFTA went into force.|$|E

V. Soong. The author of India's constitution and Dalit leader Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was also an alumnus of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{had earlier}} taken several {{measures}} to oppose Gray and the FHLBB, including recruiting {{a study from}} then-private economist <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> saying that direct investments were not harmful, and getting President Ronald Reagan to make a recess appointment of a Keating ally, Atlanta real estate developer Lee H. Henkel Jr., to an open seat on the FHLBB. By March 1987, however, Henkel had resigned, upon news of his having large loans due to Lincoln. Meanwhile, the Senate had changed control from Republican to Democratic during the 1986 Congressional elections, placing several Democratic senators in key positions, and starting in January 1987, Keating's staff was putting pressure on Cranston to remove Gray from any FHLBB discussion regarding Lincoln. The following month, Keating began large-scale contributions into Cranston's project to increase California voter registration. In February 1987, Keating met with Riegle and began contributing to Riegle's 1988 re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E

Profits from the event were {{donated to the}} Haven Foundation, a charity that aids artists and performers left uninsurable and unable to work, and the medical NGO Médecins Sans Frontières. In May 2007, Rowling pledged a donation reported as over £250,000 to a reward fund started by the tabloid News of the World for the safe return of a young British girl, Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal. Rowling, along with Nelson Mandela, Al Gore, and <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> wrote an introduction to a collection of Gordon Brown's speeches, the proceeds of which were donated to the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory. After her exposure as the true author of The Cuckoo's Calling led a massive increase in sales, Rowling announced she would donate all her royalties to the Army Benevolent Fund, claiming she had always intended to, but never expected the book to be a bestseller.|$|E

25|$|Academics Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg {{have criticized}} Federal Reserve {{chairman}} <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> {{for his role}} in the promotion and rise in tech stocks. Their research cites numerous examples of Greenspan putting a positive spin on historic stock valuations despite a wealth of evidence suggesting that stocks were overvalued.|$|E
25|$|After his {{handling}} of the economic effects of 9/11, <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> became more important, and {{in the wake of the}} Enron scandal he cut interest rates in a bid to stimulate the economy. Unusually, this ostensibly failed to cause inflation. It seemed the New Economy was working to stabilise the economy.|$|E
25|$|His {{warnings}} of impending {{economic crisis and}} a loss of confidence in the dollar in 2005 and 2006 were at the time derided by many economists, but accelerating dollar devaluation in 2007 led experts like former Federal Reserve chair <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> to reconsider hard money policies such as those of Paul.|$|E
25|$|During the California {{energy crisis}} of 2000, then-Treasury Secretary Summers teamed with <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> and Enron {{executive}} Kenneth Lay to lecture California Governor Gray Davis on {{the causes of}} the crisis, explaining that the problem was excessive government regulation. Under the advice of Kenneth Lay, Summers urged Davis to relax California's environmental standards in order to reassure the markets.|$|E
25|$|Paul Warburg, one of {{the leading}} advocates of the {{establishment}} of a central bank in the United States and {{one of the}} first governors of the newly established Federal Reserve System, came from a prominent Jewish family in Germany. Since then, several Jews have served as chairmen of the Fed, including the prior chairmen Ben Bernanke and <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> and the current chairwoman Janet Yellen.|$|E
25|$|Along with these, Reagan reappointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, {{as well as}} the {{monetarist}} <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> {{to succeed}} him in 1987. He preserved the core New Deal safeguards, such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the GI Bill and Social Security, while rolling back what he viewed as the excesses of 1960s and 1970s liberal policies.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{opposition}} in Congress for an initially proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut (over ten years), Bush held town hall-style public meetings {{across the nation}} in 2001 to increase public support for it. Bush {{and some of his}} economic advisers argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers. With reports of the threat of recession, Federal Reserve Chairman <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> said tax cuts could work but must be offset with spending cuts.|$|E
25|$|John Linder {{asserts that}} an {{estimated}} 11 trillion dollars is {{currently held in}} foreign accounts, largely for tax purposes, and is growing by $800 billion per year. Former Federal Reserve Chairman <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> predicts that enactment of the FairTax {{would result in a}} large portion of those funds being transferred to U.S. banks, where they would become available to U.S. capital markets, bringing down interest rates, and otherwise promoting economic growth in the United States instead of the countries where those funds are currently held.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{he worked}} with <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> in a major reform of the Social Security system that {{maintained}} its solvency by slowly raising the retirement age, thus cutting benefits for workers retiring in their mid-60s, and in 1986 he obtained {{the passage of a}} federal law that abolished most mandatory retirement ages. In his later years, Pepper, who customarily began each day by eating a bowl of tomato soup with crackers, sported a replaced hip and hearing aids in both ears, but continued to remain an important and often lionized figure in the House.|$|E
25|$|As was {{expected}} {{in light of}} Bunning's previous career as a baseball player, {{he has been very}} interested in Congress's investigation of steroid use in baseball. Bunning was also outspoken on the issue of illegal immigration, taking the position that all illegal immigrants should be deported. Bunning was also {{the only member of the}} United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to have opposed Ben Bernanke for Chief of the Federal Reserve. He said it was because he had doubts that Bernanke would be any different from <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan.</b>|$|E
25|$|By the mid-to-late 2000s {{the dot-com}} losses were recouped and eclipsed by a {{combination}} of events, including the 2000s commodities boom and the United States housing bubble. However, the recession of 2007 onward wiped out these gains. The second market slump brought the phrase back into the public eye, where it was much used in hindsight, to characterize the excesses of the bygone era. In 2006, upon Greenspan's retirement from the Federal Reserve Board, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart held a full-length farewell show in his honor, named An Irrationally Exuberant Tribute to <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan.</b>|$|E
25|$|Former US Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> gives most {{credit to}} German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard for Europe's {{economic}} recovery. Greenspan {{writes in his}} memoir The Age of Turbulence that Erhard's economic policies {{were the most important}} aspect of postwar Western Europe recovery, even outweighing the contributions of the Marshall Plan. He states that it was Erhard's reductions in economic regulations that permitted Germany's miraculous recovery, and that these policies also contributed to the recoveries of many other European countries. Its recovery is attributed to traditional economic stimuli, such as increases in investment, fueled by a high savings rate and low taxes. Japan saw a large infusion of US investment during the Korean War.|$|E
25|$|The {{return to}} {{political}} and social concerns included the popularity of works of Ayn Rand, who promoted ethical egoism (the praxis of the belief system she called Objectivism) in her novels, The Fountainhead in 1943 and Atlas Shrugged in 1957. These two novels {{gave birth to the}} Objectivist movement and would influence a small group of students called The Collective, one of whom was a young <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> a self-described libertarian who would become Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Objectivism holds that there is an objective external reality that can be known with reason, that human beings should act in accordance with their own rational self-interest, and that the proper form of economic organization is laissez-faire capitalism. Academic philosophers have been highly critical of the quality and intellectual rigor of Rand's work, but she remains a popular, albeit controversial, figure within the American libertarian movement.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the changed approach within the emerging economies, US policy makers and economists remained relatively unconcerned about BOP imbalances. In the early to mid-1990s, many free market economists and policy makers such as U.S. Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill and Fed Chairman <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> went on record suggesting the growing US deficit was not a major concern. While several emerging economies had intervening to boost their reserves and assist their exporters from the late 1980s, they only began running a net current account surplus after 1999. This was mirrored in the faster growth for the US current account deficit from the same year, with surpluses, deficits and the associated buildup of reserves by the surplus countries reaching record levels by the early 2000s and growing year by year. Some economists such as Kenneth Rogoff and Maurice Obstfeld began warning that the record imbalances would soon {{need to be addressed}} from as early as 2001, joined by Nouriel Roubini in 2004, {{but it was not until}} about 2007 that their concerns began to be accepted by the majority of economists.|$|E
500|$|Rand died {{of heart}} failure on March 6, 1982, {{at her home in}} New York City, and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York. Rand's funeral was {{attended}} by some of her prominent followers, including <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan.</b> A [...] floral arrangement {{in the shape of a}} dollar sign was placed near her casket. In her will, Rand named Leonard Peikoff to inherit her estate.|$|E
500|$|The {{possibility}} of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists. Former US Federal Reserve Chairman <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> gave his opinion in September 2007 that it was [...] "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency". In contrast to Greenspan's 2007 assessment, the euro's increase in {{the share of the}} worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and {{since the beginning of the}} worldwide credit crunch related recession and European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E
500|$|... 10 Songs for the New Depression is {{a simple}} vocal and {{acoustic}} performance album composed of original songs {{as well as two}} cover versions of songs from the Great Depression. The album is approximately thirty minutes in length and contains lyrical references to economist <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> Nobel Prize-winning economist and The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, and President Barack Obama. While Wainwright's previous studio album [...] (2009) contains more than twenty musicians and singers, The Guardian contributor Robin Denselow described 10 Songs as featuring a [...] "pared-down, DIY set, in keeping with the mood of the new songs".|$|E
500|$|Wainwright {{began writing}} songs for the album {{following}} {{the inauguration of}} Barack Obama in January 2009. The album features ten original songs and two cover versions of songs originally written and recorded during the Great Depression. Lyrical references throughout 10 Songs include economists <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> John Maynard Keynes and Paul Krugman, President Barack Obama, and the government program Car Allowance Rebate System (more commonly known as [...] "cash for clunkers"). Overall, critical reception of the album was positive. 10 Songs reached peak positions of number thirty-eight on the United Kingdom's Top Independent Albums chart and number twelve on the Top 40 Independent Albums Breakers chart.|$|E
500|$|Many {{economists and}} world governments {{determined}} that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan.</b> Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back {{a large portion of}} the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said [...] "it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped [...] "for Congress to have held hearings".|$|E
500|$|Keating {{believed}} that the regulators were against him because he opposed their rules. [...] He also told his staff {{that some of the}} San Francisco regulators were likely [...] "homos" [...] who were [...] "out to get him" [...] for his strong moral views. Keating took measures to oppose the FHLBB, including recruiting a study from then-private economist <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> saying that direct investments were not harmful, trying to hire FHLBB members or their wives, and getting President Ronald Reagan to make a recess appointment of a Keating ally, real estate developer Lee H. Henkel Jr., to the FHLBB. By March 1987, however, the ally had resigned upon news of his having large loans due to Lincoln. It appeared as though the government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent.|$|E
500|$|He re{{appointed}} Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and in 1987 {{he appointed}} monetarist <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> to succeed him. Reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil which {{had contributed to}} energy crises in the early 1970s. The price of oil subsequently dropped, and the 1980s {{did not see the}} fuel shortages that the 1970s had. Reagan also fulfilled a 1980 campaign promise to repeal the windfall profits tax in 1988, which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil. Some economists, such as Nobel Prize winners Milton Friedman and Robert Mundell, argue that Reagan's tax policies invigorated America's economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s. Other economists, such as Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow, argue that Reagan's deficits were a major reason his successor, George H. W. Bush, reneged on a [...] and resorted to raising taxes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated [...] "The Collective") included future Federal Reserve Chairman <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara, and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, Atlas Shrugged, as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's {{close relationship with the}} younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.|$|E
500|$|George H. Douglas {{writes that}} the {{building}} [...] "remains {{one of the most}} appealing and awe-inspiring of skyscrapers". Architect Le Corbusier called the building [...] "hot jazz in stone and steel". Ada Louise Huxtable, an architectural critic, noted that the building had [...] "a wonderful, decorative, evocative aesthetic", while another architectural critic, Paul Goldberger, notes the [...] "compressed, intense energy" [...] of the lobby, the [...] "magnificent" [...] elevators, and the [...] "magical" [...] view from the crown. The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission says that the tower [...] "embodies the romantic essence of the New York City skyscraper". The travel guide Frommer's gave the building an [...] "exceptional" [...] recommendation, with author Pauline Frommer writing, [...] "In the Chrysler Building we see the roaring-twenties version of what <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> called 'irrational exuberance'—a last burst of corporate headquarter building before stocks succumbed to the thudding crash of 1929." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007–2008 spurred {{renewed interest in}} her works, especially Atlas Shrugged, which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis, and opinion articles compared real-world events with {{the plot of the}} novel. During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests. There was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the political left, with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets, particularly through her influence on <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan.</b> For example, Mother Jones remarked that [...] "Rand's particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed", while equating Randian individual well-being with that of the Volk according to Goebbels. Corey Robin of The Nation alleged similarities between the [...] "moral syntax of Randianism" [...] and fascism.|$|E
500|$|After {{securing}} the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford {{as a potential}} vice-presidential runningmate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented [...] "co-presidency", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush. Ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the Reagan-Bush ticket, in which he declared that {{the country would be}} [...] "better served by a Reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of Jimmy Carter". On October 8, 1980, Ford said President Nixon's involvement in the general election potentially could negatively impact the Reagan campaign: [...] "I {{think it would have been}} much more helpful if Mr. Nixon had stayed in the background during this campaign. It would have been much more beneficial to Ronald Reagan." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{surplus in}} fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third {{consecutive}} surplus and the largest surplus ever. In 2001, Bush's budget estimated {{that there would be}} a $5.6trillion surplus over the next ten years. Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35trillion tax cut program—one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying [...] "the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money." [...] Federal Reserve chairman <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security. O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts. By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant. Another tax cut program was passed that year.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} {{is followed}} by a transcript of Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, originally given to Occupy Boston in Dewey Square on October 22, 2011. Contrasting the hope of the working classes in the Great Depression of the 1930s with the pessimism of their contemporaries in the current recession, Chomsky discusses the changes to the U.S. economy that have occurred since the 1970s: de-industrialization, de-development {{and the rise of the}} financial sector at the expense of other parts of the economy. He notes how both Adam Smith and David Ricardo partly foresaw this situation. Highlighting the work of Tom Ferguson, he discusses how the political parties have come under the increasing control of the corporate sector. Proceeding to look at corruption among the 1%, he makes reference to both Citigroup and <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> before discussing the role that worker sit-ins and industry takeovers could play in democratizing the U.S. economy, as well as the threat posed by both nuclear war and environmental catastrophe, both problems exacerbated by the current capitalist system. Finally, he responds to questions posed by the audience, discussing the concept of corporate personhood, rejecting the idea that the U.S. elite could resort to fascism, and discussing the possibility of a general strike, arguing that that would be [...] "a possible idea at a time when the population is ready for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Irrational exuberance" [...] is {{a phrase}} {{used by the}} then-Federal Reserve Board chairman, <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> in a speech given at the American Enterprise Institute during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s. The phrase was {{interpreted}} as a warning that the market might be overvalued.|$|E
2500|$|The undersecretary's pay of HK$220,000 {{per month}} (US$28,000) {{is more than}} the salary of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and also more than <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> earned as the {{chairman}} of the US Federal Reserve. A political assistant would earn more than what Tony Snow earned (US$ 14,000 per month) as the former White House Press Secretary.|$|E
2500|$|Then Chairman of the Federal Reserve <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> was {{a critic}} of the system, saying, [...] "We are, in effect, {{attempting}} to use government to enforce two different prices for the same itemnamely, government-mandated deposit insurance.
