Rand created a 20-page brochure detailing the brand, including the precise angle used for the logo (28°) and a new company name, NeXT. The first major outside investment was from Ross Perot, who invested after seeing a segment <b>about</b> <b>NeXT</b> on The Entrepreneurs.

500|$|Michael and Holly {{perform a}} skit that parodies Slumdog Millionaire (called [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire"), {{presenting}} Dunder Mifflin trivia {{in the form}} of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, as well as acting out torture scenes featured in the film. Nobody, except Stanley (Leslie David Baker), finds their presentation amusing, but things take {{a turn for the worse}} when they reveal that the Buffalo branch, whose staff are hearing this announcement for the first time, will be closing in the near future because of the economic recession. After reluctantly confirming this news to the Buffalo staff, David berates Michael for revealing this as it was something David told to Michael in confidence. In his own defense, Michael insists he thought they already knew about it. As Michael and Holly talk <b>about</b> <b>next</b> year's presentation, he prepares to ask for her back but stops himself, deciding not to ruin the moment. As Holly leaves with A. J., Michael says he believes he will eventually be reunited with Holly, although potentially not for a long time—and he's fine with this because [...] "I'm in no rush".|$|E

Buemi was delighted to take the victory, saying both his vehicles were [...] "amazing" [...] and cars' balance was [...] "really good". He stated that his team were aware that his car was efficient and that it needed {{to take advantage of}} this after starting the race in a lower than expected position. Second-place finisher Bird said he was happy that he was able to score points in Marrakesh and felt that being on the podium was like a victory. He revealed that his car did not behave as well as the winner, or the third-position driver, after his second free practice crash and he struggled with his vehicle's balance. Rosenqvist said that taking his first pole position and podium finish was unexpected and he was shocked to claim both achievements in his second Formula E event. He revealed his team had made the car's package for qualifying up to a good standard, were aware of its fast pace, and were feeling confident <b>about</b> <b>next</b> year's races.|$|E
500|$|The {{visit of}} West Ham United to Highbury {{produced}} a 1–0 defeat for Arsenal; the winning goal scored by Mike Small {{came in the}} 76th minute. Arsenal's conserved performance was attributed to their upcoming European Cup match, something Graham categorically denied: [...] "I'm not even thinking <b>about</b> <b>next</b> Wednesday." [...] Arsenal drew away to Oldham Athletic and then Sheffield Wednesday, extending a winless run of five games in all competitions. The team beat Tottenham on 1 December 1991 to go fourth in the league table, 10 points behind the leaders. Arsenal's aspiration to defend the league title suffered to Nottingham Forest; though the team scored twice {{in the second half}} they were unable to overturn the home side's three-goal lead and collected no points. David Hillier opined that his team [...] "should have done better in the first half – that's when we really lost it." [...] Wright scored all of Arsenal's four goals against Everton, but scored none in the team's Boxing Day defeat by Luton Town. Graham called it Arsenal's worst performance of the season and was critical of his players' attitude. Although the team's concentration and effort improved according to Peter Ball of The Times in their next game – away to Manchester City, Arsenal lost for the second consecutive league match. They ended the calendar year in seventh position, 16 points behind the leaders Manchester United.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Saints Row: The Third, {{preliminary}} work on a game called Saints Row: Part Four began. The game would take place after the events of The Third in a new city and feature gameplay similar to The Third. Meanwhile a standalone expansion to The Third called Enter the Dominatrix was first announced as a 2012 April Fool's joke, but still went into development. The expansion pack's basic concept included a superpowered player-character trapped by alien commander Zinyak in a simulation of Steelport. With THQ suffering financially, its president Jason Rubin encouraged company subsidiary and Saints Row series developer Volition to grow elements from the expansion into a full game. The company announced this change in direction in June 2012, cancelling Saints Row: Part Four and expanding Enter the Dominatrix into a full sequel, Saints Row IV. The company's strategy was partly to avoid sales issues by releasing the game in August 2013, prior to the circulation of rumors <b>about</b> <b>next</b> generation video game consoles. Volition was sold to Koch Media in early 2013 when its parent company, THQ, filed for bankruptcy. It became Koch's first internal video game studio. The studio officially announced Saints Row IV two months later, which was published by Koch Media brand Deep Silver. Acquired without rights to their Red Faction series, Volition's new goals were to make connected, open world games where [...] "the player is an agent of mayhem". The entire company worked on the one game.|$|E

500|$|Both the M1 and M2 have flat crowns. The M1 is convex on the lingual (inner) {{side and}} concave {{on the outer}} side, {{rendering}} it kidney-shaped. The anterocone, the cusp {{at the front of}} the tooth, appears not to be divided in two, as it is in living Brachytarsomys. It is narrowly connected to the protocone, another cusp behind it on the labial side, which is connected in the same way to the paracone. This lingually located cusp displays a broader connection to the hypocone on the labial side, which is isolated from the metacone lingually behind it. The metacone is broadly connected to another labial cusp behind it, referred to as the [...] "post-hypocone", which it is expected to fuse to with increasing wear. Behind this pair of cusps, a small posteroloph (a crest at the back of the tooth) is present. In general, the back part of the tooth is more highly developed than in B.albicauda. The anterolingual cingulum on the M2, a crest on the front lingual corner, is absent or very small; it is well-developed in B.albicauda. The cusps form three transverse crests, with the labial cusp behind the lingual one. In one specimen, the second and third lophs are weakly connected. The posteroloph is more highly developed than on the M1. The M3 also has three such crests, which display narrow connections along the length of the tooth. In the first crest, the two cusps are <b>about</b> <b>next</b> to each other, but in the second one, the hypocone (on the labial side) is a bit behind the paracone. The post-hypocone and the metacone, in the third crest, are joined at the back. There are three roots, two at the front and one at the back, on the M1 and M2; the roots are missing from the only known M3.|$|E

Ronnie also said in an interview that the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release. In issue number 1442 of Kerrang!
