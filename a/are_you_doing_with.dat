2500|$|By 1934, Durante {{had a major}} record {{hit with}} his own novelty composition, [...] "Inka Dinka Doo", with lyrics by Ben Ryan. It became his theme song {{for the rest of}} his life. A year later, Durante starred on Broadway in the Billy Rose stage musical Jumbo. [...] A scene in which a police officer stopped Durante's character—who was leading a live {{elephant}} across the stage—to ask, [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> that elephant?", followed by Durante's reply, [...] "What elephant?", was a regular show-stopper. This comedy bit, also reprised in his role in Billy Rose's Jumbo, likely contributed to the popularity of the idiom the elephant in the room. Durante also appeared on Broadway in Show Girl (1929), Strike Me Pink (1934) and Red, Hot and Blue (1936).|$|E
