[...] In addition, Anansi co-founder Dave Godfrey is convinced a 10-day government audit of the press was generated by FBI–RCMP concerns. [...] Many people {{did not want the}} Programme to encourage draft-eligible Americans to emigrate to Canada, and Satin routinely denied that the Manual encouraged emigration.

[...] "She was a street-smart dance queen with the sexy allure of Marilyn Monroe, the coy iciness of Marlene Dietrich and the cutting and protective glibness of a modern Mae West". Although the album received mixed reviews, Taraborrelli believed that the [...] "mere fact {{that at the time of}} its release so many couldn't resist commenting on the record was a testament to the continuous, growing fascination with Madonna... Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist's magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin was just such a defining moment" [...] Chris Smith, author of 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music believed that it was with Like a Virgin that Madonna was able to steal the spotlight towards herself. She asserted her sexuality as only male rock stars had done before, moving well beyond the limited confines of being a pop artist, to becoming a focal point for nationwide discussions of power relationships in the areas of sex, race, gender, religion, and other divisive social topics.

2500|$|Upon his return, Adorno {{helped shape}} the {{political}} culture of West Germany. Until his death in 1969, twenty years after his return, Adorno contributed to the intellectual foundations of the Federal Republic, as a professor at Frankfurt University, critic of the vogue enjoyed by Heideggerian philosophy, partisan of critical sociology, and teacher of music at the Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music. Adorno resumed his teaching duties at the university soon after his arrival, with seminars on [...] "Kant's Transcendental Dialectic", aesthetics, Hegel, [...] "Contemporary Problems in the Theory of Knowledge", and [...] "The Concept of Knowledge". Adorno's surprise at his students' passionate interest in intellectual matters did not, however, blind him to continuing problems within Germany: The literary climate was dominated by writers who had remained in Germany during Hitler's rule, the government re-employed {{people who had been}} active in the Nazi apparatus and people were generally loath to own up to their own collaboration or the guilt they thus incurred. Instead, the ruined city of Frankfurt continued as if nothing had happened, holding on to ideas of the true, the beautiful, and the good despite the atrocities, hanging on to a culture that had itself been lost in rubble or killed off in the concentration camps. All the enthusiasm Adorno's students showed for intellectual matters could not erase the suspicion that, in the words of Max Frisch, culture had become an [...] "alibi" [...] for the absence of political consciousness.

40|$|The {{literature}} is summarized on normative reactions to abortion and factors that increase risk of negative emotional sequelae. Four areas of inquiry for identifying psychotherapeutic issues {{in regard to}} abortion are elaborated, including: (a) characteristics of the woman prior to {{and at the time}} of the abortion, (b) the nature of social support and the cultural milieu around the abortion, (c) characteristics of the medical environ-ment and abortion procedure, and (d) events subsequent to the abortion which may have aroused post-decisional conflict. The implications of the research literature for psychotherapeutic treatment of women who have had abortions are discussed. If there were no ambivalence, there might not be psychotherapy. And if there were no ambivalence about abortion, it would never be a therapy issue. But decisions about childbearing, or about pursuing the options that limiting childbearing allows, are of such importance that ambivalence is the norm. There is no painless way to deal with either an unwanted preg-nancy or an intended pregnancy and the knowledge that one is carrying a genetically defective fetus. Abortion is rarely a decision taken lightly, even by pro-choice women. The sociocultural environment in which women make abortion deci-sions reinforces ambivalence at best, and at worst introduces negative thoughts and feelings with which women might not otherwise be troubled. Add to this the tendency for the abortion decision to serve as <b>an</b> emotional <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> highly charged negative feelings a woman may have in regard to her body, her sexuality, and her right to make decisions based o...|$|R
40|$|This brief essay {{analyzes}} the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 2015 {{decision in the}} North Carolina Dental case, assessing its implications for federalism. The decision promises to re-open old divisions that had once made the antitrust 2 ̆ 2 state action 2 ̆ 2 doctrine <b>a</b> controversial <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> debate about state economic sovereignty. One provocative issue that neither the majority nor the dissenters considered is indicated {{by the fact that}} nearly all the cartel customers in the Dental case were located within the state. By contrast, the cartel in Parker v. Brown, which the dissent held up as the correct exemplar of the doctrine, benefited California growers while visiting nearly all of its harm upon other states. This fact serves to make the Dental case more paternalistic {{in the sense that it}} amounts to federal management of a state 2 ̆ 7 s internal economy when there are not significant externalities, at least not as identified in the decisions. If a state 2 ̆ 7 s bad economic policy injures mainly the state 2 ̆ 7 s own citizens, what should be the role of federal antitrust policy? The same question came up with respect to the state action doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s authorization requirement in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s 2013 Phoebe-Putney case, which involved a merger of two relatively rural hospitals in the center of the state, and that very likely served few out of state patients. Significantly, the state action doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s twin requirements of clear state articulation and active state supervision never make extraterritorial impact relevant. The end result, however, is to give the federal courts an antitrust role not merely in cases with a significant interstate impact, but also where state government 2 ̆ 7 s internal deficiencies injure its own citizens...|$|R

40|$|The year 1991 {{will mark}} the sixty-fifth {{birthday}} {{of one of the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s watershed tests of regulatory authority over landed property. That test, which is set forth in Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., established the legitimacy of local zoning. At the outset, Euclid was something of a cliffhanger; the Court 2 ̆ 7 s majority was convinced only at the last minute of the propriety of local zoning regulations. But cliffhanger or not, localities since that decision have relied on Euclid as the central authority {{for a wide range of}} controls on private land development—and as a protective screen against the charge that their regulations illegitimately take away the property rights of regulated landowners. Perhaps because the case was about land, however, and perhaps because land is such a tangible form of property, Euclid has had an important role as a negative symbol as well. Euclid has acted as <b>a</b> kind of <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> those who contest what they perceive as unwarranted governmental intrusion on private property rights.

As advocates of private property have enjoyed a certain philosophical and popular revival, they have also put Euclid under siege, precisely because the case appeared to legitimate some of the most visible regulation of property. Thus, the old case 2 ̆ 7 s embattlement has created some opportunities to reassess not only the role that we assign to property rights, but also the role we expect from property regulation. In this article, I hope to contribute to that reassessment. My argument is that property on the one hand, and the regulation of property on the other, are aligned in a set of overlapping evolutionary relationships...|$|R

[...] In the 1961 film West Side Story, the character Chino takes issue with the caucasian Tony, who is of mixed Polish and Swedish heritage, and has a line in which he said, [...] "If it's the last thing I do, I'm gonna kill that Polack!" [...] The slurring of Tony's ancestry is unique in {{that none of the}} other white ancestries are targeted. Folklorist Mac E. Barrick observed that TV comedians were reluctant to tell ethnic jokes until Spiro Agnew's [...] "polack jokes" [...] in 1968, pointing to an early Polish joke told by comedian Bob Hope in 1968, referencing politicians. Barrick stated that [...] "even though the Polack joke usually lacks the bitterness found in racial humor, it deals deliberately with a very small minority group, one not involved in national controversy, and one that has no influential organization for picketing or protesting." [...] During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a revived expression of white ethnicity in American culture. The popular 1970s sitcom Barney Miller depicted Polish-American character Sergeant Wojohowicz as uneducated and mentally slow. Among the worst offenders was the popular 1970s sitcom All in the Family, where protagonist Archie Bunker routinely called his son-in-law a [...] "dumb Polack". The desensitization that was caused by the hateful language in All in the Family created a mainstream acceptance of the jokes, and the word Polack. Sociologist Barbara Ehrenreich called the show [...] "the longest-running Polish joke." [...] In the series Coach, character Dauber Dybinski played the [...] "big, dumb hulk of a player" [...] role for nine series, and a spin-off character George Dubcek (also with a Polish name) in Teech displayed the [...] "burly but dumb son of a former football player". In the movie The End, lead supporting actor Marlon Burunki is depicted as an oafish and schizophrenic Polish-American in a mental institution. The term Polack was so pervasive in American society through the 1960s and 1970s that high-ranking U.S. politicians followed suit. In 1978, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington made Polish jokes at a banquet. Ronald Reagan told Polish jokes multiple times during his presidential campaign in 1980 and during his presidency. As late as 2008, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania told Polish jokes to an audience of Republican supporters. Reportedly an audience member interrupted him, saying, [...] "Hey careful, I'm Polish", and Specter replied, [...] "That's ok, I'll tell it more slowly." [...] Mayor Marion Barry slurred Poles in 2012, and was apparently unaware the word Polacks was inappropriate.|$|R
