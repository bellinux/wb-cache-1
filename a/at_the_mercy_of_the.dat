5|$|As {{with most}} small birds, {{mortality}} {{in the first}} year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E
5|$|The {{reforms of}} Sejanus most {{significantly}} included {{the founding of}} the Castra Praetoria, which established the Praetorian Guard as the powerful political force, for which it is primarily known today. Henceforth the Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, and the rulers were equally <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in AD 31, when Tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard. Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.|$|E

If he cooperates, McGarrett will ensure they stay in America. Sang Min reveals that Hesse is {{going to leave the}} island on a Chinese freighter. Danny and McGarrett hastily drive to the docks. They then proceed to assault the freighter, where they {{dispatch}} several of Hesse's guards. McGarrett confronts Hesse, and shoots him off the boat. At the end of the episode, the new team settle into their new office space, and cannot settle on a name for their new unit.|$|E
5|$|Most of them {{unscrewed}} at {{once and}} 530kilograms (1170lb) of rope were lost, while the three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump 210kilograms of sand overboard to get the basket clear of the water. Seven hundred and forty kilograms (1630lb) of essential weight was thus lost {{in the first few}} minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the Eagle had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability. Lightened, the balloon rose to 700meters (2300ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.|$|E
5|$|Round {{the rims}} of deserts, where more {{precipitation}} occurred and conditions were more suitable, some groups took to cultivating crops. This {{may have happened}} when drought caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation. With few inputs, they were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level. The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which {{are at risk of}} erosion when exposed, as happened in the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous dust storms blew the topsoil away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} this time that the entire sport of ski jumping {{underwent}} a significant transition in technique. Until the early 1990s nearly all athletes used the parallel style (or Däscher technique), in which the skis are held close together and parallel to each other. This had been the norm since the 1950s, with Matti Nykänen creating {{a variation in the}} 1980s with the skis pointed diagonally off to the side in a crude attempt to increase surface area, which yielded more distance. However, this came largely at the expense of stability and balance, akin to 'walking a tightrope' in mid-air and leaving athletes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements. Akimoto, Findeisen, Berg, and Goldberger's accidents were all caused by unpredictable gusts of wind that made them lose control at the highest and fastest stage of their jumps, exacerbated by an outdated technique ill-suited to the new extremes of ski flying, as well as the prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat and}} captivity of emperor Valerian {{at the hands}} of the Persian Sassanian monarch Shapur I in 260 left the eastern Roman provinces largely <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persians. Odaenathus stayed on the side of Rome; {{assuming}} the title of king, he led the Palmyrene army and fell upon the Persians before they could cross the Euphrates to the eastern bank, and inflicted upon them a considerable defeat. Then, Odaenathus took the side of emperor Gallienus, the son and successor of Valerian, who was facing the usurpation of Fulvius Macrianus. The rebel declared his sons emperors, leaving one in Syria and taking the other with him to Europe. Odaenathus attacked the remaining usurper and quelled the rebellion. He was rewarded many exceptional titles by the emperor who formalized his self-established position in the East. In reality, the emperor could have done little but to accept the declared nominal loyalty of Odaenathus.|$|E

25|$|During the Reconstruction era from January 1, 1863 to March 31, 1877, {{federal troops}} were {{stationed}} in the south specifically to keep blacks from being re-enslaved as the society made the transition to one of free labor. However, in the Gilded Age that followed the withdrawal, blacks were left <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whites. When African Americans in the south {{no longer had the}} protection of the federal troops, whites imposed laws to restrict their movement and found other ways to practice involuntary servitude.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the start}} of the Mexican Drug War in 2006, the drug {{trafficking}} organizations have slaughtered their rivals, killed policemen, and now increasingly targeted politicians – especially local leaders. Most of the places where these politicians have been killed are areas plagued by drug-related violence. Part of the strategy used by the criminal groups behind the killings of local figures is the weakening of the local governments. Extreme violence puts politicians <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mafias, thus allowing the cartels {{to take control of the}} fundamental government structures and expand their criminal agendas.|$|E
