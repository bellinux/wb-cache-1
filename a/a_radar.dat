5|$|From November 1940 until February 1941, Omaha {{was again}} in the Caribbean for more {{tactical}} and gunnery exercises. In February 1941, she entered the New York Navy Yard for overhaul and the installation of <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> system, her first.|$|E
5|$|Joan Elizabeth Curran (26 February 1916 – 10 February 1999) was a Welsh {{scientist}} who played {{important roles in}} the development of radar and the atomic bomb during the Second World War. She invented chaff, <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> countermeasure technique credited with reducing losses among Allied bomber crews. She also worked {{on the development of the}} proximity fuse and the electromagnetic isotope separation process for the atomic bomb.|$|E

5|$|Kõpu Lighthouse only {{lost its}} {{important}} {{role as a}} primary navigation aid in 1997, when <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> lighthouse took over its duties. Recreational craft and small fishing vessels continue to rely on Kõpu for navigating, as a backup to electronic navigation systems. The Estonian Maritime Administration still classifies it as an active aid to navigation. Its future is ensured by {{its status as a}} protected cultural memorial.|$|E
5|$|On November 15, 2008, a 34-kg probe made a {{hard landing}} near the crater. The moon impact probe (MIP) was {{launched}} from the Indian Chandrayaan-I spacecraft {{and reached the}} surface 25 minutes later. The probe carried <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> altimeter, video imaging system, and a mass spectrometer, which {{will be used to}} search for water.|$|E
5|$|The cockpit was {{significantly}} altered for the Comet 4's introduction, on which an improved layout {{focusing on the}} onboard navigational suite was introduced. An EKCO E160 radar unit was installed in the Comet 4's nose cone, providing search functions as well as ground and cloud mapping capabilities, and <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> interface was built into the Comet 4 cockpit along with redesigned instruments.|$|E

50|$|This {{system is}} {{composed}} of weapon-direction and fire-control subsystem and multi-function radar subsystem. The multi-function radar subsystem adopted {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) technology, and there are two sets of antennas: the larger one is <b>a</b> C-band <b>radar</b> for surveillance and tracking, the smaller one is <b>a</b> X-band <b>radar</b> as <b>a</b> fire-control <b>radar.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 785th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began {{operations}} with <b>an</b> AN/FPS-3 search <b>radar</b> and AN/FPS-4 {{from the site}} in April 1952. In 1957 an AN/FPS-6 replaced the AN/FPS-4 height-finder <b>radar,</b> and <b>an</b> AN/FPS-8 search <b>radar</b> saw brief service. At the end of 1958 this site was operating <b>an</b> AN/FPS-20 <b>radar.</b> <b>A</b> second height-finder (AN/FPS-6B?) was added during 1959.|$|R
5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
5|$|At Green Beach to the west, {{part of the}} South Saskatchewan Regiment was {{landed on}} the wrong side of the Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was {{captured}} but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> station. The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed with the objective of moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Italian {{surrender}} to the Allies in September 1943, Premuda was still docked in Genoa, and was seized by Germany. Plans to convert her into <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> picket for night fighters were abandoned. In August 1944, following the replacement of her armament, she was commissioned into the German Navy as a Torpedoboot Ausland (foreign torpedo boat) with the designation TA32. The ship saw action shelling Allied positions on the Italian coast and laying naval mines. In March 1945, she took part in the Battle of the Ligurian Sea against two Royal Navy destroyers, during which she was lightly damaged. She was scuttled the following month as the Germans retreated from Genoa.|$|E
50|$|The {{bistatic}} {{angle is}} the angle subtended between the transmitter, target and receiver in <b>a</b> bistatic <b>radar.</b> When {{it is exactly}} zero the <b>radar</b> is <b>a</b> monostatic <b>radar,</b> when it is close to zero the radar is pseudo-monostatic, {{and when it is}} close to 180 degrees the <b>radar</b> is <b>a</b> forward scatter <b>radar.</b> Elsewhere, the radar is simply described as <b>a</b> bistatic <b>radar.</b> The bistatic angle {{is an important factor in}} determining the radar cross section of the target.|$|R
50|$|An AN/CPS-4 {{was added}} in 1954. This radar was {{replaced}} in 1957 by <b>an</b> AN/FPS-6 height-finder <b>radar.</b> <b>A</b> second AN/FPS-6 height-finder <b>radar</b> was added <b>a</b> year later. In 1958 this site began operating <b>an</b> AN/FPS-20 <b>radar,</b> which replaced the AN/FPS-3.|$|R
40|$|The EOS SAR mission under {{consideration}} as {{one element of}} the mission to planet earth, which will provide <b>a</b> long duration <b>radar</b> observing system with multipolarization and multifrequency capability, is presented. The payload consists of three synthetic aperture <b>radar</b> systems; <b>a</b> C-band <b>radar</b> with dual polarization, <b>an</b> L-band <b>radar</b> with quadruple polarization, and <b>an</b> X-band <b>radar</b> with dual polarization. Each radar system will be of the phased-array type, will have variable resolutions and swath widths and will be capable of steering the beam electronically in elevation...|$|R
5|$|By the Korean War, {{jet engines}} had {{replaced}} propellers on aircraft, which severely limited {{the ability of}} the 20 mm and 40 mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. New Jersey received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a quartet of Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) mounts which made use of <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the launch}} site on Meck began in late 1967. In this installation, the {{majority}} of the system was built above ground in a single-floor rectangular building. The MSR was built in a boxy extension on the northwestern corner of the roof, with two sides angled back to form a half-pyramid shape where the antennas were mounted. Small clutter fences were built to the north and northwest, and the western side faced out over the water which was only a few tens of meters from the building. Illeginni did not have <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> site; it was operated remotely from Meck.|$|E
5|$|During combat, {{the player}} can circle the enemy to expose weak points and escape {{dangerous}} positions. Changing position temporarily stops the gauges charging. Likewise, enemies may change position {{to force the}} dragon into vulnerable areas; <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> {{at the bottom of}} the screen indicates safe, neutral and dangerous areas, with the front and rear areas typically posing the most danger. Weak points can sometimes only be attacked from dangerous areas, and enemies' attack patterns often change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.|$|E
50|$|The RBE2 (<b>Radar</b> <b>à</b> Balayage Electronique 2 plans) is <b>a</b> multirole <b>radar</b> {{developed}} during the 1990s for the French Dassault Rafale combat aircraft.|$|R
50|$|From around 2000 until 2 April 2004, {{the station}} {{operated}} as RRH Saxa Vord, <b>a</b> Remote <b>Radar</b> Head operated from a parent station (RAF Buchan). On 2 April 2004, RAF Saxa Vord was upgraded from <b>a</b> Remote <b>Radar</b> Head to <b>a</b> full manned station, taking {{over control of}} the radar defences in the area. RAF Buchan will be downgraded to <b>a</b> Remote <b>Radar</b> Head. RAF Saxa Vord closed in April 2006.|$|R

5|$|In-game screen {{shows the}} cockpit view split between top half for plane's front view and bottom half for plane's instrumentation. The control panel shows planes crucial data, {{including}} speed, altitude, thrust, fuel, roll/pitch indicators and a compass. The panel also features <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> that provided {{an overview of}} important nearby objects. An onboard screen displays various flight information and warning messages, and features a speech synthesizer that occasionally announces dangers, such as approaching enemies or missile attacks. Finally, a small rear-view camera allows the player to observe enemies and missiles on their tail. The game also features a two player mode, where one player flies the plane and the other aims and fires the guns.|$|E
5|$|Large {{sections}} of the game feature a car which resembles a gutted-and-rebuilt 1969 Dodge Charger. It {{appears to have been}} tuned for performance. <b>A</b> <b>radar</b> system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate the car in the chaos of the final battle via a readout in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York on February 6, 1927 to Edward Gerard O'Neill, a lawyer, and Dorothy Lewis O'Neill (née Kitchen). He had no siblings. His family moved to Speculator, New York when his father {{temporarily}} retired for health reasons. For high school, O'Neill attended Newburgh Free Academy in Newburgh, New York. While {{he was a student}} there he edited the school newspaper and {{took a job as a}} news broadcaster at a local radio station. He graduated in 1944, during World War II, and enlisted in the United States Navy on his 17th birthday. The Navy trained him as <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> technician, which sparked his interest in science.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>radar</b> {{equipment}} improved, the Filter Room received additional {{reports from}} Chain Home Low (CHL) and Chain Extra Low (CHEL), increasing tracking accuracy. In 1944 warnings were given of V-1 flying bombs (doodle bugs) and V-2 rockets.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{operating}} <b>an</b> AN/CPS-5 <b>radar,</b> by September 1952 the 768th AC&W Squadron operated AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-5 radars {{from the}} station. Six years later <b>an</b> AN/FPS-20 <b>radar</b> replaced the AN/FPS-3 search <b>radar,</b> and <b>an</b> AN/FPS-6 performed height-finding duties.|$|R
5|$|Radar studies {{preceding}} {{and following}} the Lunar Prospector mission demonstrate that the inner walls of Shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some sunlit craters. In particular, the surroundings appear to contain {{a significant number of}} blocks in its ejecta blanket, suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface roughness, and not ice deposits, as was previously suggested from <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> experiment involving the Clementine mission. This interpretation, however, is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community. Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13cm show no evidence for water ice deposits.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Churchman bought Orford Castle in 1928, and in 1930 {{gave the}} {{property}} to the Orford Town Trust; an appeal for money to maintain and restore it began shortly afterwards. During the Second World War the castle was refortified with barbed wire to form what was originally intended to be an anti-aircraft emplacement, with Nissen huts erected around the keep. The castle was instead used as <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> emplacement, and a concrete floor was installed in the south-east tower to support the equipment. These buildings were removed {{at the end of}} the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk. II system, which allowed radar operators {{to determine whether a}} blip on their screen was a friendly aircraft. IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from <b>a</b> <b>radar</b> system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch out in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E
25|$|The other {{variant of}} the LRSAM will be fielded by the Indian Air Force. Along with the Akash SAM, the LRSAM fills a longer range {{requirement}} and both types will complement each other. Each unit of the MR-SAM would consist of a command and control centre, with <b>an</b> acquisition <b>radar,</b> <b>a</b> guidance <b>radar</b> and 3 launchers with eight missiles each.|$|R
50|$|On 1 May 1951 the 676th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began {{operating}} <b>an</b> AN/FPS-3 search <b>radar</b> and <b>an</b> AN/FPS-4 height-finder <b>radar</b> in June 1952, {{and initially}} the station {{functioned as a}} Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders {{picked up on the}} unit's radar scopes. At the end of 1958 Antigo was operating <b>an</b> AN/FPS-20 search <b>radar</b> and <b>an</b> AN/FPS-6 height-finder <b>radar.</b> <b>A</b> second AN/FPS-6B height-finder radar was added in 1959.|$|R
50|$|There is also <b>a</b> surface <b>radar</b> SPS-702, X band, {{the latest}} version of a type which has been quite {{successful}} and with all solid-state electronics. Finally there is <b>a</b> navigation <b>radar,</b> with X band, in the forward tree.|$|R
