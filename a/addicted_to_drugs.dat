500|$|Ronnie Lee Gardner {{was born}} in Salt Lake City, Utah, and was the {{youngest}} of Dan and Ruth Gardner's seven children. Dan was a heavy drinker who left the household to start another family while Ronnie was a toddler; Dan and Ruth divorced when Ronnie was 18months old. Six months later, Ronnie was found malnourished and wandering the streets alone in a diaper. Child welfare workers filed a [...] "failure to care" [...] petition and took him into custody, though they later returned him to his mother. Gardner's relationship with his father was tumultuous; Dan did not believe he was Gardner's biological father and frequently told his son of his belief. According to Gardner, he was raised by an older sister, and was sexually abused by his siblings. Sometimes he and his sister Bonnie would run away and seek refuge in a [...] "hobo camp." [...] By the age of 10, Gardner was <b>addicted</b> <b>to</b> <b>drugs</b> and permitted access to alcohol. He and his brother Randy were arrested for stealing cowboy boots and taken into juvenile detention. Gardner recalled with distress that his father Dan came to take his brother Randy home and left him behind.|$|E
500|$|From 1972 to 1979, Liv’s mother Bebe Buell {{lived with}} rock {{musician}} Todd Rundgren. In 1976, Buell became unexpectedly pregnant from a brief relationship with Steven Tyler. On July 1, 1977, Buell gave birth, naming the daughter Liv Rundgren and claiming that Todd Rundgren was the biological father. Rundgren and Buell ended their romantic relationship but Rundgren put {{his heart and}} soul into the [...] "white lie". At age eight Liv met Steven Tyler and he noticed a resemblance she shared with his other daughter, Mia. When she asked her mother about the similarity, the secret was revealed. The truth about Tyler's paternity did not become public until six years later in 1991, when she changed her name from Rundgren to Tyler, but kept the former as a middle name. Buell's stated reason for the initial decision was that Steven was too heavily <b>addicted</b> <b>to</b> <b>drugs</b> {{at the time of}} her birth. Since learning the truth about her paternity, Liv and Steven have developed a close relationship. They also have worked together professionally, once when she appeared in Aerosmith's music video for [...] "Crazy" [...] in 1993, and again when Aerosmith performed many of the songs in the film Armageddon (1998) in which Tyler starred.|$|E

500|$|In any case, Griswold, {{along with}} James Russell Lowell and Nathaniel Parker Willis, edited a posthumous {{collection}} of Poe's works published in three volumes starting in January 1850. He {{did not share}} the profits of his edition with Poe's surviving relatives. This edition included a biographical sketch titled [...] "Memoir of the Author" [...] which has become notorious for its inaccuracy. The [...] "Memoir" [...] depicts Poe as a madman, <b>addicted</b> <b>to</b> <b>drugs</b> and chronically drunk. Many elements were fabricated by Griswold using forged letters as evidence and it was denounced by those who knew Poe, including Sarah Helen Whitman, Charles Frederick Briggs, and George Rex Graham. In March, Graham published a notice in his magazine accusing Griswold of betraying trust and taking revenge on the dead. [...] "Mr. Griswold", he wrote, [...] "has allowed old prejudices and old enmities to steal... into the coloring of his picture." [...] Thomas Holley Chivers {{wrote a book called}} New Life of Edgar Allan Poe which directly responded to Griswold's accusations. He said that Griswold [...] "is not only incompetent to Edit any of [...] works, but totally unconscious of the duties which he and every man who sets himself up as a Literary Executor, owe the dead".|$|E

The character was revealed as Dylan Keogh (William Beck) during the episode's broadcast, who was last seen in 2012.

Stevenson, who previously appeared on the show for six months in 2013, subsequently joined the show's main cast. Hossington explained that Iain and Dixie would begin a partnership which would be [...] "fun" [...] to create. Mark Letheren made four guest appearances throughout the series as counsellor Ben Harding, a role he has played on-off since 2007. Susan Cookson reprised her role as Maggie Coldwell in episode twenty-six for a non-canon storyline which saw Maggie invite Zoe to join the Air Ambulance service. Gregory Forsyth-Foreman returned to the show as Louis Fairhead in episode thirty-two for a storyline which saw Louis become <b>addicted</b> <b>to</b> <b>drugs.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{character}}'s {{health is}} divided between two types: HP and Limbs. While HP {{is the general}} amount of health that a character and other NPCs have (friendly, neutral or hostile) and which depletes when damage is taken, either from combat, setting off traps, falling from a height or self injury, Limb health is specific to each portion of the body – namely the arms, legs, head, and torso, although non-human enemies feature additional appendages, and robotic enemies feature different types of appendages. Limbs can be damaged {{in the same way}} as HP, though once depleted they become [...] "crippled" [...] and induce a negative status effect, such as blurred vision if the head is crippled, or reduced movement speed if one or both legs are crippled. Both HP and Limbs can be recovered through the use of medical medicine in the form of Stimpaks, as well as sleeping and visiting a doctor, while HP can be slowly recovered by consuming food and drinking water and/or soft drinks. Players can also be affected by other negative health effects, including radiation poisoning and withdrawal symptoms. While the latter occurs when the player's character becomes <b>addicted</b> <b>to</b> <b>drugs</b> and alcohol and confers negative effects if the player does not continue using them, radiation poisoning occurs when the character absorbs radiation, either by walking through areas with background radiation, and consuming food and drink that is irradiated with a small amount of radiation. The negative impacts of both can affect SPECIAL attributes, and can be treated by a doctor, though radiation can be dealt with by using Rad Away. Furthermore, the amount of background radiation absorbed can be reduced through the use of Rad-X drugs and special apparel, both of which improve resistance to radiation.|$|E
