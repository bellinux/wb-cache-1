5000|$|In ideal power generation, or transmission, systems using {{rotating}} parts, {{not only}} the torques applied or reacted are [...] "smooth" [...] leading to constant speeds, but also the rotating plane where the power is generated (or input) and the plane it is taken out (output) are the same. In reality {{this is not the}} case. The torques generated may not be smooth (e.g., internal combustion engines) or the component being driven may not react to the torque smoothly (e.g., reciprocating compressors), and the power generating plane is normally at some distance to the power takeoff plane. Also, the components transmitting the torque can generate non-smooth or <b>alternating</b> <b>torques</b> (e.g., elastic drive belts, worn gears, misaligned shafts). Because no material can be infinitely stiff, these <b>alternating</b> <b>torques</b> applied at some distance on a shaft cause twisting vibration about the axis of rotation.|$|R

In this paper, three different test methods for grinding performance evaluation of grinding coolants are used to investigate the influence of three coolants on grinding process. The three test methods are four balls <b>test,</b> tapping <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> and real grinding test. The test results showed that the mechanism of four balls test is simple, and the test results have good repeatability, but there is a large divagation with real grinding test results.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to assess the bone healing supporting characteristics of porous calcium phosphate (Ca-P) cement when implanted in a rabbit segmental defect model {{as well as to}} determine the reliability of <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> as a method to verify bone healing. The middiaphyseal radius was chosen as the area to create bilaterally increasing defect sizes (5, 10, and 15 [*]mm), which were either filled with porous Ca-P cement or left open as a control. After 12 weeks of implantation, <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> measurements as well as histological and radiographic evaluation were performed. In two of the open 15 [*]mm control defects, bone bridging was visible at the radiographic and histological evaluation. Bone was observed to be present in all porous Ca-P cement implants (5, 10, and 15 [*]mm defects) after 12 weeks. No significant differences in torque measurements were observed between the 5 and 10 [*]mm filled and open control defects using a t-test. In addition, the mechanical strength of all operated specimens was similar compared with nonoperated bone samples. The torsion data for the 15 [*]mm open defect appeared to be lower compared with the filled 15 [*]mm defect, but no significant difference could be proven. Within the limitation of the study design, porous Ca-P cement implants demonstrated osteoconductive properties and confirmed to be a suitable scaffold material in a weight-bearing situation. Further, the used <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> method was found to be unreliable for testing the mechanical properties of the healed bone defect...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the osseointegration of implants which were surface-treated with various diameters of TiO 2 nanotubes (30 [*]nm, 70 [*]nm, and 100 [*]nm) in rabbit. Resorbable blast media (RBM) surfaced implants (Osstem, Busan, Korea) 3. 5 [*]mm in diameter and 8. 5 [*]mm in length were designated as the control group and the implants surface-treated with various diameters of nanotubes (30 [*]nm, 70 [*]nm, and 100 [*]nm) with the same shapes were designated as the experimental groups. The implants were maintained unloaded for 4 and 12 weeks. After this period, the animals were sacrificed and micro-CT analysis, histomorphometric analysis (bone to implant contact (BIC), bone volume (BV)), and removal <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> were performed.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the effects of {{surgical}} technique and implant surface roughness on implant fixation. A total of 48 screw implants with machined or etched surface topographies were placed into the femoral condyles of goats. The implant sites were prepared by a conventional technique, by undersized preparation, or by the osteotome technique. Bone tissue responses were evaluated after 12 weeks of healing by removal <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> and histologic analysis using scanning electron microscope. The cumulative removal torque value of the etched implants placed with the undersized technique (98 +/- 29 Ncm) was higher (50 +/- 35 Ncm) to a level of statistical significance than machined surface implants placed by the osteotome technique. Scanning electron microscope evaluation indicated that all implants showed interfacial bone contact. The <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> resulted in fracture at the bone-implant interface for all experimental conditions. Installation of etched implants using an undersized preparation of the implant bed resulted in superior bonding strength with the surrounding bone at 12 weeks after surgery.

40|$|Lecturepg. 60 - 71 This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the authors' experience gained from implementation of model-based monitoring systems for LNG string vibration. The development of a novel train torsional vibration monitoring approach utilizing system modal analysis and lateral-torsional coupling in geared systems has been reported. A number of recent Root Cause Analysis programs related to turbocompressor string operation problems (LNG production) have faced barriers due to lack of adequate torsional vibration monitoring solutions. As the machinery problems associated with abnormal levels of train torsional vibration become more frequent, the incentives for the Oil & Gas industry to address the need for reliable and trouble-free cyclic torque evaluation gain ground. This constitutes a demand for a robust, reliable and accurate torsional vibration monitoring approach acceptable as a practical solution. Contemporary, industry-wide accepted measurement technologies (strain gage with telemetry, optical probes, laser) fit the test needs well but their lack of ruggedness and durability as well as problematic installation impacting machine operation do not permit their consideration for long-term monitoring applications. The authors present a methodology which allows evaluation of <b>alternating</b> <b>torque</b> amplitudes in different string sections based on standard instrumentation installed on the train. The approach adopted in this paper relies heavily on the modal representation of the dynamic system being analyzed. The calculation method described utilizes the results of such analysis along with the angular vibration signal obtained from standard instrumentation installed on the train (gas turbine speed pick-up signal spectrum) and typical radial vibration data from gearbox proximity probes (when available). This means that no additional probes need to be installed to get the results. The robustness and accuracy of the proposed techniques was validated in the laboratory and benchmarked against test data from several LNG production train measurement campaigns, where the <b>alternating</b> <b>torque</b> was measured by means of standard measurement systems. The authors show the results of this verification together with prospective system applications. The symbols and abbreviations used in this paper are given in the last section...|$|R

If the implant rotates under the pressure it is deemed a failure and removed. This method comes {{at the risk of}} fracturing bone that is mid-way in the process of osseointegration. It is also unreliable in determining the osseointegration potential of a bone region, as tests have yielded that a rotating implant can go on to be successfully integrated.|$|R
