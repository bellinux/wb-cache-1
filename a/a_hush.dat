5|$|The Avianca Flight 52 {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 707-321B (registration number HK-2016). The {{aircraft was}} manufactured in June 1967 and {{was purchased by}} Avianca from Pan Am in 1977. By {{the time of the}} crash, the aircraft was 22 years old and had over 61,000 flight hours. The 707 was equipped with four JT3D-3B engines modified with <b>a</b> <b>hush</b> kit to reduce noise pollution. Avianca personnel reported that they factored in a five-percent fuel overburn into the performance calculations due to the hush kit along with an additional five-percent overburn due to the age of the aircraft. Additionally, maintenance crews had noted recurring issues with the aircraft's autopilot, including the altitude hold function.|$|E

Nevertheless, this hope was initially kept to <b>a</b> <b>hush.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{models have}} <b>a</b> <b>hush</b> or {{temporary}} silence feature that allows silencing, typically by pressing {{a button on}} the housing, without removing the battery. This is especially useful in locations where false alarms can be relatively common (e.g. near a kitchen), or users might remove the battery permanently to avoid the annoyance of false alarms, preventing the alarm from detecting a fire should one break out.|$|E

2500|$|He was {{virtually}} {{retired from the}} entertainment world and was treated like he never existed. From here on, the media would refer {{to him as the}} [...] "former entertainer", and all the recordings and pictures taken when he was a Chanels/Rats & Star member were almost never broadcast anymore, and if they were, Tashiro's voice would be lowered to <b>a</b> <b>hush</b> or removed entirely, and no part of his body would show. Newspapers and magazines tacitly agreed not to talk about him at all. In an episode of a comedic duo , host Hikari Ota accidentally said his full name. In , Sayaka Aoki, while displaying only part of his name, said [...] "I put a camera in the chest drawer", which caused a general laugh.
