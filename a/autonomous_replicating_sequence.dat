Here we report the nucleotide sequence of ARS 65. The sequence from BgIII to EcoRI sites cloned as ARS was 2658 bp long. There exist three interesting domains: a TA repeat, a myc like box (essential sequence for c-myc ARS), and a T rich region. Cloned DNAs containing various segments of pARS 65 were transfected to rat 3 Y 1 cells {{together with the}} hygromycinB resistance expression vector, and hygromycinB resistant clones were isolated.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of replication intermediates of a Kluyveromyces lactis chromosomal <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> (ARS), KARS 101, {{has shown that}} it is active as a chromosomal replicator. KARS 101 contains a 50 bp sequence conserved in two other K. lactis ARS elements. The deletion of the conserved sequence in KARS 101 completely abolished replicator activity, in both the plasmids and the chromosome. Gel shift assays indicated that this sequence binds proteins present in K. lactis nuclear extracts, and a 40 bp sequence, previously defined as the core essential for K. lactis ARS function, is required for efficient binding. Reminiscent of the origin replication complex (ORC), the binding appears to be ATP dependent. A similar pattern of protection of the core was seen with in vitro footprinting. KARS 101 also functions as an ARS sequence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A comparative study using S. cerevisiae nuclear extracts revealed that the sequence required for binding is a dodecanucleotide related to the S. cerevisiae ARS consensus sequence and essential for S. cerevisiae ARS activity...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} mapped scaffold-attached regions (SARs) on an 800 -kilobase DNA {{walk from the}} Drosophila X chromosome. We have also previously shown that the strength of binding, i. e., the ability of SARs to bind to all nuclear scaffolds or only to a fraction of them varied from one SAR to another one. In the present study, 71 of the 85 subfragments that bind scaffolds and 38 fragments that do not bind scaffolds were tested {{for their ability to}} promote <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> (ARS) activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sixteen SAR-containing fragments from the chromosome walk were also examined for association to yeast nuclear scaffolds in vitro. All identified ARSs (a total of 27) were present on SAR-containing fragments, except two, which were adjacent to SARs. There is thus a correlation between ARS and SAR activities, and this correlation defines a SAR subclass. Moreover, the presence of an ARS on a DNA fragment appeared to be highly correlated with the strength of binding. The binding activity was highly conserved from Drosophila melanogaster to yeast. These data suggest that Drosophila DNA sequences responsible for binding to components of the nuclear scaffold from either D. melanogaster or yeast may be involved in the process of heterologous extrachromosomal replication in yeasts...|$|E

Centromeric DNAs from yeast were found to have sequences in their functional elements which cause them to be unusually straight. <b>Autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequences</b> were found to have two structural domains, one consisting of unusually straight sequences surrounding the consensus and the other of bending elements in flanking DNA.

Cloned EBV DNA EcoRI restriction fragments, A, B, and DIJhet, were judged to function in this capacity by their ability to convert YNN 27 cells to the uracil phenotype after transformation with each EBV-specific fragment ligated into YIp 5. Additional analyses to confirm and to specify further the location of the ars were performed by cleavage of EcoRI fragments A and B into smaller BamHI fragments, which were subsequently cloned in YIp 5 and tested for their ability to function as ars. BamHI fragment X, obtained from EcoRI fragment A, and BamHI fragment R, obtained from EcoRI fragment B, showed ars behavior. The successful recovery of the appropriate virus DNA segments in plasmid form from transformed yeast cells and the ability of these yeast cells to be propagated further substantiated the ars capability of the three EBV fragments...|$|R
40|$|With the {{sequencing}} {{of the first}} complete eukaryotic chromosome, III of yeast (YCIII) of length 315 kb, several types of questions concerning chromosomal organization and the heterogeneity of eukaryotic DNA sequences can be approached. We have undertaken extensive analysis of YCIII with the goals of: (1) discerning patterns and anomalies in the occurrences of short oligonucleotides; (2) characterizing the nature and locations of significant direct and inverted repeats; (3) delimiting regions unusually rich in particular base types (e. g., G+C, purines); and (4) analyzing the distributions of markers of interest, e. g., delta (delta) elements, ARS (<b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequences),</b> special oligonucleotides, close repeats and close dyad pairings, and gene sequences. YCIII reveals several distinctive sequence features, including: (i) a relative abundance of significant local and global repeats highlighting five genes containing substantial close or tandem DNA repeats; (ii) an anomalous distribution of delta elements involving two clusters and a long gap; (iii) a significantly even distribution of ARS; (iv) a relative increase {{in the frequency of}} T runs and AT iterations downstream of genes and A runs upstream of genes; and (v) two regions of complex repetitive sequences and anomalous DNA composition, 29000 - 31000 and 291000 - 295000, the latter centered at the HMRa locus.

40|$|The replicating {{activity}} of several cloned DNAs containing putative origin sequences was examined in a cell-free extract that absolutely depends on simian virus 40 (SV 40) T antigen promoting initiation of SV 40 DNA replication in vitro. Of the three DNAs containing the human Alu family sequence (BLUR 8), {{the origin of}} (Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasmid 2 micron DNA (pJD 29), and the yeast <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> (YRp 7), only BLUR 8 was active as a template. Replication in a reaction mixture with BLUR 8 as a template was semiconservative and not primed by a putative RNA polymerase III transcript synthesized on the Alu family sequence in vitro. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the small-sized DNA produced in a short-term incubation was converted to full-length closed circular and open circular DNAs in alkaline sucrose gradients. DNA synthesis in extracts began in a region of the Alu family sequence and was inhibited 80 % {{by the addition of}} anti-T serum. Furthermore, partially purified T antigen bound the Alu family sequence in BLUR 8 by the DNA-binding immunoassay. These results suggest that SV 40 T antigen recognizes the Alu family sequence, similar to the origin sequence of SV 40 DNA, and initiates semiconservative DNA replication in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Transcriptional {{repression}} at {{the silent}} yeast mating type loci is achieved through {{the formation of}} a particular nucleoprotein complex at specific cis-acting elements called silencers. This complex in turn appears to initiate the spreading of a histone binding protein complex into the surrounding chromatin, which restricts accessibility of the region to the transcription machinery. We have investigated long-range, cooperative effects between silencers by studying the repression of a reporter gene integrated at the HML locus flanked by various combinations of wild-type and mutated silencer sequences. Two silencers can cooperate over &gt; 4000 bp to repress transcription efficiently. More importantly, a single binding site for either the repressor activator protein 1 (Rap 1), the <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> (ARS) binding factor 1 (Abf 1) or the origin recognition complex (ORC) can enhance the action of a distant silencer without acting as a silencer on its own. Functional cooperativity is demonstrated using a quantitative assay for repression, and varies with the affinity of the binding sites used. Since the repression mechanism is Sir dependent, the Rap 1, ORC and/or Abf 1 proteins bound to distant DNA elements may interact to create an interface of sufficiently high affinity such that Sir-containing complexes bind, nucleating the silent chromatin state...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of replication origins in metazoans is only nominally {{similar to that}} in model organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By contrast to the compact origins of budding yeast, in metazoans multiple elements act as replication start sites or control replication efficiency. We first reported that replication forks diverge from an origin 5 ′ to the human c-myc gene and that a 2. 4 -kb core fragment of the origin displays <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> activity in plasmids and replicator activity at an ectopic chromosomal site. Here we have used clonal HeLa cell lines containing mutated c-myc origin constructs integrated at the same chromosomal location to identify elements important for DNA replication. Replication activity was measured before or after integration of the wild-type or mutated origins using PCR-based nascent DNA abundance assays. We find that deletions of several segments of the c-myc origin, including the DNA unwinding element and transcription factor binding sites, substantially reduced replicator activity, whereas deletion of the c-myc promoter P 1 had only a modest effect. Substitution mutagenesis indicated that the sequence of the DNA unwinding element, rather than the spacing of flanking sequences, is critical. These results identify multiple functional elements essential for c-myc replicator activity...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that replication of fission yeast chromosomes is initiated in distinct regions. Analyses of <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequences</b> {{have suggested that}} regions required for replication {{are very different from}} those in budding yeast. Here, we present evidence that fission yeast replication origins are specifically associated with proteins that participate in initiation of replication. Most Orp 1 p, a putative subunit of the fission yeast origin recognition complex (ORC), was found to be associated with chromatin-enriched insoluble components throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, the minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins, SpMcm 2 p and SpMcm 6 p, encoded by the nda 1 +/cdc 19 + and mis 5 + genes, respectively, were associated with chromatin DNA only during the G 1 and S phases. Immunostaining of spread nuclei showed SpMcm 6 p to be localized at discrete foci on chromatin during the G 1 and S phases. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that Orp 1 p was preferentially localized at the ars 2004 and ars 3002 origins of the chromosome throughout the cell cycle, while SpMcm 6 p was associated with these origins only in the G 1 and S phases. Both Orp 1 p and SpMcm 6 p were associated with a 1 -kb region that contains elements required for autonomous replication of ars 2004. The results suggest that the fission yeast ORC specifically interacts with chromosomal replication origins and that Mcm proteins are loaded onto the origins {{to play a role in}} initiation of replication...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Origins of DNA {{replication}} are key genetic elements, {{yet their}} identification remains elusive in most organisms. In previous work, {{we found that}} centromeres contain origins of replication (ORIs) that are determined epigenetically in the patho-genic yeast Candida albicans. In this study, we used origin recognition complex (ORC) binding and nucleosome occupancy pat-terns in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis to train a machine learning algorithm to predict the position of ac-tive arm (noncentromeric) origins in the C. albicans genome. The model identified bona fide active origins {{as determined by the}} presence of replication intermediates on nondenaturing two-dimensional (2 D) gels. Importantly, these origins function at their native chromosomal loci and also as autonomously <b>replicating</b> <b>sequences</b> (ARSs) on a linear plasmid.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a transformation system which uses <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> plasmids for a methylotrophic yeast, Candida boidinii. Two autonomous replication sequences, CARS 1 and CARS 2, were newly cloned from the genome of C. boidinii. Plasmids having both a CARS fragment and the C. boidinii URA 3 gene transformed C. boidinii ura 3 cells to Ura+ phenotype at frequencies of up to 10 (4) CFU/micrograms of DNA. From Southern blot analysis, CARS plasmids seemed to exist in polymeric forms {{as well as in}} monomeric forms in C. boidinii cells. The C. boidinii URA 3 gene was overexpressed in C. boidinii on these CARS vectors. CARS 1 and CARS 2 were found to function as an <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> element in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well.

40|$|A yeast {{artificial}} chromosome (YAC) {{was constructed}} with a native <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> (ARS) flanked telomere {{at one end and}} a 50 -bp synthetic oligonucleotide of C 4 A 2 repeats at the other. This was done in order to determine whether the presence of the flanking ARS sequence is required for telomere function. This construct was introduced into two different yeast strains: one mutated in the recombination function RAD 52 and the other wild type for this gene. Both strains gave rise to autonomously replicating artificial chromosomes. The molecules in the RAD 52 strain were rearranged dimers terminating at both ends with Tetrahymena telomeres, whereas in the rad 52 strain two classes of YACs were found: rearranged dimers and elements bearing an ARS-free telomere. The presence of the latter class of molecules confirmed the finding of Wellinger and Zakian (1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 973 - 977) that the flanking ARS is not required for telomere function. Furthermore, in this class of molecules the ARS-free telomeric end was shortened as a result of deletions that removed some distal pBR 322 sequences and some C 4 A 2 repeats. The size of the resulting YACs ranged from 7. 7 to 9 kb, considerably below the size threshold found by Zakian et al. (1986, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 925 - 932) for CEN 4 artificial plasmids. An explanation for the structural instability of the ARS-free end of the YACs is suggested. © 1990...|$|E
40|$|Many cell {{division}} cycle (cdc) mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit elevated mitotic loss of pDK 243, a 14 -kilobase minichromosome with a centromere and one <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> (ARS). Tandem copies of different ARSs {{were added to}} pDK 243. The addition of these ARS clusters to pDK 243 {{had no effect on}} its mitotic loss in cdc 7 (protein kinase), cdc 9 (DNA ligase), or cdc 16 or cdc 17 (DNA polymerase) mutants. However, in cdc 6 and cdc 14 mutants, the mitotic loss of pDK 243 with an ARS cluster was suppressed by a factor of 6 - 8 compared to pDK 243 without the cluster. This suppression was dependent upon the number of ARSs in the cluster and the integrity of the ARS consensus sequence in each ARS of the cluster. ARSs are known to be DNA replication origins. Therefore, the suppression of mini-chromosome loss by ARSs in cdc 6 and cdc 14 mutants suggests that these mutants are defective in the initiation of DNA replication. Since the CDC 6 protein appears to act at the G 1 /S phase transition, the CDC 6 protein may be a factor required at the beginning of S phase to initiate DNA replication at origins. In contrast, the CDC 14 protein acts after mitosis. We suggest that the CDC 14 protein performs a function late in the cell cycle that may be required for efficient initiation of DNA replication during S phase of the next cell cycle...|$|E
40|$|Genome-wide {{experimental}} studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveal that <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> (ARS) requires an essential consensus sequence (ACS) for replication activity. Computational studies identified thousands of ACS like {{patterns in the}} genome. However, only a few hundreds of these sites act as replicating sites and the rest are considered as dormant or evolving sites. In a bid to understand the sequence makeup of replication sites, a content and context-based analysis was performed {{on a set of}} replicating ACS sequences that binds to origin-recognition complex (ORC) denoted as ORC-ACS and non-replicating ACS sequences (nrACS), that are not bound by ORC. In this study, DNA properties such as base composition, correlation, sequence dependent thermodynamic and DNA structural profiles, and their positions have been considered for characterizing ORC-ACS and nrACS. Analysis reveals that ORC-ACS depict marked differences in nucleotide composition and context features in its vicinity compared to nrACS. Interestingly, an A-rich motif was also discovered in ORC-ACS sequences within its nucleosome-free region. Profound changes in the conformational features, such as DNA helical twist, inclination angle and stacking energy between ORC-ACS and nrACS were observed. Distribution of ACS motifs in the non-coding segments points to the locations of ORC-ACS which are found far away from the adjacent gene start position compared to nrACS thereby enabling an accessible environment for ORC-proteins. Our attempt is novel in considering the contextual view of ACS and its flanking region along with nucleosome positioning in the S. cerevisiae genome and may be useful for any computational prediction scheme...|$|E

After cell mating the macronucleus is derived from a micronucleus, a derivation that includes excision of the genes from chromosomes and elimination of the remaining DNA.

Ura- auxotrophs were obtained by selecting for resistance to 5 -fluoroorotic acid and were identified as ura 3 mutants by transformation with P. stipitis URA 3. P. stipitis URA 3 was cloned by its homology to Saccharomyces cerevisiae URA 3, with which it is 69 % identical in the coding region. P. stipitis ARS elements were cloned functionally through plasmid rescue. These sequences confer autonomous replication when cloned into vectors bearing the P. stipitis URA 3 gene. P. stipitis ARS 2 has features {{similar to those of}} the consensus ARS of S. cerevisiae and other ARS elements. Circular plasmids bearing the P. stipitis URA 3 gene with various amounts of flanking sequences produced 600 to 8, 600 Ura+ transformants per micrograms of DNA by electroporation.

40|$|The aquatic Gram-negative organism, Caulobacter crescentus, is {{a member}} of the alpha (alpha) {{subclass}} of the proteobacteria. C. crescentus possesses an unique cell cycle with a complex developmental program in that the bacterium asymmetrically divides to produce a replication competent stalked cell and replication incompetent swarmer cell. Previously, a chromosomal fragment was shown to support autonomous plasmid replication. In addition, sequence analysis of this <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> (ARS) 500 by fragment, termed Cori, exhibited some shared features characteristic of a typical replication origin. However, as not all identified ARS elements are chromosomal replication origins, it was therefore shown by two-dimensional (2 -D) DNA agarose gel electrophoresis analysis that chromosomal replication is bi-directional and originates within the Cori region (Chapter 2). Tracing of the leading strand path of nascent DNA within the Cori region not only supported the 2 -D gel analysis results, but also indicated that replication initiates from within Cori (Chapter 3). Thus, it is confirmed that Cori is the chromosomal replication origin in C. crescentus and that replication proceeds bi-directionally. Nascent replicated DNA is methylated by the methyltransferase CcrM, but transcription of ccrM is indirectly dependent on synthesis of glycerol- 3 -phosphate, a precursor for cell membrane phospholipid synthesis (Chapter 6). A feature unique to C. crescentus is the global response regulator CtrA that controls key events within the cell cycle such as chromosomal replication. CtrA represses replication in the swarmer cell by binding to five specific sites on Cori. In order to allow replication to initiate, CtrA is removed from the stalked cell by proteolytic degradation. Another interesting feature is that Cori resides within an unusual gene cluster. It has also shown that this unusual gene cluster is not unique to C. crescentus as the alpha-proteobacterium intracellular pa...|$|E
40|$|The best {{characterized}} eukaryote replication {{model is}} of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Replication origins of S. cerevisiae are 100 to 200 bp in size and contain an essential 11 -bp <b>autonomous</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> (ARS) consensus sequence (ACS). The origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to the ACS in order to recruit additional replication factors (Cdt 1, Cdc 6, MCM, Cdc 45) and together they form the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). Unlike budding yeast, the mammalian cells contain dispersed replication origins in which multiple elements distributed over large distances act as replication start sites. Mammalian DNA replication origins, such as the c-myc origin, contain a DNA unwinding element (DUE), which is an AT-rich region that contains 10 -of- 11 matches to ARS consensus. Our lab primarily studies DNA replication of the human c-myc locus. We have successfully integrated the wild-type 2. 4 kb c-myc replication origin and its various inactive mutants in a known ectopic chromosomal site in HeLa/ 406 cells in order to study the multiple functional elements of this origin. My thesis focused on investigating the minimal sequence required in mammalian replication origin for replication activity. To address this question, I assessed the effects of replication protein tethering on chromatin accessibility of inactivated c-myc origins which are 930 bp or less and contain an intact DUE. In part I of my thesis, I describe how I made two new HeLa/ 406 cell lines containing two different deletion mutants of the cmyc replicator core (which are 607 bp and 228 bp long) at the known ectopic chromosomal site. In part II of my thesis, I describe how I created plasmids expressing GAL 4 DNA-binding domain (GAL 4 DBD) -BRG 1 fusion proteins. BRG 1 is a catalytic core subunit of SWI/SNF mammalian chromatin remodeling complex. Wild-type BRG 1 and catalytic inactive BRG 1 K 798 R mutant were used to make GAL 4 DBD fusion proteins. In part III of my thesis, I evaluated the effects of GAL 4 DBD fusion proteins on chromatin structure of the inactivated ectopic c-myc replicator via DNase I hypersensitivity assay. The proteins used were Cdt 1, a licensing protein necessary for pre-RC formation; wild-type BRG 1 and catalytically dead BRG 1 mutant. GAL 4 DBD-Cdt 1 has previously been shown to restore origin activity, as well as binding of replication proteins such as ORC, MCM, Cdc 45, and DUE-B. My data suggest that expression of GAL 4 DBD-Cdt 1 or of GAL 4 DBD-wild-type BRG 1 can significantly increase the DNase I sensitivity of the inactivated ectopic 52 ̆ 7 930 bp c-myc origin, which contains both the DUE and the GAL 4 binding sites. However, the shorter c-myc replicators (607 bp or 228 bp) did not show any change in DNase I hypersensitivity when the same GAL 4 DBD-Cdt 1 was expressed. These results indicate that in conjunction with GAL 4 DBD protein tethering, the c-myc DUE alone is not sufficient for opening the chromatin structure of the ectopic c-myc replicator. Thus, the reactivation of the ectopic c-myc replicator via GAL 4 DBD protein tethering requires additional DNA elements besides the DUE...|$|E

They {{can be easily}} identified as the plasmids containing them transform yeast cells at a high frequency. As the first step towards identifying all potential replication origins in a 73 -kb region of the long arm of fission yeast chromosome II, we have mapped five new ARS elements using systematic subcloning and transformation assay. 2 D analysis {{of one of the}} ARS plasmids that showed highest transformation frequency localized the replication origin activity within the cloned genomic DNA. All the new ARS {{elements are}} localized in two clusters in centromere proximal 40 kb of the region. The presence of at least six ARS elements, including the previously reported ars 727, is suggestive of a higher origin density in this region than that predicted earlier using a computer based search.

40|$|We have cloned a {{functional}} centromeric DNA sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using the 2 mu chromosome-loss mapping technique and meiotic tetrad analysis, {{we have identified}} this DNA sequence as the centromere of chromosome V (CEN 5). The CEN 5 sequence has been localized on an 1, 100 -base-pair BamHI-BglII restriction fragment. Plasmids containing CEN 5 and an autonomously <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> are mitotically stable in S. cerevisiae and segregate in a Mendelian fashion during meiosis...|$|R
40|$|A plasmid able to {{transform}} {{and to be}} stably maintained both in Sulfolobus solfataricus and in Escherichia coli was constructed by insertion into an E. coli plasmid of the autonomously <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence</b> of the virus particle SSV 1 and a suitable mutant of the hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase) gene as the transformation marker. The vector suffered no rearrangement and/or chromosome integration, and its copy number in Sulfolobus was increased by exposure of the cells to mitomycin C...|$|R

H. polymorpha DL 1 - 57 harboring an autonomously <b>replicating</b> <b>sequence,</b> HARS 36, efficiently expressed the gene for recombinant hirudin. The effect of methanol oxidase (MOX) on {{the expression of the}} hirudin gene in H. polymorpha DL 1 - 57 was studied, and the fermentation strategies coupled with the MOX activity and an antioxidant, tocopherol, were also examined. ope...|$|R

We validate {{the design of}} a non-trivial CRDT, a <b>replicated</b> <b>sequence,</b> with performance measurements in the context of Wikipedia. Furthermore, we discuss how to eliminate a remaining scalability bottleneck: Whereas garbage collection previously required a system-wide consensus, here we propose a flexible two-tier architecture and a protocol for migrating between tiers. We also discuss how the CRDT concept can be generalised, and its limitations...|$|R
