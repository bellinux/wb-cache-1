2500|$|As of October 16, 2008, Arizona {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{consumer-friendly}} net metering laws in the country. Excess generation is rolled over month to month, and any surplus is returned annually to the consumer at the <b>avoided</b> <b>cost</b> rate. IREC best practices, based on experience, recommends perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Arizona had 642 MW of rooftop solar in 2015. [...] Historically, the states' utilities have led repeated, failed efforts to eliminate net metering. [...] But after a year of wrangling with the solar industry, the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) decided in December 2016 to lower net-metering reimbursement rates significantly, leading to a temporary lull in rooftop solar installations because the lower rates made solar installations less economical for most residential and commercial installations.|$|E

50|$|The US Energy Information Administration has {{recommended}} that levelized costs of non-dispatchable {{sources such as}} wind or solar may be better compared to the avoided energy cost {{rather than to the}} LCOE of dispatchable sources such as fossil fuels or geothermal. This is because introduction of fluctuating power sources may or may not avoid capital and maintenance costs of backup dispatchable sources. Levelized <b>Avoided</b> <b>Cost</b> of Energy (LACE) is the avoided costs from other sources divided by the annual yearly output of the non-dispatchable source. However, the <b>avoided</b> <b>cost</b> is much harder to calculate accurately.|$|E

50|$|SMECO {{has filed}} a {{complaint}} with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), alleging that the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) coerced utilities into purchasing excess solar power generated by the state's community solar program at much higher retail rates rather than paying the amount it would have cost these utilities to create the power themselves, also known as the <b>avoided</b> <b>cost.</b> This would be in violation with the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), which establishes that any payment given to such qualifying power plants equate the utility's <b>avoided</b> <b>cost.</b> In addition, PURPA mandates that these plants do not exceed 80 MW of power.|$|E
40|$|Population {{growth and}} {{advances}} in {{quality of life}} in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) will require the region to rapidly increase its energy supply, even if major improvements in energy efficiency are attained. The region is characterized by a low-carbon power matrix and a potential to produce over 78 PWh from non-traditional renewable energy technologies (NRETs). However, bias toward fossil fuels and the perceived cost disadvantages prevent further market entry of renewable energy. Additional (societal) benefits of employing renewables are considerable but typically left out of cost comparisons. A consideration of these benefits may offer a rationale to promote investment and support regulations that would contribute to the deployment of these NRET technologies. We quantify societal benefits in terms of <b>avoided</b> <b>costs</b> (climate change <b>avoided</b> <b>costs,</b> <b>avoided</b> pollution control <b>costs,</b> <b>avoided</b> energy security <b>costs)</b> and economic benefits (improvements in the balance of payments and job creation). Results indicate that societal benefits are sufficiently large enough to compensate the cost disadvantage of solar and wind energy against fossil alternatives, justifying the eventual wholesale entry of these options. ...|$|R

50|$|Connecticut's {{renewable}} portfolio standard requires 7% {{of power}} in the state will be from renewable resources by 2010, and 23% by 2020. A bill passed in 2011 requires incentives that will produce at least 30 MW of new residential PV installed by the end of 2022. Net metering is available for all up to 2 MW sites, and is reconciled annually at either the <b>avoided</b> <b>cost</b> or the time of use/generation rate, which is higher but requires time of use metering.|$|E
50|$|The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA P.L. 95-617) {{passed in}} 1978 was very {{important}} to increasing electricity production from renewable energy facilities. PURPA required that electric utilities must interconnect with renewable power production facilities.

50|$|Solar {{power in}} Florida has been increasing, {{as the cost}} of solar power systems using {{photovoltaics}} (PV) has decreased in recent years. In 2008, Florida adopted a net metering rule that allows any electric utility customer generating up to 2 MW (2,000 kW) of power to use net metering, which provides a retail rate credit for kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered to the utility, rolled over from month to month, and paid out in cash by the utility once a year at the <b>avoided</b> <b>cost</b> rate.|$|E
50|$|Excess {{generation}} {{is a separate}} issue from net metering, but it is normally {{dealt with in the}} same rules, because it can arise. If local generation offsets a portion of the demand, net metering is not used. If local generation exceeds demand some of the time, for example during the day, net metering is used. If local generation exceeds demand for the billing cycle, best practices calls for a perpetual roll over of the kilowatt credits, although some regions have considered having any kilowatt credits expire after 36 months. The normal definition of excess {{generation is}} annually, although the term is equally applicable monthly. The treatment of annual excess generation (and monthly) ranges from lost, to compensation at <b>avoided</b> <b>cost,</b> to compensation at retail rate. Left over kilowatt credits upon termination of service would ideally be paid at retail rate, from the consumer standpoint, and lost, from the utility standpoint, with <b>avoided</b> <b>cost</b> a minimum compromise. Some regions allow optional payment for excess annual generation, which allows perpetual roll over or payment, at the customers choice. Both wind and solar are inherently seasonal, and it is highly likely to use up a surplus later, unless more solar panels or a larger wind turbine have been installed than needed.|$|E
50|$|Solar {{power in}} Wisconsin on rooftops is {{estimated}} to be able to provide 35.5% of the electricity used in Wisconsin, using 14,000 MW of solar panels. Net metering is available for systems up to at least 20 kW, and excess generation is credited at retail rate to customers next bill. Some utilities allow net metering up to 100 kW. For Xcel customers, kilowatt credits are rolled over monthly and are reconciled annually at <b>avoided</b> <b>cost.</b> Best practices recommend no limits, either individually or aggregate, and perpetual roll over of kilowatt credits.|$|E

50|$|The Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) {{adopted a}} feed-in tariff on 16 July 2012, for systems from 50 kW (AC) to 20 MW (AC), and {{was limited to}} 50 MW (AC). As {{customers}} cannot use their own electricity, it is actually a 20-year fixed rate power purchase agreement and LIPA retains the SRECs. The 2012 NY legislature failed to pass legislation which would have opened a New York market for SRECs starting in 2013. Payment is 22.5¢/kWh, less than what LIPA paid for peak generation at various times. At an estimated <b>avoided</b> <b>cost</b> of $0.075/kWh, the program added about $0.44/month to the average household electric bill.|$|E
5000|$|Net {{metering}} {{is available}} for residential customers up to 25 kW and others from 100 kW to 2 MW depending on type of customer and the utility. Excess generation is credited at retail rate to next month's bill and optionally paid once a year at energy supply rate (normally referred to as [...] "avoided cost"). Best practices recommend no limits, either individual or aggregate, and perpetual rollover of kilowatt credits, and not converting to a monetary value. Allowing optional payment once a year, either at <b>avoided</b> <b>cost</b> or retail, allows a mechanism of providing for the case where the system installed is larger than needed.|$|E
