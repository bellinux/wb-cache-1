5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on the barrels. The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevation</b> for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E

And it is to the abundant and marvellous expression of it by Turner, that I would direct especial attention, as being that which is in itself demonstrative of the highest knowledge and power--knowledge, in the constant use of lines of subdued slope in preference to steep or violent ascents, and in the perfect subjection of all such features, when they necessarily occur, to the larger masses; and power, in the inimitable statements of retiring space by mere painting of surface details, without the aid of crossing shadows, divided forms, or any other artifice.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} data are {{presented}} concerning {{the motion of}} limb segments during drawing movements executed in different planes in free space. The technique used allows {{the determination of the}} wrist and elbow positions in space as well as the measurement <b>of</b> the elbow <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> extension. Other kinematic variables are determined trigonometrically. Elbow and shoulder torque is also calculated. For circles and ellipses, {{it was found that the}} motion at the wrist is sinusoidal in two orthogonal directions in the plane of motion. Angular motion, when described by a set <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> previously identified psychophysically as constituting an appropriate coordinate system, is also sinusoidal. Although the number of degrees of freedom of the arm affords many possible ways of performing the task, there is a fixed phase relation between the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> the upper arm and forearm for naturally executed movements in all planes of space. Also, the phase <b>of</b> the yaw <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> the upper arm and forearm relative to the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevation</b> are related to the plane of motion and to the slant of ellipses in a fixed manner. There is a simple mapping between angular motion and intended wrist trajectory. Because this mapping is not valid for all planes of space, the actual trajectory can deviate from the intended one. However, the subject has no cognizance of the distortion. The calculated torque deviates substantially from sinusoidal and does change significantly when the same movement is executed in different planes. Results of simulations and mathematical analysis indicate that the fixed phase relationship between <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevation</b> leads to a minimal distortion from sinusoidal motion at the wrist in an average sense and that the characteristic distortions observed in the sagittal plane result inevitably from this constraint on the phase relations. The results support the assumption that the topology of the sensorimotor map used for the production of the movement and for its perception is the same. The problem of invariant relationships between kinematic parameters is discussed and the suggestion is made that they represent a general constraint, leading through learning and practice to an optimal solution in an average sense...|$|R

Graham, who has carefully surveyed the extremity of the Cape, makes it one hundred and thirty feet. The mixed sand and clay lay at an angle of forty degrees with the horizon, where I measured it, but the clay is generally much steeper. No cow nor hen ever gets down it. Half a mile farther south the bank is fifteen or twenty-five feet higher, and that appeared to be the highest land in North Truro. Even this vast clay bank is fast wearing away. Small streams of water trickling down it at intervals of two or three rods, have left the intermediate clay in the form of steep Gothic roofs fifty feet high or more, the ridges as sharp and rugged-looking as rocks; and in one place the bank is curiously eaten out in the form of a large semicircular crater.|$|E

When {{the laws}} of the causes have been ascertained, and the first stage of the great logical {{operation}} now under discussion satisfactorily accomplished, the second part follows; that of determining from {{the laws of}} the causes what effect any given combination of those causes will produce. This is a process of calculation, in the wider sense of the term; and very often involves processes of calculation in the narrowest sense. It is a ratiocination; and when our knowledge of the causes is so perfect as to extend to the exact numerical laws which they observe in producing their effects, the ratiocination may reckon among its premises the theorems of the science of number, in the whole immense extent of that science. Not only are the most advanced truths of mathematics often required to enable us to compute an effect, the numerical law of which we already know; but, even by the aid of those most advanced truths, we can go but a little way. In so simple a case as the common problem of three bodies gravitating toward one another, with a force directly as their mass and inversely as the square of the distance, all the resources of the calculus have not hitherto sufficed to obtain any general solution, but an approximate one. In a case a little more complex, but still one of the simplest which arise in practice, that of the motion of a projectile, the causes which affect the velocity and range (for example) of a cannon-ball may be all known and estimated: the force of the gunpowder, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevation,</b> the density of the air, the strength and direction of the wind; but {{it is one of the}} most difficult of mathematical problems to combine all these, so as to determine the effect resulting from their collective action.|$|E
