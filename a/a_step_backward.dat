For this reason, he enjoyed [...] "China", and opined that [...] "The China plot, which thankfully focused less on Michael's craziness than his (and his coworkers') relationship with Oscar, demonstrated how well-drawn the show has been even {{when it comes to}} its more peripheral characters."

[...] Patrick Holm of Total Sci-Fi felt that the second episode [...] "equates the word 'adult' with sex and swearing – more of a playground definition than a serious drama. In the conclusion of his review, Jonathan Capps of Noise to Signal felt that the episode was [...] "certainly nothing to get excited about, but I think it won't be too indicative of later episodes, as we're still getting to know these characters, and that has to take the fore in the first few episodes. However, Chris' [...] painfully simplistic, heavy-handed and often clichéd interpretation of sci-fi (some of Jack's techno-babble is frankly embarrassing) could prove to be a worrying factor later in the series." [...] A reviewer of TV Fodder felt [...] "Day One" [...] was a [...] "great second episode", adding [...] "there doesn't seem to be anything I don't like about this show".|$|E
500|$|Until the Whole World Hears {{met with}} an overall mixed to {{positive}} response from critics. Several critics regarded the musical aspects of the album as mediocre or sub-par, while others praised the album's lyrical content. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and described it as a [...] "powerful worship experience", but also stated that [...] "some might wonder how a little more variety would sound from such experienced professionals... the band's core sound continues to land in the AC cross hairs". Andrew Greer of CCM Magazine commented that the album [...] "ups the musical ante a bit, with some borderline poetic verses and interesting musical riffs", but also commented that [...] "many of these tracks still suffer from the 'Crowns Cliché Syndrome,' using lyrical Christian-ese to produce trite rhymes that seem hard-pressed to energize a ready-to-worship crowd". Robert Ham of Christianity Today criticized the album for using what he deemed as a repetitive musical formula, but also praised the song [...] "Joyful, Joyful", which he compared to Coldplay's song [...] "Viva la Vida", as well as Megan's Garrett's vocals on [...] "Mercy". He concluded that Until the Whole World Hears [...] "feels like <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>backward</b> creatively". At Cross Rhythms, Tony Cummings rated the album seven out of ten squares, saying [...] "this album is a little disappointing considering some of the glories that preceeded [...] it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Here he, {{like many}} other writers, notes the {{elements}} of musical form (then often described as [...] "closed forms") which characterize the opera and make it appear {{to be something of}} a return to the language of earlier times, [...] "the veritable apotheosis of bel canto with its demands for vocal beauty, agility and range," [...] notes Charles Osborne. Thus, the cantabile-cabaletta two-part arias, the use of the chorus, etc., which Verdi had originally asked Cammarano to ignore, are evident. But Verdi wanted something else: [...] "the freer the forms he presents me with, the better I shall do," [...] he wrote to the librettist's friend in March 1851. It was not what he received from his librettist, but he certainly demonstrated his total mastery over this style. Osborne's take on Il trovatore is that [...] "it is as though Verdi had decided to do something which he had been perfecting over the years, and to do it so beautifully that he need never to do it again. Formally, it is <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>backward</b> after Rigoletto".|$|E

[...] Newman gives three references in her article, one being by Lucis Trust, Bailey's organization, [...] "The Use and Significance of the Great Invocation," [...] which Newman accessed in 2005. [...] A 2017 review of the 2000-word text of this article shows no line to connect Judaism and the door where evil dwells. [...] It says no specific evil is meant, and that Christ came to the Roman Empire in a day of wickedness. [...] Bailey does refer to monotheism in any form as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>backward</b> for humanity, since she believes in an association of divine or quasi-divine Masters.

[...] Fienberg noted the many things lacking in the season from previous Marvel Netflix series, including: [...] "street-level authenticity"; [...] "subtext" [...] as [...] "There's no specificity to Danny's experience other than the most generic of identity crises...and Jones is far too placid a leading man to give any sense of Danny's internal torment," [...] which leads him to come across like [...] "a spoiled frat boy"; and [...] "a worthy adversary to our hero", which added to the [...] "baffling" [...] number of basic character archetypes missing in the season, as there was also [...] "no comic relief or voice of wise authority and well-delivered exposition." [...] He called the season's fights [...] "weakly staged and all-too-brief, without any effort to even pretend that the show's leading man is doing any of his own stunts" [...] and felt [...] "Danny's strength and his enhanced abilities are barely explained and inconsistently depicted." [...] Fienberg also felt of Dawson's appearance, that [...] "after five seasons of four Marvel-Netflix shows, nobody has yet figured out what [...] role in this universe is other than 'continuity'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harald Høffding {{wrote an}} article about him in A brief history of modern {{philosophy}} (1900). Høffding mentioned Kierkegaard in Philosophy of Religion 1906, and the American Journal of Theology (1908) printed an article about Hoffding's Philosophy of Religion. Then Høffding repented of his previous convictions in The problems of philosophy (1913). Høffding was also {{a friend of the}} American philosopher William James, and although James had not read Kierkegaard's works, as they were not yet translated into English, he attended the lectures about Kierkegaard by Høffding and agreed with much of those lectures. James' favorite quote from Kierkegaard came from Høffding: [...] "We live forwards but we understand backwards". William James wrote:"We live forward, we understand backward, said a Danish writer; and to understand life by concepts is to arrest its movement, cutting it up into bits as if with scissors, and, immobilizing these in our logical [...] where, comparing them as dried specimens, we can ascertain which of them statically includes or excludes which other. This treatment supposes life to have already accomplished itself, for the concepts, being so many views taken after the fact, are retrospective and post mortem. Nevertheless, we can draw conclusions from them and project them into the future. We cannot learn from them how life made itself go, or how it will make itself go; but, on the supposition that its ways of making itself go are unchanging, we can calculate what positions of imagined arrest it will exhibit hereafter under given conditions." [...] William James, A Pluralistic Universe, 1909, p. 244 Kierkegaard wrote of moving forward past the irresolute good intention:The yes of the promise is sleep-inducing, but the no, spoken and therefore audible to oneself, is awakening, and repentance is usually not far away. The one who says, [...] "I will, sir," [...] is at the same moment pleased with himself; the one who says no becomes almost afraid of himself. But this difference if very significant in the first moment and very decisive in the next moment; yet if the first moment is the judgment of the momentary, the second moment is the judgment of eternity. This is precisely why the world is so inclined to promises, inasmuch as the world is the momentary, and at the moment a promise looks very good. This is why eternity is suspicious of promises, just as it is suspicious of everything momentary. And so it is also with the one who, rich in good intentions and quick to promise, moves backward further and further away from the good. By means of the intention and the promise, he is facing {{in the direction of the}} good, is turned toward the good but is moving backward further and further away from it. With every renewed intention and promise it looks as if he took a step forward, and yet he is not merely standing still, but he is actually taking <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>backward.</b> The intention taken in vain, the unfulfilled promise, leaves despondency, dejection, that in turn perhaps soon blazes up into an even more vehement intention, which leaves only greater listlessness. Just as the alcoholic continually needs a stronger and stronger stimulant-in order to become intoxicated, likewise the one who has become addicted to promises and good intentions continually needs more and more stimulation-in order to go backward.

40|$|A {{paucity of}} {{research}} explores both {{negative and positive}} changes for family members supporting a loved one with dementia, especially when communication by speech and awareness of others diminishes. This qualitative study sought the views of family groups concerning their experiences over the past 10 years supporting a loved one with dementia. A focus group sought negative and positive subjective interpretations of this phenomenon. One superordinate theme: Synthesis of Meaning emerged from the data using interpretative phenomenological analysis. This overarched two subordinate themes: (<b>a)</b> <b>Steps</b> <b>backward</b> -encompassing those times when relatives hovered uncertainly, missed opportunities to engage due to advancing dementia, and felt regret and (b) Steps forward -encompassing moments of unexpected rewards, acceptance, self-forgiveness, and empathic connection with others on a similar journey. This study highlights that although often fraught with distress, positive aspects of the dementia journey are possible and offer opportunity for psychological growth and well-being...|$|R
