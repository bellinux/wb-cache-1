5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.|$|E
5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Peter goes to {{retrieve}} Meg from her [...] "party" [...] and asks Meg {{to come as}} Lois wants her there. Meg just says it's just a birthday party and asks who would remember if she wasn't there. Peter says that Lois would as she remembers everything and that her best memories are of when Meg and her brothers were born. Peter then has an epiphany, the party is more for Lois than Stewie. Realizing how terrible she has been, Meg agrees {{to come home and}} the cult members agree as well. Peter makes a toast, then looks <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> before he can drink the poisoned punch and Pulls Meg out before she can drink Her's, oblivious {{to the fact that he}} is saving her life in the process while the cult members all die. The Cult Leader chases after them while wearing his ceremonial white robe and is mistaken by Stewie as [...] "The Man in White". Stewie does away with him and, feeling victorious, joins the others to enjoy his party.|$|E

500|$|Douglas {{worked with}} a speech {{instructor}} on breath control {{in order to become}} better acclimatized to the fast rhythm of the film's dialogue. Early on in the shoot, Stone tested Douglas by enhancing his [...] "repressed anger", according to the actor. At one point, Stone came into Douglas' trailer and asked him if he was doing drugs because [...] "you look like you haven't acted before". This shocked Douglas, who did more research and worked on his lines again and again, pushing himself harder than he had before. All of this hard work culminated with the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech. Stone planned to use a Fortune magazine cover in exchange for promotional advertisements, but Forbes magazine made a similar offer. Stone stuck with Fortune, which upset Forbes publisher Malcolm Forbes, who turned down a later request to use his private yacht. Stone switched from 12- to 14-hour shooting days {{in the last few weeks}} in order to finish principal photography before an impending Directors Guild of America strike and finished five days ahead of schedule. Sheen remembered that Stone was always looking at the script and <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
500|$|Stewie and Olivia {{begin to}} bond shortly afterward, {{and the two}} spend their time bonding by sitting in a park while eating ice cream. [...] As they sit and eat their ice cream, they mock various people, such as a man smelling his own hand, a Jewish cowboy, a man who cuts his own hair, and an uptight and hardworking Asian man who is looking <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] They also go to a {{birthday}} party for one of Olivia's friends. [...] Olivia introduces Stewie to her old friend, a child actor named Victor, and she obliges Stewie to get both of them punch, but a jealous Stewie only wishes Victor to go away. The couple begin to argue constantly, and their latest argument ends with them getting married. After the marriage, which Rupert officiates, their relationship does not get any better. Later, the couple decide to accompany Brian on a double-date with his girlfriend, Jillian. During the date, the pair continue to bicker throughout, leading to Stewie starting an argument with {{a person in the}} restaurant who asks him to be quiet. He feels the relationship is failing, but Brian encourages him to reconsider and Stewie agrees to return to Olivia. Returning to his playhouse to apologize and makeup with her, Stewie discovers Olivia [...] "cheating" [...] on him with her friend Victor (although the two are just playing with silly putty). With the relationship over, a seemingly distraught Stewie leaves the playhouse, which he then sets on fire with both Olivia and Victor inside.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E

2500|$|In 1926, at the tea {{interval}} of a match, admirers presented Crockett with a cheque for £1,043 (A$2,086, {{but of course}} worth much more than).

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of April 9, 1968, Raiford dropped off a couple of just-freed A {{students}} and was returning home when he violated the curfew. Raiford, now age 61, said he glanced <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> quietly exited his car, sensing something was not right. Raiford said he attempted to continue stealthily on foot, hoping the darkness of a neighborhood park would protect him.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Matt Millen {{said in a}} radio {{interview}} that he warned former Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis not to draft Russell in 2007. According to Millen, Russell struggled to pay attention during a pre-draft interview in his office {{during a visit to}} Detroit which had the No. 2 pick that year to the point where Millen kicked Russell out after he kept looking down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{guard of}} the train, Mr GE Evans, {{was sitting in}} the rear carriage, looking out of the left window. [...] The force of the crash threw him into the corner of his compartment. [...] He picked himself up after the train stopped, rushed {{to the top of the}} cutting beside the line as a vantage point to see what had happened, then {{returned}} to the carriage and applied the handbrake. [...] He deemed that the time of the accident was 9:48am, after looking <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> displaying 9:50am and allowing two minutes since the time of impact.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{keep talking}} to him, I ask him {{questions}} {{and he looks}} at his watch," [...] Millen said. [...] "I said, 'You got some place you need to be?' And he goes, 'Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Sorry, sir.' So I ask him another question, he looks <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and I said, 'You're done, get out of here." [...] Millen said he then told Russell to go to see head coach Rod Marinelli, who later also told Russell to leave his office. [...] "So I'm done, I can't believe what I just witnessed, and so I call Al," [...] Millen said, [...] "I get on the phone and I say, 'Coach, I don't know what you're thinking, but don't take JaMarcus Russell. Don't take Calvin Johnson, but don't take JaMarcus Russell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fitzmorris adhered {{strictly}} to timetables. When he chaired meetings, he always started exactly {{on time and}} finished accordingly. One of his chamber of commerce associates recalled that Fitzmorris ran committee meetings [...] "railroad-style. When an agenda was scheduled for 9 a.m., he would look at his railroad watch and start the meeting at 9 a.m. sharp (not 9:01) - even if I was the only member who had shown up on time. If the meeting was scheduled for one hour, Jimmy Fitz would look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> again at 10 a.m. sharp and summarily close the meeting, even if a pontificating member was in mid-sentence! When people came in late, he would give them the kind of look that only railroad men give late passengers sprinting after a moving train." ...|$|E

2500|$|Felt {{was unaware}} of {{impending}} eventsas was Harkinsand hurried to Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base for his noon flight. Before leaving, he {{held a press conference}} with Harkins and Đôn while the rebels were rolling into the city. Harkins spoke about the military situation with optimism; {{on the morning of the}} coup, the front page of the Stars and Stripes, a military newspaper, featured a piece with Harkins' sunny outlook, entitled [...] "Viet Victory Near". While Felt and Harkins were talking, the officers were preparing to launch the coup at a lunchtime meeting at military headquarters next to the airport. Thinking of the situation, Đôn kept glancing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> while waiting for Felt to fly out. The three men were standing as they talked, and Đôn, overcome by nerves, chewed his gum [...] "like a threshing machine", and could not stand still, frequently changing his footing as he talked. After Felt left, the runway was closed, and Đôn brushed off Harkins and quickly went away to get ready for the coup.|$|E
2500|$|In the 196667 European Cup, Celtic progressed {{through the}} first two rounds with {{relatively}} comfortable wins against Zurich and Nantes. Celtic then faced Yugoslav side Vojvodina, who Chalmers later described as [...] "the best team we played in the whole tournament". A miss-kick by Tommy Gemmell allowed Vojvodina to score the only goal of the first leg, played in Yugoslavia. In the return game, Celtic drew the aggregate score level with a goal by Chalmers in the 58th minute. Stein was agitated during the game, frequently glancing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> Near the end, he remarked to Sean Fallon that [...] "it looks like bloody Rotterdam!", citing where a play-off match would have been held if the tie had finished level. Instead, McNeill headed in a tie-winning goal from a corner kick during injury time. Celtic then defeated Dukla Prague 31 in the first (home) leg of the semi-final, with Wallace scoring twice. In the return game, Celtic sustained heavy pressure but held out for a goalless draw. It became a common belief that Stein had abandoned his attacking principles for that game, but Bobby Lennox, McNeill and Chalmers all later said that Stein had not set out defensive tactics beforehand.|$|E
