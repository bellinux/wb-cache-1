5|$|In 1938, John Livingood and Glenn T. Seaborg {{discovered}} the radioisotope cobalt-60. This isotope was famously used <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> <b>University</b> in the 1950s to establish parity violation in radioactive beta decay.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Allison {{joined the}} S-1 Section, which coordinated the early {{investigations}} into the feasibility of an atomic bomb. He began building a reactor in the squash courts under the disused stands of Stagg Field. He became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's chemistry section in January 1942, and in March, his small experimental reactor using beryllium came closer to criticality than the graphite-moderated design of Enrico Fermi's group <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> <b>University.</b> During 1942, Compton brought all the research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> <b>University,</b> Princeton University and the University of California together at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago.

5|$|After Oxford, Williams {{spent his}} two-year {{national}} service flying Spitfires in Canada for the Royal Air Force. While on leave in New York, he became close to Shirley Brittain Catlin (born 1930), {{daughter of the}} novelist Vera Brittain and the political scientist George Catlin.

5|$|Climate {{forecasting}} {{is a way}} by {{some scientists}} are using to predict climate change. In 1997 the prediction division of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> <b>University</b> began generating seasonal climate forecasts on a real-time basis. To produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed, including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough validation of each model's accuracy level in simulating interannual climate variability.|$|E
5|$|During World War II Urey {{turned his}} {{knowledge}} of isotope separation {{to the problem of}} uranium enrichment.
