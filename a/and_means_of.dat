In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment.

The political settlement allowed the ARBiH and the HVO to deploy additional troops against the VRS {{in a series of}} small-scale attacks designed to wear down the Bosnian Serb military, but the attacks claimed no territorial gains before October.

According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews to carry out the deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns.

Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, Irene. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo to wherever he wished.|$|E

Humanity's best defense against the Covenant is the SPARTAN Project, super-soldiers in powered armor, but these elite troops are too few to turn the tide of war in the UNSC's favor. Following a Covenant attack on Reach, a planet within UNSC jurisdiction, the Pillar of Autumn flees randomly coming across an ancient installation built by the mysterious Forerunner. The Covenant call this relic Halo, and believe it is a weapon <b>and</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> transcendence. UNSC discover that Halo is in fact a method of containing a parasite known as the Flood, by destroying all sentient life to prevent the Flood from spreading beyond Halo. The SPARTAN Master Chief and his artificial intelligence companion, Cortana, detonate the Pillar of Autumns engines, destroying Halo. Escaping the destruction via a fighter, the Chief and Cortana believe themselves the only survivors of the catastrophe.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Delay in the {{diagnosis}} of tuberculosis {{increases the risk of}} death and enhances the transmission of disease in the community. This study aims to determine the patient and health service delay and factors affecting it in tuberculosis diagnosis. Materials & Methods: A cross-sectional survey that included all the public health centers was conducted in Markazi province from March 2009 till June 2011. Patients were interviewed after diagnosis by using a structured questionnaire. Results: One hundred and sixty-six patients aged between 9 and 87 (median; 66) years were included in the study. They comprised 87 (52. 4 %) females and 79 (47. 6 %) males. The median <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> patient delay was 35 and 62 days, respectively; the median <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> health system diagnosis delay was 34 and 53 days, respectively; the median <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> health system treatment delay was 5 and 6 days, respectively; The median <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> total delays were 86 and 121 days, respectively for all patients. The main determinants of delay were non education, poor economic, private sector, female gender and age≥ 55. Conclusion: The results of this review suggest {{that there is a need}} for revising case-finding strategies and reduction of infectious cases for better control of tuberculosis...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of preoperatively {{administered}} i. v. hypertonic saline on hypotension following induction of general anesthesia. Materials and Methods: Fifty-four patients who scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated to two groups of 27 patients who received hypertonic saline 5 % (2. 3 ml/kg) or received normal saline (13 ml/kg). Infusion of hypertonic saline was done half an hour before induction of anesthesia during 30 minutes. Anesthesia was conducted in a standard protocol for all patients. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR) <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> arterial pressure (MAP) were assessed in all patients. Results: The <b>mean</b> age <b>of</b> patients was 36. 68 ± 10. 8 years. Forty percent of patients were male. The mean SBP at min 2 <b>and</b> min 5, <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> DBP at min 2, 5, <b>and</b> 15, <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> HR at all time points <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> MAP at min 2 and 15 between groups were no significantly different (P > 0. 05), but <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> SBP at min 10 <b>and</b> 15, <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> DBP at min 10, <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> MAP at min 5 and 10 in hypertonic saline group was significantly more than the normal group (P 0. 05). Conclusions: Infusion of hypertonic saline 5 % (2. 3 mg/kg) before the general anesthesia led to a useful reduction in MAP and reduced heart rate, with no episodes of severe hypotension...|$|R
