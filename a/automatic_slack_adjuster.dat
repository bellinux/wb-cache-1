40|$|NIOSH {{recommends}} that all fire departments operating fire apparatus equipped with automatic slack adjusters (ASAs) immediately take the following actions {{to reduce the}} risk of fire fighters being injured in an apparatus crash due to brake failure: 1. Ensure that ASAs are not manually adjusted. 2. Establish procedures to ensure maintenance on fire apparatus is conducted as recommended in NFPA 1911 Standard for the Inspection, Maintenance, Testing, and Retirement of In-Service Automotive Fire Apparatus. 3. Ensure maintenance is only performed by qualified technicians who meet NFPA 1071 Standard for Emergency Vehicle Technician Professional Qualifications. An <b>automatic</b> <b>slack</b> <b>adjuster</b> is a mechanical component of the air brake system that adjust brakes as necessary when the vehicle is in operation to compensate for wear in the brake shoes (drum brakes) or pads (disc brakes). When an ASA is found to be out of adjustment, it signifies the existence of a larger braking system problem that needs correction. Manual adjustment of ASAs should only be done by qualified technicians during installation or when absolutely necessary to move the apparatus to a repair facility (NTSB 2006, 2007; IAFC 2006). In 2006, the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) warned the fire service of this potential problem (IAFC 2006) following an investigative report released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB 2006). While conducting an investigation of a recent apparatus crash-related fire fighter fatality, NIOSH learned that fire departments may not fully appreciate the hazards related to manual adjustment of ASAs. NIOSH would like to renew efforts to bring this to the attention of all U. S. fire departments, fire fighters, and fleet maintenance departments who are tasked with preventive maintenance or operation of apparatus equipped with ASAs. The manual adjustment of ASAs may contribute to unexpected brake failure on fire apparatus. When an ASA is found to be out of adjustment it signifies the existence of a larger problem with the braking system that needs to be corrected immediately. Vehicles found to have ASAs that are out of adjustment should be taken out-of-service immediately until corrective brake service is completed. Fire Departments should ensure that all technicians conducting brake service on fire department apparatus: (1) are certified in air brake repair to the level (T- 4) required by the Automotive Service Excellence Medium/Heavy Duty Truck Technician Certification and (2) have, at a minimum, Level 1 Fire Apparatus Technician Certification as certified by the Emergency Vehicle Technician Certification Commission. Additionally, fire departments should adhere to manufacturer guidelines and recommendations and applicable federal, state or provincial, and local laws regarding apparatus inspection and maintenance [NFPA 1911]. Further, the NTSB has recommended, and NIOSH agrees, that all drivers of fire apparatus equipped with air brakes must undergo training and testing to demonstrate proficiency in the inspection and operation of air-braked vehicles. Such training should emphasize that manual adjustment of automatic slack adjusters is dangerous and should not be done, except during installation, or in an emergency situation when it is absolutely necessary to move the vehicle to a repair facility.

50|$|In a truck’s {{air brake}} system, relay valves get a signal when a driver presses the treadle, which then opens the valve and allows air {{to enter the}} brake chamber via air inlet. The {{diaphragm}} gets pushed, then the rod, then the <b>slack</b> <b>adjuster</b> which twists to turn the brake camshaft.

40|$|Stereoscopic {{tracking}} {{technology has}} been developed for simultaneous tracking of numerous markers including particles and dots in three-dimensional space. It can offer an unprecedented capability for measuring three-dimensional (3 -D) velocities in a fluid flow and displacement/deformation of a solid object. For fluid motion measurement, the flow can be seeded with small particles. For surface motion, the surface can be marked with dots while for deformation of a transparent object, it can be embedded with particles. In our effort for implementing the stereoscopic tracking technology, we employ neural networks for particle image overlap decomposition and simultaneous stereoscopic tracking of several thousands markers with high-resolution high-speed solid state cameras. One of the successful application examples is the measurement of parachute aerodynamics, for which the technique is termed stereoscopic tracking velocimetry (STV). By seeding the measurement volume with neutrally-buoyant helium soap bubbles as velocity markers, the parachute flow field can be visualized. The testing with a medium-scale model is conducted with high-speed high-resolution cameras. It is not feasible to provide a 3 -D flow field of known velocity for assessing accuracy in 3 -D flow measurement. For measurement accuracy and performance estimation, known velocity fields and corresponding stereoscopic particle images are thus obtained through 3 -D numerical simulation of the aerodynamics flow around a parachute. Another successful application example is the deformation measurement of the brake system component of a heavy-duty truck, that is, <b>slack</b> <b>adjuster.</b> For the reliability evaluation of the measurement technology, numerical calculation for the stress analysis has been also performed for cross examination.

40|$|Abstract — Reducing energy {{consumption}} {{has become a}} pressing issue in cluster computing systems not only for minimizing electricity cost, but also for improving system reliability. Therefore, it is highly desirable to design energy-efficient scheduling algorithms for applications running on clusters. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} non-preemptively scheduling mixed tasks on power-aware clusters. We developed an algorithm called Power Aware Slack Scheduler (PASS) for tasks with different priorities and deadlines. PASS attempts to minimize {{energy consumption}} in addition to maximizing the number of tasks completed before their deadlines. To achieve this goal, high-priority tasks are scheduled first in order to meet their deadlines. Moreover, PASS explores slacks into which lowpriority tasks can be inserted so that their deadlines can be guaranteed. The dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) technique is used to reduce energy consumption by exploiting available <b>slacks</b> and <b>adjusting</b> appropriate voltage levels accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with a well-known energyefficient algorithm- CC-EDF, PASS saves up to 60 percent of energy dissipation. With respect to the number of high-priority tasks meeting deadlines, PASS outperforms the existing approach by over 10 percent without degrading the overall performance. PASS successfully schedules tasks with hard deadlines in a mix of tasks with soft deadlines. In doing so, PASS embraces a new feature that allows clusters to support a variety of real-time applications, making clusters amenable for commercialization. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new error control {{approach}} for continuous media communication protocols. Since continuous media data are inherently bursty, these protocols commonly use a control time for the first packet in a burst to ensure continuous playback {{in the presence of}} delay jitter. The retransmission scheme presented in this paper, which is called <b>Slack</b> <b>Automatic</b> Repeat Request (S-ARQ), is based on appropriately extending the control time for the first packet in a burst to allow for the timely retransmission of lost packets, i. e., before the lost packet is due for playback. We present simulation results that demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this retransmission scheme under a realistic scenario for an FDDI network. 1. Introduction Digital multimedia applications are demanding network services that respect real-time constraints. In particular, distributing continuous media streams (e. g., digital audio or video) across an asynchronous network for playback a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} energy {{management}} techniques for distributed {{systems such as}} hand-held mobile devices, sensor nodes, and data center servers. One of the major design problems in multiple application domains is the mismatch between workloads and resources. Sub-optimal assignment of workloads to resources can cause underloaded or overloaded resources, resulting in performance degradation or energy waste. This work specifically focuses on the heterogeneity in system hardware components and workloads. It includes energy management solutions for unregulated or batteryless embedded systems; and data center servers with heterogeneous workloads, machines, and processor wear states. This thesis describes four major contributions: (1) This thesis describes a battery test and energy delivery system design process to maintain battery life in embedded systems without voltage regulators. (2) In battery-less sensor nodes, this thesis demonstrates a routing protocol to maintain reliable transmission through the sensor network. (3) This thesis has characterized typical workloads and developed two models to capture the heterogeneity of data center tasks and machines: a task performance model and a machine resource utilization model. These models allow users to predict task finish time on individual machines. It then integrates these two models into a task scheduler based on the Hadoop framework for MapReduce tasks, and uses this scheduler for server energy minimization using task concentration. (4) In addition to saving server energy consumption, this thesis describes a method of reducing data center cooling energy by maintaining optimal server processor temperature setpoints through a task assignment algorithm. This algorithm considers the reliability impact of processor wear states. It records processor wear states through <b>automatic</b> timing <b>slack</b> tests on a cluster of machines with varying core temperatures, voltages, and frequencies. These optimal temperature setpoints are used in a task scheduling algorithm that saves both server and cooling energy...|$|R
