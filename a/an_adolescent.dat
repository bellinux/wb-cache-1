40|$|A {{number of}} {{environmental}} factors can influence <b>an</b> <b>adolescent’s</b> risk for drinking, including parenting styles, <b>an</b> <b>adolescent’s</b> choice of peer groups, and even whether {{he or she}} is active in after-school activities.

It is difficult to establish the degree to which alcohol use is influenced by environmental factors. This article describes some of the environmental influences that may increase the risk for underage drinking.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic pain {{negatively}} affects <b>an</b> <b>adolescent’s</b> life; however, {{little is}} known about the social impact of chronic pain for adolescents. More is known about the general peer relationships of adolescents with chronic pain than their close friendships. Close friendships begin to take on more importance during adolescence as these relationships facilitate the development of <b>an</b> <b>adolescent’s</b> sense of personal identity and increasing independence from family influences. Thus, chronic pain may create friendship challenges for adolescents beyond those typically experienced during this developmental trajectory, which may negatively impact their abilities to secure social support...|$|R

5|$|Burial 48 {{was carved}} from the bedrock under the terrace, upon the central north-south {{axis of the}} North Acopolis {{directly}} under Temple 33; it {{has been identified as}} the tomb of king Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The remains of the king were flanked those of two juvenile human sacrifices; one of these was a child and one was <b>an</b> <b>adolescent.</b> The walls of the tomb were coated in stucco, onto which were painted hieroglyphs indicating that the tomb was sealed in March 457, a year after the king had died. The king was interred bundled in a seated position and his remains lacked the skull, hands, and femurs. Grave goods included 27 ceramic vessels of mixed of local and imported origin, stone and shell artefacts including a well-used stone metate and accompanying handstone, a large quantity of jade artefacts, including jade discs and hundreds of beads that once formed a semicircular collar, two pairs of earspools and a great many more beads in small groups that did not form a part of the collar. Two obsidian blades also accompanied the burial.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo (4 March 1901 or 1903– 22 June 1937), born Joseph-Casimir Rabearivelo, {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be Africa's first modern poet and the greatest literary artist of Madagascar. Part {{of the first generation}} raised under French colonization, Rabearivelo grew up impoverished and failed to complete secondary education. His passion for French literature and traditional Malagasy poetry prompted him to read extensively and educate himself on a variety of subjects, including the French language and its poetic and prose traditions. He published his first poems as <b>an</b> <b>adolescent</b> in local literary reviews, soon obtaining employment at a publishing house where he worked as a proofreader and editor of its literary journals. He published numerous poetry anthologies in French and Malagasy, as well as literary critiques, an opera, and two novels.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn {{probably}} {{made his first}} public concert appearance {{at the age of}} nine, when he participated in a chamber music concert accompanying a horn duo. He was also a prolific composer from an early age. As <b>an</b> <b>adolescent,</b> his works were often performed at home with a private orchestra for the associates of his wealthy parents amongst the intellectual elite of Berlin. Between the ages of 12 and 14, Mendelssohn wrote 12 string symphonies for such concerts, and a number of chamber works. He wrote his first published work, a piano quartet, {{by the time he was}} 13. It was probably Abraham Mendelssohn who procured the publication of Mendelssohn's early piano quartet by the house of Schlesinger. In 1824, the 15-year-old wrote his first symphony for full orchestra (in C minor, Op.11).|$|E

40|$|This paper extends Brock and Durlauf’s {{models on}} binary choice with social interactions. In the {{extended}} model, an individual will form expected behaviors of peers {{taking into account}} their characteristics. The expected behaviors of peers in a group are heterogeneous. The expectations of peers are determined as rational expectations. We consider models in both group and network settings. Endogenous interaction, contextual and correlated effects are identifiable. Conditions under which an unique equilibrium exits are presented. In the group setting, multiple equilibria can be characterized by an aggregate scalar index. As an empirical application, <b>an</b> <b>adolescent’s</b> smoking behavior is studied. The results show there exists significant endogenous peer effect, and many contextual variables are significant in influencing <b>an</b> <b>adolescent’s</b> smoking behavior...|$|R

Saying that he has left the Outsiders, Kovu asks Simba to let him join his pride. Simba reluctantly accepts, but distrusts Kovu because of his similarities to Scar, and continues to treat him ruthlessly. That night, Simba has a nightmare about attempting to save his father Mufasa from falling into the stampede but is stopped by Scar who turns into Kovu and throws Simba off the cliff into the stampede.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{was among}} several authors {{who wrote about}} Florida {{following}} the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used <b>an</b> <b>adolescent</b> narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something {{that may have been}} allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.|$|E
5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as <b>an</b> <b>adolescent</b> or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by the strangers, the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a world full of anachronistic high-technology, interspersed in a pre-industrialized, agrarian culture.|$|E
