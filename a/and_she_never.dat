5|$|Solanas {{said that}} she {{regularly}} suffered sexual abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun. Because of her rebellious behavior, her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor.

However, her time in the band was short due to her contracting mononucleosis, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> recorded or performed live with the Germs. According to Pat Smear, upon quitting, she introduced her friend, Donna Rhia, who became her replacement.

She studied vocal techniques in Cuba, where she made her debut in 1929 as a lyrical singer in the Company of Maestro Ernesto Lecuona. Maruja González performed in several theaters of Havana before going on a tour through the United States and upon her return to Havana she sang La Bayadere and the Merry Widow in the same city. At the beginning of the 30s, she signed a number of contracts in Latin America and in Spain. She married Perico Suarez.

25|$|When Damala left, {{she took}} on a new leading man and lover, the poet and playwright Jean Richepin, who {{accompanied}} her on a quick tour of European cities to help pay off her debts. She renewed her relationship with the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII. When they returned to Paris, Bernhardt leased the theater of Porte Saint-Martin and starred in a new play by Richepin, Nana-Sahib, a costume drama about love in British India in 1857. The play and Richepin's acting were poor, and it quickly closed. Richepin then wrote an adaptation of Macbeth in French, with Bernhardt as Lady Macbeth, {{but it was also}} a failure. The only person who praised the play was Oscar Wilde, who was then living in Paris. He began writing a play, Salomé, in French, especially for Bernhardt, though it was quickly banned by British censors <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> performed it.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Robinson {{caused a}} stir in the Harlem {{community}} by choosing a white dancer, Geneva Sawyer, as his dance partner over Jeni Le Gon in the Twentieth Century Fox film Café Metropole (1937). LeGon had danced with him in Hooray for Love (1935) and had received favorable reviews. Sawyer had been Shirley Temple's dance coach during the time Temple and Robinson made movies together, and Sawyer had taken tap lessons from Robinson while he was teaching Temple and choreographing her routines. Robinson suggested to the producers that Sawyer could be cast as his partner if she wore blackface. Le Gon's career suffered as a result, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> worked with Robinson again. Ironically, although the scene was shot with Sawyer in blackface, the studio became convinced that a mixed-race adult couple dancing together would be too controversial: both scenes with Robinson were cut from {{the final version of}} the movie and the deleted scenes were only released in 2008 as part of a Fox DVD boxed set of Tyrone Power movies.|$|E

In the second match of the season, she took 3/18 to help secure a ten-run win over the defending champions New South Wales, and later made an unbeaten 92 in a 132-run win over Western Australia, more than doubling her previous best score in the WNCL. She took 2/18 from ten overs in the final match of the season against Victoria, helping to secure a 38-run win. South Australia won five of their eight matches and did not make the final, but Nitschke scored 190 runs at 27.14 and took seven wickets at 16.57 with an economy rate of 2.57. In 2003–04, Nitschke made 136 runs at 27.20 and took six wickets at 35.66 at an economy rate of 3.24 in a consistent but unspectactular WNCL season; her two best scores of 36 and 35, both unbeaten, came in two wins against Western Australia, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> took more than one wicket per match.

Peter is subsequently unemployed and the family begins to fall into debt. After Peter fails to find any good jobs, Lois turns to her father Carter for assistance. Carter agrees to employ Peter as a servant on his estate, and the Griffins move into a settlement of other Mexican immigrants near Carter's mansion. Of course, working as a servant proves gruelling for Peter, who begins to empathize with the immigrants. He forms a friendship with them and they invite him to a party, however, Carter crashes the party by reminding him of American regulations. Peter is outraged and rallies up the immigrants to form a rebellion. Carter decides to negotiate with Peter, saying he will arrange for Peter to gain American citizenship if he calls off the rebellion. Peter demands that everyone must gain citizenship, but the others insist that he take this opportunity, saying that their day will come someday. Peter agrees, and from this point onward Peter becomes an official American citizen; the family moves back to their house and Peter regains his job.|$|E
25|$|As a result, all Brenda's friends {{apologized for}} their {{behavior}} towards her. During the fourth season, Brenda {{is interested in}} the drama department but it also led to problems: she spoiled her first audition and then went to the director of the play to try again and convince him. She then got the role, but a student made a rumor saying that she had slept to have the role. Unfortunately, this student was the girlfriend of Steve Sanders and the latter believed the rumors, others refusing more or less to believe the denials of Brenda. Steve understood his mistake when the student asked him to attack Brenda to make her miss rehearsals. A little later, Steve's friend tried to commit suicide, but Brenda and Steve joined forces to save her and Steve was finally compensated by following Brenda's debut on stage. The director's praise led her to accept the latter at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) in London for a year. After Kelly and Dylan last broke up, Brenda finally learned that a relationship was possible between Kelly and Brandon and expressed her blessing. She later spent her last night with Dylan, telling her she would not be gone forever. The couple will reconcile briefly in the final scene of the fourth season, though (because of Shannen Doherty's departure) Brenda's character was removed from the script <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> returned to Beverly Hills.|$|E
