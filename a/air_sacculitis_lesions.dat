40|$|This {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} was designed to confirm the association between Congo red binding Escherichia coli (CREC) and E. coli <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis</b> in commercial broilers. It was also designed to evaluate CREC as an <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis</b> risk factor and to explore the CREC relationship to other <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis</b> risk factors (poultry house temperature, air-ammonia levels, and presence of other diseases). In addition, this study was used to assess a possible role of the broiler-breeder flocks and hatchers in the spread of CREC <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis.</b> Congo red E. coli-associated airsacculitis risk was based on CREC exposure of the chicks in the hatchers. Breeder flocks with greater than 30 CREC colonies/plate from hatcher air sampling tests were placed in the high risk group; flocks with less than five CREC colonies/plate were placed in the low risk group. Increased risks of death due to <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis</b> (RR = 2. 26), and increased death rates due to CREC <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis</b> (RR = 9. 45) in high-risk flocks, identified CREC as an important <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis</b> risk factor. The attributable risk percent of CREC airsacculitis from hatcher exposure of CREC was 89. 4 %, pointing to the hatcher as the source of CREC infection. The association of specific broiler-breeder flocks to high levels of CREC in the hatchers, and subsequent <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis,</b> suggests that the broiler-breeders are the ultimate source of CREC...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Five {{independent}} {{episodes of}} ochratoxicosis in about 970, 000 turkeys, two episodes in about 70, 000 laying hens, and two episodes in about 12, 000, 000 broiler chickens were in-vestigated. Ochratoxin A concentrations in suspect feed and ingredients ranged from <. 2 to 16 ppm. Feed samples tested for T- 2 toxin, F- 2 toxin, heavy metals, and polychlorinated biphenyls were negative. Minor amounts of aflatoxin (< 60 ppb) {{were found in}} suspect feed from two epi-sodes. The main symptoms in turkeys were mortality (up to 59 %), nephrotoxicity (pale, swollen kidneys that became tan colored in the sequel to acute toxicity), decreased feed consumption (as little as 20 % of the normal feed intake) prior to death, and secondary <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis.</b> Histopathol-ogy revealed edema and necrosis of the proximal tubules of the kidneys and no changes in the liver or other organs. Suspect feed containing 2 ppm ochratoxin A increased uric acid levels in serum when fed to poults in the laboratory. The episodes in laying hens were characterized by reduced egg production, poor egg shell quality, and nephropathy. The episodes in broiler chickens were characterized by poor growth rate, poor feed conversion efficiency, poor pigmentation, nephro-pathy, and increased incidence of <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis.</b> Obtaining feed and ingredients free of ochratoxin, cleaning the feed and ingredient handling equipment, and adding antifungal agents to the fee...|$|R

40|$|The {{syndrome}} {{known as}} Gastric Dilation <b>Air</b> <b>Sacculitis</b> (GDAS) {{has recently been}} described by Lumsden et al. (2002) for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Walbaum), in seawater (SW) culture in New Zealand. The syndrome is characterised by distended abdomens, gastric dilation and <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis,</b> increased feed conversion ratios (FCR) and mortality. Consequently, financial returns on affected stocks are greatly reduced. A study into the epidemiology and physiology of the syndrome was initiated, working with the major aquaculture company, The New Zealand King Salmon Company (NZKS). The study revealed causative factors of GDAS. GDAS was experimentally induced only in saltwater by feeding a commercially manufactured low-cohesion pelleted diet. Control groups were fed a different diet with high physical cohesion. Low-cohesion pellets have previously been associated with {{a high incidence of}} GDAS in commercial sea cages. These data implicated osmoregulatory stress and physical properties of the feed in GDAS development. In addition, gastrointestinal (GI) physiology in GDAS -affected and -control fish was characterised. The process of GDAS development in O. tshawytscha is characterised by a loss of smooth muscle tone of the stomach as it distends. Laplace's law (P= 2 T/r, where P is the distending pressure, T is the tension in the wall and r is the radius of the cylinder) predicts that unless muscle mass increases, the ability of the stomach wall to contract will be lost and consequently a loss of GI motor function will result. Therefore, GI circular smooth muscle integrity in terms of (1) stimulated and maximal contractility, (2) osmoregulatory ability of the intestine and the (3) control of the GI system was studied in pathologically affected (+ve) and unaffected (-ve) smolt. Affected fish showed changes in GI circular smooth muscle function and osmoregulatory dysfunction. Feeding different diets induced distinct gastric evacuation patterns. The intestinal brake hypothesis is presented and argued to be the probable mechanism for GDAS development. GDAS (+ve) serum showed the presence of factors capable of contracting gut smooth muscle. In addition, potential humoral mediators of the intestinal brake in fish were investigated...|$|R

40|$|Chronic upper {{respiratory}} tract diseases are severe problems in captive orangutans (Pongo abelii, P. pygmaeus), but the etiology and pathogenesis are unknown. This study recorded the prevalence of such diseases in captive European orangutans (201 animals; 20 zoos) and investigated possible predisposing factors. Bornean orangutans (P. pygmaeus) showed chronic respiratory signs (13. 8 % of all animals) significantly more often than Sumatran (P. abelii; 3. 6 %), and male animals more often (15. 8 %) than females (3. 9 %). Hand-reared animals developed more <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis</b> (21 %) than parent-reared animals (5 %). Diseased animals were more often genetically related to animals with respiratory diseases (93 %) than to healthy animals (54 %).

40|$|Poultry have a {{very limited}} number of {{resident}} macrophages in the normal steady-state respiratory tract. Thus, poultry must rely heavily on active migration of phagocytic cells to the lungs and air sacs in defending against respiratory pathogens. Intratracheal administration of a live, apathogenic Pasteurella multocida vaccine (Choloral; Clemson University strain) {{increased the number of}} avian respiratory phagocytes (ARP; obtained by lavage of lungs and air sacs) within 24 h by 3 orders of magnitude compared with the number of ARP obtained from mock-inoculated controls and from nonreacting chickens. Chickens yielding a high number of ARP did not show any sign of respiratory disease. Flow cytometric analysis of ARP that were exposed to 20 nonopsonized fluorescent microspheres per ARP for 30 min at 37 degrees C demonstrated a fivefold increase in the percentage of actively phagocytic cells in the ARP populations of stimulated chickens compared with the percentage of phagocytic ARP for mock-inoculated control birds. The phagocytic capacity (relative number of engulfed microspheres) of ARP from stimulated birds doubled during the same time. The flow cytometric observations were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. These results indicate that activation by avirulent replicating agents of phagocytic cells of chicken to migrate to the respiratory tract may be a means of defending poultry against <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis</b> and pneumonia...|$|R

Of the 17 species of birds examined, 25 of 31 (80. 6 %) peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) from Calabria Region and a single northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) from Campania Region were infected with S. tendo, suggesting a strong host speciﬁcity for the peregrine falcon. The northern goshawk and 18 of 25 infected peregrine falcons showed cachexia and all infected birds had bone fractures.

40|$|The {{syndrome}} {{known as}} gastric dilation <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis</b> (GDAS) {{has previously been}} shown to affect Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in seawater (SW) aquaculture. Feed and osmoregulatory stress have been implicated as potential epidemiological co-factors. The development and physiology of GDAS was investigated in SW and freshwater (FW) adapted smolts. Diet A (low-cohesion pellets) and diet B (high-cohesion pellets) were fed to both FW- and SW-adapted fish. GDAS was induced only in the SW trial on feeding diet A. Stimulated gastro-intestinal (GI) smooth muscle contractility, and fluid transport by the pyloric caeca were different in GDAS-affected fish, which also showed osmoregulatory dysfunction. Cardiac stomach (CS) smooth muscle contractility in response to acetylcholine and potassium chloride (KCl) was significantly reduced in fish fed diet A relative to controls from weeks 3 – 5. In contrast, maximal pyloric sphincter (PS) circular smooth muscle contraction in response to KCl was significantly elevated in fish fed diet A in weeks 4 and 5. Serum osmolality was elevated in GDAS-affected fish from week 2 of the SW trial. Fluid transport from the mucosal to serosal surface of isolated pyloric caeca was significantly reduced in weeks 3, 4 and 5 in SW fish fed diet A.

40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the clinical, pathological and bacteriological aspects of five poultry farms at Ismailia province(Egypt) suffering from respiratory symptoms accompanied with enteritis. Post-mortem findings suggested septicemia. Bacteriological examination revealed the isolation of E. coli (60 % & 40 %), Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT, 26. 6 % & 20 %) and E. coli concomitant with Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (18. 6 % & 12 %) in broilers and layers chickens respectively. The eighty-five E. coli isolates were serotyped as follow: seventy were identified to six different serotypes, O 78, O 26, O 1, O 2, O 157 and O 111, with different frequencies. The results of the biological properties of the E. coli isolates revealed that all E. coli isolates bind Congo red (100). β-hemolysin was observed in 48 isolates (56. 47 %) and enterotoxins assays revealed that two E. coli strains recovered from birds were O 26 (22. 86 %) and O 157 (5. 71 %), while invasiveness assay revealed negative results. The in vitro Antimicrobial resistance patterns of the isolates were reported. Experimental infections of ORT were examined and scored weekly.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{description of}} the number, location and relative position of the air sacs and their diverticula in the ostrich is essential for {{a better understanding of}} the pathogenesis of <b>air</b> <b>sacculitis</b> in this bird. The air sacs were studied in ten ostriches of varying ages by latex or silicone casting of the respiratory tract and dissection. Results revealed that the air sacs of the ostrich conform to the general pattern in birds. Cervical, lateral and medial clavicular, cranial and caudal thoracic, and abdominal air sacs are present. The left and right medial clavicular air sacs fuse with each other ventrally to the trachea to form a single, median compartment. A unique, large gastric diverticulum which covers the caudal aspects of the proventriculus and gizzard originates from the median compartment of the clavicular air sac. The lateral clavicular air sacs and their diverticula are similar to those of other bird species, with the exception that humeral diverticula are absent. Both abdominal air sacs are relatively small, with the left sac being the larger. Perirenal and femoral diverticula, similar to those found in other bird species, are present. However, the entire femur is aerated by the femoral diverticulum which also forms a large, subcutaneous division caudally and caudo-Iaterally to the femur. The presence of this subcutaneous part has practical implications for injury and intramuscular injections. The number and location of ostia connecting the air sacs to the bronchial tree are generally similar to those reported in other bird species.

Bordetella avium was isolated from trachea and primary bronchi of all BA+ turkeys, but was never isolated from lung parenchyma. Acute purulent bronchitis associated with B. avium colonization of the primary bronchi subsided by 3 weeks postinoculation.

40|$|Partially-eviscerated (also {{described}} as effilé, effileé, roped, partly eviscerated, partially drawn, wire drawn or Boston drawn) poultry {{are produced by}} removing the intestines from the poultry carcass but leaving the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, crop, proventriculus and gizzard inside the body cavity (as defined in Regulation (EC) 543 / 2008). Regulation (EC) 853 / 2004 allows production of partially-eviscerated poultry, provided it is authorised by the competent authority. The overall aim of this project was {{to carry out a}} risk assessment of partially-eviscerated (effilé) poultry production (poultry with the heart, liver, kidneys, crop, proventriculus and gizzard left inside the body cavity) with a view to considering whether the risks of partially-eviscerated poultry production can be managed to an acceptable level such that the practice could be authorised in the UK. To achieve this aim the project had four Objectives: Objective 1, an initial risk assessment of the public health implications of allowing partially-eviscerated birds into the food chain together with a review of all relevant and appropriate literature/company information relating to the control of partially-eviscerated poultry production; Objective 2, an industrial survey of current production of partially-eviscerated poultry; Objective 3, a series of short practical evaluations of any processes where further data was required; Objective 4, a full analysis of all the data and findings of Objectives 1 to 3 and the production of the final project report. The literature review found that documentation on the production of partially-eviscerated poultry was scarce and not comprehensive. However, it highlighted the important points for risk assessment and identified a reason for the development of partial-evisceration processing, i. e. the prevention of “greening” during storage due to the removal of the intestines. The review of current post-mortem inspection of poultry concluded that of the twenty one conditions that are currently looked for during post-mortem inspection of poultry, the majority of these conditions do not pose a risk to public health. Seven conditions were considered to be of concern to public health (Ascites/oedema, Cellulitis, Contamination, Hepatitis, Pericarditis, Perihepatitis/peritonitis, Respiratory disease (airsacculitis)). It was concluded that only four of those seven conditions (hepatitis, pericarditis, perihepatitis/peritonitis, and respiratory disease (<b>air</b> <b>sacculitis))</b> may not be identified during post-mortem inspection of partially-eviscerated poultry. Their public health significance was considered to be as indicators of the presence of enteric microbial pathogens rather than any inherent pathology of the conditions. Data on condemnations show that the rates of condemnations for these conditions are very low. In addition, these conditions should be clearly identifiable by the end user of the poultry during preparation of the carcass for cooking. Therefore, in our opinion, {{it is unlikely that the}} consumer would ingest such infected viscera. Four French plants and two UK plants were visited during the industrial survey. Although there was a commonality in the practices employed at all of the plants, differences were found between the plants, particularly in the specific method used to remove the intestines from the carcasses in order to produce the product. Four main methods have been identified that can be used to partially eviscerate poultry, three are manual, one is mechanical. The only UK plant currently producing partially-eviscerated poultry, skinned the whole carcass with its feathers on. Partially-eviscerated (effilé) poultry report 3 of 166 Due to the lack of data on the microbiological quality of partially-eviscerated poultry a series of short targeted experimental evaluations were carried out to: (1) investigate the difference in chilling time between partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses; (2) investigate any difference between the growth of microorganisms on partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses during chilled storage; (3) investigate the growth of microorganisms in the organs of partially-eviscerated broiler carcasses during chilled storage. These studies showed: (1) due to the presence of warm internal organs partially-eviscerated poultry carcasses are warmer than eviscerated carcasses at the start of chilling and the rate of cooling of partially-eviscerated poultry carcasses is slower than that of similar eviscerated carcasses; (2) there was no significant difference between the microbiological quality of partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses after chilling and during chilled storage; (3) ACC, Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, coliform and Escherichia coli counts were all shown to be capable of increasing in/on the heart, crop, feet, gizzard, cavity, skin and liver of partially-eviscerated broiler carcasses after chilling and during chilled storage. A critical review of all available relevant and appropriate literature and data was carried out, supplemented by a survey of current industrial practice and a practical evaluation of processes, to form a risk assessment of the public health implications of allowing partially-eviscerated birds into the food chain. This risk assessment considered: 1. What abnormalities may not be identified in partially-eviscerated poultry production when compared to traditional poultry production; 2. Whether the risk of zoonotic pathogens are any greater for partially-eviscerated poultry production when compared to traditional poultry production; 3. The aetiology of those conditions; 4. The public health implications of those conditions and of allowing partially-eviscerated poultry into the food supply...|$|R
