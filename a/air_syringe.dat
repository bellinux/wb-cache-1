40|$|During {{the past}} 150  years, {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{has been described}} as a rare complication in dentistry, the etiology of which might be maneuvers performed by the patient (eg, sneezing while the mouth is closed, blowing the nose) or the dental professional through the use of specific dental instruments (eg, dental drill, <b>air</b> <b>syringe,</b> etc). Irrespective of etiology, air is forced through the soft tissues, thus producing rapid swelling of the area.

30|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{an uncommon}} clinical complication of dental treatment {{caused by the}} forceful injection of air into the loose surrounding connective tissue. According to a review of 75 reported cases from 1960 to 1993 [11], emphysematous complications were caused most frequently {{by the use of}} high-speed hand pieces (n[*]=[*] 42) and <b>air</b> <b>syringes</b> (n[*]=[*] 27). Only one case of implant cleaning-related emphysema was included in that case series. Centripetal air dissection with retropharyngeal and mediastinal emphysema has occurred in many patients, especially following extractions [11]. A subsequent case review (1994 – 2008) involving 47 cases of subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum following dental treatment reported that air-syringe comprised 15 % (7 cases) of the total; however, the main cause was the use of a high-speed air turbine hand piece in 31 patients (66 %) [12]. Another case review reported that 16 of 32 cases (50 %) of iatrogenic subcutaneous emphysema were related to the use of air-driven hand pieces [8]. The development of pneumomediastinum after the use of air-polishing devices using abrasive powder for peri-implantitis is very rare. To our knowledge, the present report is the first to describe extensive subcutaneous emphysema accompanying pneumomediastinum after peri-implantitis treatment using an air-abrasive device.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Aim : To {{compare the}} {{retention}} of glass ionomer cement (GIC) used as fissure sealant with a resinbased sealant. Methods: Six- to nine-year-old children (n= 96) with all permanent first molars in occlusion were examined and assigned to two groups: GIC sealant or resin-based sealant. The sealants were applied according to the manufacturers' recommendations. The assessment of sealant retention was performed at two-month interval sessions (n= 6), when each sample was scored according to the following criteria: complete retention, partial retention or complete loss. The visual and tactile examinations were carried out with a WHO probe, mouth mirror, <b>air</b> <b>syringe</b> and artificial light. The data were submitted to descriptive statistics and survival analysis. Results: A total of 384 occlusal surfaces were analyzed.

30|$|The {{protocol}} for GCF collections involved gentle removal of visible plaque at both sites followed by washing and drying the premolar regions using <b>air</b> <b>syringe</b> to avoid contaminating the paper strip (Periopaper, Harco, Tustin, CA, USA) by the plaque. Then, paper strips were inserted for 1  mm into the gingival crevice and left there for 30  seconds. Periotron 8000 (Periotron 8000, Oraflow Inc., New York, USA) {{was used to}} measure the volume of GCF in each paper strip. Microcentrifugee tubes containing paper strips were thawed, and GCF was eluted from the paper strips using 50  μL of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma, St Louis, USA) and 0.05 % (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma, St Louis, USA).

40|$|Subcutaneous emphysema, {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} in dental practice. It is usually benign and self-limiting; nevertheless, severe consequences can result from surgical treatment. Emphysema occurs when air is injected into the subcutaneous layer of the tissue, this may come from either an air turbine handpiece or <b>air</b> <b>syringe.</b> Due to the danger of developing emphysema, procedures using compressed air are not recommended in dental extractions involving the raising of a skin flap, bone sectioning or exeresis. Two determining factors are always involved with subcutaneous emphysema. On the one hand, a compressed air procedure (air turbine handpiece, air-water syringe), and on the other, a communication between the oral cavity and deeper tissue producing dissection. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent the trapped air leaking into other areas. The aim is to present a case of subcutaneous emphysema related to dental extraction, without raising a mucoperiosteal flap, possibly caused by close contact between the air turbine handpiece and the tooth during sectioning which forced air into the subcutaneous tissue...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Estimation of radon risk in soil gas is a {{preventive}} practice when building safe dwellings. We propose {{a method for}} measuring of 222 Rn in soil gas based on liquid scintillation counting (LSC). A small-diameter hollow steel probe with a sharpened lower-end tip combined with a large-volume syringe (RADON v. o. s., Czech Republic) {{is used as a}} soil gas sampling system. One measurement approach includes direct soil gas counting in a special LS vial coated inside with plastic scintillation material, MeltilexTM. Another approach is about 10 times more sensitive. It includes a radon trap-glass bubbler filled with a 20 -mL portion of a toluene-based LS cocktail. After sampling, the LS solution is transferred into conventional vials for LS counting. The air inside the 150 -mL syringe in both cases is blown through a vial or a bubbler. In the bubbler method, 3 portions of the <b>air</b> <b>syringe</b> volume are blown through the bubbler to make the method more reproducible. Rn sorp-tion in the trap depends on the toluene and bubbler volumes, temperature, and humidity. In both measurement approaches, modern LSC measurement equipment with alpha/beta separation is used. The method was tested on Quantulus 1220 TM and Triathler LS spectrometers. The described measurement approaches yielded count rates in the alpha window of 2. 4 cpm for direct counting in Meltilex-coated vials and ~ 24 cpm when Rn is trapped in toluene, both corresponding to a concentration of 1 kBq m− 3 for Rn in soil gas...|$|E

40|$|Two {{commercial}} pit and fissure sealants {{were compared}} in vitro for thermocyclic failure. Both products failed; however, one was {{three times more}} resistant to failure than was the other. Pit and fissure sealants have generated great interest in dentistry and have been advocated for use in sealing occlusal surface develop-mental pits and fissures in deciduous molar teeth. ' Untreated, these surfaces have {{a high incidence of}} caries; if they can be protected from oral microorganisms, decay should be reduced. 2 Several questions as to the value of sealants in reducing decay and in their structural in-tegrity have arisen. 3 - 7 In our opinion, there are three primary modes of sealant failure. The first is breakdown and fracturing of the sealant induced by forces of mastication. The second is poor operator technique in place-ment of the sealants (for example, lack of dry field, use of outdated materials, and oil from residues in the <b>air</b> <b>syringe).</b> 8 The third is stress due to thermocycling brought about by the daily ingestion of hot and cold liquids and solids {{that are part of the}} nor-mal diet, 9. 10 which induces a loss of marginal integrity between sealant and enamel (mar-ginal failure).

Method: Samples were collected from all the dental chairs {{in the department of}} public health dentistry. Ten millilitres of water was collected in a sterile container from <b>air</b> water <b>syringe</b> in the mid afternoon, once before flushing and once after flushing for two minutes. One control sample was also taken from tap in the department. The samples were then sent to department of Microbiology, Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla where they were investigated for gram positive and gram negative cocci; gram positive and gram negative bacilli. Results: No organism was detected in the control sample from tap water. The only organism that was detected was staphylococcus coagulase negative. The mean of staphylococci coagulase negative colony forming units in pre flushing sample was 1460. 89 and in post flushing sample was 1380. The difference between pre flushing and post flushing sample was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Though the organism present in water was only staphylococci coagulase negative, the level was higher than as recommended by CDC, so appropriate disinfection methods should be used, and the source of staphylococci coagulase negative should be investigated.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, a new {{generation}} of simplified one-bottle dentin bonding systems, sensitive to variations in the degree of substrate moisture, was introduced. This in vitro project compared the dentin bond strengths and interfacial ultra-morphology formed by three one-bottle bonding systems [OptiBond SOLO (ethanol-based), Prime&Bond 2. 1 (acetone-based), and Single Bond (ethanol- and water-based) ]. The null hypothesis tested was that re-wetting a dried dentin surface with a HEMA aqueous solution would not result in bond strengths, and resin impregnation into demineralized dentin, comparable to those obtained for moist dentin. METHODS: Dentin specimens were assigned to the following three etched surface conditions: moist dentin-control group; dentin dried for 5 s; and dentin dried for 5 s and re-moistened with a commercial 35 % HEMA aqueous solution. Mean shear bond strengths were calculated and analyzed with one- and two-way ANOVA. Dentin discs treated with the same combination of surface condition/adhesive were processed and observed under both transmission and scanning electron microscopes. RESULTS: For moist dentin, the morphology of the resin-dentin interfaces showed penetration of the dentin adhesives to the depth of the transition between demineralized and unaffected dentin. Drying dentin for 5 s resulted in a significant decrease in mean bond strengths and an incompletely infiltrated collagen structure with areas of unveiled collagen fibers, regardless of the solvent. Re-wetting dentin with the aqueous HEMA solution re-established the level of bond strengths obtained to moist dentin and resulted in a raise of the fiber network with simultaneous increase in interfibrillar space dimensions. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that the use of an aqueous HEMA solution might compensate for the dryness induced on dentin surfaces by using air blasts from an <b>air</b> <b>syringe,</b> after rinsing off the etchant. As the behavior of the material that contained water was also affected by surface dryness, the percentage of water included in the composition of current ethanol- and water-based adhesives, such as Single Bond, {{may not be enough to}} compensate for the collapse of the collagen filigree upon drying. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{movement}} of methane (CH 4) from anaerobic sediments through the leaves, stems, and flowers of aquatic plants {{and into the}} atmosphere was found to provide a significant pathway for the emission of CH 4 from the aquatic substrates of flooded wetlands.

The purpose {{was to investigate the}} effects of various syringe and needle combinations on the injection force to determine the most ergonomic combination. Materials and Methods. A load cell was used to generate and measure the injection force. Phase 1 : the injection force of 5 common syringes was measured by injecting water into <b>air.</b> The <b>syringe</b> that required the lowest injection force was evaluated with various needle gauges (25, 27, and 30 [*]G) and lengths (16, 25, and 38 [*]mm) by injecting TA (40 [*]mg/mL) into air. The needle-syringe combination with the lowest injection force (CLIF) was deemed the most ergonomic combination. Phase 2 : comparisons between the CLIF and a standard combination (SC) were performed by injecting TA into air and tap water into a keloid specimen. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and independent t-test were used. Results. Increasing the syringe caliber, injection speed, and needle gauge and length significantly increased the injection force (p value < 0. 001). The SC required a maximum force of 40. 0 [*]N to inject water into keloid, compared to 25. 0 [*]N for the CLIF. Injecting TA into keloid using the SC would require an injection force that was 103. 5 % of the maximum force female thumbs could exert compared to 64. 8 % for the CLIF.

40|$|Within the remit of the {{activities}} of the Emergency MedicalServices (EMS), there are occasions when it is hard to position the head of the patient in an adequate position for endotracheal intubation. Pre-hospital trauma life support suggests the „face-to-face ” intubation method in these situations. In patients with injuries sustained in accidents, this method is recommended prior to the removal of the patient from the vehicle; in this case, the patient is placed in the seated position. The „face-to-face ” method of intubation and its application. For this method of intubation and its application, at least two members of the EMS team are required, with the medical technician conducting manual head and neck stabilisation into a neutral position, while the practitioner prepares for the so-called “face-to-face ” position with the patient. Initially, the practitioner is to grip the handle of the laryngoscope firmly in their right hand while keeping the top of the blade in the upright position (contrary to normal intubation technique). Upon opening the respiratory passage in the patient with the left hand, the practitioner is to position the laryngoscope blade in the patient’s mouth, press the tongue slightly downward together with the lower jaw, and move the blade up and forward to produce epiglottal visualisation. The endotracheal tubus is then applied with the left hand between the patient’s glottis, to the desired depth.

The method isof value in screening or quanti-tating abnormal amounts of this compound, but {{cannot be used}} to measure the small amounts normally present in urine. Additional Keyphrases orotic aciduria #{ 149 }cit rul-linemia #{ 149 } 6 -azauridine #{ 149 }ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency #{ 149 } uv-d etect ion This note describesa simple,rapidanion-exchange column-chromatographic method for measuring abnormallyincreasedamounts of oroticacidin urine. We have used the method to measure orotic acid in the urines of two unrelated patients with citrullinemia, an inborn error of urea synthesis (1). Increased amounts of orotic acid in urine are also found in hereditary orotic aciduria (an inborn error of pyrimidine synthesis) (s), in cases of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (3), and in patients who are being treatedwith the anti-neoplasticdrug, 6 -azauridine (4). Recently describedtechniquesformeasuring orotic acid include ion-exchange column chromatography (i), the use of enzymes (5), isotope dilution (6), and colorimetry (7) -the first three are rather cumbersome for routine use, the last is nonspecific.

40|$|Infections {{of the eye}} {{give rise}} to severe ocular {{morbidity}} and blindness include keratitis, orbital cellulites, endophthalmitis and dacryocystitis. Corneal blindness, in developing countries is predominantly associated with infections. In India, nearly 30 - 35 % of all culture positive infectious keratitis are caused fungi. Laboratory diagnosis mainly depends upon proper collection and transport of clinical specimens. In fungal keratitis, corneal scraping is the ideal sample, but occasionally corneal biopsy or anterior chamber aspirate may also be needed. Corneal scraping is usually by Kimura spatula, under a slit lamp examination, after anaesthetizing the cornea with topical anaesthetic like 0. 4 % proparcaine. Corneal biopsy is done by a minor trephining and AC aspirate using a sterile tuberculin syringe. In case of endophthalmitis, 150 - 200 ìl of aqueous humour is collected. Vitreous fluid (500 - 1000 ìl), however, is collected by pars plana vitrectomy onto sterile tuberculin syringe, the needle is then fixed to a sterile rubber bung after expelling <b>air</b> from the <b>syringe.</b> The collected sample is immediately transported to the laboratory. Swabs from the regurgitating lacrimnal sacs and wound aspirate/ swabs are the ideal specimens for dacryocystitis and orbital cellulites, respectively. These samples are cultured onto SDA slants following standard procedures. The main draw back of culture is its long incubation time (5 to 14 days), though it is indispensable from the view point of the specificity. Direct examination (KOH we...|$|R
40|$|Sucrose {{has been}} shown to {{attenuate}} the behavioural response to painful procedures in human infants undergoing circumcision or blood collection via heelstick. Sucrose has also been found to have a behaviour-modifying effect in neonatal rats exposed to a hot plate. The effect was abolished in neonatal rats by injection of the opioid antagonist naltrexone, suggesting that it was mediated by endogenous opioids. In this experiment, the behaviour of 571 newborn Large White x Landrace hybrid piglets in a specific-pathogen-free piggery of the University of Queensland was recorded during and after the routine management practices of tail docking, ear notching and teeth clipping. Piglets were randomly assigned to receive 1. 0 ml of a 12 % sucrose solution (treatment group) or a placebo (1. 0 ml of <b>air)</b> administered via <b>syringe</b> in the mouth, 60 s before commencement of one of the management procedures. Behaviours were recorded {{at the time of the}} procedure, and then 2 min after completion of the procedure. Piglets that received the sucrose solution did not behave significantly differently from piglets receiving the placebo. Regardless of whether sucrose or placebo was administered, piglets undergoing the routine management procedures showed significantly greater behavioural responses than piglets undergoing no procedure. It was concluded that under commercial conditions, a 12 % sucrose solution administered I min prior to surgery was not effective in decreasing the behavioural indicators of distress in piglets undergoing routine management procedures, Further research into methods of minimising distress caused to piglets by these procedures is recommended...|$|R

Contamination of water exiting the dental unit water lines could be inhibited {{with the use}} of some disinfectants. The purpose of this investigation was to establish the effect of two disinfectants and to test their capacity to eliminate colony forming units (CFU) per mL. Vacuum lines of four chairs were treated for a total of 2 weeks. Two disinfectants (Bio 2000 and Alpron) were used as per manufacturer’s instructions. Water samples for hetereothrophic counts from each unit’s <b>air</b> ⁄ water <b>syringe</b> line were collected before treating the first patient of the day. Baseline, daily, first and second week samples of 10 mL were plated on blood agar plates and eosin ethylene blue agar. For meosifilic bacterial counts, Mueller Hinton agar plates with 1 mL direct and 1 ⁄ 10 were used in sterile serum and CFU were counted. The suspected colonies were further evaluated using API 20 E and API 20 NE. No Gram(–) opportunistic pathogens were found during the entire observation. Baseline contamination level (> 102 CFU mL- 1) without use of disinfectants was significantly higher (P < 0 Æ 0001) than at both first and second weeks when disinfectants were used. No colony was formed when Bio 2000 was used after both first and second weeks, whereas small number of CFU mL- 1 was found {{at the end of the}} first week when Alpron (< 10) was used. In conclusion, when used daily, both disinfectants prevent the development of bacterial contamination after first and second weeks with no significant differences (P = 0 Æ 35). ...|$|R

The calcium sulfate (an eco-friendly binder) foams containing a large amount of trapped bubbles are obtained by mixing of water, mineral binder and surfactants. The mix-then-foam process is then applied before the setting of the mineral matrix. To study the interaction between bubbles behavior and rheological properties evolution of the concentrated suspension, a transparent model fluid (dispersion of Carbopol® 676 in water) is used. Bubbles are injected using a variable volume <b>syringe.</b> <b>Air</b> pressure is controlled during injection. The air bubbles stability in yield stress polymer is analyzed by picture processing. The study of single bubble is first investigated in Carbopol® gels with various yield stresses, to model the effect of rheological properties evolution (setting effect of the binder). As expected, bubbles sizes and internal pressure evolve according to thermodynamic laws. During injection, bubble growing depends on various parameters: yield stress, injected air volume, pressure, bubble sphericity [...] . The experiments lead to the identification of rheological behavior linking pressure, bubble geometry and yield stress in static condition. A modification of the Laplace law depending on yield stress of the fluid and bubble sphericity is proposed. The foam stability is mostly conditioned by coalescence phenomena. It consists on the fusion of two bubbles in contact after the separating membrane destruction. Experiments reveal that a small amount of surfactants promote the stability of the foam structure. The shape of bubbles after coalescence is strongly influenced by yield stress. The type and the surfactants amount generate a wide range of configuration. Results lead {{to a better understanding of}} the foams stability at fresh state. A chemical optimization regarding to mechanical and thermal properties targets is available...|$|R
