5|$|Sheffield was {{particularly}} hard-hit during the 2007 United Kingdom floods and the 2010 'Big Freeze'. Many landmark buildings such as Meadowhall and the Sheffield Wednesday grounds flooded due to {{being close to}} nearby rivers that flow through the city. Since 2012, there have been disputes between the city council and residents {{over the fate of}} the city's 36,000 highway trees, with 4,000 having been felled as part of <b>a</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> maintain the city streets.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} special paint {{jobs have been}} carried out. In the mid-1990s, SAS started <b>a</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> cover MD-80 in single colors {{overlaid}} with small, white aircraft silhouettes, but the project was abandoned after two aircraft. As SAS {{was one of the}} main sponsors of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, it painted one aircraft in a Lillehammer '94 scheme. Similarly a Copenhagen '96 scheme was pained for Copenhagen's term as the European Capital of Culture. Since 2002, SAS has painted selected aircraft in a Star Alliance livery. With the delivery of the A319 in 2006, one aircraft was delivered in a retro Viking scheme.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> {{circumvent}} the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A. Douglas Puter {{to round up}} people from Portland saloons, and then {{take them to the}} land office where they would register for an O parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> {{cover the}} moors with ash from {{coal-fired}} power stations, and possibly municipal rubbish, was proposed in 1962, {{and again in}} 1969. Another plan of the 1960s was to build a regional airport on the moors; this proposal was revived in 1971. Further ash-tipping schemes were voiced in 1974, as was a third plan for an airport in 1976. There were also {{plans to use the}} moor as a dump for colliery waste in 1978, when Thorne Colliery was upgraded and reopened.|$|E
5|$|Anne's {{second cousin}} George of Hanover (her {{eventual}} successor) visited London {{for three months}} from December 1680, sparking rumours of a potential marriage between them. Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded, as her father was essentially exiled from court, and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin Sophia Dorothea of Celle as part of <b>a</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> unite the Hanoverian inheritance. Other rumours claimed she was courted by Lord Mulgrave (later made Duke of Buckingham), although he denied it. Nevertheless, {{as a result of}} the gossip, he was temporarily dismissed from court.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1420, vessels from Bristol were {{regularly}} travelling to Iceland {{and it is}} speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. After Cabot arrived in Bristol, he proposed <b>a</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> the king, Henry VII, in which he proposed to reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic. He estimated {{that this would be}} shorter and quicker than Columbus' southerly route. The merchants of Bristol, operating under the name of the Society of Merchant Venturers, agreed to support his scheme. They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s, looking for possible trading opportunities. In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{flies to}} Imperial Iran (Persia) to investigate. Gorner owns {{factories}} and produces legitimate pharmaceuticals, however MI6 suspects he has other motives. During Bond's investigation he identifies Gorner {{due to a}} deformity of his hand, and establishes Gorner's complicity in <b>a</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> not only flood Europe with cheap drugs but also to launch a two-pronged terrorist attack on the Soviet Union, whose retaliation will subsequently devastate the UK. The attack is to be made using a stolen British airliner, earlier hijacked over Iraqi airspace, and an ekranoplan. Bond is assisted in his investigation by Scarlett Papava (whose twin sister Poppy is under Gorner's emotional spell), Darius Alizadeh (the local head of station), JD Silver (an in-situ agent), and Felix Leiter.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{resigned}} {{as chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co amid a series of board disagreements in 1934. He took control of The Churchill Machine Tool Co and, with Maginness as managing director, in December of that year embarked on <b>a</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> expand production and replace obsolete machinery, some of it over 20 years old, {{in an attempt to}} achieve an average output figure of £40,000 per month. However, there were difficulties in decision-making and wariness as the clouds of war loomed, most notably because of the company's contracts to supply a needy Soviet Union with machine tools, which had done much to assist it out of the depths of depression.|$|E

5|$|Following his Macedonian triumph, Pyrrhus was {{approached}} by his officer Cleonymus. The Spartan convinced the Epiriote king to aid him in <b>a</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> seize control of his homeland. Cleonymus' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were twofold. Firstly, he was angry {{that he had been}} overlooked for the Agiad kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew, Areus II. Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness and violent nature. Furthermore, Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that his new wife, Chilonis, was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus, the son of Areus.|$|E
5|$|Heseltine {{had long}} nurtured <b>a</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> launch a music magazine, which he {{intended}} to start {{as soon as he}} found appropriate backing. In April 1920, Rogers decided to replace his semi-moribund magazine The Organist and Choirmaster, with a new music journal, The Sackbut, and invited Heseltine to edit it. Heseltine presided over nine issues, adopting a style that was combative and often controversial. The Sackbut also organised concerts, presenting works by van Dieren, Sorabji, Ladmirault and others. However, Rogers withdrew his financial backing after five issues. Heseltine then struggled to run it himself for several months; in September 1921 the magazine was taken over by the publisher John Curwen, who promptly replaced Heseltine as editor with Ursula Greville.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Department of National Heritage {{bought the}} castle from its owners. The {{government}} agency English Heritage {{took control of}} the castle in 1984 and <b>a</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>to</b> reopen the property to visitors was put forward in 1993. This included a final assessment of the archaeological work of the previous decades, and the castle finally opened to the public again in 1994. As of 2015, the castle is open to visitors through guided tours organised by the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. The site is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
