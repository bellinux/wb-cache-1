5|$|The Yunnan hare {{is smaller}} than the woolly hare; the supraorbitals <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> and small, and the toothrow and {{diastema}} (space between two teeth) are of different proportions. It also has a characteristic brighter pelage than the woolly hare, although, according to Gao Yaoting, the Yunnan hare's gray rump is also a characteristic of the woolly hare.|$|E
5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> {{junctions}} at {{each end}} of the station: Herne Hill North Junction, where the lines to Loughborough Junction and Brixton diverge; and Herne Hill South Junction, where the lines to West Dulwich and Tulse Hill diverge. Thameslink and Southeastern services cross each other's paths at the junctions, constraining capacity on both routes. The station also has a turnback siding on its eastern side, adjacent to Milkwood Road.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E

5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> rather than cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E
5|$|Skulls of P. mongoliensis <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> on top, {{especially}} {{over the}} back of the skull, with a triangular depression, the antorbital fossa, on the outside surface of the maxilla (an upper jaw bone). A flange is present on the lower edge of the dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw), although it is not as prominent as in P. meileyingensis or P. major (=P. lujiatunensis). P. mongoliensis is among the largest known species. The skull of the type specimen, which is probably a juvenile, is 15.2centimetres (6in) long, and the associated femur is 16.2centimetres (6.4in) in length. Other specimens are larger, with the largest documented femur measuring about 21centimetres (8.25in) long.|$|E

5|$|The lack {{of numbers}} and {{political}} {{isolation of the}} country at the time caused {{the creation of a new}} breed quite distinct from the former English style toy dog as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed. The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most of the features of the classic toy terrier, with the addition of some new characteristics. The head is high but not wide, the cheeks <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> and the eyes are round. By 1960, 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the first standard for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is well known. Both {{the left and}} right scapulae and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The scapular blades <b>are</b> <b>flat,</b> although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and coracoids articulate, the coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a slightly different morphology of the {{pectoral girdle}}, with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller scapular blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The station's geology is {{dominated}} by the Tomkinson Group, a formation comprising sedimentary rocks of the Paleoproterozoic era that is over 1.6 billion years old. The Tomkinson Group includes layers of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, with some claystone and siltstone, deposited in a fluvial to shallow marine environment. There are also Cambrian basaltic rocks, particularly near the homestead. The eastern parts of the station form a stony plateau within the Ashburton Range. The central parts <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> and include claypans, while to the west are stony ridges. The region is drained by an ephemeral waterway, Tomkinson Creek, and is considered a good candidate to contain manganese deposits, the mineral having been extracted in the 1950s and 1960s at the Mucketty mine just east of Muckaty Station.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves <b>are</b> <b>flat,</b> but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E
5|$|Female banded sugar ants {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by their black head, orange thorax and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males {{of the species}} are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The scape (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are black, and the head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect setae are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the dorsum of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes <b>are</b> <b>flat.</b> The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in workers is 21.|$|E
5|$|Individual archaea {{range from}} 0.1micrometers (μm) to over 15μm in diameter, and occur in various shapes, {{commonly}} as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in Sulfolobus, needle-like filaments {{that are less}} than half a micrometer in diameter in Thermofilum, and almost perfectly rectangular rods in Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. Archaea in the genus Haloquadratum such as Haloquadratum walsbyi <b>are</b> <b>flat,</b> square archaea that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.|$|E

5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The leaves <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the leaves are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E
5|$|The Olmec colossal {{heads are}} at least {{seventeen}} monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders. The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the Olmec civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. All portray mature individuals with fleshy cheeks, flat noses, and slightly crossed eyes; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of Tabasco and Veracruz. The backs of the monuments often <b>are</b> <b>flat.</b> The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances, requiring {{a great deal of}} human effort and resources, it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual Olmec rulers. Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress. The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres, but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar to}} the cervical vertebrae, but have taller and more prong-like neural spines. The rest are amphiplatyan, meaning that they <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> at both ends. They also have postzygapophyses which are less elongate and more pedestal-like, in addition to taller and more rectangular neural spines. The parapophyses, which are depressions instead of projections, have moved off from the transverse processes to the neural arch, between the transverse processes and the articular processes known as the prezygapophyses {{at the front of the}} vertebrae. However, they move back onto the base of the transverse processes in the last few dorsals. In the third or fourth dorsal, the parapophysis is located very close to the suture between the neural spine and the centrum, which is unlike the other dorsals but similar to the first few dorsals in Edmontosaurus. Also like Edmontosaurus, the median ridge separating the prezygapophyses become more pronounced in the rear dorsals.|$|E

50|$|A {{connection}} {{is said to}} <b>be</b> <b>flat</b> if its curvature vanishes: Ω = 0. Equivalently, a connection <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> if the structure group {{can be reduced to}} the same underlying group but with the discrete topology. See also: flat vector bundle.|$|R
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are formed}} by {{weathering}} processes as large {{variations in temperature}} between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts <b>are</b> <b>flat,</b> stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources {{of water in the}} form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.|$|E
5|$|The interclavicle is a {{large plate}} with a smooth upper surface and a {{prominent}} groove on the bottom surface. It also bears a small, pointed projection at its back end. The scapulae have prominent shelves on each side (diagnostic of leptocleidids and polycotylids, but not strongly differentiated in elasmosaurids), and their glenoids are clearly concave, with roughened attachments for cartilage. The two coracoids curve outwards {{in the middle and}} contact at their ends, forming a hole in the middle, although the exact morphology of this hole is uncertain. The regions where the coracoids contact is vaulted and thickened to form a weak, ridge-like projection, comparable to but probably convergently acquired from elasmosaurids. The pubes form a somewhat rectangular dish, with a convex front edge and concave outer edge, while the ischia <b>are</b> <b>flat,</b> triangular, and plate-like. The edges of the pubes where they meet the ischia curve inwards from the midline to each side. The corresponding edges of the ischia are similarly-shaped, with the curved edges of the bones collectively forming two rounded fenestrae that are connected in the center by a small rhombus-shaped opening, as also seen in Futabasaurus. The ilia are rod-shaped and bent, with blunt projections halfway along their outer rims; at the top end, they are flattened into a fan-like shape.|$|E
