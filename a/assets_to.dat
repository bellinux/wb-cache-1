5|$|Iceland {{elected a}} new {{government}} in April 2013, which {{as one of their}} top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated <b>assets</b> <b>to</b> foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated <b>assets</b> <b>to</b> the creditors – which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013. Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after his death, a legal battle arose over Banks' estate and the {{disposition}} of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth {{said that he had}} amended his will in October without her knowledge. The new will left all of Banks' <b>assets</b> <b>to</b> his longtime caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his will. A Chicago funeral home sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay the funeral home costs.|$|E

Trans-Pacific Foods administered the chain's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd to re-brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack's and make HJP the sole master franchisee of both brands. An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising support as to insure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products.

5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's <b>assets</b> <b>to</b> allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these <b>assets</b> <b>to</b> the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} loan <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> ratio, {{investment}} <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> ratio, management composition and delinquency rate on income <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> ratio of low income credit unions (LICUs) were evaluated.

It was found that loan <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> ratio positively influenced the magnitude of income <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> ratio, while the investment <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> ratio had {{a negative effect on}} the income <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> ratio. LICUs that employed managers had higher incomes <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> ratios than those with volunteer managers serving in this capacity. The delinquency rate and income <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> ratio were positively related, but negatively related to delinquency rate squared indicating that when the delinquency rate increased at an increasing rate the income <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> ratio fell. LICUs portrayed three risk behavioural patterns, each associated with size or income of the organization: (1) small LICUs had high risk behaviour, (2) middle income LICUs were risk neutral, and (3) large LICUs accepted higher risks as income increased. ...|$|R
