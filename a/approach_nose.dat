50|$|The {{objective}} of this technique is to maintain wings level and the aircraft position near the runway centerline during <b>approach.</b> The <b>nose</b> points into the wind so that the aircraft approaches the runway slightly skewed {{with respect to the}} runway centerline (crabbing). This gives the impression of approaching the runway flying sideways, which can be disorienting for the pilot. Position is maintained by balancing the crosswind component, or more accurately the drag force arising from it, with engine thrust. Wings are maintained level throughout the approach. Just before the flare, opposite rudder (downwind rudder) is applied to eliminate the crab, with a simultaneous application of opposite aileron to maintain a wings-level attitude, so that at touch down, the body, velocity vector, and bank angle are all aligned with the runway, and the aircraft is positioned near the center.|$|R

The aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair, and was written-off by insurers in May 2009.|$|R

25|$|Nonetheless, at mid–20th century, {{despite such}} {{refinement}} {{of the open}} rhinoplasty approach, the endonasal rhinoplasty was the usual <b>approach</b> to <b>nose</b> surgery—until the 1970s, when Padovan presented his technical refinements, advocating the open rhinoplasty approach; he was seconded by Wilfred S. Goodman in the later 1970s, and by Jack P. Gunter in the 1990s. Goodman impelled technical and procedural progress with the article External Approach to Rhinoplasty (1973), which reported his technical refinements and popularized the open rhinoplasty approach. In 1982, Jack Anderson reported his refinements of nose surgery technique in the article Open Rhinoplasty: An Assessment (1982). During the 1970s, the principal application of open rhinoplasty was to the first-time rhinoplasty patient (i.e., a primary rhinoplasty), not as a revision surgery (i.e., a secondary rhinoplasty) to correct a failed nose surgery. In 1987, in the article External Approach for Secondary Rhinoplasty (1987), Jack P. Gunter reported the technical effectiveness of the open rhinoplasty approach for performing a secondary rhinoplasty; his improved techniques advanced the management of a failed nose surgery.|$|R

This experiment studied behaviors of PGF 2 alpha -treated pseudopregnant nulliparous pigs (gilts) exposed to newborn piglets. Penned pseudopregnant gilts (days 46 - 53) were injected with either 10 mg PGF 2 alpha (n = 8) or saline (n = 8) im, and behavior was recorded for 2 h (period A). Between 2 and 6 h (period B), gilts were given two male piglets (< 12 h old) and a novelty object (house brick) and recordings continued. During period A, PGF 2 animals showed greater frequencies of standing, pawing, rooting, lifting, and carrying straw (indices of nest building) and scratching than saline treated animals. During period B, one PGF 2 alpha- and two saline-treated gilts attacked piglets, which {{were removed from the}} pen and the gilts excluded from further analysis. There were no treatment differences in period B in gilt posture, nest building behavior, or interactions with piglets or novelty object, except for a reduced frequency to trap piglets beneath their bodies and an increased frequency to attempt to escape from the pen in PGF 2 alpha -treated animals. Piglet position relative to the gifts 2 ̆ 7 head and udder was unaffected by treatment.

Preliminary results have been presented recently (L. A. Pinnaduwage et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 91, 044105 (2007)). Our MEMS-based electronic nose is composed of a microcantilever sensor array with seven individual sensors used for vapor detection and an artificial neural network (ANN) for the pattern recognition. A set of custom vapor generators generated reproducible vapor mixtures in different compositions for training and testing of the neural network. The sensor array was selected to be capable to generating different response patterns to mixtures with different component proportions. Therefore, once the electronic nose was trained using the response patterns to various compositions of the mixture, {{it was able to}} predict the composition of “unknown” mixtures. We have studied two vapor systems: one included the nerve gas simulant dimethylmethyl phosphonate (DMMP) at parts-per-billion (ppb) concentrations and water and ethanol at parts-per-million (ppm) concentrations; the other system included acetone, water and ethanol all of which were at ppm concentrations. In both systems, individual, binary and ternary mixtures were analyzed with good reproducibility. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that {{the main source of}} cost for developing high-integrity software systems is their verification. A significant portion of this verification cost is spent assessing that software complies with its requirements. Over the years several different methods have been developed to address this issue, in particular: testing, peer reviews, formal verification and automatic code generation. It is more and more frequent that these verification strategies are mixed within the same system, so as to adopt the most appropriate one for each component. This increases the complexity of the integration phase because it has to cope with multiple formalisms, development and verification methods. Our goal is to propose a pragmatic process to integrate components developed using different methods into a single system and demonstrate that properties already verified for each component in isolation are preserved in their composition. This process leverages AADL as a pivotal modeling language for system specification and relies on specific verifications between the latter and the components developed using heterogeneous modeling and programming languages, namely Simulink for computation intensive parts and Ada/SPARK 2014 for other components.
