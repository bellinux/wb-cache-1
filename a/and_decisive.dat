5|$|Between 1794 and 1815, Wellesley {{participated in}} a number of {{military}} campaigns where he achieved tactical, strategic, <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> victories in India and across six countries of western Europe. He faced and defeated many of Napoleon's marshals as the {{commander in chief of the}} Anglo-Portuguese Army during the Peninsular War, but his best known battle was at Waterloo in 1815 where he led an Anglo-Allied force to a decisive victory over Napoleon I. It was to be his last battle.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Egypt in 331BC, Alexander marched eastward into Mesopotamia (now {{northern}} Iraq) {{and again}} defeated Darius, at the Battle of Gaugamela.

Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana (modern Hamedan), while Alexander captured Babylon.|$|E

5|$|McKinley was {{president}} during the Spanish–American War of 1898, {{in which the}} U.S. victory was quick <b>and</b> <b>decisive.</b> As part of the peace settlement, Spain {{turned over to the}} United States its overseas colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. With the nation prosperous, McKinley defeated Bryan again in the 1900 presidential election. President McKinley was assassinated by Leon Czolgosz in September 1901, and was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|Although several German states {{initially}} {{sided with}} Austria, they {{stayed on the}} defensive and failed to take effective initiatives against Prussian troops. The Austrian army therefore faced the technologically superior Prussian army with support only from Saxony. France promised aid, but it came late and was insufficient. Complicating the situation for Austria, the Italian mobilization on Austria's southern border required a diversion of forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the Third Italian War of Independence on a second front in Venetia and on the Adriatic sea. The day-long Battle of Königgrätz, {{near the village of}} Sadová, gave Prussia an uncontested <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> victory.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century Irish {{influence}} became a significant feature of island life and Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, the High King of Ireland took possession of Mann and the Isles until 1072. The {{records for the}} rulers of the Hebrides are obscured again until the arrival of Godred Crovan as King of Dublin and the Isles. The ancestor {{of many of the}} succeeding rulers of Mann and the Isles, he was eventually ousted by Muirchertach Ua Briain and fled to Islay, where he died in the plague of 1095. It is not clear the extent to which Ui Briain dominance was now asserted in the islands north of Man, but growing Irish influence in these seas brought a rapid <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> response from Norway.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, São Paulo {{rose from}} being a mere great in Brazil to become an {{international}} powerhouse. Manager Telê Santana turned to the Paulistas youth and instilled his style of quick, cheerful, <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> football. Led by stars such as Zetti, Müller, Raí, Cafu, Palhinha, São Paulo beat Newell's Old Boys of Argentina to begin a dynasty. In 1993 São Paulo successfully defended the title by thumping Universidad Católica of Chile in the finals. The Brazilian side became the first club since Boca Juniors in 1978 to win 2 consecutive Copa Libertadores. Like Boca Juniors, however, they would reach another final in 1994 only to lose the title to Vélez Sársfield of Argentina in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|King William I {{appointed}} Otto von Bismarck {{as the new}} Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded war on Denmark in 1864, {{which promoted}} German over Danish interests in the Jutland peninsula. The subsequent (<b>and</b> <b>decisive)</b> Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation (Norddeutscher Bund) which excluded Austria from the federation's affairs. After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed {{the founding of the}} German Empire in 1871 at Versailles, uniting all scattered parts of Germany except Austria. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the Hohenzollern King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital.|$|E

A week later they surrendered, with many mercenaries and some Swedish abandoning their banners and insignia, and changing sides. As {{a result of the}} series of Swedish defeats in spring 1627, they lost all their strongholds on {{the west bank of the}} Vistula, and with those, their hopes for a quick <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> victory. The situation also convinced the Elector of Brandenburg to declare his support for the Commonwealth, and afterwards the Lithuanian forces resumed their offensive in Livonia.|$|E

5|$|Rapid {{economic}} growth marked McKinley's presidency. He promoted the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition, and in 1900, he secured {{the passage of}} the Gold Standard Act. McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict, but when negotiation failed, he led the nation into the Spanish–American War of 1898; the U.S. victory was quick <b>and</b> <b>decisive.</b> As part of the peace settlement, Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; Cuba was promised independence, but at that time remained {{under the control of the}} U.S. Army. The United States annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898 and it became a U.S. territory.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on 10 February, about 50 Vietnamese {{soldiers}} (Tirailleurs indochinois) of the 4th Regiment of Tonkinese Rifles within the Yen Bay garrison turned on their French officers with assistance from about sixty civilian VNQDDĐ members who invaded the camp from the outside. The mutiny failed within 24 hours when {{the majority of}} the Vietnamese soldiers in the garrison refused to participate and remained loyal to the colonial army. Further sporadic attacks occurred across the Delta region, with little impact. French retribution to the attack was swift <b>and</b> <b>decisive.</b> The main leaders of the VNQDD were arrested, tried and put to death, effectively ending the military threat of what was previously the leading Vietnamese nationalist revolutionary organisation.|$|E
5|$|The Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1818) was {{the final}} <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> {{conflict}} between the British East India Company (EIC) and the Hindu Maratha Empire in India. The war left the Company in control of most of India. It began with an invasion of the Hindu Maratha territory by British East India Company troops, the largest such British controlled force massed in India. The troops were led by the Governor General Hastings (no relation to Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of Bengal) supported by a force under General Thomas Hislop. Operations began against the Pindaris, a band of Mercenaries and Marathas from central India.|$|E

5|$|This species {{appears to}} have been confounded with C.distans; and from Lightfoot's {{description}} of the green angles of the fruit, I presume it to have been what he intended under that name. It is considerably larger than the real distans, the spikes black intermixed with green rather than yellowish, and the female ones often branched or compounded at their base. Its most essential <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> character however consists in the two strong deep-green nerves or ribs which run along each side of the fruit externally near the edge. The arillus is also broader and more compressed than in C.distans.|$|E
5|$|Having secured {{two quick}} <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> {{victories}} over his opponents which greatly increased his reputation, Charles marched against the Saxon forces in early 1701. These were camped {{on the opposite}} bank of the Düna. The clash occurred {{in the battle of}} Düna, ending in another Swedish victory. However, the outcome was not as decisive as Charles had hoped for. A large part of Augustus' army survived and marched into neutral Prussia. As a consequence, Charles was not able to capitalize on the previous Russian setback at Narva, but was forced to postpone the planned invasion. Instead he decided to chase the Saxon army into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where Augustus was also king. Thus far, technically, Poland-Lithuania had stayed neutral in the conflict since Augustus began the war with Sweden in his capacity as Elector of Saxony rather than as king of Poland. Charles' purpose was to remove Augustus from the Polish throne. The subsequent conflict became known as the Swedish invasion of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Joan of Arc {{puts the}} player {{in command of}} the battered, bloodied and demoralised French during the Hundred Years War against England. At the {{beginning}} of the campaign, nearly every major <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> battle fought by the French has always led to defeat to the English. In France's darkest hour though, a seventeen-year-old girl—Joan of Arc intends to save France by the command of God. She intends to drive the English from France forever. Her presence at the Siege of Orleans earns her the nickname 'The Maid of Orleans', and she earns the confidence of the uncrowned Dauphin Charles VII by being given command of the entire French Army, although the Dauphin's advisors begin to plot against Joan of Arc. At several turning points in the Hundred Years' War, namely the Loire Campaign where the entire English and Burgundian forces were cleared out, hope for a free France begin to inspire more men to join the fight under Joan of Arc.|$|E

5|$|Once Edward had {{regained the}} support of Clarence, he mounted a swift <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> {{campaign}} to regain the Crown through combat; {{it is believed that}} Richard was his principal lieutenant as some of the king's earliest support came from members of Richard's affinity, including Sir James Harrington and Sir William Parr, who brought 600 men-at-arms to them at Doncaster. He may have led the vanguard at the Battle of Barnet, in his first command, on 14 April 1471, where he outflanked the Duke of Exeter's wing, although the degree to which his command was fundamental may have been exaggerated. That his personal household sustained losses indicates he was {{in the thick of the}} fighting. A contemporary source is clear about his holding the vanguard for Edward at Tewkesbury, deployed against the Lancastrian vanguard under the Duke of Somerset on 4 May 1471, and his role two days later, as Constable of England, sitting alongside John Howard as Earl Marshal, in the trial and sentencing of leading Lancastrians captured after the battle.|$|E
5|$|Yuri, {{also known}} as , has a {{determined}} personality but is secretly very sensitive and protective. She invites Otonashi to join the SSS, an organization she founded and leads which fights against God. She is smart <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> when making operations and decisions. She carries a silver Beretta 92. Not only is she skilled with a gun, but she is also capable in close range hand-to-hand combat, which is shown when she fends off Angel's hand sonic with a combat knife. She vowed to fight against God after her three younger siblings were murdered by burglars looking for valuables and never forgave herself for failing to prevent their deaths. She is an effective leader, but does not think so. She regrets even fighting with Kanade later in the story, because she feels {{she could have been}} great friends with her. She disappears after the graduation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Theramenes {{remained}} a general through 407 BC, but, in that year, when the Athenian defeat at Notium {{led to the}} downfall of Alcibiades and his political allies, Theramenes was not reelected. In the next year, however, he did sail as a trierarch in the scratch Athenian relief fleet sent out to relieve Conon, who had been blockaded with 40 triremes at Mytilene by Callicratidas. That relief force won a surprising victory over the more experienced Spartan force in the Battle of Arginusae, but {{in the wake of}} that battle Theramenes found himself {{in the middle of a}} massive controversy. At the end of the battle, the generals in command of the fleet had conferred to decide on their next steps. Several pressing concerns presented themselves; 50 Peloponnesian ships under Eteonicus {{remained a}}t Mytilene, blockading Conon, <b>and</b> <b>decisive</b> action by the Athenians could lead to the destruction of that force as well, but, at the same time, ships needed to be dispatched to recover the sailors of the twenty five Athenian triremes sunk or disabled in the battle. Accordingly, all eight generals, with the larger part of the fleet, set out for Mytilene, while a rescue force under Thrasybulus and Theramenes, both of whom were trierarchs in this battle but had served as generals in prior campaigns, remained behind to pick up the survivors and retrieve corpses for burial. At this point, however, a severe storm blew up, and both of these forces were driven back to shore. Eteonicus escaped, and a great number of Athenian sailors—estimates as to the precise figure have ranged from near 1,000 to as many as 5,000—drowned.|$|E
