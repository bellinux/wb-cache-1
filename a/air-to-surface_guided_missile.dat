50|$|In the 1950s {{the factory}} started the {{production}} of Mikoyan's MiG-15 and later, the MiG-17 fighter aircraft. In 1957 Tbilisi Aircraft State Association built the MiG-21 two-seater fighter-trainer aircraft and its various derivative aircraft, continuing the MiG-21 production for about 25 years.

5000|$|... 31 March 1956: Two patrol squadrons were {{designated}} Petrel guided missile squadrons, operating P2V-6M aircraft. The Petrel was an <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> {{designed for use}} by patrol aircraft against shipping. VP-24 {{was selected as the}} East Coast squadron, and VP-17 as the West Coast unit. VP-24 was the first to be fully equipped; VP-17 became operational in early 1957.|$|E
5000|$|... 22 May 1946: The {{training}} syllabus {{was completed}} at NAS Edenton, N.C., and the squadron {{was transferred to}} NAS Atlantic City, New Jersey. Three crews were given SWOD training at NAF Chincoteague, Virginia, in September 1946 and April 1947. The ASM-N-2A Bat <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> gave the squadron its nickname, the Batmen. The Bat was developed during World War II as a derivative from an earlier glide-bomb project, the Pelican. The Bat skipped several normal stages of development and went directly into combat. During the war it was carried by three squadrons, VPBs 109, 123 and 124. Only VPB-109 had any success with the missile, sinking three ships and destroying a large oil tank. The project languished briefly after the war until two squadrons were selected to be designated Bat squadrons: VP-24 in the Atlantic Fleet, and VP-25 in the Pacific.|$|E

25|$|The SAAB 18 was a {{twin-engine}} bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, {{designed and}} built {{for use by the}} Swedish Air Force by Svenska Aeroplan AB (SAAB) in response to a 1938 design competition. Due to delays, it did not enter service until 1944, but quickly became the standard Swedish bomber aircraft. Serving in the bomber, reconnaissance and ground-attack roles, it also assisted in the development of ejection seats and <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missiles</b> until its replacement by the Saab Lansen in the late 1950s.|$|R

5000|$|The GAM-63 was an <b>air-to-surface</b> {{supersonic}} <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> {{armed with}} a nuclear warhead. Its development was inaugurated in April 1946. The Rascal {{was intended as a}} [...] "stand off" [...] weapon, to be launched from Strategic Air Command (SAC) bombers as far away as 100 miles, thus reducing the manned bomber crew's exposure to enemy defenses in the immediate target area.|$|R
5000|$|Primarily {{used by the}} PAF, it {{has also}} been used by the Pakistan Army (PA) in its {{counter-insurgency}} operations in north-west Pakistan.

5000|$|It was {{developed}} by the U.S. during World War II, was later expanded into a more general program including turbojet, ramjet, pulsejet, and rocket power. Straight wing, swept wing, and canard (tail first) air frames were investigated and visual, television, heat-homing, and three types of radar guidance were looked at for use as possible air-to-air, <b>air-to-surface</b> and surface-to-surface <b>guided</b> <b>missiles</b> and as target drones.|$|R
50|$|Kawasaki Igo-1-B, {{otherwise}} known as Kawasaki Ki-148 was a World War II Japanese <b>guided</b> <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> designed in 1944. Developed along its sister projects of Mitsubishi Igo-1-A and Tokyo Imperial University-designed Igo-1-C, the Igo-1-B was a simple radio-controlled guided bomb propelled by a rocket engine generating 150 kg of thrust for up to 80 seconds.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{configuration}} of the Kh-38M was revealed at the 2007 Moscow Air Show (MAKS). The modular <b>guided</b> <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> is meant to succeed the venerable Kh-25 missile family.

5000|$|In October 1962, 16 {{aircraft}} {{were ordered}} by the South African Air Force (SAAF), as the Buccaneer S.50. [...] These were S.2 aircraft, {{with the addition of}} Bristol Siddeley BS.605 rocket engines; to provide additional thrust for the [...] "hot and high" [...] African airfields. The S.50 was also equipped with strengthened undercarriage, and higher capacity wheel brakes, and had manually folded wings. They were equipped to use the AS-30 command <b>guided</b> <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missiles.</b> Due to the need to patrol the vast coastline, they also specified in-flight refuelling, and larger [...] underwing tanks. [...] Once in service, the extra thrust of the BS.605 rocket engines proved to be unnecessary, and thus the rockets were very rarely operated, and were eventually removed from all aircraft. [...] South Africa later sought to procure further Buccaneers, but the British government blocked further orders, because of a United Nations embargo of South Africa.|$|R

"At Eglin, the 1st <b>Guided</b> <b>Missiles</b> Squadron was {{assigned}} <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missiles</b> and <b>guided</b> bombs (e.g., Tarzon) and the 2nd <b>Guided</b> <b>Missiles</b> Squadron worked with surface-to-surface missiles and aircraft drones. During {{the first ten}} months of its existence, the 550th <b>Guided</b> <b>Missiles</b> Wing also continued its predecessor's earlier preparations to support Project GREENHOUSE with drone aircraft, but additional drones and personnel were assigned to other Air Proving Ground units during this period as well. By January 1950, the Air Proving Ground decided this piecemeal operation ought to be consolidated, and it recommended {{the establishment of a}} separate and permanent drone squadron. Personnel from the 2nd <b>Guided</b> <b>Missiles</b> Squadron were subsequently transferred to a new unit – the 3200th Drone Squadron, 3200th Proof Test Group – in May 1950. While the 3200th Drone Squadron remained under the 550th for administrative purposes, its operations were essentially divorced from the 550th's missile activities when the 3200th moved to Auxiliary Field 3. The 2nd <b>Guided</b> <b>Missiles</b> Squadron was placed on inactive status after the transfer, but it was revived at Holloman Air Force Base on 25 October 1950 when the 550th's detachment out there was discontinued. As the 2nd <b>Guided</b> <b>Missiles</b> Squadron Commander at Holloman, Captain John A. Evans inherited the old detachment's manpower and gained 40 airmen from other Wing resources. This brought the Squadron's strength to 17 officers and 114 airmen (out of the 550th's total complement of 201 officers and 816 airmen)." ...|$|R
