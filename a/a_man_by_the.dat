In 2000, Brashear was charged with assault following an incident where he grabbed <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> neck and shoved him. The incident occurred after the man complained to Desgagne about the couple's infant son crawling on the exercise machines in a communal gym. Brashear received six months probation after pleading guilty to common assault.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Lympne {{was to be}} the {{destination}} for the landing of an aircraft carrying Adolf Hitler in a daring kidnap plot. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name of Kiroff had given information to the British Military Attaché in Sofia, Bulgaria, that he was the brother-in-law of Hans Baur, the personal pilot of Hitler. He stated that Baur was planning to defect using Hitler's Focke-Wulf Fw 200 with him on board. The RAF made plans to receive the aircraft at Lympne and 25 March was the date that the defection was expected to occur. Baur did not defect and spent the war as Hitler's personal pilot. A few weeks later Rudolph Hess defected to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker {{against a}} mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears {{ignorant of the}} basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man {{has the ability to}} cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{decide to}} split up and {{interrogate}} the doppelgangers. Betty tells Mulder that Lulu is causing {{all of the problems}} and forcing her to leave, while Lulu tells Scully the same thing. Later, the two look-alikes pass each other and a sewer grate blows open, sucking Mulder into the storm drain and sealing him in. Scully finds that the girls share the same father, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name of Bob Damphouse, who is in prison. Damphouse is revealed to be mentally insane, and is always in a fit of rage. Eventually, Mulder finds {{his way out of the}} storm drain.

The other Bert Zupanic shows up and everyone stops fighting. The two Zupanics see each other and a fight breaks out again. The episode ends with Mulder and Scully shown bruised and beaten.|$|E

She tries and fails to seduce him, but when she finds a picture of Rose in Elton's jacket she demands that he leave her alone. Meanwhile, Bridget and Bliss disappear from the group unexpectedly. Victor explains their absence by saying that they quit {{to move on with}} their lives. After a meeting Elton, Ursula and Mr Skinner stage a walkout.

As Ursula and Elton see the faces of the former LINDA members on the Abzorbaloff's body, the alien reveals that he has absorbed them and wishes to also absorb the Doctor to gain his accumulated experience and knowledge. The Abzorbaloff manages to trick Ursula and absorb her as well, before pursuing Elton who attempts to escape.|$|E

25|$|This vision lasted {{approximately}} {{twenty-four hours}} and {{was said to}} have had a powerful impact on his overall perception of reality as well as his entire self. While the revelation was overpowering and transformative, it was the only visual moment where Nathan of Gaza felt that he was a true prophet. Nevertheless, in addition to his physical and mental alteration, there was another important component to the vision: Nathan of Gaza believed that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name of Shabbetai Zevi was the messiah. This strong belief in Shabbetai Zevi as the next leader of the Jewish people marked the initiation of the first Sabbatean believer, Nathan of Gaza.

25|$|On August 1, 1828, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name of Barney Griffin, who had {{travelled}} from Syracuse to the Village of Sackets Harbor {{several days}} earlier, ended up {{dying in the}} Jefferson County Poor House.

Hungerford put an advertisement in the a paper to see if a relative would claim the money. No one did. He then turned the money over to the County Treasurer for use of the Poor House, deducting a dollar for the advertisement money that came out of his own pocket. Understanding the nature of greed, he asked the County Board of Supervisors to indemnify him for his actions, which it agreed to do.|$|E

Almost 80 years before John Smith's alleged rescue by Pocahontas, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name of Juan Ortiz told of his remarkably similar rescue from {{execution}} by an Indian girl.

As late as 1783, {{at the end of}} the American Revolutionary War, Spain held claim to roughly half of today's continental United States (see New Spain); in 1775, Spanish ships even reached Alaska. From 1819 to 1848, the United States and its army increased the nation's area by roughly a third at Spanish and Mexican expense, including today's three most populous states: California, Texas, and Florida. Hispanics became the first American citizens in the newly acquired Southwest territory and remained the ancestral majority in several states until the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|Most {{assessments}} of Thorpe's career emphasise his downfall {{rather than his}} political achievements, [...] "a fall unparalleled in British political history", according to the Daily Telegraph obituarist.

500|$|After {{the attack}} on Southland, UB-14 broke down again and put in at Chanak to await repairs. While there on 4 September, word came of the British {{submarine}} [...] entangled in Turkish antisubmarine nets off Nagara Point. Von Heimburg, Prince Heinrich, and UB-14s cook, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name of Herzig, set out in a rowboat to observe the Turkish attempts to destroy E7. After several mines that formed part of the net had been detonated to no avail, von Heimburg and his group rowed out and repeatedly dropped a plumb line until it contacted metal. Then, von Heimburg dropped a Turkish sinker mine with a shortened fuse {{right on top of}} E7. After the hand-dropped mine detonated too close for the British submarine's captain's comfort, he ordered his boat surfaced, abandoned, and scuttled. Between shellfire from the Turkish shore batteries and E7s scuttling charges, von Heimburg and company narrowly escaped harm. While most sources credit E7s sinking to the Turkish efforts, author Robert Stern contends that von Heimburg and UB-14 deserve partial credit for the demise of E7.|$|E

A second earthquake occurs as Lulu prepares to walk in on Zupanic and Saperstein exchanging money. After Betty emerges from the bathroom, the two see each other and the glass in the building begins breaking. Zupanic is knocked unconscious and Saperstein takes the money and leaves.|$|E
500|$|Her {{music videos}} {{contributed to a}} higher degree of sexual freedom among young women, as Jean M. Twenge, author of Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled—and More Miserable Than Ever Before (2007) wrote: [...] "In Alfred Kinsey's studies in the 1950s, only 3% of the young women had {{received}} oral sex from <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> mid-1990s, however, 75% of women aged 18-24 had experienced cunnilingus. Music videos by female artists have contributed to the trend, with both Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson heavily implying male-on-female oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a man's head until he's in exactly the right position." [...] Similarly, Paula Kamen in Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution (2000) states that [...] "n the early to mid-1990s, oral sex even reached mainstream music as politically charged demand of truly liberated women," [...] citing TLC, Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson as examples of female artists simulating cunnilingus in their videos. Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "she celebrated becoming an erotic being... young women a way to have their sexual freedom and their dignity, to have their cake and eat it too." [...] She was named Best Female Singer and Female Sex Symbol by Rolling Stone for the year 1993 in pop music. Goren adds that later pop stars such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Pink would rely on image, sex appeal and choreography as much as musical talent.|$|E
