5000|$|Class 1 {{regional}} switches {{provide the}} final layer of long distance switching. VNL routing methods preferred [...] "down-chain" [...] trunk {{connections between the}} originating Class 1 switch and a Class 3, Class 2, or Class 1 switch in a different region. <b>Analog</b> <b>trunk</b> connections between Class 1 switches were required to have a loss of zero decibels.|$|E
50|$|The TCU was {{responsible}} {{for a group of}} Facility Interface Units (FIUs). Each FIU {{was responsible}} for connecting the system to a particular class of physical connection: analog lines in the Analog Line FIU (and its successor, the Extended Line FIU); analog trunks in the <b>Analog</b> <b>Trunk</b> FIU; and digital carrier in the Digital Trunk FIU and its successor, the EDT FIU. Unlike the SM in the competitive 5ESS Switch, the TCUs did not perform all call processing functions, but limited themselves to digit collection and signalling interpretation.|$|E
50|$|Geographic area codes were {{designed}} {{based on previous}} 3-digit USSR area codes by removing the lead 0. Calling across areas still requires dialing trunk prefix 8 and waiting for dialtone after that. This pause was initially required by the <b>analog</b> <b>trunk</b> switches to identify the caller from PSTN for billing purposes. When calling within Belarus add 0 to the trunk prefix. This way dialing within the country is practically unchanged. In 2003 the abbreviated dialing within areas was replaced with a full 9-digit number + 2-digit trunk prefix. Previously {{it was possible to}} dial 82RRnn-nnn to reach a number in the same area. Now it is required to dial 80-AARRnn-nnn where AA is the area code, RR is the region code and nn-nnn is the local number.|$|E
50|$|Initially, T-1 trunks {{were used}} only to connect major {{telephone}} exchanges, via the same twisted pair copper wire that the <b>analog</b> <b>trunks</b> used. One transmit pair, one receive pair. If the exchanges were too far apart, a repeater boosted the signal.|$|R
50|$|RBS was {{developed}} {{at the time that}} AT&T was moving from <b>analog</b> <b>trunks</b> onto digital equipment. This permitted AT&T to run 24 digital phone lines on the same number of wires that 2 analog phone lines would have taken, saving money and improving call quality, without the high cost of frequency-division multiplexing.|$|R
50|$|The Systems Saber added <b>analog</b> <b>trunking</b> operation, {{direct access}} to {{functions}} via the keypad (on the Systems Saber III), and increased channel capacity to a then-unheard of 255 conventional channels. The Systems Saber also {{increased the number of}} channels per zone to sixteen and added the ability to reprogram the function of many of the controls.|$|R
50|$|During this era, most voice {{connections}} used <b>analog</b> <b>trunk</b> circuits {{that were}} designed to conform with the Via Net Loss plan established by Bell Laboratories. The purpose of the VNL plan and five-level long distance switching hierarchy was to minimize the number of trunk circuits in a call and maximize the voice quality of the connections. Excessive loss in a voice connection meant that subscribers may have difficulty hearing each other. This was particularly important in the 1960s when dial up data connections were developed {{with the use of}} analog modems. The SES evaluated multi-frequency outpulsing signaling as well as voice impairments including sound amplitude, noise, echo, {{and a variety of other}} parameters. Deployment of common-channel signaling systems such as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling and later Signaling System #7 obviated the need to monitor multi-frequency signaling as it became obsolete.|$|E
50|$|The TSPS system {{utilized}} special <b>analog</b> <b>trunks</b> {{that originated}} at Class 5 end office circuit switch systems and Class 4 toll access circuit switch systems that {{were connected to}} Class 3 primary toll circuit switch systems such as the 4A-ETS/PBC and 4ESS switch systems. The TSPS system did not perform switching between the originating end office switch and the toll switch for the subscriber voice path.|$|R
5000|$|If the PSAP {{receives}} {{calls from}} the telephone company on older <b>analog</b> <b>trunks,</b> they are usually Pulse driven circuits. These circuits are similar to traditional telephone lines, but are formatted to pass the calling party's number (Automatic Number Identification, ANI). (For historical reasons, the PSAP will refer to these as CAMA circuits even though Centralized Automatic Message Accounting (CAMA) is actually {{a reference to the}} call log.) ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{in other}} carrier systems, the {{physical}} properties {{of an actual}} trunk wire are missing. With <b>analog</b> <b>trunks,</b> to signal the equipment {{at the far end}} that a trunk was going to be used, equipment would [...] "loop" [...] the line by connecting the wires together at one end or ground start one of the wires (depending on the type of trunk), and do the opposite to return the trunk to idle. With a digital trunk, another method was needed to signal between ends.|$|R

5000|$|The GTD-5 EAX ran on a Time-Space-Time (TST) topology. Each TCU {{contained}} two timeswitches (TSWs) with a {{total capacity}} of 1544 timeslots: 772 in the originating time switch and 772 in the terminating time switch. Four FIUs of 193 timeslots each were connected to the TSW. Trunking FIUs connected 192 timeslots of facility (eight DS1 carriers or 192 individual <b>analog</b> <b>trunks).</b> The original <b>Analog</b> Line FIU had a 768 line capacity with one codec per line. The digital output of the 768 codecs was concentrated to 192 timeslots before presentation to the timeswitch, a 4:1 concentration. In the later 1980s, higher capacity line frames of 1172 and 1536 lines became available, allowing for higher concentration ratios of 6:1 and 8:1.|$|R
50|$|For old, <b>analog</b> PBX <b>trunks,</b> glare {{would be}} reduced by using ground start signalling, which offered better answer and {{disconnect}} supervision. IE: Nortel BSP discouraged using loop start trunks for this and other reasons. Long Distance exchanges in the 1950s and 60s incorporated Glare Detectors to alleviate the problem.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1999 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaWith {{the rapid}} {{development}} of urban economy, there are bus increasing, route extending, and shuttle frequency increasing etc. At the same time, road construction {{is subject to}} land surface, so traffic jam often occurs. It is a big trouble for life of citizens and problem for economy development. So {{it needs to be}} improved as fast as possible. Vehicle monitoring system for public traffic in Beijing can expediently monitor the state of each controlled bus, thereby making perfect management. With the integration of GPS, <b>analog</b> <b>trunked</b> communication and digital map, the old, blinding manage system of public traffic would be changed into advanced, visualized management mode, and several routes are dispatched in one dispatch center at the same time. The system frame and its components are introduced in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|The Calhoun-Talladega 800 MHz {{communications}} system was originally developed and installed to enhance interoperability {{and to provide}} alert and notification for the community during the destruction of chemical weapons at the Anniston Army Depot (ANAD). The {{communications system}} was funded and maintained through a federal grant known as the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), a joint United States Army and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) program designed to provide community education and emergency preparedness resources {{in the event of}} a chemical agent emergency. [...] The original communications system, a Legacy system with <b>analog</b> <b>trunking,</b> went on-the-air in 1998 and quickly became the primary means of two-way communications for most public safety agencies in Calhoun and Talladega Counties, replacing their standalone conventional radio repeaters. In 2006, the CSEPP communications system was upgraded to a digital Project 25 Motorola Type II SmartZone version 7.4 linear simulcast/multicast trunked 800 MHz communications system.|$|R
50|$|A call Agent {{controls}} the signalling communication between phones, Media gateways like routers on which PRI lines Terminate, ex Cisco 28xx Series Routers (now new versions of Cisco Voice Routers are released 29xx and 39xx), Media Gateways like Analog Extensions (also called as FXS in Cisco devices context like Cisco VG224 and VG248, VG202 and VG204) and <b>Analog</b> <b>Trunks</b> (also called FXO in Cisco Device Context).Call Agent {{is responsible to}} register the end devices like phones and media gateways, which act as dump terminals.After one has dump extension registered to the call agent, when end device phone instrument handset (headphone or speaker) is picked up, the phone sends signal to call-agent and informs that the phone handset has been picked up what to do, Call Agent instructs the phone to give the dial tone. After the user listens to the dial tone, user enters the destination number to which they want to dial. The phone will send each digit immediately that is dialed by user one by one (i.e. the first digit will be sent first to call-agent immediately it is dialed then second and so on).|$|R
50|$|A DS3 is {{delivered}} native on a copper trunk. DS3 may {{be converted to}} an optical fiber run when needing longer distances between termination points. When a DS3 {{is delivered}} over fiber it is still an <b>analog</b> type <b>trunk</b> connection at the termination points. When delivering data over an OC3 or greater SONET is used. A DS3 transported over SONET is encapsulated in a STS-1 SONET channel. An OC-3 SONET link contains three STS-1s, and therefore may carry three DS3s. Likewise, OC-12, OC-48, and OC-192 may carry 12, 48, and 192 DS3s respectively.|$|R
50|$|Can {{be found}} only in {{dispersive}} media. In a waveguide, phase velocity varies with frequency. In a filter, group delay tends to peak near the cut-off frequency, resulting in pulse distortion. When <b>analog</b> long distance <b>trunks</b> were commonplace, for example in 12 channel carrier, group delay distortion had to be corrected in repeaters.|$|R

Some systems with advanced features {{are referred to as}} an Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR). Specialized Mobile Radio is a term defined in US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. The term is of US regulatory origin but may be used in other regions to describe similar commercial systems which offer a radio communications service to businesses.|$|R
50|$|Most {{automated}} {{telephone exchanges}} use digital switching rather than mechanical or <b>analog</b> switching. The <b>trunks</b> connecting the exchanges are also digital, called circuits or channels. However analog two-wire circuits are still used {{to connect the}} last mile from the exchange to the telephone in the home (also called the local loop). To carry a typical {{phone call from a}} calling party to a called party, the analog audio signal is digitized at an 8 kHz sample rate with 8-bit resolution using a special type of nonlinear pulse code modulation known as G.711. The call is then transmitted from one end to another via telephone exchanges. The call is switched using a call set up protocol (usually ISUP) between the telephone exchanges under an overall routing strategy.|$|R
5000|$|U.S. state patrols, county sheriffs' offices, and {{municipal}} police departments often {{run their own}} systems in parallel, presenting interoperability problems. The FCC assigns licenses to these entities in the public safety (PP and PX) allotments of the spectrum. These include allocations in the lower portion of the VHF spectrum (around 39 - 45 MHz), highly susceptible to [...] "skip" [...] interference but still used by state highway patrols; the VHF [...] "hi-band", from 150 to 160 MHz; and various UHF bands. Many systems still use conventional FM transmissions for most traffic; others are <b>trunked</b> <b>analog</b> or digital systems. Recently, {{there has been a}} move towards digital trunked systems, especially those based around the public-safety standard Project 25 format set by the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International. A minority of other police radio systems, the largest examples being the Milwaukee Police Department and Pennsylvania State Police use the incompatible OpenSky format. TETRA, the standard in many European countries as well as other places in the world, is virtually unused in the United States.|$|R
40|$|Using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, we have imaged {{the central}} 20 pc {{of the giant}} H II region 30 Doradus Nebula in three {{different}} emission lines. The images allow us to study the nebula with a physical resolution that is within a factor of 2 of that of typical ground-based observations of Galactic H II regions. We present a gallery of interesting objects within the region studied. These include a tube blown by the wind of a high-velocity star and a discrete H II region around an isolated B star. This small isolated H II region {{appears to be in}} the midst of the champagne flow phase of its evolution. Most of the emission within 30 Dor is confined to a thin zone located between the hot interior of the nebula and surrounding dense molecular material. This zone appears to be directly analogous to the photoionized photoevaporative flows that dominate emission from small, nearby H II regions. For example, a column of material protruding from the cavity wall to the south of the main cluster is found to be a direct <b>analog</b> to elephant <b>trunks</b> in M 16. Surface brightness profiles across this structure are very similar to surface brightness profiles taken at ground-based resolution across the head of the largest column in M 16. The dynamical effects of the photoevaporative flow can be seen as well. An arcuate feature located above this column and a similar feature surrounding a second nearby column are interpreted as shocks in which the photoevaporative flow stagnates against the high-temperature gas that fills the majority of the nebula. The ram pressure in the photoevaporative flow, derived from thermal pressure at the surface of the column, is found to balance with the pressure in the interior of the nebula derived from previous X-ray observations. By analogy with the comparison of ground-based and HST images of M 16, we infer that the same sharply stratified structure seen in HST images of M 16 almost certainly underlies the observed structure in 30 Doradus, which is a crucial case because it allows us to bridge the gap between nearby H II regions and the giant H II regions seen in distant galaxies. The real significance of this result is that it demonstrates that the physical understanding gained from detailed study of photoevaporative interfaces in nearby H II regions can be applied directly to interpretation of giant H II regions. Stated another way, interpretation of observations of giant H II regions must account for the fact that this emission arises not from expansive volumes of ionized gas but instead from highly localized and extremely sharply stratified physical structures...|$|R
