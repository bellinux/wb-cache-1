25|$|As part of Star Warss 20th {{anniversary celebration}} in 1997, The Empire Strikes Back was {{digitally}} remastered and re-released along with Star Wars and Return of the Jedi {{under the title}} Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition. Lucas took this opportunity to make several {{minor changes to the}} film. These included explicitly showing the Wampa creature on Hoth in full form, creating a more complex flight path for the Falcon as it approaches Cloud City, digitally replacing some of the interior walls of Cloud City with vistas of Bespin, and replacing certain lines of dialogue. A short sequence was also added depicting Vader's return to his Super Star Destroyer after dueling with Luke, created from <b>alternate</b> <b>angles</b> of a scene from Return of the Jedi. Most of the changes were small and aesthetic; however, some fans believe that they detract from the film.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the growing}} tide of {{revolution}} was becoming discernible, giving Hoveyda {{ample opportunity to}} leave the country before revolutionary forces could {{have had a chance to}} overthrow the 2500-year-old monarchy. Aside from persistent efforts by family and friends {{to leave the country}} as quickly as possible, the Shah himself proposed Hoveida with an ambassadorial position to Belgium. His refusal to leave the country can be judged as being a result of naïveté or blind optimism, but Hoveida's decision can also be assessed from <b>alternate</b> <b>angles.</b> For one, he did not want to abandon his mother who was incapable of traveling at the time. On a more personal level, Hoveyda came to the conclusion that after years of self-exile, he would do all he could to remain in Iran. With all these points of rationale being considered, Hoveida actually came to believe that revolutionary fervour was capable of being contained and that everything would eventually straighten out, allowing the country to resume its present course.|$|E

50|$|Proposition 31 is the {{construction}} of a parallel line to a given line through a point not on the given line. As the proof only requires the use of Proposition 27 (the <b>Alternate</b> Interior <b>Angle</b> Theorem), it is a valid construction in absolute geometry. More precisely, given any line l and any point P not on l, {{there is at least one}} line through P which is parallel to l. This can be proved using a familiar construction: given a line l and a point P not on l, drop the perpendicular m from P to l, then erect a perpendicular n to m through P. By the <b>alternate</b> interior <b>angle</b> theorem, l is parallel to n. (The <b>alternate</b> interior <b>angle</b> theorem states that if lines a and b are cut by a transversal t such that there is a pair of congruent <b>alternate</b> interior <b>angles,</b> then a and b are parallel.) The foregoing construction, and the <b>alternate</b> interior <b>angle</b> theorem, do not depend on the parallel postulate and are therefore valid in absolute geometry.|$|R
60|$|Too bewildered to {{look back}} or to reason, he rushed {{into one of the}} little courts at the side of Fleet Street as a rabbit rushes into a hole. He had a vague idea, if this incomprehensible old Jack-in-the-box was really {{pursuing}} him, that in that labyrinth of little streets he could soon throw him off the scent. He dived in and out of those crooked lanes, which were more like cracks than thoroughfares; and by the time that he had completed about twenty <b>alternate</b> <b>angles</b> and described an unthinkable polygon, he paused to listen for any sound of pursuit. There was none; there could not in any case have been much, for the little streets were thick with the soundless snow. Somewhere behind Red Lion Court, however, he noticed a place where some energetic citizen had cleared away the snow for a space of about twenty yards, leaving the wet, glistening cobble-stones. He thought little of this as he passed it, only plunging into yet another arm of the maze. But when a few hundred yards farther on he stood still again to listen, his heart stood still also, for he heard from that space of rugged stones the clinking crutch and labouring feet of the infernal cripple.|$|E

50|$|In geometry, a {{transversal}} {{is a line}} that passes through two lines in the same plane at two distinct points. Transversals {{play a role in}} establishing whether two other lines in the Euclidean plane are parallel. The intersections of {{a transversal}} with two lines create various types of pairs of angles: consecutive interior angles, corresponding angles, and <b>alternate</b> <b>angles.</b> By Euclid's parallel postulate, if the two lines are parallel, consecutive interior angles are supplementary, corresponding angles are equal, and <b>alternate</b> <b>angles</b> are equal.|$|E
50|$|It {{follows from}} Euclid's {{parallel}} postulate {{that if the}} two lines are parallel, then the angles {{of a pair of}} <b>alternate</b> <b>angles</b> of a transversal are congruent (Proposition 1.29 of Euclid's elements).|$|E

50|$|Kawasaki is {{responsible}} for some very interesting theories, mathematically speaking. He {{was the first to}} develop the technique of iso-area folding, which allows the folder to end up with each side of the paper displayed in equal amounts.

50|$|Euclid's Proposition 27 {{states that}} if a {{transversal}} intersects two lines so that alternate interior angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel.

This contradicts Proposition 16 which states that an exterior angle of a triangle is always greater than the opposite interior angles.|$|E

50|$|Spacers {{separate}} baffles {{and keep}} them aligned at a specified distance from each other inside the suppressor. Many baffles and spacers are manufactured as a single assembly and several suppressor designs have all the baffles attached together with spacers as a one-piece helical baffle stack. Modern baffles are usually carefully shaped to divert the propellant gases effectively into the chambers. This shaping can be a slanted flat surface, canted {{at an angle to}} the bore, or a conical or otherwise curved surface. One popular technique is to have <b>alternating</b> <b>angled</b> surfaces through the stack of baffles.|$|R

As De Morgan pointed out, this is logically equivalent to (Book I, Proposition 16). These results do not depend upon the fifth postulate, but they do require the second postulate which is violated in elliptic geometry.|$|E

30|$|To give {{a better}} idea of the meaning of holes death, let us {{consider}} some examples. The smallest cycle in H 1 is an empty triangle, one of such cycles is given by the three simplices {(Schur’s lemma, Stone-Von Neumann Theorem), (Schur’s lemma, Spectral Theorem), (Spectral Theorem, Stone-Von Neumann Theorem)} which is killed by a 2 -simplex when the three concepts appear together in the paper (Mantoiu et al. 2004). Another interesting example is a 5 -step long cycle in H 1, {(Boltzmann equation, <b>Alternate</b> Interior <b>Angles</b> Theorem), (Boltzmann equation, Vlasov equation), (Inverse function theorem, Vlasov equation), (Arzelá - Ascoli theorem, <b>Alternate</b> Interior <b>Angles</b> Theorem), (Arzelá - Ascoli theorem, Inverse function theorem)}, that is killed by the 10 -simplex which nodes are: { Blum’s speedup theorem, Boltzmann equation, <b>Alternate</b> Interior <b>Angles</b> Theorem, Kramers theorem, Perpendicular axis theorem, Ordinary differential equation, Kronecker’s theorem, Arzelá - Ascoli theorem, Navier - Stokes equations, Vlasov equation, Moreau’s theorem} (Gottlieb 2000). The article, classified in arXiv as Probability, establishes the conditions for a family of n-particles Markov processes to propagate chaos, and shows its application to kinetic theory. We think this is a another possible interpretation of killing holes: a theoretical result that has several applications, hence bridges related areas and closes a homological cycle.|$|R

By combining these three ideas a new problem arises: given multiple folds that bisect the vertex and making a complete straight cut of the vertex, can the sum of the <b>alternating</b> fold-cut <b>angle</b> be determined by just the number of folds of the paper alone? This paper will present and prove a formula for solving this problem...|$|R
