50|$|The {{fortunes}} of the commercial envelope manufacturing industry and the postal service go hand in hand, and both link to the printing industry and the mechanized envelope processing industry producing equipments such as franking and <b>addressing</b> <b>machines.</b> They are all four symbiotic: technological developments affecting one obviously ricochet through the others: <b>addressing</b> <b>machines</b> print addresses, postage stamps are a print product, franking machines imprint a frank on an envelope. If fewer envelopes are required; fewer stamps are required; fewer franking machines are required and fewer <b>addressing</b> <b>machines</b> are required. For example, the advent and adoption of information-based indicia (IBI) (commonly referred to as digitally-encoded electronic stamps or digital indicia) by the US Postal Service in 1998 caused widespread consternation in the franking machine industry, as their equipments were effectively rendered obsolescent and resulted {{in a flurry of}} lawsuits involving Pitney Bowes among others. The advent of e-mail in the late 1990s appeared to offer a substantial threat to the postal service. By 2008 letter-post service operators were reporting significantly smaller volumes of letter-post, specifically stamped envelopes, which they attributed mainly to replacement by e-mail. Although a corresponding reduction in the volume of envelopes required would have been expected, no such decrease was reported as widely as the reduction in letter-post volumes.|$|E

Sick with jaundice, he returned to Texas, where he received a draft notice. He served in the Navy in the South Pacific, primarily as a gunnery officer, seeing combat first aboard the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Chester - torpedoed early in the war by a Japanese submarine.

40|$|The OAMulator is a Web based {{resource}} {{to support the}} teaching of instruction set architecture, assembly languages, memory, addressing, high level programming, and compilation. The tool {{is based on a}} simple, virtual CPU architecture called the One <b>Address</b> <b>Machine.</b> A compiler allows to take programs written in a special programming language, called OAMPL, and transform them into OAM assembly. An OAM assembler allows to interpret and execute OAM assembly code (produced by the compiler or written directly by students), emulating the One <b>Address</b> <b>Machine.</b> The OAMulator is targeted at non-CS students who take introductory courses in information technology or information systems. Such students are normally exposed to concepts of computer hardware and software, but it is di#cult for them to make the connection between the two. The OAMulator takes the mystery out of CPU architecture by letting students gain confidence with the concepts of compilers and binary execution. The Web based deployment allows students to work on problems in convenient locations, at their own pace, and with rewarding interaction. ...|$|R

We demonstrate that compilation techniques for distributed <b>address</b> space <b>machines</b> can be very effective when used in compilers for shared <b>address</b> space <b>machines.</b> Automatic data decomposition can co-locate data and computation to improve locality.
