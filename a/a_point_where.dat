However, if the person already had coronary heart disease the reduction was 25%. The results emphasize the importance of early identification of FH and treatment with statins.|$|E
5|$|In the 1800s–1900s, the Lutheran State Church {{supported}} the Swedish government by opposing both emigration and preachers' efforts recommending sobriety. This escalated to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> its ministers even were persecuted {{by the church}} for preaching sobriety, and the reactions of many congregation members to that contributed to an inspiration {{to leave the country}} (which however was against the law until 1840).|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Flat Bastion, {{then called}} Baluarte de Santiago (Santiago's Bastion), {{was built by}} the Spanish some time between 1565 and 1627. It may have been designed by Daniel Specklin. It {{was one of the}} fortifications along the Charles V Wall that protected the new Africa Gate. The Flat Bastion Magazine within the Bastion was once <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> immense quantities of gunpowder were stored.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the bulk density of the column {{is the same as}} the surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|Each road stage (that is, all {{the stages}} except the team time {{trial and the}} {{individual}} time trial) included an intermediate sprint. This was <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the leading riders in the stage were awarded points in the points classification and time bonuses in the general classification. Many of the stages also included climbs that were categorised by the race organisers according to their difficulty; the leading riders over each of these climbs were awarded points in the mountains classification, with the most difficult climbs earning the most points.|$|E

At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Phoenix successfully defended her championship against Tamina, in <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> her association with Phoenix started splitting up, and on the March 22 episode of Superstars, Phoenix teamed with Eve Torres against Natalya and Tamina, in a losing effort, with this effectively ensuring the ending for the team.|$|E

5|$|Rescue trains were {{dispatched}} {{from across}} Atlantic Canada, {{as well as}} the northeastern United States. The first left Truro around 10am carrying medical personnel and supplies, arrived in Halifax by noon and returned to Truro with the wounded and homeless by 3pm. The track had become impassable at Rockingham, on the western edge of Bedford Basin. To reach the wounded, rescue personnel had to walk through parts of the devastated city until they reached <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the military had begun to clear the streets. By nightfall, a dozen trains had reached Halifax from the Nova Scotian towns of Truro, Kentville, Amherst and Stellarton and from the New Brunswick towns of Sackville, Moncton and Saint John.|$|E
5|$|The first {{sighting}} of an ocean {{passage to the}} Pacific south of Tierra del Fuego is sometimes attributed to Francisco de Hoces of the Loaisa Expedition. In January 1526 his ship San Lesmes was blown south from the Atlantic entrance of the Magellan Strait to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the crew thought they saw a headland, and water beyond it, which indicated the southern extremity of the continent. It is speculation as to which headland they saw; conceivably it was Cape Horn. In parts of the Spanish-speaking world {{it is believed that}} de Hoces may have discovered the strait later known as the Drake Passage more than 50years before Sir Francis Drake, the British privateer.|$|E

5|$|The {{sculpture}} predates 300 BC, {{based on}} {{the style of the}} hieroglyphic text, and is thought to be an Early Maya monument that was intended to represent an Early Maya ruler (at the base) who carried the underworld (i.e. the bat) and his ancestors (the main figure above carrying a smaller figure on its back). The Maya sculptor used half-remembered Olmec stylistic elements upon the ancestor figure in a form of Maya-Olmec syncretism, producing a hybrid sculpture. As such it represents the transition from one cultural phase to the next, at <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the earlier Olmec inhabitants had not yet been forgotten and were viewed as powerful ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E
5|$|Bohun's {{spent most}} of his early career reconquering Marcher lands {{captured}} by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd during the Welsh war in England. This was finally accomplished through Edward I's war in Wales in 1277. Hereford also fought in Wales in 128283 and 129495. At the same time he also had private feuds with other Marcher lords, and his conflict with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, eventually ended with the personal intervention of King Edward himself. Hereford's final years were marked by the opposition he and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, mounted against the military and fiscal policy of Edward I. The conflict escalated to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> civil war threatened, but was resolved when the war effort turned towards Scotland. The king signed the Confirmatio Cartaruma confirmation of Magna Cartaand Bohun and Bigod agreed to serve on the Falkirk Campaign. Bohun died in 1298, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.|$|E

5|$|Buoyed by {{his defeat}} to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became {{a series of}} {{experiments}} which he analyzed meticulously. Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance. He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless. Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921. In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m. A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile. His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m {{at the same time}} has not been matched by any other athlete before or since. Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record. After excelling in mathematics, Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Every so often, {{the player}} {{will come to}} <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> {{he or she is}} given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E
5|$|Market Forces is a science-fiction thriller set nearly {{fifty years}} after its writing {{featuring}} a protagonist who fights lethal battles to win contracts for his company and to retain his position within the company. While the story is fictional, the author included a bibliography section that informed the story's satire of globalisation and modern corporate practices. Morgan extrapolates trends in free market capitalism out fifty years to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> corporations are unfettered by domestic governments. It is a dystopian vision where large corporations constantly battle to rule entire countries using humans as pawns. The protagonist, Chris Faulkner, {{can be viewed as}} a personification of the story's take on the development of its economic system; the character is written to be likeable but becomes increasing brutal as he invests himself deeper into the corporate culture.|$|E
