2500|$|The Holocaust had a {{profound}} impact on the community in the United States, especially after 1960, as Jews tried to comprehend what had happened, and especially to commemorate and grapple with it when looking to the future. Abraham Joshua Heschel summarized this dilemma when he attempted to understand Auschwitz: [...] "To try to <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> commit a supreme blasphemy. Israel enables us to bear the agony of Auschwitz without radical despair, to sense a ray [...] God's radiance in the jungles of history." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, simply {{squaring}} many {{random numbers}} mod n produces {{a very large}} number of different prime factors, and so very long vectors and a very large matrix. The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> look specifically [...] for numbers a such that a2 mod n has only small prime factors (they are smooth numbers). They are harder to find, but using only smooth numbers keeps the vectors and matrices smaller and more tractable. The quadratic sieve searches for smooth numbers using a technique called sieving, discussed later, from which the algorithm takes its name.|$|E
2500|$|On May 5, 2013, Savant made {{an error}} in a {{combinatorics}} problem. The question was how many 4-digit briefcase combinations contain a particular digit (say 5, for example). She said the answer was 4000, yet people showed the correct answer—3439—using various strategies. [...] The incorrect answer of 4000 counted those combinations {{with more than one}} [...] "5" [...] multiple times (twice for [...] "1535", three times for [...] "1555", for instance). [...] So, the correct <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> take all possible combinations minus the combinations in which each digit is not a 5 to the nth power, or 10,000 - 94 = 3439.|$|E

2500|$|Petruchio's <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> psychologically tame Katherina, {{a method}} not frowned upon by society; [...] "the play signals a shift towards a [...] "modern" [...] way of {{managing}} the subordination of wives by legitimatising domination {{as long as it}} is not physical." [...] Detmer argues [...] "Shakespeare's [...] "shrew" [...] is tamed in a manner that would have made the wife-beating reformers proud; Petruchio's taming [...] "policy" [...] dramatises how abstention from physical violence works better. The play encourages its audience not only to pay close attention to Petruchio's method but also to judge and enjoy the method's permissibility because of the absence of blows and the harmonious outcome." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abbreviations, {{the use of}} {{a foreign}} language, variant spellings, or other unusual word tricks are {{indicated}} in the clue. A crossword creator might choose to clue the answer SEN (as in the abbreviation for [...] "senator") as [...] "Washington bigwig: Abbr." [...] or [...] "Member of Cong.", with the abbreviation in the clue indicating that the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be similarly abbreviated. The use of [...] "Var." [...] indicates the answer is a variant spelling (e.g., EMEER instead of EMIR), while the use of foreign language or a foreign place name within the clue indicates that the answer is also in a foreign language. For example, ETE ( [...] , French for [...] "summer") might be clued as [...] "Summer, in the Sorbonne". ROMA could be clued as [...] "Italia's capital", whereas the clue [...] "Italy's capital" [...] would indicate the English spelling Rome.|$|E

60|$|Have {{you seen}} Hyde's (Dr. not Mr.) letter about Damien? That {{has been one}} of my concerns; I have an answer in the press; and have just written a {{difficult}} letter to Damon trying to prepare him for what (I fear) must be to him extremely painful. The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> come out as a pamphlet; of which I make of course a present to the publisher. I am not a cannibal, I would not eat the flesh of Dr. Hyde,--and it is conceivable it will make a noise in Honolulu. I have struck as hard as I knew how; nor do I think my answer can fail to do away (in the minds of all who see it) with the effect of Hyde's incredible and really villainous production. What a mercy I wasn't this man's guest in the Morning Star! I think it would have broke my heart.|$|E
6000|$|The third {{reference}} I have to <b>answer,</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> my repeated assertion, {{that the}} evidence of manual labor {{is one of the}} chief sources of value in ornament, ("Seven Lamps," [...] p. 49, [...] "Modern Painters," [...] § 1, Chap. III.,) to which objection is made in these terms: [...] "We must here warn the reader against a remarkable error of Ruskin. The value of ornaments in architecture depends not in the slightest degree on the manual labor they contain. If it did, the finest ornaments ever executed would be the stone chains that hang before certain Indian rock-temples." [...] Is that so? Hear a parallel argument. [...] "The value of the Cornish mines depends not in the slightest degree on the quantity of copper they contain. If it did, the most valuable things ever produced would be copper saucepans." [...] It is hardly worth my while to answer this; but, lest any of my readers should be confused by the objection, and as I hold the fact to be of great importance, I may re-state it for them with some explanation.|$|E
60|$|The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{be found}} {{not in the}} extent or {{in the nature of}} the genius of either man, but in the {{condition}} of mind,--which indeed may be read plainly in their works by those who have eyes to see. The one was steadfast, industrious, full of purpose, never doubting of himself, always putting his best foot foremost and standing firmly on it when he got it there; with no inward trepidation, with no moments in which he was half inclined to think that this race was not for his winning, this goal not to be reached by his struggles. The sympathy of friends was good to him, but he could have done without it. The good opinion which he had of himself was never shaken by adverse criticism; and the criticism on the other side, by which it was exalted, came from the enumeration of the number of copies sold. He was a firm reliant man, very little prone to change, who, when he had discovered the nature of his own talent, knew how to do the very best with it.|$|E

60|$|Wise. That {{is easily}} done. The three {{thousand}} that were converted, (Acts the second,) repented not, till they had sight and sence of their sins: {159c} Paul repented not till he had sight and sence of his sins: the Jailor repented not till he had sight and sence of his sins: nor could they. For {{of what should}} a man repent? The Answer is, of Sin. What is it to Repent of sin? The <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> <b>To</b> be sorry for it, to turn from it. {159d} But how can a man be sorry for it, that has neither sight nor sence of it. David did, not only commit sins, but abode impenitent for them, untill Nathan the Prophet was sent from God {{to give him a}} sight and sence of them; {159e} and then, but not till then, he indeed repented of them. Job, in order to his Repentance, cries unto God, Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. And again, That which I see not teach thou me, I have born chastisement, I will not offend any more: {159f} That is, not in what I know, for I will repent of it; nor yet in what I know not, when thou shalt shew me it.|$|E

Paul repented not till he had sight and sense of his sins (Act 9). The jailer repented not till the had sight and sense of his sins; nor could they (Act 16). For of what should a man repent? The answer is, Of sin. What is it to repent of sin? The <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> <b>To</b> be sorry for it, to turn from it. But how can a man be sorry for it, that has neither sight nor sense of it?

David did not only commit sins, but abode impenitent for them, until Nathan the prophet was sent from God {{to give him a}} sight and sense of them; and then, but not till then, he indeed repented of them (2 Sam 12). Job, in order to his repentance, cries unto God, 'Show me wherefore thou contendest with me?' (Job 10:2). And again, 'That which I see not teach thou me, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more' (Job 34:32). That is, not in what I know, for I will repent of it; nor yet in what I know not, when thou shalt show me it. Also Ephraim's repentance was after he was turned to the sight and sense of his sins, and after he was instructed about the evil of them (Jer 31:18-20).|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{who admits}} that the {{business}} of fiction is to exhibit human life, can deny that scenes of misery and crime must of necessity, while human nature remains what it is, form part of that exhibition. Nobody can assert that such scenes are unproductive of useful results, when they are turned to a plainly and purely moral purpose. If I am asked why I have written certain scenes in this book, my <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{be found in the}} universally-accepted truth which the preceding words express. I have a right to appeal to that truth; for I guided myself by it throughout. In deriving the lesson which the following pages contain, from those examples of error and crime which would most strikingly and naturally teach it, I determined to do justice to the honesty of my object by speaking out. In drawing the two characters, whose actions bring about the darker scenes of my story, I did not forget that it was my duty, while striving to portray them naturally, to put them to a good moral use; and at some sacrifice, in certain places, of dramatic effect (though I trust with no sacrifice of truth to Nature), I have shown the conduct of the vile, as always, in a greater or less degree, associated with something that is selfish, contemptible, or cruel in motive. Whether any of my better characters may succeed in endearing themselves to the reader, I know not: but this I do certainly know:--that I shall in no instance cheat him out of his sympathies in favour of the bad.|$|E
