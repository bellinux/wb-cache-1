5|$|Immediately thereafter, Australian Greg Chappell, one of {{the leading}} batsmen of his time, became India's coach (2005) and {{identified}} Pathan's batting potential. Pathan improved his batting skills and tried to become a complete bowling all-rounder, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> the batting on occasions in ODIs and scored 93 in a Test match (10 Dec 2005, versus Sri Lanka in Delhi) in the role after an illness to Virender Sehwag. He made three scores beyond 80 in the space of four Test innings against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. For {{the first nine months of}} Chappell's stint at the helm, Pathan performed strongly with both bat and ball, scoring runs regularly and frequently taking top-order wickets. He rose to No. 2 in the ICC's ODI rankings for all-rounders and was also in the top five in the Test rankings. This led critics to compare him to former Indian pace bowling allrounder Kapil Dev.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1945, the Nazi {{governor}} (Reichskommissar) of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, {{offered to}} open up Amsterdam to food and coal shipments to ease {{the suffering of the}} civilian population.

After threatening Seyss-Inquart with prosecution for war crimes, Smith successfully negotiated for the provision of food to the suffering Dutch civilian population in the cities in the west of the country, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> discussions for the peaceful and complete German capitulation in the Netherlands, to the First Canadian Army, that did follow on the 5th of May.|$|E

At the end of the 1924–25 season, Woodfull scored 522 runs in four innings, including three centuries. After scoring three centuries, including a 236, in 1925–26, he was selected for the 1926 tour of England.|$|E

He loaned Glenn Miller money to launch Miller's successful band of 1938, but Dorsey saw the loan as an investment, entitling him to a percentage of Miller's income. When Miller balked at this, the angry Dorsey got even by sponsoring a new band led by Bob Chester, and hiring arrangers who deliberately copied Miller's style and sound. Dorsey branched out in the mid-1940s and owned two music publishing companies, Sun and Embassy. After opening at the Los Angeles ballroom, the Hollywood Palladium on the Palladium's first night, Dorsey's relations with the ballroom soured <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> a competing ballroom, the Casino Gardens circa 1944.

25|$|The Guthrie's design arose out of Ralph Rapson's {{work with}} the Walker Art Center, and {{concepts}} the Walker was considering for a small auditorium near their museum. The result was a theater designed by Rapson, that seated 1,441 people when it first opened its doors in 1963. Its irregularly-shaped stage, designed by Tanya Moiseiwitsch, had 7 sides and took up 1120 square feet (104 m²). Seating radiated outward and upward, and the ceiling was hung with acoustical panels that carried the asymmetrical theme {{to the top of}} the theater. The design concept encouraged the use of a minimal use of large set pieces. In 1974 the distinctive exterior screen, which had suffered from corrosion by the elements over the years, was removed. In 1980 Artistic Director Liviu Ciulei redesigned the stage. The stage itself was modified so that its size, shape and height was adjustable, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> up the back wall to create more depth.|$|E
