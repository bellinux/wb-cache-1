40|$|O artigo examina as relações entre imagem e linguagem, privilegiando o conceito de letra em Jacques Lacan. São tecidas considerações sobre esta articulação no sonho e na videoarte, examinando-se particularmente dois trabalhos do artista {{americano}} Gary Hill: Around and About (1980) e Ura Aru (1985 - 86). Defende-se a existência de dois pólos de incidência da letra: <b>aquele</b> de um encontro com a imagem e <b>aquele</b> de uma forte tensão em relação à imagem. Este último pode levar a uma quebra do funcionamento especular em prol de uma espécie de reviramento do imaginário, deixando entrever o que chamamos de "avesso do imaginário". Nesta virada, surge o sujeito em sua condição utópica, pois sem lugar e remetido a um devir imprevisível. This paper {{investigates the}} relationship between image and language, especially by using the lacanian concept of letter. This question is particularly explored in two works by the American videoartist Gary Hill: Around and About (1980) and Ura Aru (1985 - 86). We argue that the letter has two ways of incidence: a mix with image or a strong tension with it. This tension can, in some conditions, lead to a break in specular mode of functioning and provoke a kind of reversion of the imaginary, letting us approach what we name the "reverse of the imaginary". In this turning, the subject emerges in his utopic condition, since he has no definite place, but stands in an unforeseeable future...|$|E

We draw on works onSpanish and Catalan (Castroviejo Miró 2006 a,b; Alonso Cortés 1999) and develop a hypothesis capable ofexplaining why the demonstrative in EP can occupy such a position, which apparently is a post-nominal one. Wedefend the hypothesis that in this type of exclamative the post-nominal position of the demonstrative is the result ofan elliptical predicative clause. In order to understand the position of the demonstrative, we also analyse thestructures of wh-exclamatives, of predicative clauses and of degree phrases...|$|E
