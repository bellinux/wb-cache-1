5|$|Irish {{immigrants}} generally remained {{loyal to}} the Democratic Party, but McKinley's promises of sound money attracted German-Americans who were <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans had long been Democratic; efforts by that party to rebut McKinley, including circulating a statement by Bismarck in support of bimetallism, were ineffective. Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association had for him.|$|E
5|$|In August 1932 {{there was}} an {{unsuccessful}} uprising by General José Sanjurjo, who had been particularly <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> events in Castilblanco. The aims of the insurrection were vague, and it quickly turned into a fiasco. Among the generals tried and sent to Spanish colonies were four men who {{would go on to}} distinguish themselves fighting against the Republic in the civil war: the Duke of Seville, Martin Alonso, Ricardo Serrador Santés, and Heli Rolando de Tella y Cantos.|$|E
5|$|Many Samians were <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> {{the actions}} of their generals at Lade, and {{resolved}} to emigrate before their old tyrant, Aeaces of Samos, returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of Zancle to settle {{on the coast of}} Sicily, and took with them the Milesians who had managed to escape from the Persians. Samos itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade. Most of Caria now surrendered to the Persians, although some strongholds had to be captured through force.|$|E

It shows a disregard of public concern that is completely unacceptable from a public service broadcaster." ...|$|R
50|$|However, the Shadows {{continue}} to provide Londo assistance. This assistance culminates in their protection of Centauri supply lines during an assault by the Narn, enabling the Centauri to directly attack the Narn homeworld in a devastating assault using mass drivers (a method deemed <b>appalling</b> <b>by</b> most other races due to its use causing indiscriminate civilian casualties and severe damage to a planet's biosphere), leading to the surrender of the Narn soon thereafter.|$|R
5|$|Many Samians were <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> {{the actions}} of their generals at Lade, and {{resolved}} to emigrate before their old tyrant, Aeaces, returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of Zancle to settle {{on the coast of}} Sicily, and took with them such Milesians as had escaped from the Persians. Samos itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade. Meanwhile, Dionysius of Phocaea went to Sicily, and established himself as a pirate, preying on Carthaginian ships.|$|E
5|$|After Einarr {{had settled}} in Orkney two of Harald Finehair's unruly sons, Halvdan Hålegg (English: Hálfdan Longlegs) and Gudrød Ljome (English: Gudrod the Gleaming), killed Einarr's father Rognvald by {{trapping}} him in his house and setting it alight. Gudrød took possession of Rognvald's lands while Hálfdan sailed westwards to Orkney and then displaced Einarr. The sagas say that King Harald, apparently <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> his sons' actions, overthrew Gudrød and restored Rognvald's lands to his son, Thorir. From a base in Caithness on the Scottish mainland Einarr resisted Hálfdan's occupation of the islands. After winning a battle at sea, and a ruthless campaign on land, Einarr spied Hálfdan hiding on North Ronaldsay. The sagas claim that Hálfdan was captured, and sacrificed to Odin as a blood eagle.|$|E
5|$|Before its September 2011 release, Drive {{was shown}} {{at a number}} of film festivals, {{including}} the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it was praised and received a standing ovation. Refn won the festival's Best Director Award. The film received widespread praise, with critics highlighting Refn's direction, performances by the ensemble cast, visuals and action sequences, and the film score composed by Cliff Martinez. However, some critics were <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> its graphic violence and found it potentially detrimental to the film's box office success. Several critics listed Drive {{as one of the best}} films of 2011; it received various accolades, including Best Sound Editing nomination at the 84th Academy Awards.|$|E

5|$|Even though Champollion was <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> the rampant looting {{of ancient}} {{artefacts}} {{and destruction of}} monuments, the expedition {{also contributed to the}} destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled. Champollion's suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali's 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction of a museum in which to house the ancient artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham was {{involved}} in the transition to open democratic elections in South Africa. He had visited South Africa in 1982 with other black jurists and had been <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> the racial oppression he found and analogized to before the American Civil War. After apartheid's demise, Higginbotham consulted with Nelson Mandela and founded the South Africa Free Election (SAFE) Fund. He raised several million dollars to support fair elections in South Africa, and served as one of the international mediators of the first inter-racial elections in South Africa in 1994. After the election, he helped South Africa's newly elected government draft a new constitution.|$|E
5|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a missing {{documentary}} film crew who had gone to the Amazon to film cannibal tribes. A rescue mission, led by the New York University anthropologist Harold Monroe, recovers the film crew's lost cans of film, which an American television station wishes to broadcast. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> the team's actions, and after learning their fate, he objects to the station's intent to air the documentary. The presentation of the crew's lost footage, functioning similarly to a flashback, revolutionized the found footage style of narrative filmmaking, later popularized by such films as The Blair Witch Project.|$|E
5000|$|Gemeindebauten {{have become}} an {{important}} part of the architecture and culture of Vienna since the 1920s. Up to 1918, the housing conditions of Vienna's growing working class were <b>appalling</b> <b>by</b> modern standards. When the Social Democratic Party of Austria gained control of the municipal administration during Austria's First Republic (1918-1934) (so called [...] "Red Vienna"), it began the project of improving living conditions for workers. A large number of Gemeindebauten, usually large residential estates, were built during that time. Including those buildings that were finished after the events of February 1934, 64,000 apartments where completed, which created housing space for about 220,000 people. Apartments were assigned on the basis of a point system favoring families and less affluent citizens.|$|R
6000|$|The Doctor arose. [...] "Come here a moment." [...] Rose obeyed {{and stood}} beside her at the window, and they looked out across a stretch of roofs, heaped and humped into mountainous masses, blurred and blent and made <b>appalling</b> <b>by</b> smoke and plumes of steam. A scene as desolate as a {{burnt-out}} volcano--a jumble of hot bricks, jagged eave-spouts, gas-vomiting chimneys, spiked railings, glass skylights and lofty spires, a hideous and horrible stretch of stone and mortar, cracked and seamed into streets. It had no limits and it palpitated under the hot September sun, boundless and savage. At {{the bottom of the}} crevasses men and women speckled the pavement like minute larvæ.|$|R
60|$|In a {{paroxysm}} of fear, the boy {{closed the}} book, and thrust it from him. Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds; and rather to will {{that he should}} die at once, than be reserved for crimes, so fearful and <b>appalling.</b> <b>By</b> degrees, he grew more calm, and besought, in a low and broken voice, {{that he might be}} rescued from his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt.|$|R
5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to use Nonsuch Island as his base of operations throughout the 1930s, {{with the onset of}} World War II in 1939 it was announced that the ferry linking Bermuda to New York would soon be making its final run, requiring Beebe and his team to hastily abandon their station there. Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the environment was slowly being transformed due to the war. The large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island's reefs were being destroyed in order to construct an airfield, and the combination of construction activity and pollution made observation of the sea life impossible. <b>Appalled</b> <b>by</b> the destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island to a military contractor and returned to New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{never took}} place. Instead, the fighter force {{was committed to}} the disastrous Operation Bodenplatte, designed to support German forces during the Battle of the Bulge. Galland's influence on matters was now virtually nil. <b>Appalled</b> <b>by</b> the Ardennes losses, he personally confronted Gollob and criticised him severely. Gollob contacted the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Himmler's reputation {{as the most powerful}} man after Hitler at that time may have been a prime motive. Gollob complained about his misuse in the Luftwaffe and Galland's leadership. The SS had already spread their influence into other areas of military affairs including the V-2 operations. Himmler, whose relationship with Göring was poor, took the opportunity to exploit the dissent in the Luftwaffe and undermine the Reichsmarschall by supporting Gollob. It was also an opportunity for the SS to seize control of the Luftwaffe and for Himmler to oust Göring from power. Göring, for his part offered no support to Galland when Himmler or the SS were mentioned. On 13 January 1945, Galland was finally relieved of his command.|$|E
5|$|This victory did not {{delay the}} workhouse's fate; {{the site was}} duly sold to the Catholic Church for £110,000, and {{demolition}} began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E
25|$|Over {{six hundred}} Old Newingtonians enlisted during World War I {{and the loss}} of life was <b>appalling.</b> <b>By</b> war's end, 109 Old Boys had died for God, King and Country. Prior to 1920 the walls of the {{vestibule}} {{at the entrance to the}} Founders Wing had been hung with sporting teams photographs. In 1921 this space was transformed by the installation of white marble tablets, encased in Queensland maple, upon which were inscribed the names of Old Boys who had served. Those who had made the supreme sacrifice are listed on the central panels below the words: These Nobly Strining, Nobly Fell. With a black and white marble floor and stained glass door panels this space takes on the feel of a small chapel.|$|R

5|$|When {{the first}} Europeans entered Indiana during the 1670s, {{the region was}} in {{the final years of}} the Beaver Wars. The French {{attempted}} to trade with the Algonquian tribes in Indiana, selling them firearms in exchange for furs. This incurred the wrath of the Iroquois, who destroyed a French outpost in Indiana in retaliation. <b>Appalled</b> <b>by</b> the Iroquois, the French continued to supply the western tribes with firearms and openly allied with the Algonquian tribes. A major battle—and {{a turning point in the}} conflict—occurred near modern South Bend when the Miami and their allies repulsed a large Iroquois force in an ambush. With the firearms they received from the French, the odds were evened. The war finally ended in 1701 with the Great Peace of Montreal. Both Indian confederacies were left exhausted, having suffered heavy casualties. Much of Ohio, Michigan and Indiana was left depopulated as many tribes fled west to escape the fighting.|$|E
5|$|George {{was deeply}} devout and spent hours in prayer, but his piety was {{not shared by}} his brothers. George was <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> {{what he saw as}} their loose morals. In 1770, his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was exposed as an adulterer, and the {{following}} year Cumberland married a young widow, Anne Horton. The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession. George insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign. The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Shortly afterward, another of George's brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. The news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. Neither lady was ever received at court.|$|E
5|$|Soon, {{they find}} the espers and Terra convinces them to accept a truce with Gestahl. However, during the negotiations, Kefka attacks the espers, killing each of those still alive and {{capturing}} the magicite that remains from their essence. Additionally, he kills General Leo, who is <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> Kefka's dishonorable tactics and attempts to defend the espers. The Returners reunite, now aware that the peace was a ploy for Gestahl to obtain magicite and the stone statue remains of the Warring Triad within the espers' now-unsealed land. Kefka and Gestahl travel through the open gate to the esper world, find the Warring Triad, and prompt the island on which the esper world is located to detach and fly in the sky as an ominous Floating Continent. The Returners attempt {{to stop them from}} causing further damage, but despite their efforts, they are unable to prevent Kefka and Gestahl from gaining the power of the statues. Now empowered, Kefka promptly kills Gestahl and moves the statues out of their proper alignment, upsetting the balance of magical power and causing the destruction of most of the surface world. In the disaster, the Returners are separated from one another as Setzer's airship is torn apart.|$|E

5|$|The British {{campaign}} {{to abolish the}} slave trade is generally considered to have begun in the 1780s {{with the establishment of}} the Quakers' antislavery committees, and their presentation to Parliament of the first slave trade petition in 1783. The same year, Wilberforce, while dining with his old Cambridge friend Gerard Edwards, met Rev. James Ramsay, a ship's surgeon who had become a clergyman on the island of St Christopher (later St Kitts) in the Leeward Islands, and a medical supervisor of the plantations there. What Ramsay had witnessed of the conditions endured by the slaves, both at sea and on the plantations, horrified him. Returning to England after fifteen years, he accepted the living of Teston, Kent in 1781, and there met Sir Charles Middleton, Lady Middleton, Thomas Clarkson, Hannah More and others, a group that later became known as the Testonites. Interested in promoting Christianity and moral improvement in Britain and overseas, they were <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> Ramsay's reports of the depraved lifestyles of slave owners, the cruel treatment meted out to the enslaved, and the lack of Christian instruction provided to the slaves. With their encouragement and help, Ramsay spent three years writing An essay on the treatment and conversion of African slaves in the British sugar colonies, which was highly critical of slavery in the West Indies. The book, published in 1784, was to have an important impact in raising public awareness and interest, and it excited the ire of West Indian planters who in the coming years attacked both Ramsay and his ideas in a series of proslavery tracts.|$|E
25|$|The {{destruction}} of the Bamyan Buddhas {{became a symbol of}} oppression and a rallying point for the freedom of religious expression. Despite the fact that most Afghans are now Muslim, they too had embraced their past and many were <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> the destruction.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Hansen, a {{historian}} who was <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> the witch-craze {{and those who}} carried it out, proposed that coauthorship by Sprenger was a falsehood presented by Institoris (Kramer) and that approbation is partially a forgery.

40|$|Abstract The {{first and}} most {{prominent}} United Nations Millennium Development Goal (MDG- 1) has been widely celebrated. Yet, four reflections should give us pause. Although retaining the idea of ‘‘halving extreme poverty by 2015 ’’, MDG- 1 in fact sets a much less ambitious target than had been agreed to at the 1996 World Food Summit in Rome: {{that the number of}} poor should be reduced by 19 % (rather than 50 %), from 1094 million to 883. 5 million. Tracking the $ 1 /day poverty headcount, the World Bank uses a method that may paint far too rosy a picture of the evolution of extreme poverty. Shrinking the problem of extreme poverty, which now causes some 18 million deaths annually, by 19 % over 15 years is grotesquely underambitious in view of resources available and the magnitude of the catastrophe. Finally, this go-slow approach is rendered even more <b>appalling</b> <b>by</b> the contribution made to the persistence of severe poverty by the affluent countries and the global economic order they impose...|$|R
