500|$|By 1927, Cobby {{had been}} {{promoted}} to squadron leader, and the following year went to England to attend RAF Staff College, Andover. [...] Returning to Australia, he took over as CO of No.3 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, from Squadron Leader Frank Lukis on 13January 1930. At this time, the position of No.3 Squadron commander doubled as CO of the base. Though popular with his staff, Cobby was not known for his attention to detail. In December 1930, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore Richard Williams, arrived for an inspection and found the base to be {{in such a state}} of untidiness that he ordered every man on parade and gave them what was described as [...] "an almighty dressing down", threatening that Christmas leave would be cancelled unless the place was cleaned up. Having handed over to Squadron Leader Bill Bostock on 22November 1931, Cobby was promoted to wing commander on 1May 1933 and subsequently served as RAAF Director of Intelligence. [...] In this position he headed an interdepartmental committee that was formed in August 1933 to examine the possibilities of <b>air</b> <b>survey</b> and aerial <b>photography</b> to further national development. The committee's findings, presented in April 1934, favoured employing government agencies for such work and ultimately {{led to the formation of}} the North Australian Survey Flight from staff and aircraft of No.1 Squadron in April 1935. The resulting surveys of Queensland and the Northern Territory provided valuable input for the establishment of military airfields and other installations following the outbreak of World WarII. Restless in the inter-war years, Cobby retired from the Air Force to join the Civil Aviation Board as Controller of Operations in 1936; he also contributed to aviation magazines such as Australian Airmen and Popular Flying. His civil aviation duties included aircraft inspection, the issuing of licences and airworthiness certificates, maintenance of radio and meteorological services, and RAAF liaison.|$|R

A total of 149 physicians, predominantly from European countries, replied to the 28 -question survey. The results of the <b>AIR</b> <b>survey</b> were compared with a similar survey of 509 French pulmonologists conducted by the French National Reference Centre and the Network of Regional Competence Centres for Rare Lung Diseases. A number of positive findings emerged from the <b>AIR</b> <b>survey,</b> including the high level of multidisciplinary team involvement in both diagnosis and management. This survey, when taken together with the French survey, suggests that there is still a need to improve earlier diagnosis of IPF...|$|R

40|$|An unusual, highly modified, Baker reflector-corrector class {{telescope}} {{has been}} adapted for wide field <b>survey</b> <b>photography</b> {{in the near}} infrared. This optical system uses a full field corrector plate and a field flattening lens to provide a flat field subtending about 4. 5 deg on the sky. The small aperture telescope (20 inch primary) has been modified {{for use in the}} Newtonian focus configuration while preserving the optical elements of the Prime focus configuration. The telescope has been further modified to accept a very large format (146 mm diameter photocathode) image intensifier camera to serve as a detector. The camera output is recorded photographically on film rather than glass plates. This unique instrument system is used in a program of sky <b>survey</b> <b>photography</b> in the optical infrared (8000 - 9000 A bandpass) supplemented by visual bandpass photography. The photographs obtained with this system are of value not only for the extreme redness of the band but also because of their high resolution and their freedom from hydrogen emission...|$|R

40|$|A low-altitude aerial {{infrared}} (<b>AIR)</b> <b>survey</b> {{was conducted}} to identify hydraulic connections between aquifers and rivers and to map spatial surface temperature patterns along boreal rivers. In addition, the stable isotopic compositions (delta O- 18, delta D), dissolved silica (DSi) concentrations and electrical conductivity of water in combination with AIR data were used as tracers to verify the observed groundwater discharge into the river system in a boreal catchment. Based on low temperature anomalies in the <b>AIR</b> <b>survey,</b> around 370 groundwater discharge sites were located along the main river channel and its tributaries (203 km altogether). On {{the basis of the}} <b>AIR</b> <b>survey,</b> the longitudinal temperature patterns of the studied rivers differed noticeably. The stable isotopes and DSi composition revealed major differences between the studied rivers. The groundwater discharge locations identified in the proximity of 12 municipal water intake plants during the low-flow seasons should be considered as potential risk areas for water intake plants during flood periods (groundwater quality deterioration due to bank infiltration), and should be taken under consideration in river basin management under changing climatic situations...|$|R
