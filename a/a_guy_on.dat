Because I love so many different genres, it's kind of hard to just pick one thing to do, so I just did everything!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Frey {{came up with}} a {{cinematic}} {{scenario of}} a person who, tired from driving a long distance in a desert, saw a place for a rest and pulled in for the night, but entered [...] "a weird world peopled by freaky characters", and became [...] "quickly spooked by the claustrophobic feeling of being caught in a disturbing web from which he may never escape." [...] In an interview with Cameron Crowe, Frey said that he and Henley wanted the song [...] "to open like an episode of the Twilight Zone", and added: [...] "We take this guy and make him like a character in The Magus, where every time he walks through a door there’s a new version of reality. We wanted to write a song just like it was a movie." [...] Frey described the song in an interview with NBC's Bob Costas as a cinematic montage [...] "just one shot to the next ... a picture of <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> the highway, a picture of the hotel, the guy walks in, the door opens, strange people." [...] Frey continued: [...] "We decided to create something strange, just {{to see if we could}} do it." [...] Henley then wrote most of the lyrics based on Frey's idea, and sought inspiration for the writing by driving out into the desert as well as from films and theater.|$|E

5000|$|It's {{probably}} {{not a case of}} Bonfire Night decline, but rather a shift in priorities ... there are new trends in the bonfire ritual.

The emphasis has moved. The bonfire with <b>a</b> <b>Guy</b> <b>on</b> top - indeed the whole story of the Gunpowder Plot - has been marginalised. But the spectacle remains.|$|E

The guyed mast of such constructions is usually less tall than the free-standing basement tower.|$|R

50|$|Regarding the song's title, Vedder stated:Yeah, {{that song}} {{was based on}} a remake of the brown {{corduroy}} jacket that I wore.

The ultimate one as far as being co-opted was that there was <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> TV, predictably patterned, I guess, after the way I was looking those days, with long hair and an Army T-shirt. They put this new character on a soap opera, so there was a guy, more handsome than I, parading around on General Hospital. And the funny thing is, that guy was Ricky Martin.|$|E
