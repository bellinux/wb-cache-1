40|$|The {{analysis}} of the experiences of Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEs) in transition, which became EU members in the historical 2004 (and 2007) enlargement, evidences the importance of timing and targeting policy intervention for a balanced growth (Monasterolo et. al, 2008). In fact, even if the Countries, till the last financial and economic crisis, showed a clear path of convergence (EC, 2008; EC, 2009) with EU average levels of development thanks to a sustained growth in GDP, {{at the same time}} they had to face a notable increase in regional inequality (Brasili, 2005), mainly driven by the persisting backwardness of agricultural and rural areas. The European pre-accession funds had limited effect in preventing the spread in internal divergence because of the lack of ex ante and in itinere monitoring and evaluation (Monasterolo, 2008). Moreover, they failed in addressing specific problems and needs of so variegated areas due to the deficiencies in identifying and defining the characteristics of rural areas (Csáki, 2009). This paper will introduce a new map of Serbia, <b>a</b> current EU <b>pre-accession</b> <b>Country,</b> where <b>a</b> clear identification of rural areas is still lacking (Bogdanov, 2007). We identified the dynamic characteristics of urban and rural areas as well as their strengths and weaknesses, computing a principal components analysis on a group of 37 socio-economic, agricultural and structural variables, which are available periodically at a municipality level. Then, we delineated homogeneous regions through the cluster analysis.

40|$|In an era {{of rapid}} {{technological}} change, information exchange, and emergence of knowledge-intensive industries {{it is critical to}} be able to identify the future skill needs of the labour market. Growing unemployment in EU member states and <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries</b> in Eastern Europe combined with technological changes which make the skills of a significant number of workers obsolescent each year demand adequate knowledge of medium- and long-term demand for specific skills. Some EU members states have developed employment forecasting methods to identify future skill requirements which take account of the sectoral, occupational, and educational and training factors which influence supply and demand in the labour market for skills. A number of countries in Eastern Europe which are preparing to join the EU are interested in developing employment forecasting models that would provide them with similar information relating to skills. Taking account of the requirements of the Single European Market and increasing international mobility, it is desirable that the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries</b> should develop models which, if possible, are comparable with existing methods of forecasting training and qualification needs in existing member states of the EU. This task requires regular medium-term forecasts which will extend the time horizon of decision makers beyond the current economic cycle, be applicable to the whole economy, allow speedy adjustment to changing circumstances, and which will take account of relevant factors such as investment plans, output and labour productivity forecasts, and technological change. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a summary of existing methods and data sets used to forecast education and training needs in four members of the European Union, in order to motivate similar work in three <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries.</b> We first provide a detailed account of the different approaches to forecast education and training needs in France, Germany, Ireland and The Netherlands. For each of these countries, we consider the labour market data on which employment forecasts are based and the current methods in use, examine how data reliability and accuracy of forecasts are dealt with, and discuss the dissemination and usage of forecast information generated by those systems.

40|$|Are there {{indications}} of {{real exchange rate misalignment}} {{in the case}} of the five <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries?</b> Will stable real exchange rates, required by two of the Maastricht criteria, be in line with economic fundamentals in the pre-EMU period in these countries? In order to address these questions, we employ the concept of the fundamental real exchange rate (FRER), taking into account the specific features of countries in the advanced stage of transition. The FRER model approximates the integration gain with the impact of foreign direct investment on trade and allows for larger current account deficits if external debt is below a safety limit. The model coefficients are calibrated according to our previous econometric work. Sensitivity tests are used to deal with uncertainty about the baseline assumptions. According to the FRERs, there were signs of overvaluation for all the pre-accession economies, with the exception of Slovenia, at the end of 2001. The second main finding relates to the feasibility of stable real exchange rates in the pre-EMU period. Stability of real exchange rates will not automatically be in line with economic fundamentals in the forthcoming period and, moreover, the FRERs do not move in one direction in all the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries.</b> This finding suggests that some flexibility of exchange rates will be needed in the forthcoming period.

We find that the variance of co-financing rate across countries is poorly explained by different composition of sectors of investment.

We find that while the absolute level of grants is related to sectors, the EU co-financing rate depends on countries. There is no justification in economic analysis of such a country bias, because the variability of economic rate of returns is unrelated either to sector or country factors. These findings points to the need of a more consistent approach to evaluation and EU co-financing of infrastructure supported by the EU funds.

40|$|At {{their meeting}} in February, the EU Council of Ministers {{acknowledged}} the deficiencies in BSE testing {{which had been}} found in Germany. Following discussion of this issue, Commissioner Byrne (Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection) urged ministers to review their own national procedures for BSE testing. In his briefing to the Agriculture Council, Commissioner Byrne noted that the total number of BSE cases in mainland Europe had almost doubled in 2001 to 957 cases. It was felt that this {{is more likely to be}} a consequence of increased testing and detection, rather than any increased incidence of the disease. However concerns were expressed over the age profile of the infected animals, with animals born as recently as 1998 testing positive for BSE. This is a clear indication that cattle were still being exposed to infection at that date, probably through contaminated meat and bone meal. The view was expressed that many of the mistakes which had been made in EU member countries were now being repeated in <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries.</b> Commissioner Byrne warned that the massive accumulation of stocks of meat and bone meal must be destroyed quickly, otherwise it would be only a matter of time before an accident or fraud led to a serious incident. Comment: It was recognised some time ago that the introduction of compulsory testing would overstretch the capacity of member states' laboratories to undertake the task. Against this background there may be some grounds for concern that EU meat which has not been effectively tested for BSE may be slipping through the net and be available for export to third countries. This is potentially a source of concern to ACP countries not only from a public health perspective but also from a production and export perspective. Should any of this suspect EU beef find its way into the markets of beef exporting ACP countries, these countries could find their BSE free status compromised, with serious consequences for their exports.

40|$|While EU beef {{production}} fell by 1. 8 % in 2001 (to 7. 26 million tonnes) {{from the}} already {{low levels of}} 2000, beef consumption was down 12 % compared to 1999 (to 6. 7 million tonnes). This exerted strong downward pressure on EU beef prices, which dropped below intervention-price levels and even in some countries below the safety-net level. Consequently intervention-stock levels grew rapidly to around 259, 000 tonnes by mid-December 2001. Prices only slowly recovered but were still below the intervention level by year end. Production {{is expected to increase}} in 2002 - 2003 as purchase for destruction schemes are discontinued, to reach 7. 7 million tonnes by 2004. It will then fall back slightly before rising to 7. 75 million tonnes by 2009. While consumption is recovering from the BSE-related consumer scares, there remains a downward trend in per capita beef consumption in the EU. Beef imports are set to grow slightly over the period as 'double zero' agreements with <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries</b> come into effect. The re-opening of major export markets following the FMD crisis is leading to a recovery in EU beef exports (to 500, 000 tonnes in 2001). Exports are projected to grow to 740, 000 tonnes in 2003 - 2004, after which they may fall back slightly. Comment: Total EU beef exports are heavily dependent on the Russian market. Any changes in the Russian import regime or any economic problems in Russia can leave tens of thousands of tonnes of beef each month looking for temporary export markets. ACP beef producers will have to stay alert to these temporary fluctuations in the destination of EU beef exports and try to establish the capacity to effectively protect their markets when sudden import surges from the EU might undermine the functioning of national and regional markets important to ACP beef producers.

40|$|Summary: In 1992 Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary {{signed the}} Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). In time, Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, while Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Macedonia joined CEFTA. However, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia left CEFTA on {{entering}} the European Union, which Bulgaria and Romania also joined later. The latter two, however, signed, along with 8 other parties (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and UNMIK Kosovo), the Agreement on Amendment of and Accession to the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA 2006) on 19 December 2006. This new CEFTA will replace over thirty bilateral free trade agreements concluded among them. After a short introduction, this paper {{argues that the}} purpose of CEFTA is to enable its members to enter the EU more easily, and thus serves as an instrument of EU accession. Reference is made to the most important benefit of the old CEFTA, which was the common preparation for integration to the EU’s market.

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of 2000 the European accession process was placed at the centre of peace-building in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The prospect of EU membership provided a common vision that could encourage different segments of society and the political elites to bridge ethnic divergences and engage in authentic post-war reconciliation. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>pre-accession</b> criterion the European Union required Bosnia and Herzegovina to unify its fragmented policing system {{at the level of}} the state. However, this requirement proved to be a step too far, resulting in a protracted and ultimately unsuccessful process of political negotiations that lasted from 2004 to 2007. This thesis analyses the police reform negotiating process. In the aftermath of interethnic violence, ethnic communities tend to focus on protecting their self-continuity and, as a result, aspects of identity and security become closely linked. It was for this reason that the European Union’s insistence on placing law enforcement authority at the state level in Bosnia and Herzegovina came to be viewed as an identity threat, which subsequently affected interethnic group dynamics in a negative way. From this premise, the study goes on to assess the impact of the negotiating process on the political discourse in Bosnia and Herzegovina and on public notions of societal security. The study illustrates the background and rationale of the European Union’s strategy and analyses the dynamics between the international community and the domestic political elite. The conclusions of the thesis are drawn from interviews with the principal domestic politicians and the main international policymakers of the international community, and also from a broad range of opinion surveys as well as the original documentation of the negotiating process...|$|R

On 8 April 1994, the Government of the Republic of Poland made a formal request, in Athens, for membership in the European Union. During the European Council summit held in Essen on 9-10 December 1994, Member States adopted <b>a</b> <b>pre-accession</b> strategy, defining the areas and forms of cooperation recognized by the EU as essential to speed up integration. This process also confirmed that the EU was willing to go through with enlargement to associated countries. Formal confirmation of the strategy outlined in the White Paper (on the alignment of countries with the requirements of the internal free-market) which was adopted at the European Council Summit in Cannes in June 1995. The White Paper, and the annual preparatory programs adopted by the Polish government, determined the framework and the relations of Poland with the EU. On 3 October 1996, under the resolution passed by the Council of Ministers on 26 January 1991, the Office for European Integration came into force with its purpose to coordinate and assist all ministries and institutions directly involved in the process of Polish integration with the European Union. The primary role of the Office for European Integration was to ensure the implementation of the tasks related to coordinating policies on matters related to the integration of Poland into the European Union.

40|$|The Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD) was <b>a</b> <b>pre-accession</b> instrument, {{created and}} {{implemented}} by the European Union since 1999 and aimed at providing logistical support to applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe. The programme had two main components: providing non-refundable financial assistance, by stimulating regional economic growth and development and, at the same time, it was directed at implementing certain management systems that matched the development policies of the EU. The effects triggered by {{the implementation of the}} SAPARD Programme in Romanian tourism were assessed in the past years from various quantitative perspectives (number of projects, value of the granted funding), but the regional economic impact generated strictly by this programme hasn’t yet been explicitly and unequivocally pointed out. From this standpoint, the previous research has been mainly focused on pre/post implementation comparisons of the GDP and of the unemployment rate. On a national level, the Suceava county stands out in terms of the large number of SAPARD projects funded through the Measure 3. 4 – The development and diversification of economic activities to generate multiple activities and alternative income, thus leading to an increasing number of boarding houses in rural areas and, at the same time, fostering the qualitative development of the tourism supply in the area. From our point of view, an analytical approach of the multiplying effect generated by the SAPARD Programme would start from the thorough measurement of the economic changes that have occurred locally, in relation to the weight of the absorbed grants. The preliminary results arrived at in less than 5 years since the suspension of this funding source pinpoint a rather insignificant contribution of these funds to the local economy. The lack of experience of the parties involved in the system, bureaucracy and the migration of the non-refundable money are the most probable causes of the selection and implementation of projects that were rather unsustainable and inadequate in terms of quality...|$|R

One of the criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of any country isrepresented by the percentage of services from around economy and opportunities for growth withthe development of multiple hoists on the real economy, but also {{and the evolution of}} Romaniansociety. În the results of my study, I show that after a decade with increases and decreases, due tothe economic crisis, the share of Romania's services is on an upward path...|$|R

Since the opening of accession negotiations in February 2000 with six new candidate countries (Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia), as decided by the Helsinki European Council, the Committee of the Regions entered in <b>a</b> <b>pre-accession</b> dialogue with the regions and cities of these countries as well as making initial contacts with those of Turkey. The CoR has had a key contribution to make to the success of the forthcoming EU enlargement due to its closeness to citizens and to its natural links with the local and regional elected representatives of the applicant countries. Indeed, the CoR first made contact with elected representatives of the candidate countries in 1997. These relations have been formalized through the establishment of a number of joint committees for the Association Council with representatives of local and regional authorities of candidate countries, and the CoR now plans to welcome these colleagues as observers. The local and regional authorities of the applicant countries have a major role to play in developing modem democracy in their countries and implementing pre-enlargement institutional reforms. In addition, the success of accession to the European Union relies on a better preparation and information of the citizens of these countries, and here again local and regional authorities have high responsibilities. And we know their role will grow further, especially with the process of devolution currently underway in these countries. This study complements the first CoR study "A Europe of Regions and Cities - Strategies and Prospects for EU Enlargement" on the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Cyprus published in 2000. It highlights significant differences with the countries dealt with in the first study in particular a strong history of centralism. However, there are positive driving forces to decentralisation and regionalisation to be seen, such as a convergence of regional identities and regional administrative structures. N/...|$|R

Subsidy reform has been a key component of the pre-accession reform agenda of the 10 new member states that joined the EU in 2004 (EU- 10). During the <b>pre-accession</b> period, these <b>countries</b> had to undertake a number of important structural reforms in their economies. One of the most critical reforms was to reduce, and in some cases, eliminate their subsidy programs. This paper analyzes how key subsidy reforms (in state aid to enterprises, agriculture, energy, and transportation) were carried out in the EU- 10 during 1995 – 2005, and explains observed variations across types of subsidies and across countries. Based on an extensive qualitative analysis, the paper draws lessons for future successful reforms of government subsidies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{product market}} policies in Croatia by benchmarking them to OECD countries and highlighting how {{policies that are}} more conducive to competition would stimulate a more efficient allocation of resources and, in consequence, facilitate convergence to higher income levels. OECD indicators of overall regulation in product markets indicate that Croatias policies in 2007 were generally more restrictive of competition than were the policies in OECD countries. This {{is especially true for}} policies concerned with the degree of state control of the economy and with barriers to entrepreneurship. Regulatory obstacles to trade and foreign direct investment, by contrast, are in line with those of <b>pre-accession</b> European Union <b>countries</b> (Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic, and Poland in 2003, as well as Bulgaria and Romania in 2006), albeit well above the OECD average. Regulation of post, electricity, gas, telecoms, air, rail, and road transport, as estimated by the OECD energy transport and communication sectors indicator, is also less liberal than in the OECD, highlighting the positive knock-on effects {{for the rest of the}} economy that could derive from further liberalization of network industries.
