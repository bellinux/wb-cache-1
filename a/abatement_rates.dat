40|$|This text {{reviews the}} {{assessments}} of marginal abatement costs of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture. We use agricultural emissions {{and the corresponding}} prices collected from 21 studies that have assessed abatement potentials and costs using various modeling approaches and assumptions. We first highlight {{the implications of the}} modeling approach for marginal abatement costs. Harmonized <b>abatement</b> <b>rates</b> for three emission prices (10, 20 and 50 Â [euro] 2005 /tCO 2 eq) are regressed on variables that reflect various modeling assumptions and study characteristics. In a second step, the emission price is introduced as an explanatory variable. When controlling for a few key characteristics of the studies, the models explain an important share of the observed variability in <b>abatement</b> <b>rates.</b> The type of modeling approach is found to have a significant effect. In particular, we find that equilibrium models lead to higher <b>abatement</b> <b>rates</b> for a given price. The flexibility in nitrogen use and its effect on crop yields also plays a significant role in lowering marginal abatement costs. The results of the second step indicate that the price elasticity of the abatement rate is about 0. 6. This estimate is found to be robust to several specifications and consistent with previous assessments covering other economic sectors.

In the present study, it was revealed that there is a strong positive correlation between inter-electrode space, and TD, COD as well as BOD <b>abatement</b> <b>rates</b> and rate of coefficients. The pseudo-first-order abatement kinetic was relatively fitted. The decrease in the distance between electrodes from 10.0 to 2.5  cm increased the rate constant from 0.01 to 0.026  min− 1 for TD, 0.007 to 0.020  min− 1 for COD and 0.006 to 0.018  min− 1 for BOD using Al–Fe electrode combination and from 0.008 to 0.019  min− 1 for TD, 0.006 to 0.015  min− 1 for COD and 0.005 to 0.014  min− 1 for BOD using Fe–Al electrode combination. The increase in the rate constant of both Al–Fe and Fe–Al electrode combinations may be ascribed to the decrease of TD, COD and BOD of the STS water. The use of this kinetic study showed high correlation coefficients (r 2  ≥  0.959). Thus, the kinetic study is more suitable for explaining the efficiency of distance between electrodes for electrolytic treatment.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters on the economic and health consequences of lead paint abatement regulations. The first chapter studies the effect of state-level lead paint abatement regulations on housing markets, focusing on house prices, rents and the allocation of households across houses with different health risks. State lead abatement mandates require owners of old houses to mitigate lead hazards {{in the presence of}} small children. I estimate the effects of these mandates on the housing market using a triple differences strategy that exploits differences by state, year, and housing vintage. The estimates suggest a large fraction of the abatement costs fall on property owners, with house prices for multi-family properties declining by 6. 4 % and single-family homes declining 4. 3 %. These effects persist for at least a decade, consistent with low <b>abatement</b> <b>rates.</b> Families with small children bear part of the mandates' costs, too: after a mandate, these families are 17 % less likely to live in old houses, and they pay higher rents for safer homes. These results suggest that the mandates have important real distributional consequences despite evidence of low <b>abatement</b> <b>rates.</b> The second chapter analyzes the impact of state-level lead paint abatement regulations on children's health and educational outcomes in a difference-in-differences framework [...] Lead poisoning has long-lasting consequences on children's health, as well as on their cognitive and non-cognitive abilities. Abatement mandates reduce the rate of elevated blood lead levels by 29 %. Moreover, the mandates decrease the rate of enrollment in special education in exposed cohorts by 8. 1 %, indicating a {{reduction in the number of}} children with disabilities. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that this decrease in the rate of enrollment in special education induces savings between $ 17. 5 and $ 111 million per state-cohort on average, while the increased lifetime earnings from the reduction in blood lead levels could lead to increased tax revenues in the order of $ 2. 8 million per state-cohort on average. However, the reduction in special education enrollment does not appear to be reflected in improvements in educational outcomes, as I find no evidence that average fourth-grade test scores and disciplinary actions change with the mandates. The third chapter analyzes both the selection of houses into compliance and individuals' valuation of lead-safe housing using address-level housing, environmental and health data. Lead paint in old homes is the major source of lead poisoning for US children despite federal and local regulations concerning the mitigation of lead hazards and the disclosure of lead status of a house whenever known. By leveraging detailed information on property owners, I find that small landlords are more likely to have non-compliant properties. Distressed landlords as indicated either by high loan to value ratios or by distressed sales have similar bad outcomes. By leveraging sales data, I estimate that the finding of a lead hazard significantly decreases the value of a house. by Ludovica A. Gazze. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} the {{treatment}} of an industrial wastewater containing Cr (VI) by electrocoagulation using Al or Fe electrodes, in a discontinuous system with forced recirculation of the solution. Treatment of the waste impurities is achieved by electrocoagulation whereas Cr (VI) removal requires its reduction to Cr (III) prior to precipitation {{in the form of}} neutral hydroxide. The speciation of the various trivalent species, namely Cr (III), Fe (III) and Al (III) was investigated to determine the optimal pH range for treatment of Cr-containing wastes by using Al or Fe electrodes. With aluminium electrodes, the presence of Cr (VI) does not affect the COD abatement. Moreover Cr (VI) species was observed to be faster removed from the wastewater with higher current densities. However it was shown that the occurrence of the direct electrochemical reduction of Cr (VI) at the Al cathode surface, does not suffice to predict the experimental reduction rates. With Fe electrodes, COD abatement by electrocoagulation is retarded by the presence of Cr (VI), whereas the rate of iron dissolution is unaffected by chromate in the wastewater. The observed difference in the COD <b>abatement</b> <b>rates</b> suggests that the removal of generated Cr (III) by precipitation might be assisted by the presence of coagulant Fe(OH) 3. Removal of Cr (VI) from the wastewater in the cell could be successfully modelled taking into account the chemical reaction with electrogenerated Fe (II), its side oxidation by air oxygen, and the electrochemical reduction of Cr (VI) at the iron cathode...|$|E

In this study we develop a high-resolution inventory of Hg emissions at 0. 05 ° [*]×[*]  0. 05 ° for Jiangsu, China, using a bottom-up approach and then compare the results with available global/national inventories. With detailed information on individual sources and the updated emission factors from field measurements applied, the annual Hg emissions of anthropogenic origin in Jiangsu in 2010 are estimated at 39   105  kg, of which 51, 47, and 2  % were Hg 0, Hg 2 +, and Hg p, respectively. This provincial inventory is thoroughly compared to three downscaled national inventories (NJU, THU, and BNU) and two global ones (AMAP/UNEP and EDGARv 4. tox 2). Attributed to varied methods and data sources, clear information gaps exist in multi-scale inventories, leading to differences in the emission levels, speciation, and spatial distributions of atmospheric Hg. The total emissions in the provincial inventory are 28, 7, 19, 22, and 70  % larger than NJU, THU, BNU, AMAP/UNEP, and EDGARv 4. tox 2, respectively. For major sectors, including power generation, cement, iron and steel, and other coal combustion, the Hg contents (HgC) in coals/raw materials, <b>abatement</b> <b>rates</b> of air pollution control devices (APCDs) and activity levels are identified as the crucial parameters responsible for the differences in estimated emissions between inventories. Regarding speciated emissions, a larger fraction of Hg 2 + is found in the provincial inventory than national and global inventories, resulting mainly from the results by the most recent domestic studies in which enhanced Hg 2 + were measured for cement and iron and steel plants. Inconsistent information on large power and industrial plants is the main source of differences in spatial distribution of emissions between the provincial and other inventories, particularly in southern and northwestern Jiangsu, where intensive coal combustion and industry are located.

For this purpose, the effect of initial S 2 O 82 - (0 - 5. 0 mM) and OPPE (10 - 100 mg/L) concentrations on OPPE and its organic carbon content (TOC) removal were investigated at an initial reaction pH of 6. 5. Results indicated that very fast OPPE degradation (100 %) accompanied with high TOC <b>abatement</b> <b>rates</b> (90 %) could be achieved for 10 and 20 mg/L aqueous OPPE at elevated S 2 O 82 - concentrations (> 2. 5 mM).

S 2 O 82 -/UV-C oxidation of OPPE was also compared with the relatively well-known and established H 2 O 2 /UV-C oxidation process. Treatment results showed that the performance of S 2 O 82 -/UV-C was comparable to that of H 2 O 2 /UV-C oxidation for the degradation and mineralization of OPPE. In order to elucidate the relative reactivity and selectivity of SO 4 ●- and HO●, bimolecular reaction rate coefficients of OPPE with SO 4 ●- and HO● were determined by employing competition kinetics with aqueous phenol (47 M) selected as the reference compound. The first-order abatement rate coefficient obtained for OPPE during S 2 O 82 -/UV-C oxidation (0. 044 min- 1) was found to be significantly lower than that calculated for phenol (0. 397 min- 1).

Average abatement efﬁciency rates, for the ﬁrst and {{the second year of}} study, were: biochemical oxygen demand over ﬁve days (BOD 5) (96. 4 %, 92. 0 %), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (84. 6 %, 77. 7 %), total suspended solids(TSS) (94. 8 %, 89. 9 %),total nitrogen(TN) (79. 5 %, 66. 0 %),ammonium nitrogen(NH 4 +-N) (98. 8 %, 86. 6 %) and total phosphorous (TP) (83. 7 %, 82. 8 %). Average abatement efﬁciency for nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 −-N) (− 1280. 5 %, − 961. 1 %) and nitrite nitrogen (NO 2 −-N) (− 5. 8 %, − 40. 0 %) were negative because its content in inﬂuent wastewater was very low and they appear mainly from inﬂuent NH 4 +-N, as a result of puriﬁcation processes carried out in the HF-CW bed. The <b>abatement</b> <b>rates</b> make the system suitable to produce discharges into the environment in accordance with Spanish law. It is noteworthy that the HF-CW patch suffered an episode of bed drying during the summer of 2013, whereby the causes were related to system oversizing and high evapotranspiration in the area. As a consequence, the decrease in the abatement of water pollutants during the second year {{can be attributed to the}} creation of preferential water ﬂow paths and short circuits through the constructed wetland (CW) bed. As a result of the oversizing of the CW, a theoretical resizing based on BOD 5, TSS, TN or TP is proposed. The calculated values for the redesign were: 5. 22 m 2 considering DBO 5, 0. 18 m 2 considering TSS, 10. 14 m 2 considering TN and 23. 83 m 2 considering TP. Considering the area where the HF-CW was located and in accordance with Spanish law for non-sensitive areas (no TN or TP requirements for wastewater discharge), BOD 5 is the most appropriate parameter for design; it is 5. 2 times lower than the HF-CW initially built and without risk of bed drying...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of excess organic matter into a system, {{commonly referred to}} as eutrophication (Nixon, 1995), is a widespread problem in estuaries throughout much of the world. To combat this trend, many management agencies are imposing regulations limiting the amount of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) which can be discharged into coastal waters through wastewater treatment and agriculture. In 2005, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) enacted legislation mandating that wastewater treatment facilities (WWTF) discharging their effluent into Narragansett Bay and its tributaries reduce the concentration of nitrogen in their effluent. This legislation will reduce wastewater nitrogen loading to the bay by 50 % by 2014 with the ultimate goal of improving water quality, reducing hypoxia, and restoring lost ecosystem services (e. g. seagrass) to the bay. Early stages of this reduction took place between 2005 - 2009, reducing loadings at 11 WWTF’s which discharge into the bay from 16 - 20 mg/l total nitrogen to either 8 or 5 mg/l. Response of other estuaries to similar reductions in loading has been varied and complex, with relatively few ecosystems showing straightforward linear reductions in concentration, productivity, and chlorophyll with reduced load. The overall goal {{of this study is to}} quantify the impact of these initial loading reductions on the standing stock (Chapter 1), seasonal cycling (Chapter 2), and mass-balance (Chapter 3) of nitrogen and phosphorus in Narragansett Bay. To accomplish this goal, we first reviewed data from a five-year study of surface nutrient concentration at 13 stations throughout Narragansett Bay (Chapter 1). Because Narragansett Bay is aligned along a north-south gradient of decreasing urbanization and most sources of nutrients to the bay are located in or around the city of Providence, at the head of the estuary, we can establish down-bay relationships of nutrient constituents to see how their concentrations change spatially throughout the bay, and compare these relationships to past studies. We can also use established volume relationships to estimate the total standing stock of nutrients in the bay at any given time, and compare how this changes over the course of a year during the present survey and during past surveys. In response to a 30 % reduction in the total annual load of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from all sources, which corresponds to a 17 % reduction in total nitrogen, we saw measurable reductions in downbay concentrations and standing stocks approximately on par with these reductions. Phosphorus concentrations in the bay have declined dramatically (30 - 50 %) in part due to recent loading reductions, but also in part due to management action in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s to remove phosphates from detergents and industrial surfactants. We also see changes in the way nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium are used on a downbay gradient, which we hypothesize are related to the loading reductions. In order to fully understand the impact of load reductions on the ecosystem, we must also consider how the nutrients in the system have changed over the long-term, both in terms of annual cycling, and in terms of response to changing climate in the bay. This analysis constitutes the second chapter of the dissertation. Over the last 50 - 100 years, Narragansett Bay has grown measurably warmer, and weather patterns have changed, bringing increased cloud cover, more storms, and more precipitation. All of these changes impact the way nutrients enter the bay, and the way phytoplankton use the nutrients. We examined the impact of these potential changes using a long-term weekly dataset of nutrient concentrations collected by the MERL lab at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography since 1978. We use both conventional statistics and a state-space model formulated in the computing language R (SSPIR). Our results show virtually no long-term trend or change in timing of seasonal cycling of nutrients or chlorophyll. However, we do see changes in the seasonal patterns of concentration of both nutrients and chlorophyll at the GSO station, with measurable changes in cumulative distribution function for phosphate, silicate, ammonium, and chlorophyll. We also observe statistically significant reductions over the course of the time series for nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and phosphate, though it is difficult to ascribe causality to these changes. Model results were largely inconclusive, but show a marginally significant intervention effect attributable to the loading reduction in the ammonium signal at the GSO dock, with no significant long-term trend observed for any analyte. Finally, we conduct a mass-balance nutrient budget assessment for nitrogen and phosphorus in Narragansett Bay (Chapter 3). Mass-balance is a common way of tracing the sources, sinks, and reservoirs of nutrients in a system, and seeing how these components might change with time. Nutrient budgets for Narragansett Bay have been compiled approximately every decade, but recent and future loadings compel a reanalysis to determine how the system is responding to initial stage reductions. We see a reduction in WWTF loading to the bay of just over 100 million moles of nitrogen and 4 million moles of phosphorus, which constitutes about 20 and 16 percent of the net annual load of nitrogen and phosphorus from all sources. However, much of this reduction is realized in tributary rivers, and variable riverine <b>abatement</b> <b>rates</b> in those rivers mean that some of the net reduction is not felt by the bay proper. Furthermore, evidence from literature suggests that changes in bay sediment net denitrification rate may be offsetting some or all of the loading reductions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{focuses on}} {{environmental}} policies aimed at rising investment in pollution abatement capital. We assume that ecological uncertainty, i. e., uncertainty over {{the dynamics of}} pollution, affects firm investment decisions. Capital irreversibility is not postulated but endogenized using a quadratic adjustment cost function. Using this framework, we {{study the effects of}} environmental policies considering taxes on polluting inputs and subsidies to reduce the cost of abatement capital. Environmental policies promoted to enforce abatement capital may generate the unexpected result of reducing the <b>abatement</b> investment <b>rate.</b> Pollution externality Ecological uncertainty Irreversibility Investment decisions Environmental policy...|$|R
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} optimal <b>abatement</b> subsidy <b>rates</b> should be {{differentiated}} across firms {{according to the}} (actual or imputed) marginal damages created by a firm’s emissions. When subsidy rates are developed under a limited budget, we find they may be optimally differentiated to target, in addition to marginal damages, features such as abatement costs, income transfer, and producer participation. The degree to which subsidy rates optimally target these other features depends on how the subsidy is implemented, or more specifically, on how benchmarks for pollution abatement are defined. The results provide insight into current policy debates. ...|$|R
40|$|Factory-level {{data are}} used to {{estimate}} water pollution abatement costs for Chinese industry. Joint abatement cost functions are utilized which relate total costs to treatment volume and the simultaneous effect of reductions in suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand and other pollutants. Tests of alternative functional forms suggest that a very simple (constant elasticity) model fits the data {{as well as a}} complex (translog) model, permitting sophisticated policy experiments with relatively simple calculations. From the results, the cost-effectiveness of current pollution control policy in China is analysed. Basic conclusions are (1) The benefits of stricter discharge standards should be weighed carefully against the costs. For the sample of 260 factories, a shift across the existing range of standards entails a present-value difference of US$ 330 million in abatement costs. (2) Emissions charges as low as US$ 1. 00 /ton would be sufficient to induce 80 % abatement of suspended solids for cost-minimizing factories. Charges of US$ 3, US$ 15 and US$ 30 per ton would be sufficient to induce 90 % abatement of TSS, COD and BOD. (3) The current regulatory system provides an economic incentive to abate by charging a levy on pollution in excess of the standard. However, the results suggest that changing to a full emissions charge system would greatly reduce overall abatement costs. For the 260 factories in the sample, the current overall <b>abatement</b> <b>rate</b> could be attained under a charge system at a reduced annual cost whose present value is US$ 344 million. ...|$|R
