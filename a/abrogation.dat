5|$|In {{response}} to President Ngo Dinh Diem's <b>abrogation</b> of the 1956 reunification election and suppression of communists {{during the late}} 1950s, Hanoi had begun sending arms and material to the guerrillas of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), who were fighting an insurgency to topple the American-supported Saigon government. To combat the NLF and {{to shore up the}} government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy of containment and belief in the domino theory, to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.|$|E
5|$|L. Neil Smith {{wrote the}} {{alternate}} history novel The Probability Broach in 1980 {{as part of}} his North American Confederacy Series. In it, Albert Gallatin joins the rebellion in 1794 to benefit the farmers, rather than the fledgling US Government as he did in reality. This results in the rebellion becoming a Second American Revolution. This eventually leads to George Washington being overthrown and executed for treason, the <b>abrogation</b> of the Constitution, and Gallatin being proclaimed the second president and serving as president until 1812.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{concepts}} had become U.S. policy, Kennan began {{to criticize the}} foreign policies that he had seemingly helped begin. Subsequently, prior {{to the end of}} 1948, Kennan became confident that positive dialogue could commence with the Soviet government. His proposals were discounted by the Truman administration and Kennan's influence was marginalized, particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed Secretary of State in 1949. Soon thereafter, U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more assertive and militaristic quality, causing Kennan to lament about what he believed was an <b>abrogation</b> of his previous assessments.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov {{informed}} Tokyo of the Soviet Union's unilateral <b>abrogation</b> of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact on August 5. At {{two minutes}} past midnight on August 9, Tokyo time, Soviet infantry, armor, and air forces had launched the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. Four hours later, word reached Tokyo of the Soviet Union's official declaration of war. The senior {{leadership of the}} Japanese Army began preparations to impose martial law on the nation, {{with the support of}} Minister of War Korechika Anami, in order to stop anyone attempting to make peace.|$|E
5|$|By 1933, the Nazi Party was {{the largest}} elected party in the German Reichstag and led to Hitler's {{appointment}} as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. He aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter {{what he saw as}} the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the <b>abrogation</b> of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans which gave him significant popular support.|$|E
5|$|John was incensed {{about what}} he {{perceived}} as an <b>abrogation</b> of his customary right as monarch to influence the election. He complained both about the choice of Langton as an individual, as John felt he was overly influenced by the Capetian court in Paris, and about the process as a whole. He barred Langton from entering England and seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions. Innocent set a commission in place {{to try to convince}} John to change his mind, but to no avail. Innocent then placed an interdict on England in March 1208, prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services, with the exception of baptisms for the young, and confessions and absolutions for the dying.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January 1957, Jordan {{signed the}} Arab Solidarity Agreement (ASA) with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria which entailed those countries' {{financial}} assistance to replace the annual British aid to Jordan that ended with the <b>abrogation</b> of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty in November 1956 (the treaty was officially and mutually abrogated in March 1957). However, implementation of the ASA was hindered by Egypt and Syria's inability or unwillingness to subsidize the Jordanian army, whose budget rivaled that of their own armies. Furthermore, by then, Abu Nuwar was steadily losing Hussein's confidence due to dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar among the army brass and the negative effects that his anti-Western hostility was having on relations with Jordan's principal Western allies, the UK and US; Hussein viewed the latter two as much-needed alternatives of financial support to Jordan in lieu of his disappointment with the ASA.|$|E
5|$|When {{the council}} {{objects to the}} Duke's {{increasing}} usurpation of power and <b>abrogation</b> of the constitution, Süß suggests to him that this challenge to his authority can be suppressed by dismissing the council and restructuring the government so that the Duke can reign as an absolute monarch. Süß tells the Duke that he can accomplish this by hiring mercenaries and that, {{as a sign of}} their gratitude, the Jews of Württemberg will provide all the requisite funds. Süß argues that he would be most effective if the Duke were to give him a letter granting him immunity from the laws of Württemberg. The Duke demurs at first but ultimately grants Süß's request.|$|E
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the <b>abrogation</b> of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E
25|$|Far right-wing organisations, such as Noua Dreaptă, protested {{publicly}} at its <b>abrogation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The only {{noticeable}} {{difference between}} the Soviet and early Russian Federation variants was the <b>abrogation</b> of the hammer and sickle from the latter.|$|E
25|$|Islamic modernists {{reject the}} abrogating {{status of the}} sword verses, which {{would result in the}} <b>abrogation</b> (naskh) of {{numerous}} Quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation.|$|E
25|$|Naskh (نسخ) : The {{doctrine}} of al-Nasikh wal-Mansukh (<b>abrogation)</b> of {{certain parts of}} the Qur'anic revelation by others. The principle is mentioned in the Qur'an (2:106) see mansukh.|$|E
25|$|Following the <b>abrogation</b> of {{paragraph}} 13(d), the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) largely {{lost its}} function, and became primarily office {{based in the}} DMZ with a small staff.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the early Russian Federation variant of the Order {{differed}} from the Soviet variant only in the <b>abrogation</b> of the hammer and sickle from the silver shield on the obverse.|$|E
25|$|The Court, in {{an opinion}} by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, struck down this <b>abrogation</b> as unconstitutional and further {{held that the}} {{doctrine}} of Ex parte Young does not apply in this situation.|$|E
25|$|Supersessionism is {{the view}} that the New Covenant replaces, {{fulfills}} or completes God's prior covenants with the Israelites. The most common alternatives to Supersessionism are <b>abrogation</b> of old covenant laws and dual covenant theology.|$|E
25|$|Democratic politicians' {{responses}} stressed their {{outrage at}} {{what they called a}} disgraceful <b>abrogation</b> of justice, and, that evening CNN reported that Representative John Conyers, Jr., Democrat of Michigan, announced {{that there would be a}} formal Congressional investigation of Bush's commutation of Libby's sentence and other presidential reprieves.|$|E
25|$|Ivan Franko Park, is {{the oldest}} park in the city. Traces of that time {{may be found in}} three- hundred-year-old oak and maple trees. Upon the <b>abrogation</b> of the Jesuit order in 1773 the {{territory}} became the town property. A well-known gardener Bager arranged the territory in the landscape style, and most of the trees were planted within 1885–1890.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei {{believes}} <b>abrogation</b> in Quranic verses is not {{an indication}} of contradiction but an indication of addition and supplementation. As an example he mentions 2:109 where -according to him- it clearly states the forgiveness is not permanent and soon {{there will be another}} command (through another verse) on this subject that completes the matter. He also mentions 4:15 where the abrogated verse indicates its temporariness.|$|E
25|$|North Korea {{denounced the}} <b>abrogation</b> of {{paragraph}} 13(d). North Korea responded militarily by digging massive underground fortifications resistant to nuclear attack, and forward deployment of its conventional forces {{so that the}} use of nuclear weapons against it would endanger South Korean and U.S. forces as well. In 1963 North Korea asked the Soviet Union and China for help in developing nuclear weapons, but was refused.|$|E
25|$|Like all Islamic jurists Ibn Taymiyyah {{believed}} in a hierarchy {{sources for the}} Sharia. Most important was the Quran, and the sunnah or any other source could not abrogate a verse of the Qur'an. (For him, an <b>abrogation</b> of a verse, known in Arabic as Naskh, was only possible through another verse in the Qur'an.) Next was sunnah which other sources (besides the Quran) must not contradict.|$|E
25|$|Obrogation {{is a term}} in the {{jurisprudence}} {{of canon}} law that refers to the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law. It {{may also be the}} partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one. Obrogation {{should not be confused with}} <b>abrogation,</b> which is the explicit repeal of a law, in whole or in part.|$|E
25|$|He is {{considered}} one of the main authors of key National Socialist ideological creeds, including its racial theory, persecution of the Jews, Lebensraum, <b>abrogation</b> of the Treaty of Versailles, and opposition to degenerate modern art. He is known for his rejection of and hatred for Christianity, having played an important role in the development of German Nationalist Positive Christianity. At Nuremberg he was sentenced to death and executed by hanging for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts in Kachin State {{and other}} Kachin {{populated}} areas have occurred since Burmese {{independence from the}} United Kingdom. Kachin troops previously formed {{a significant part of}} the Burmese army. With the unilateral <b>abrogation</b> of the Union of Burma constitution by the Ne Win regime in 1962, Kachin forces withdrew and formed the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) under the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO). Aside from the major towns and railway corridor, Kachin State has been virtually independent from the mid-1960s through 1994, with an economy based on smuggling, jade trade with China, and narcotics.|$|E
25|$|Akayev {{had promised}} to step down from office when his final term expired in 2005, but the {{possibility}} of a dynastical succession had been raised. His son Aidar Akayev and his daughter Bermet Akayeva were candidates in the 2005 legislative election, and it was widely suspected {{that he was going to}} retain either de facto power by arranging for the election of a close supporter or relative, or perhaps even by <b>abrogation</b> of the term limit provision in the constitution and remaining in power personally, an allegation which he strongly denied.|$|E
25|$|Its name Abdül Hamid {{was changed}} to Hamidiye after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution. Under {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Sèvres, which ended the First World War between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship was to be handed over to the United Kingdom as war compensation. However, the ensuing Turkish War of Independence culminated in the <b>abrogation</b> of the Treaty of Sèvres; it was {{replaced}} by the Treaty of Lausanne, which permitted the new Turkish republic to retain its fleet, including Hamidiye, which became a training ship.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1989, revolts {{had spread}} from one capital to another, ousting the regimes imposed on Central, South-East and Eastern Europe after World War II. Even the isolationist Stalinist regime in Albania was unable to stem the tide. Gorbachev's <b>abrogation</b> of the Brezhnev Doctrine was perhaps the key factor that enabled the popular uprisings to succeed. Once it became evident that the feared Soviet Army would not {{intervene}} to crush dissent, the Central, South-East and Eastern European regimes were exposed as vulnerable {{in the face of}} popular uprisings against the one-party system and power of secret police.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, {{after the}} <b>abrogation</b> of Sikkim's monarchy, the Indian National Congress gained a {{majority}} in the 1977 elections. In 1979, after a period of instability, a popular ministry headed by Nar Bahadur Bhandari, leader of the Sikkim Sangram Parishad Party, was sworn in. Bhandari held on to power in the 1984 and 1989 elections. In the 1994 elections, Pawan Kumar Chamling of the Sikkim Democratic Front became the Chief Minister of the state. Chamling and his party have since held on to power by winning the 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014 elections. Currently, the Governor of Sikkim is Shriniwas Dadasaheb Patil.|$|E
25|$|Gamaliel VI (400–425) was the Sanhedrin's last president. With {{his death}} in 425, Theodosius II outlawed the title of Nasi, the last remains of the ancient Sanhedrin. An {{imperial}} decree of 426 diverted the patriarchs' tax (post excessum patriarchorum) into the imperial treasury. The exact reason for the <b>abrogation</b> of the patriarchate is not clear, though Gamaliel VI, the last holder of the office who had been for a time elevated by the emperor {{to the rank of}} prefect, may have fallen out with the imperial authorities. Thereafter, Jews were gradually excluded from holding public office.|$|E
25|$|It {{was unclear}} how the People's Charter would be officially implemented. The interim {{government}} {{announced that the}} public would be consulted, but no official reference to a referendum was made. Legally, if the Charter was deemed to alter the Constitution, {{it could only be}} adopted by a two-thirds majority of elected members of Parliament, which was not in session, having been dismissed after the coup. Deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who opposed the Charter, however, stated that a referendum would constitute legal validation. In the end, the <b>abrogation</b> of the Constitution in 2009 made the question redundant, and much of the essence of the People's Charter was included in the new constitution promulgated by the interim government in 2013.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, he {{expressed}} {{his view of}} the Democratic Party::But what do I have to say about the Democratic Party? I’m ashamed, really, of how little leadership there has been. There has been just tremendous timidity {{on the part of the}} party, generally, although there have been a handful of exceptions. But, you know, we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total <b>abrogation</b> of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.|$|E
25|$|The main {{distinction}} of the Early Christian community from its Jewish roots was {{the belief that}} Jesus was the long-awaited Messiah, as in the Confession of Peter, but that in itself would not have severed the Jewish connection. Another point of divergence was the questioning by Christians of the continuing applicability of the Law of Moses (the Torah), though the Apostolic Decree of the Apostolic Age of Christianity appears to parallel the Noahide Law of Judaism. The two issues came to be linked in a theological discussion within the Christian community {{as to whether the}} coming of the Messiah (First or Second Coming) annulled either some (Supersessionism), or all (<b>Abrogation</b> of Old Covenant laws), of the Judaic laws in what came to be called a New Covenant.|$|E
25|$|On February 18, 1935, the Justices' {{decisions}} {{in all three}} cases were announced; all supported the government's position by a narrow 5–4 majority. Chief Justice Hughes wrote the opinion for each case, finding the government had plenary power to regulate money. As such, the <b>abrogation</b> of {{both private and public}} contractual gold clauses was within congressional reach when such clauses represented a threat to Congress's control of the monetary system. Speaking for the Court in the Perry case, Hughes's opinion was remarkable: in a judicial tongue-lashing not seen since Marbury v. Madison, Hughes chided Congress for an act which, while legal, was regarded as clearly immoral. However, Hughes ultimately found the plaintiff had no cause of action, and thus no standing to sue the government.|$|E
25|$|Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case {{which held}} that Article One of the U.S. Constitution {{did not give}} the United States Congress the power to {{abrogate}} the sovereign immunity of the states that is further protected under the Eleventh Amendment. Such <b>abrogation</b> is permitted where {{it is necessary to}} enforce the rights of citizens guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment as per Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer 427 U.S. 445 (1976). The case also held that the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), which allows state officials to be sued in their official capacity for prospective injunctive relief, was inapplicable under these circumstances, because any remedy was limited to the one that Congress had provided.|$|E
25|$|In the 1680s, King Charles II {{determined}} {{to bring the}} New England colonies under a more centralized administration in order to regulate trade more effectively. His efforts were fiercely opposed by the colonists, resulting in the <b>abrogation</b> of their colonial charter by the Crown. Charles' successor James II finalized these efforts in 1686, establishing the Dominion of New England. Dominion rule triggered bitter resentment throughout New England; {{the enforcement of the}} unpopular Navigation Acts and the curtailing of local democracy angered the colonists. New Englanders were encouraged, however, by a change of government in England that saw James II effectively abdicate, and a populist uprising overthrew Dominion rule on April 18, 1689. Colonial governments reasserted their control {{in the wake of the}} revolt, and successive governments made no more attempts to restore the Dominion.|$|E
