30|$|The proxies do however {{not include}} a proxy of the over or {{underestimation}} of the worker concerning his/her skills, job tasks and job match. Such self-estimation errors hamper our analyses when the error varies between {{the city and the}} countryside. Spatial selection may lead to an over-representation of overconfident workers in cities and with that in a bias in the results of spatial skill and task patterns. Nothing guarantees {{that this is not the}} case. As we control for important covariates, education, jobs etc, we do not expect our results to be fully driven by such a possible bias. The question is however how such a bias would reflect in the measure of matching quality. The measure provides insight in the match between your tasks and your skills. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> very <b>confident,</b> <b>you</b> will probably value both your skills and your job tasks more. Hence, it is unclear what effect this will have on the estimate of the match quality. We conclude that the results on the sorting of workers and jobs into cities may be hampered by subjectivity but that is it unlikely that such a bias fully drives our results. We have no reason to expect the results on the matching quality to be affected by subjectivity.|$|R
