25|$|Alexander then marched {{east to the}} Hydaspes, where Porus, {{ruler of}} the kingdom between the Hydaspes (Jhelum)near Bhera and the Akesines (Chenab) refused to submit to him. The two armies fought the Battle of the Hydaspes River outside the town of Nikaia (near the modern city of Jhelum) and Poros became Alexander's satrap. Alexander's army crossed the Hydraotis and marched east to the Hyphasis (Beas). However, Alexander's troops refused to face the vastly {{superior}} imperial army of Magadh Empire, Persoi refused {{to go beyond the}} Hyphases (Beas) River near town Beas. The Battle with Porus depressed the spirits of the Macedonians, as too many valiant comrades died helplessly by Porus' war elephants, and made them very unwilling to advance farther into India. Moreover, when they learned that a vastly superior imperial army of Magadh, Gangaridai and Prasii <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Greeks, all the generals of Alexander refused to meet them for fear of annihilation. Therefore, Alexander had to return. He crossed the river and ordered to erect giant altars to mark the easternmost extent of his empire thus claiming the territory east of Beas as part of his conquests. He also set up a city named Alexandria nearby and left many Macedonian veterans there, he himself turned back and marched his army to the Jhelum and the Indus to the Arabian Sea, and sailing to Babylon.|$|E

500|$|Symbols {{of death}} proliferate {{throughout}} The Wind Will Carry Us with scenes {{set in a}} graveyard, the imminence of the old woman’s passing, and the ancestors that the character of Farzad mentions in an early scene.

This becomes the theme of the work and the subject of the film — they <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> old woman to give up the ghost. The viewer is asked to consider what constitutes the soul, and what happens to the soul after death.

Peter begins taking the parrot everywhere he goes, showing it off to his friends, Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe, who, in turn, begin making suggestions as to how Peter could change his appearance to appear more [...] "pirate-like" [...] because of the resemblance between Peter and a pirate, who are known for keeping parrots as pets. Peter takes the advice given to him by his friends by dressing up in pirate clothing, gathering up a crew of other [...] "pirates", and going by the name [...] "Long John Peter". Peter begins taking the pirate act to the extreme, even robbing a British man's car filled with sugarcane, tobacco, and spices. In the [...] "battle" [...] for the spices, Peter's parrot is severely injured and eventually dies.|$|E

The Nablus Casbah was attacked by two battalions simultaneously, using two different fighting methods. The Golani Brigade pushed in using Achzarit armored personnel carriers and armored bulldozers to clear away barricades. The Golani Brigade engaged the Palestinians in heavy street combat, forcing many to withdraw to {{the western part of}} the Casbah, where they were attacked by the Paratroopers Brigade. The Palestinians in the Casbah were deployed in small squads, consisting of two to four men, with each squad in charge of a sector. Explosive charges were set between the alleys and shooting positions were taken.
