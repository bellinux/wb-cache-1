They are, therefore, not as polite. ເດ also has the sense of <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> or to indicate an equivalent to this as a demonstrative pronoun.|$|E
25|$|Take {{for example}} {{one who is}} invited to dine with his colleagues or clients, would we allow him to avoid embarrassment by eating fruit and {{vegetables}} from which terumot and ma'asrot (which nowadays is Rabbinic) have not been removed, or by consuming hamets she-avar alav haPesah, or by drinking Stam yeynam (wine touched or poured by a non-Jew). Or alternatively, suppose someone is at a meeting and is ashamed to walk out in order to daven Minha. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> prayers {{at the airport in}} between flights. Would we allow him to forgo his rabbinic prayer obligation because of this embarrassment? The answer is that in those cases where acting according to halakha - be it to not eat terumot and ma’asrot, or to not drink stam yeynam, or to fulfill ones prayer obligation – creates the embarrassment, then kevod ha-beriyyot cannot set aside the Rabbinic prohibition. One should be proud to be fulfilling the halakha.|$|E

2500|$|A form {{of social}} {{production}} and reproduction, along with its economic and financial mechanisms, its political formations, and so on, can be desired as such, {{in whole or in}} part, independently of the interests of the desiring-subject. It was not by means of a metaphor, even a paternal metaphor, that Hitler was able to sexually arouse the fascists. It is not by means of a metaphor that a banking or stock-market transaction, a claim, a coupon, a credit, is able to arouse people who are not necessarily bankers. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> the effects of money that grows, money that produces more money? There are socioeconomic [...] "complexes" [...] that are also veritable complexes of the unconscious, and that communicate a voluptuous wave from the top to the bottom of their hierarchy (the military–industrial complex). And ideology, Oedipus, and the phallus {{have nothing to do with}} this, because they depend on it rather than being its impetus.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, , Julian De Vizio, Zach Russell, Jayden Sierra and Will Singe {{successfully}} auditioned as soloists for {{the fourth}} season of The X Factor and progressed to the super bootcamp stage. After failing {{to make it into}} the top six of the Under-25 Boys category during super bootcamp, the judges Ronan Keating, Guy Sebastian, Natalie Bassingthwaighte and Mel B decided to put them together to form a boy band for the home visits stage, thus qualifying for the Groups category. During home visits, they travelled to London, England and sang Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love", their first song as a group, in front of their mentor Keating and guest mentors One Direction. Keating later selected them, along with Fourtunate <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>About</b> Tonight, for the live finals—a series of ten weekly live shows in which contestants are progressively eliminated by public vote. During the official launch for The X Factor at the Museum for Contemporary Art in Sydney on 13 September 2012, Keating announced that the group would be called The Collective. He stated, [...] "We put it up on the web and had a lot of different names and the fans themselves picked it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gary Duncan and Dino Valenti both {{returned}} to Quicksilver Messenger Service at this time, expanding {{the group to}} a six-piece. The next two albums, Just for Love <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>About</b> Me, were recorded simultaneously in Hawaii. Much of What About Me was recorded at Pacific High Recording in SF. Both albums were mixed at PHR. The band's approach to recording was undisciplined, with Valenti hiring a building without electricity to record in. The finished albums took many hours in the studio because the group had a contract which allowed unlimited studio time with no Capitol producer present unless invited. The producer was only invited to the studio to hear the playing of the finished albums. The albums are {{a departure from the}} group's earlier sound, with Valenti taking over as lead singer and, under the pseudonym of Jesse Oris Farrow, principal songwriter. The records sold relatively well and produced the group's one legitimate hit radio single, [...] "Fresh Air." [...] John Cipollina and Nicky Hopkins departed soon after their experiences in Hawaii. Hopkins apparently left during the Hawaii recording sessions, as session musician Mark Naftalin takes his place for three cuts on What About Me.|$|E
