We reached the quay upon the creek, but there we found nothing save some bloodstains and--this is strange--your sword, Godwin, the hilt set between two stones, and on the point a writing." ...|$|R

Grisell indeed was worn down with long watching and grief, and looked haggard and drawn so as to enhance all her scars and distortion of feature into more uncomeliness than her wont. She saw him shudder a little, but his lame arm and wan looks interested her kind heart. [...] "I fear me you <b>are</b> still feeling <b>your</b> <b>wound,</b> sir," [...] she said, in the sweet voice which was evidently a surprise to him.|$|R
