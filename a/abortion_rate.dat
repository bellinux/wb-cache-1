40|$|The {{likelihood}} {{of having an}} abortion in the U. S. A. is strongly dependent upon where a woman lives. <b>Abortion</b> <b>rates</b> vary markedly from state to state, and these variations have been increasing, especially in recent years. Path analysis shows the causal structure of public demand and access variables that determined state <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> in 1991 and 1992. Access variables, including the restrictiveness of state laws regulating abortion, state funding of abortions for poor women {{and the availability of}} hospital <b>abortions,</b> affect <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> directly. Greater accessibility leads to higher <b>abortion</b> <b>rates.</b> Public demand variables affect <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> both directly and indirectly through access conditions. The number of women at risk of unintended pregnancies leads to higher <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> directly and indirectly through its effects on medical access. Per capita income, percent Catholic, and percent of the population born outside the state affect <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> indirectly through the access variables. High per capita income leads directly to greater availability of hospital abortions, higher levels of state funding of abortions for poor women, less restrictive state abortion laws, and indirectly to higher <b>abortion</b> <b>rates.</b> States with large non-native populations have less restrictive abortion laws and higher <b>abortion</b> <b>rates.</b> The presence of a large Catholic population reduces the number of hospitals offering abortion services and leads indirectly to lower <b>abortion</b> <b>rates.</b> The interaction of public demand and access at the state level creates geographically varying environments in which abortion decisions are made. <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> medical access legal access antiabortion violence path analysis...|$|R

On the contrary, statistics released from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that more restrictive laws on abortions do not necessarily mean fewer abortions; the <b>abortion</b> <b>rate</b> one year for Latin America (where, broadly speaking, abortions are generally made illegal) was 32 per 1000 people, whereas the <b>abortion</b> <b>rate</b> for Western Europe (where overall the laws are more relaxed) was 12 in 1000.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{analyze the}} trends in legally induced {{abortion}}s among women younger than 30 {{years in the}} five Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, since the liberalized abortion laws came into force. METHODS: Data stem from national registrations of vital events. Some {{have been published in}} the national vital statistics while others have been retrieved for this study. General and age-specific <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> are used to analyze the trends. Further, an index has been calculated by dividing the age-specific <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> by the Nordic average. RESULTS: The analysis reveals an overall reduction in the general <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> in the Nordic countries, apart from Iceland. The rates have been highest in Denmark and Sweden and lowest in Finland since the early 1980 s. In the mid- 1980 s, the <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> increased among 15 - 19 -year-old women in Sweden and among 20 - 24 -year-old women in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, followed by a reduction. In Iceland the very low age-specific <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> for all age groups under 30 years {{at the beginning of the}} study period increased and Iceland had the highest rate for 15 - 19 -year-old women in the late- 1990 s. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively low <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> in Finland demonstrate effective preventive efforts, although the recent increase challenges further studies on the relationship between <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> and counseling activities. The rise in <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> in Iceland indicate a need for improved sex education, contraceptive services and availability of contraceptive methods for young people...|$|R

2500|$|RU-486, a drug {{widely used}} {{overseas}} as an abortifacient, was effectively banned in Australia until 2006. This {{was because of}} a deal in the federal Senate between anti-abortion Tasmanian Senator Brian Harradine and the major parties to get his vote on other issues. [...] Abortifacient drugs were designated as [...] "restricted goods" [...] for which approval from the health minister had to be obtained before the drug could even be assessed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), without which drugs cannot be sold in Australia, in effect vesting the minister with a veto over such drugs. Health Minister Tony Abbott, and previous ministers, used this process to prohibit the sale of RU-486 in Australia, by refusing the drug being assessed by the TGA.

40|$|Objective: The {{relation}} between levels of contraceptive {{use and the}} incidence of induced abortion remains a topic of heated debate. Many of the contradictions are likely {{due to the fact}} that abortion is the end point of a process that starts with sexual activity, contraceptive use (or non-use), followed by unwanted pregnancy, a decision to terminate, and access to abortion. Trends in <b>abortion</b> <b>rates</b> reflect changes in each step of this process, and opposing trends may cancel each other out. This paper aims to investigate the roles played by the dissemination of contraception and the evolving norms of motherhood on changes in <b>abortion</b> <b>rates.</b> Methods: Drawing data from six national probability surveys that explored contraception and pregnancy wantedness in France from 1978 through 2010, we used multivariate linear regression to explore the associations between trends in contraceptive rates and trends in (i) <b>abortion</b> <b>rates,</b> (ii) unwanted pregnancy rates, (iii) and unwanted birth rates, and to determine which of these 3 associations was strongest.
