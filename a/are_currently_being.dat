5|$|For proper {{protection}} of the wood turtle,in-depth land surveys of its habitat to establish population numbers are needed. One emerging solution to the highway mortality problem, which primarily affects nesting females, is the construction of under-road channels. These tunnels allow the wood turtle to pass under the road, a solution that helps prevent accidental deaths. Brochures and other media that warn people to avoid keeping the wood turtle as a pet <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> <b>being</b> distributed. Next, leaving nests undisturbed, especially common nesting sites and populations, is the best solution to enable the wood turtle's survival.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of European agricultural methods, the shores of San Francisco Bay consisted mostly of tidal marshes. Today, the bay has been significantly altered heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of water delivery, shipping, agriculture, and urban development, with side effects including the loss of wetlands and {{the introduction}} of contaminants and invasive species. Approximately 85% of those marshes have been lost or destroyed, but about 50 marshes and marsh fragments remain. Huge tracts of the marshes were originally destroyed by farmers for agricultural purposes, then repurposed to serve as salt evaporation ponds to produce salt for food and other purposes. Today, regulations limit the destruction of tidal marshes, and large portions <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> <b>being</b> rehabilitated to its natural state.|$|E

5|$|The {{line was}} {{constructed}} by the South Eastern Railway, settling a rivalry with the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway that led to disputes over the route and planning. It opened in 1851 after several false starts, followed by branch lines to Rye Harbour in 1854, Dungeness in 1881 and New Romney in 1884. The line struggled to be profitable and it seemed likely that it would close following the Beeching Report. All the branch lines were closed by 1967 but the main line was kept open because of poor road connections in the area. Services <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> <b>being</b> provided by Southern.|$|E

5|$|Invasive {{plants such}} as Crofton weed and Formosa lily occur in {{inaccessible}} areas and probably cannot be eradicated but others <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> <b>being</b> managed. In 1995 the first action was taken to control the spread of introduced plants of the island, chiefly ground asparagus and bridal creeper, but also cherry guava, Madeira vine, Cotoneaster, Ochna and Cestrum. This has been followed by weeding tours {{and the formation of}} the Friends of Lord Howe Island group in 2000. Programs have also been started to remove weeds from private properties and revegetate some formerly cultivated areas. An Environmental Unit was created by the Board and it includes a Flora Management Officer and a permanent Weed Officer. Weeds have been mapped and an eradication program is in place, supported by improved education and quarantine procedures.|$|E

5|$|SR750 was {{established}} in 1937, ran from SR257 to its junction with SR 315. In 1997, SR750 was extended eastward from SR315, crossing Olentangy River and US 23 via Powell Road, then following Polaris Parkway around to a new eastern terminus at I-71 in the far northern end of Columbus. Ten years later, a new interchange was built for Gemini Place at I-71, north of SR 750. The interchange would relieve traffic in the area. The next year, SR750's westernmost portion was re-routed to the south, onto an all-new alignment that brought its western terminus {{in line with the}} intersection of SR257 and County Road 126 (Glick Road), after an expansion to the Columbus Zoo. In September 2013, a slope stabilization project began for SR 315, and turn lanes <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> <b>being</b> added for SR 315 and SR 750's intersection.|$|E
5|$|The F/A-18 Hornets are modern {{all-weather}} strike fighter jets, {{designed to}} attack both ground and aerial targets. Australia's F/A-18s were built during the 1980s and early 1990s and <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> <b>being</b> upgraded {{to improve their}} capabilities and extend their service lives. ACG operates a total of 71 F/A-18A and F/A-18B Hornets. The F/A-18A is a single-seat fighter and the F/A-18B is a two-seat variant which is mainly used for pilot training. The Australian Government is planning to replace the F/A-18A and Bs with the F-35A Lightning II from 2013 onwards. The F/A-18F Super Hornet is a dedicated strike aircraft in RAAF service and are considered superior to the F-22 Raptor {{in their ability to}} acquire and track moving ground targets, {{and will continue to be}} upgraded until the F-35s are delivered.|$|E
5|$|The Historic Chapels Trust {{obtained}} {{an estimate}} for the restoration, which amounted to £2.5m. Unable {{to meet the}} full amount, the Trust decided to undertake the restoration in phases. The first phase was completed in September 2007 {{at a cost of}} nearly £900,000, which included weatherproofing and major works to the roof. Of the money raised for this, £262,500 came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, £200,000 from English Heritage, £250,000 from Stoke-on-Trent City Council, and a further £20,000 was raised locally. The second phase of restoration commenced in August 2010 and was completed a year later. The Trust spent £600,000 restoring the galleries, staircases and pulpits, replacing the organ and renovating the exterior ironwork. Funds <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> <b>being</b> raised for the final phase of restoration, which will include installation of a new heating and lighting system.|$|E
