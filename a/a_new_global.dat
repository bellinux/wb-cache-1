25|$|In May 1513, Portuguese explorers {{reached the}} coast of Guangdong, {{bringing}} the Columbian Exchange into China. This created <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>global</b> demand for Chinese products, while European firearms and New World crops were introduced to China for the first time. However, {{the potential of the}} China market was limited by the Ming's insistence of the maritime prohibitions. Early Portuguese attempts at trade negotiations were unsuccessful, and the Portuguese presence {{at the mouth of the}} Pearl River was driven off in the Battle of Tunmen of 1521 and the Battle of Xicaowan of 1522. The Portuguese, like the Japanese, were hence forced to conduct their trade illegally on the islands along {{the coast of}} China, away from reach of the Ming authorities.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th-century {{economy of}} China, the Ming Dynasty was stimulated by {{trade with the}} Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch. China became {{involved}} in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>global</b> trade of goods, plants, animals, and food crops known as the Columbian Exchange. Trade with European powers and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper banknotes as the common medium of exchange in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient Little Ice Age, natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as Li Zicheng to challenge Ming authority.|$|E
