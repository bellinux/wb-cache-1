It throws {{a new light}} on it; and if that's the way nice people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, why, we must give up the idea. I'm quite prepared to do so.

60|$|I have endeavoured to {{meet you}} as fairly as I {{possibly}} could. I assure you again we are acting in earnest, with zeal and entire good faith; and any suggestion that {{any member of the}} Government, either in this office or the Government of India, has any prejudice whatever against Mahomedans, for the purposes of political administration in India, is one of the idlest and most wicked misapprehensions that could possibly enter into the political mind. I am greatly encouraged by having met you. I am sure that you speak in the name of important bodies of your own countrymen and of your own community. I am sure that you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> our proposals in a fair and reasonable spirit, and give us credit for a desire to do the best that we possibly can in the interests of all the communities in India, including also the interests of the British Government. I can only tell you further, that if this action of ours fails, miscarries, and is wrecked, it will be a considerable time before another opportunity occurs. You will never again--I do not care whether the time be long or be short--you will never again have the combination of a Secretary of State and a Viceroy, who are more thoroughly in earnest in their desire to improve Indian government, and to do full justice to every element of the Indian population.|$|E
50|$|She {{would like}} people to {{question}} research findings from neuroscientists in terms of effect size, she is critical of neuroscientists who describe slight statistical differences between the genders as significant differences in their findings. Rippon also says, if you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> brain volume differences {{then you need to}} know how heavy and how tall those people are - a volume correction, otherwise the data is meaningless, and not all researchers, she says, do that. Another worry for Rippon is a publication bias, that publishers will only publish when a difference is found rather than publishing research proving there are no differences.|$|E

So that the business of the country and the business of Arizona being represented at the federal level can move forward. ... We can't have until the 2018 election, waiting around to accomplish the Trump agenda, to secure the border and stop illegal immigration and repeal Obamacare and fix the economy and fix the veterans administration, all those things need to be done and we can't be at a standstill while we wait for John McCain to determine what he's going to do." ...|$|E
5000|$|For me, [...] "Beatle George" [...] was a suit or a {{shirt that}} I once wore, {{and the only}} problem is, {{for the rest of}} my life, people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that shirt and mistake it for me. - George Harrison to Q, 1995 During the Beatles' career, Harrison had been the first to tire of Beatlemania and the group's celebrity status, and he had written songs rejecting what Leng terms the [...] "artifice" [...] {{surrounding}} the band. Lennon himself described the Beatles' predicament as [...] "four individuals who eventually recovered their individualities after being submerged in a myth". In addition, for Harrison, while he began to match Lennon and Paul McCartney as a songwriter towards the end of the group's career, his relatively junior position in the Beatles was a source of frustration to him, which, according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore, left [...] "deep and lasting wounds".|$|E
5000|$|The song, {{written by}} Dave Mustaine, {{deals with the}} theme of a failed suicide attempt, similar to {{the origin of the}} phrase skin of my teeth, where the {{commentator}} narrowly escapes death. The song has often been (incorrectly, according to Mustaine) thought to promote suicide. He has talked about the meaning of [...] "Skin o' My Teeth" [...] several times, as shown below. [...] MTV flipped when they saw the lyrics to 'Skin O' My Teeth' because they thought I was promoting committing suicide. It has taken us a long enough time to get our relationship politically correctwith MTV. So I don't {{want to go out and}} film a video about a song that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> and say, 'You're nuts.' and if they say, 'Hey Dave, we're going to play your song, as radical as it is, but you have to go on there and say the song is not about suicide,' I'll say it. 'Hey, this song is not about suicide'. Dave Mustaine ...|$|E

5000|$|Following a 13th {{birthday}} celebration {{at the coffee}} shop where Sherry works as a waitress, Jennifer again spends the day with Howard, who gives her a teddy bear (which she names Howard, after him) and sets up an impromptu photo shoot by the lake. Things start fairly innocent, but Howard soon asks her to lift her knee-length skirt and [...] "show a little skin" [...] while posing. When she proves reluctant to do so, Howard attempts {{to explain to her}} about [...] "the beauty of the human body", even showing her some pornographic magazines, but then backs off. He does, however, make Jennifer promise to [...] "keep our real friendship a secret."The next day, Sherry announces to Jennifer that she and Frank <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> engagement rings, which sets off another argument; in a fit of rage, Jennifer pushes the contents of her dresser over, then punches a framed photo of her with her parents, causing her hand to bleed. While with Howard at the rec center later, he treats her injury and inquires about Jennifer's home situation, commenting [...] "sometimes parents don't care whether you're alive or dead... you wonder why they had you in the first place" [...] and mentioning his own abusive childhood.|$|E

40|$|Promoting gender {{equality}} and women empowerment {{is the third}} Millennium Development Goal – MDG. Achieving this goal is making sure all the other MDGs are achieved, now that good implementation of policies and strategies drawn for achieving these MDGs goals may only be properly implemented if {{gender equality}} is strategically taken into consideration. This {{is the reason why}} promoting gender equality and women empowerment can also be seen as a bridge to justice promotion between men and women. So, taking into consideration that justice is a relation between individuals (man and woman), we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> different strategies through which gender equality can be promoted in our real, multilingual and multicultural world. Here, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the existing tools designed for promoting gender equality in the international level, as well as real situations of gender inequality in our daily life. Therefore, taking into consideration {{that there is a need}} of social change in our current societies, we can foresee possible strategies to be used in the implementation of policies and strategies that are drawn for achieving gender equality and women empowerment goals...|$|E

The first law is the law of identity, the second the law of non-contradiction and the third the law of excluded middle [4, 5].
