5|$|When under attack, some {{octopuses}} {{can perform}} arm <b>autotomy,</b> {{in a manner}} similar to the way skinks and other lizards detach their tails. The crawling arm may distract would-be predators. Such severed arms remain sensitive to stimuli and move away from unpleasant sensations. Octopuses can replace lost limbs.|$|E
5|$|File shells such as Limaria fragilis {{can produce}} a noxious {{secretion}} when stressed. It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and protrude {{some distance from the}} shell when it is feeding. If attacked, it sheds tentacles in a process known as <b>autotomy.</b> The toxin released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Salamanders {{use their}} tails in defence {{and some are}} {{prepared}} to jettison them to save their lives in {{a process known as}} <b>autotomy.</b> Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone {{at the base of the}} tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated. Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of <b>autotomy</b> (self-amputation), {{shedding}} {{one of their own}} appendages in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara, {{along with}} other, now extinct {{members of the}} order Sphenodontia, belong to the {{superorder}} Lepidosauria, the only surviving taxon within Lepidosauromorpha. Squamates and tuatara both show caudal <b>autotomy</b> (loss of the tail-tip when threatened), and have transverse cloacal slits. The origin of the tuatara probably lies close to the split between the Lepidosauromorpha and the Archosauromorpha. Though tuatara resemble lizards, the similarity is superficial, because the family has several characteristics unique among reptiles. The typical lizard shape is very common for the early amniotes; the oldest known fossil of a reptile, the Hylonomus, resembles a modern lizard.|$|E
5|$|In some lowland {{areas the}} adult {{salamanders}} will remain active all winter long, excluding cold spells. However, {{during the cold}} winter months in the northern parts of its range, the long-toed salamander burrows below the frost-line in a coarse substrate to hibernate in clusters of 8–14 individuals. While hibernating, it survives on protein energy reserves that are stored in its skin and along its tail. These proteins serve a secondary function {{as part of a}} mixture or concoction of skin secretions that is used for defense. When threatened, the long-toed salamander will wave its tail and secrete an adhesive white milky substance that is noxious and likely poisonous. The color of its skin can serve as a warning to predators (aposematism) that it will taste bad. Its skin colors and patterns are diverse, ranging from a dark black to reddish brown background that is spotted or blotched by a pale-reddish-brown, pale-green, to a bright yellow stripe. An adult may also drop part of its tail and slink away while the tail bit acts as a squirmy decoy; this is called <b>autotomy.</b> The regeneration and regrowth of the tail is one example of the developmental physiology of amphibians that is of great interest to the medical profession.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autotomy</b> of the tail, {{a feature}} {{found in some}} lizards is absent in most snakes. Caudal <b>autotomy</b> in snakes is rare and is intervertebral, unlike that in lizards, which is intravertebral—that is, the break happens along a {{predefined}} fracture plane present on a vertebra.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autotomy,</b> or the {{shedding}} of appendages, is {{also used}} to distract predators, giving the prey a chance to escape. This highly costly mechanism is regularly practiced within stick insects (order Phasmatodea) where the cost is accentuated by the possibility that legs can be lost 20% of the time during molting. Harvestmen (order Opiliones) also use <b>autotomy</b> as a first line of defense against predators.|$|E
25|$|For brine shrimp, many functions, {{including}} swimming, digestion {{and reproduction}} are not controlled through the brain; instead, local nervous system ganglia may control some regulation or synchronisation of these functions. <b>Autotomy,</b> the voluntary shedding or dropping {{of parts of}} the body for defence, is also controlled locally along the nervous system. Artemia have two types of eyes. They have two widely separated compound eyes mounted on flexible stalks. These compound eyes are the main optical sense organ in adult brine shrimps. The median eye, or the naupliar eye, is situated anteriorly in the centre of the head and is the only functional optical sense organ in the nauplii, which is functional until the adult stage.|$|E
25|$|Geckos, skinks, {{and other}} lizards that are {{captured}} by the tail will shed part of the tail structure through a process called <b>autotomy</b> and thus be able to flee. The detached tail will continue to wiggle, creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal. The detached tails of leopard geckos can wiggle for up to 20 minutes. In many species the tails are of a separate and dramatically more intense color {{than the rest of}} the body so as to encourage potential predators to strike for the tail first. In the shingleback skink and some species of geckos, the tail is short and broad and resembles the head, so that the predators may attack it rather than the more vulnerable front part.|$|E
25|$|When attacked, slugs can {{contract}} their body, making themselves {{harder and}} more compact and more still and round. By doing this, they become firmly {{attached to the}} substrate. This, combined with the slippery mucus they produce, makes slugs more difficult for predators to grasp. The unpleasant taste of the mucus is also a deterrent. Some species present different response behaviors when attacked, such as the Kerry slug. In contrast to the general behavioral pattern, the Kerry slug retracts its head, lets go of the substrate, rolls up completely, and stays contracted in a ball-like shape. This is a unique feature among all the Arionidae, and among most other slugs. Some slugs can self-amputate (<b>autotomy)</b> {{a portion of their}} tail to help the slug escape from a predator. Some slug species hibernate underground during the winter in temperate climates, but in other species, the adults die in the autumn.|$|E
25|$|Echinoderms (such {{as the sea}} star), crayfish, many reptiles, and {{amphibians}} exhibit remarkable {{examples of}} tissue regeneration. The case of <b>autotomy,</b> for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate. Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a salamander or a triton will grow again and again after amputation. In reptiles, chelonians, crocodilians and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating {{it as part of}} a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect.|$|E
500|$|Some {{species of}} starfish {{are able to}} {{reproduce}} asexually as adults either by fission of their central discs or by <b>autotomy</b> {{of one or more}} of their arms. Which of these processes occurs depends on the genus. Among starfish that are able to regenerate their whole body from a single arm, some can do so even from fragments just [...] long. Single arms that regenerate a whole individual are called comet forms. The division of the starfish, either across its disc or {{at the base of the}} arm, is usually accompanied by a weakness in the structure that provides a fracture zone.|$|E
2500|$|Arthropods {{are known}} to {{regenerate}} appendages following loss or <b>autotomy.</b> Regeneration among arthropods is restricted by molting such that hemimetabolous insects are capable of regeneration only until their final molt whereas most crustaceans can regenerate throughout their lifetimes. [...] Molting cycles are hormonally regulated in arthropods, although premature molting can be induced by <b>autotomy.</b> Mechanisms underlying appendage regeneration in hemimetabolous insects and crustaceans is highly conserved. During limb regeneration species in both taxa form a blastema following <b>autotomy</b> with regeneration of the excised limb occurring during proecdysis. Arachnids, including scorpions, {{are known to}} regenerate their venom, although {{the content of the}} regenerated venom is different than the original venom during its regeneration, as the venom volume is replaced before the active proteins are all replenished.|$|E

2500|$|Tissue {{regeneration}} {{is widespread}} among echinoderms {{and has been}} well documented in starfish (Asteroidea), sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea), and sea urchins (Echinoidea). Appendage regeneration in echinoderms has been studied since at least the 19th century. [...] In addition to appendages, some species can regenerate internal organs and parts of their central nervous system. In response to injury starfish can autotomize damaged appendages. <b>Autotomy</b> is the self-amputation of a body part, usually an appendage. Depending on severity, starfish will then go through a four-week process where the appendage will be regenerated. Some species must retain mouth cells in order to regenerate an appendage, due to the need for energy. [...] The first organs to regenerate, in all species documented to date, are associated with the digestive tract. Thus, most of our knowledge about visceral regeneration in holothurians concerns this system.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{its small}} size and {{localized}} distribution around streams, the {{northern two-lined salamander}} is preyed upon {{by a variety of}} animals. Predators include birds, such as the eastern screech owl (Otus asio), snakes such as the eastern garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) and ringneck snakes (Diadophis punctatus). Other important predators of the northern two-lined salamander larvae are other salamanders, such as the large, stream-dwelling larvae of the northern spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus) and the blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus). Response to a predator is variable in E. bislineata [...] Some individuals, when confronted with a garter snake, will remain motionless when contacted by the head of the snake, but would engage in a protean flip, where the tail is held over the body when contacted by the snake's tongue. Tail <b>autotomy</b> is common in E. bislineata , {{as a result of a}} struggle with a predator. Losing part of the tail increases the likelihood of surviving the encounter with a predator. In some populations, up to 32% of animals had autotomized tails.|$|E
2500|$|All {{honey bees}} live in colonies where the workers sting intruders {{as a form}} of defense, and alarmed bees release a {{pheromone}} that stimulates the attack response in other bees. The different species of honey bees are distinguished from all other bee species (and virtually all other Hymenoptera) by the possession of small barbs on the sting, but these barbs are found only in the worker bees. The sting and associated venom sac of honey bees are also modified so as to pull free of the body once lodged (<b>autotomy),</b> and the sting apparatus has its own musculature and ganglion, which allows it to keep delivering venom once detached. The gland which produces the alarm pheromone is also associated with the sting apparatus. The embedded stinger continues to emit additional alarm pheromone after it has torn loose; other defensive workers are thereby attracted to the sting site. The worker dies after the sting becomes lodged and is subsequently torn loose from the bee's abdomen. [...] The honey bee's venom, known as apitoxin, carries several active components, the most abundant of which is melittin, and the most destructive is phospholipase A2.|$|E
2500|$|Male Chasmagnathus granulatus crabs {{exhibit a}} [...] "defensive response" [...] to {{electric}} shocks. [...] During {{a study on}} the ability of shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) learning to avoid an electrical shock, it was observed that many crabs emerged from the dark shelter to avoid the shock thus entering a brightly light area which would normally be avoided. [...] Immediately after the injection of formalin (an irritant in mammals) or saline into one cheliped (the leg which ends with the claw), shore crabs move quickly into the corner of the aquarium and [...] "freeze" [...] after 2 to 3 seconds. [...] After 1 to 3 minutes, these injected animals are fidgety and exhibit a wide range of movements such as flexion, extension, shaking or rubbing the affected claw. Formalin-treated animals show 20-times more rubbing behaviour during the first minute after injection than saline-treated crabs. Intense rubbing of the claw results in <b>autotomy</b> (shedding) in 20% of animals of the formalin-treated group whereas saline-injected crabs do not autotomise the injected cheliped. [...] During the 10 minutes after injection, crabs in the formalin-treated group tried to use the intact cheliped, guarding the damaged cheliped. [...] The scientists conducting this study commented [...] "the present results obtained in crabs may be indicative of pain experience rather than relating to a simple nociceptive reflex". Other species of crab have been shown to autotomise legs when placed on a hot plate or exposed to a small electric shock.|$|E
50|$|Caudal <b>autotomy</b> in lizards {{takes two}} forms. In the first form, called {{intervertebral}} <b>autotomy,</b> the tail breaks between the vertebrae. The second form of caudal <b>autotomy</b> is intravertebral <b>autotomy,</b> {{in which there}} are zones of weakness, fracture planes across each vertebra in the mid-part of the tail. In this second type of <b>autotomy</b> the lizard contracts a muscle to fracture a vertebra, rather than break the tail between two vertebrae. Sphincter muscles in the tail then contract around the caudal artery to minimize bleeding. Caudal <b>autotomy</b> is prevalent among lizards; it had been recorded in 13 of approximately 20 families.|$|E
