[...] In the Pitchfork Media review, Spencer Owen writes, [...] "This subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of 'We live in a beautiful world,' which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record." [...] Robert Christgau alleged that, along with [...] "Yellow", the song {{was one of only}} two good ones on all of Parachutes. Critic Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, compliments, [...] "Both the vocals and guitar are utterly beautiful. It's a song to take solace from, draw comfort from, be quietly awed by." [...] David DeVoe of Hybridmagazine.com wrote: [...] "It is a wonderful song that echoes the promise of what is to come {{on the rest of the}} record.

500|$|... "Womanizer" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists {{from a variety}} of music genres, as well as a great number of amateurs. Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly {{explained}} that [...] "the song has been covered by other artists with an enthusiasm only matched in recent times by musicians’ desire to remake Radiohead’s 'Creep' in their own image". On December 8, 2008, New Zealand singer Ladyhawke performed a cover at BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. The song was covered by American band The All-American Rejects on the Yahoo! Music Pepsi Smash show in December 2008. It was performed in an acoustic version, in which the band members played percussions with beer bottles. The cover also included an excerpt from The Turtles's [...] "Happy Together". British [...] singer Lily Allen also covered the song, because [...] "simple really, I love Britney <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> song". Her cover was a stripped down version, that according to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, [...] "might provoke those who reckon it doesn't have much of a chorus to revise their opinion". Allen also performed the song as the encore during her 2009 tour. French singer Sliimy cover was deemed as an [...] "indie makeover".

500|$|Afanasieff {{flew back}} to California where he {{finished}} the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments {{with the thought of}} giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, {{but for the most part}} people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the video's release, several critics took notice of the {{similarities}} in Eminem's attire and Carey's stalker. Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote: [...] "It isn't quite as ridiculous as we were hoping, and Mariah's insisting the male stalker she plays isn't meant to be a 'specific person', but there's still plenty to enjoy in the 'Obsessed' video. There is a lot of MC cleavage, a not entirely convincing fake beard and a neat Mean Girls reference towards the end." [...] Newsdays Corris Little described it as [...] "genius!" [...] and continued, [...] "Move over Eminem, I'm officially obsessed with Mariah Carey. Who isn't? She can sing, she's pretty and she has really fun music videos." [...] A writer from the Evening Standard called the video [...] "shocking", and felt that Carey's disguise was so convincing, she should assume the role more often if she wants to travel incognito. The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman described it as [...] "human butterfly embrac her macho side", and concluded his review with [...] "I'm guessing the video involves Mariah's butch bellhop becoming a little infatuated with the singer, or something. Basically it's another way to give her double the screentime – much like that Mariah-on-Mariah fight in 'Heartbreaker'!" [...] New York Daily News writer Chris Baud joked about Eminem going one step further, writing: [...] "It's great that Mariah seems to be having fun with this whole 'Miminem' thing, but we're afraid of the conflict going any further, because no one wants to see the next step: Eminem in drag." [...] Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly complimented Carey for [...] "going after" [...] Eminem, and concluded [...] "I like Mariah with a sense of humor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> idea of her turning the tables on the king of celebrity-mocking videos." ...|$|E
500|$|The New Directions set {{of three}} Jackson family numbers was favorably {{reviewed}} by most critics, though they didn't necessarily agree on which songs were most effective.

Votta singled out [...] "ABC", which demonstrated [...] "what a lovely singer Tina is", and Kubicek said he enjoyed it [...] "mostly because Tina deserves more singing time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> fact that Mike is now an actual singer who gets his own solos". Chaney called it [...] "a solid performance" [...] and gave it a B+, while Futterman wrote that it [...] "felt like a flashback to the New Directions' group performances of yesteryear, when it was all about an over-the-top, feel-good attitude". The dancing in [...] "Control" [...] was highlighted in many reviews: Hyman and Slezak were complimentary, but Chaney wrote that the [...] "choreography seemed a little awkward and occasionally out of synch", that it was [...] "the least effective of the three Jackson numbers" [...] and added that for her [...] "this felt dated when it could have been retro-fresh"; she graded the song a [...] "C". However, Futterman made mention of the [...] "slick dance moves", and Votta noted that the [...] "jazz band guys" [...] were [...] "holding their own with the background dancing through the whole number". However, for Kubicek, the song [...] "definitely brought down the energy at the middle of their performance". Bell characterized the final song as [...] "an amazing 'Man in the Mirror' cover", and Chaney said it was [...] "the best of their three songs", and gave it an [...] "A−".
