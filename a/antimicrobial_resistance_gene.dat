A test study was performed on a collection of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from milk samples from dairy farms in Qu, Canada. The reproducibility of the hybridizations was determined, and the microarray results were compared with those obtained by phenotypic resistance tests (either MIC or Kirby-Bauer). The microarray genotyping demonstrated a correlation between penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin resistance phenotypes with the corresponding acquired resistance genes.

Our previous trials at a dairy showed that the maintenance of the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes</b> is not influenced by specific antimicrobial selection and that the most prevalent <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> phenotype of Escherichia coli is specifically selected for in young calves. In this paper we examine the role of secondary advantages conveyed by <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes.</b> We tested antimicrobial-susceptible null mutant strains for their ability to compete with their progenitor strains in vitro and in vivo.

On average, the null mutant strains were as competitive as the progenitor strains in vitro and in newborn calves (in vivo). Inoculation of newborn calves at the dairy with antimicrobial-susceptible strains of E. coli did not impact the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli. Our results demonstrate that the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes</b> are not responsible for the greater fitness advantage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli in calves, but the farm environment and the diet clearly exert critical selective pressures responsible for the maintenance of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes.</b> Our current hypothesis is that the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes</b> are linked to other genes responsible for differential fitness in dairy calves...|$|R

Aim: To study antimicrobial resistance and the presence of integrons and antimicrobial gene cassettes in Shigella flexneri strains. Material and methods: In vitro susceptibility to 27 antimicrobials was studied in twenty four Shigella flexneri strains isolated from stools. The presence of integrons class 1, 2 and 3 and <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>gene</b> cassettes was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers for each gene. Results: Most strains were resistant to one of the following antimicrobials: ampicillin, sulphonamide, trimethoprim, tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim or chloramphenicol. Twenty nine percent were simultaneously resistant to all these antimicrobials. Integrons class 1 and 2 were found in 19 strains (79 %). Class 3 integrons were not found.

Multiple liquid and solid samples were collected from each environment. The prevalences and concentrations of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) and Gram-positive (enterococci) bacteria were determined from individual samples (n = 174). The prevalences of 84 <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes</b> in metagenomic DNA isolated from samples pooled (n = 44) by collection date, location, and sample type were determined. The prevalences and concentrations of AMR E. coli and Salmonella were similar among the livestock and municipal sample sources. The levels of erythromycin-resistant enterococci were significantly higher in liquid samples from cattle catchment ponds and swine waste lagoons than in liquid samples from municipal wastewater treatment facilities, but solid samples from these environments did not differ significantly. Similarly, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant E. coli concentrations were significantly higher in swine liquid than in municipal liquid samples, {{but there was no}} difference in solid samples. Multivariate analysis of the distribution of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes</b> using principal coordinate analysis showed distinct clustering of samples with livestock (cattle and swine), low impact environment and municipal samples forming three separate clusters.

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding the {{survival}} of resistance plasmids {{in the absence of}} selective pressure for the antibiotic resistance genes they carry is important for assessing the value of interventions to combat resistant bacteria. Here, several poorly explored questions regarding the fitness impact of IncP 1 and IncN broad host range plasmids on their bacterial hosts are examined; namely, whether related plasmids have similar fitness impacts, whether this varies according to host genetic background, and what effect <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>gene</b> silencing has on fitness. Results For the IncP 1 group pairwise in vitro growth competition demonstrated that the fitness cost of plasmid RP 1 depends on the host strain. For the IncN group, plasmids R 46 and N 3 whose sequence is presented for the first time conferred remarkably different fitness costs despite sharing closely related backbone structures, implicating the accessory genes in fitness. Silencing of antimicrobial resistance genes was found to be beneficial for host fitness with RP 1 but not for IncN plasmid pVE 46. Conclusions These findings suggest that the fitness impact of a given plasmid on its host cannot be inferred from results obtained with other host-plasmid combinations, even if these are closely related. </p...|$|E

Antibiotic contents of farm-made fertilizers were assessed by LC/MS-MS. Phenotypic <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> {{was investigated in}} Escherichia (E.) coli (indicator bacteria); <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes</b> of the total bacterial microbiota (sul(II), tet(A), tet(B), tet(M); marker Measured in nUDD (number of animals treated multiplied by treatment days), colistin was {{the most frequently used}} antibiotic, in organic farms followed by tylosin, doxycycline and amoxicillin. Antibiotic residues were rarely detected; however, manure contained up to 10 ^ 8 <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes</b> per gram; concentrations were higher when the antibiotic had been used on farm. In six farms, antimicrobial resistant E. coli were tracked from the moment when pigs were placed on farm. Some isolates carried a broad variety of resistances from the very beginning that were maintained until slaughter, despite the fact that partly no antibiotics were applied during fattening.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{pressures to}} reduce or eliminate the use of antimicrobials for growth promotion purposes in production animals, {{there is a growing}} need to better understand the effects elicited by these agents in order to identify alternative approaches that might be used to maintain animal health. Antibiotic usage at subtherapeutic levels is postulated to confer a number of modulations in the microbes within the gut that ultimately result in growth promotion and reduced occurrence of disease. This study examined the effects of the coccidiostat monensin and the growth promoters virginiamycin and tylosin on the broiler chicken cecal microbiome and metagenome. Using a longitudinal design, cecal contents of commercial chickens were extracted and examined using 16 S rRNA and total DNA shotgun metagenomic pyrosequencing. A number of genus-level enrichments and depletions were observed in response to monensin alone, or monensin in combination with virginiamycin or tylosin. Of note, monensin effects included depletions of Roseburia, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus, and enrichments in Coprococcus and Anaerofilum. The most notable effect observed in the monensin/virginiamycin and monensin/tylosin treatments, but not in the monensin-alone treatments, was enrichments in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the metagenomic dataset identified enrichments in transport system genes, type I fimbrial genes, and type IV conjugative secretion system genes. No significant differences were observed with regard to <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>gene</b> counts. Overall, this study provides a more comprehensive glimpse of the chicken cecu...|$|E
40|$|Forty-one Streptococcus agalactiae {{isolates}} {{collected from}} pregnant women at 35 – 37 weeks of gestation were analysed for their capsular types, antimicrobial resistance determinants, distribution of virulence factors and genetic relatedness using PCR and multiplex PCR. Capsular type III was predominant (65. 8 %), followed by capsular type II (14. 6 %), Ib (7. 3 %), and V(4. 9 %). All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin {{were found in}} 97. 6 %, 24. 4 %, and 14. 6 % of isolates, respectively. The most common <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>gene</b> was tetM found in 97. 6 % of the isolates followed by ermTR and ermB found in 12 % and 7. 3 % of isolates, respectively. The most common virulence gene was hly (100 %), followed by scpB (97. 6 %), bca (97. 6 %), rib (53. 65 %) and bac (4. 9 %). The insertion sequence IS 1548 was found in 63. 4 % of isolates. By multi locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) typing, 30 different allelic profiles or MLVA types (MTs) were identified. The most frequent was the MT 1 (5 / 41, 12. 2 %) and followed by MT 2 (4 / 41, 9. 75 %). Our data revealed that population structure of these isolates is highly diverse and indicates different MLVA types...|$|E
40|$|This study {{characterized}} class 1 integrons in Escherichia coli in Taiwan. The {{stability and}} changes in gene cassettes inserted into integrons were also evaluated. The study included 436 clinical strains of E. coli isolated in 2002. Class 1 integrons were characterized by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Genetic localization of class 1 integrons was determined by conjugal transfer and Southern hybridization. The results indicated that 64 % of E. coli isolates carried class 1 integrons. Molecular analysis revealed that the class 1 integrons harbored 13 different <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>gene</b> cassettes and two unknown gene cassettes; the predominant cassettes were aadA and dfrA. Novel gene cassettes first recovered from E. coli were aacA 4 and linF. Cassette arrays orfD-aacA 4 -catB 8 and aadA 1 -linF were also observed. Gene cassette dfrA 12 -orfF-aadA 2 was stable. The class 1 integron and dfrA 17 -aadA 5 gene cassette were located on the same transferable plasmids and were capable of transmission. Therefore, the increased drug resistance of clinical isolates {{may be explained by}} antibiotic selective pressure and widespread presence of integrons. Under antibiotic selective pressure, gene cassette-mediated resistance may not be easily lost. The potential role of integrons in the uptake and dissemination of resistance genes by plasmid between species of bacteria may decrease the therapeutic effectiveness of antibiotics...|$|E

40|$|Campylobacter spp. {{are common}} {{pathogenic}} bacteria in both veterinary and human medicine. Infections caused by Campylobacter spp. are usually treated using antibiotics. However, the injudicious {{use of antibiotics}} has been proven to spearhead the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The {{purpose of this study}} was to detect the prevalence of antibiotic <b>resistance</b> <b>genes</b> in Campylobacter spp. isolated from chickens and human clinical cases in South Africa. One hundred and sixty one isolates of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were collected from chickens and human clinical cases and then screened for the presence of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes.</b> We observed a wide distribution of the tetO <b>gene,</b> which confers <b>resistance</b> to tetracycline. The gyrA genes that are responsible quinolone resistance were also detected. Finally, our study also detected the presence of the bla OXA- 61, which is associated with ampicillin resistance. There was a higher (p < 0. 05) prevalence of the studied <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes</b> in chicken faeces compared with human clinical isolates. The tetO gene was the most prevalent gene detected, which was isolated at 64 % and 68 % from human and chicken isolates, respectively. The presence of gyrA genes was significantly (p < 0. 05) associated with quinolone resistance. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the presence of gyrA (235 bp), gyrA (270 bp), bla OXA- 61 and tetO <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>genes</b> in C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from chickens and human clinical cases. This indicates that Campylobacter spp. have the potential of resistance to a number of antibiotic classes...|$|R
