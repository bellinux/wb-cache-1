5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During his years in office, {{he tried to keep}} alive the idea of a {{cultural}} nation called Germany, divided into two states. In his speeches and writings, he repeatedly urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to look upon themselves as a nation firmly <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city's occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party chief, in East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Both battleships were {{relegated to}} reserve and {{auxiliary}} {{roles in the}} mid-1930s. Kilkis, which had been upgraded in the mid-1920s, became a naval artillery training facility in 1932. Limnos guns were removed and installed in a coastal defense battery {{on the island of}} Aegina. While they were both <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Salamis Naval Base on 23 April 1941, both ships were sunk during the German invasion of Greece by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers. Kilkis was hit by bombs and went down in shallow water at her moorings; Limnos was also hit, but was able to get underway enough to be beached. The wrecks were refloated and sold for scrap in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|By December 1914, {{the ground}} forces Ocean {{supported}} had advanced to Al-Qurnah, at the juncture of the Euphrates and Tigris, allowing the Admiralty to recall Ocean for other purposes. She was accordingly stationed at Suez, Egypt, {{to assist in}} the defence of the Suez Canal, arriving there on 29 December. She <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth of {{the southern end of the}} canal on 29 December and remained in that area until mid-January 1915, when she proceeded northward up the canal. On 3–4 February, she and the armed merchant cruiser Himalaya supported ground troops against an Ottoman attack on the canal in the vicinity of El Kubri. Later on the 3rd, after the Ottoman attack at El Kubri had been defeated, Ocean was sent to Deversoir to provide artillery support to the garrison there, but Ottoman attacks were insignificant.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} French majority in numbers, {{the attack was}} a disaster: nearly 1,000 French soldiers were killed as the boats were caught in open water under the island's gun batteries: several were sunk with all hands. Heavy fire from batteries and Royal Marines prevented a single French soldier from landing and the retreating fleet was subject to heavy fire from the smaller island to the north, inflicting further losses. British casualties were negligible. Although this operation indicated the probable result of a full-scale invasion of Britain, the threat remained and British forces began a close blockade of the surviving landing craft that were <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cotentin ports. A month after the battle this strategy resulted in a secondary success when a French frigate and corvette passing along the coast were intercepted and defeated by the blockade squadron.|$|E
5|$|In February 1809 the French Atlantic Fleet, {{blockaded}} in Brest on the Breton coast by the British Channel Fleet, {{attempted to}} break out into the Atlantic and reinforce the garrison of Martinique. Sighted and chased by British blockade squadrons, the French were unable to escape the Bay of Biscay and eventually <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Basque Roads, near the naval base of Rochefort. There they were kept under observation during March by the British fleet under the dour Admiral Lord Gambier. The Admiralty, desiring {{an attack on the}} French fleet, ordered Lord Cochrane, an outspoken and popular junior captain, to lead an attack, over the objections of a number of senior officers. Cochrane organised an inshore squadron of fireships and bomb vessels, including a converted frigate, and personally led this force into Basque Roads on the evening of 11 April.|$|E

5|$|In February 1942, A, B and C Troops were {{dispatched}} to the Outer Hebrides {{under the command of}} Captain Lord Lovat for extra training. Returning to Troon in March, they were immediately sent to Dartmouth, Devon where they embarked on HMS Prins Albert. Once on board they were informed about Operation Bludgeon and started mission training. The objective of this raid was a large building that was a short distance inland from the Dutch coast, and that was used by senior German officers. For the duration of the operation BTroop were issued with flamethrowers to set the building on fire. After several days training, the commandos moved around the coast and <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Thames waiting for the order to go. The operation was eventually cancelled, due to the increased German E-Boat activity {{in the area of the}} landing.|$|E
5|$|In early 1799, Surcouf {{sailed to}} the city of Susoh in Aceh, on Sumatra, where he found two 20-gun merchantmen <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harbour, in the process of loading pepper; Clarisse dropped anchor close by and opened fire, after which Surcouf sent his older brother Nicolas to head a 20-man board party on Clarisse 's boats and board the largest of the ships, while he boarded her with Clarisse from the {{opposite}} side; assaulted from two sides, she surrendered after a 30-minute battle. The other ship cut her anchor and attempted to flee, but the boats of Clarisse overhauled and captured her without resistance, most of her crew being ashore. Surcouf returned to Île de France with his prizes in June.|$|E

Captain Murray's orders were to join a Mediterranean squadron under the overall command of Captain Robert Mann, which was tasked with intercepting merchant vessels suspected of supplying American rebels. While at sea Murray also took the opportunity to train his crew in seamanship and battle techniques, in preparation for future enemy engagement.

Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type of brand management is strongly <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E
5|$|Mathews and Cave {{also began}} to muster their forces, already {{commanding}} 900 Zanzibari askaris under Lieutenant Arthur Edward Harington Raikes of the Wiltshire Regiment who was seconded to the Zanzibar Army and held the rank of brigadier-general. 150 sailors and marines were landed from the Pearl-class protected cruiser Philomel and the gunboat Thrush, which were <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harbour. The naval contingent, {{under the command of}} Captain O'Callaghan, came ashore within fifteen minutes of being requested to deal with any rioting caused by the general population. A smaller contingent of sailors under Lieutenant Watson of Thrush were put ashore to guard the British consulate, where British citizens were requested to gather for protection. HMS Sparrow, another gunboat, entered the harbour and was anchored opposite the palace next to Thrush.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1914, Seeadler {{departed}} East Africa for {{the last}} time, bound for Germany. She had spent nearly thirteen {{and a half years}} abroad, the longest uninterrupted period of overseas service of any major German warship. Her replacement, her sister , had not yet arrived but was en route. Seeadler stopped in Aden on 22 January, and arrived in Kiel on 18 March. She was then moved to Danzig and decommissioned. On 6 May 1914, she was reclassified as a gunboat. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was reduced to a hulk for storing naval mines since she was no longer fit for active service. She was towed to Wilhelmshaven and <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer roadstead. On 19 April 1917, her cargo exploded while she was moored in the Jade outside Wilhelmshaven. The explosion destroyed the ship, but there were no casualties; her wreck was never raised.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{interpretation}} of <b>the</b> verbal <b>anchors</b> used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scales in different clinical groups and a healthy control group. Design: Prospective experimental study. Setting: Rehabilitation center. Participants: Nineteen subjects with brain injury, 16 with chronic low back pain (CLBP), and 20 healthy controls. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Subjects used a visual analog scale (VAS) to rate their interpretation of the verbal anchors from the Borg RPE 6 - 20 and the newer 10 -point category ratio scale. Results: All groups placed <b>the</b> verbal <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order that they occur on the scales. There were significant within-group differences (P >. 05) between VAS scores for 4 verbal <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group, 8 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CLBP group, and 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain injury group. There {{was no significant difference}} in rating of each verbal anchor between the groups (P >. 05). Conclusions: All subjects rated <b>the</b> verbal <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order they occur on the scales, but there was less agreement in rating of each verbal <b>anchor</b> among subjects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain injury group. Clinicians should consider the possibility of small discrepancies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meaning of the verbal anchors to subjects, particularly those recovering from brain injury, when they evaluate exercise perceptions...|$|R

5|$|Reitz was an {{important}} figure in Afrikaner cultural life. He was a poet, and published many poems in Afrikaans, making him a progenitor {{of the development of}} Afrikaans as a cultural language. As such he sympathised with the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners (Society of Real Afrikaners), established in the Cape Colony in 1875. Although he never became a member himself, he was an active contributor to the society's journal, Die Suid-Afrikaansche Patriot. With his literary work, Reitz was solidly <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> so-called First Afrikaans Language Movement, although he was less interested in the didactic drive of that movement than in writing in Afrikaans as a purely cultural activity. Much of his work was based on English texts, which he translated, edited, and adapted. In the process he produced completely new works of art.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg reached Ragusa on 24 August 1461 {{along with}} the Pal Engjëlli, the Archbishop of Durrës.

His fame was visible when he walked through the city-gates and the {{population}} poured into the streets to see him. He had been greeted with a ceremony and a tour of the city inspecting its walls and weaponry. He then received the financial sum he had come for. His men were also supplied with food for their coming campaign. His popularity allowed him to be well-kept by the Ragusans where the largest Albanian community outside of Albania was present. On 29 August 1461, Skanderbeg set off for Apulia, but a storm forced him to anchor off a Dalmatian island. On 3 September 1461, Skanderbeg finally reached Barletta.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish ships sought {{shelter from}} the British north of Trafalgar in Conil Bay, the {{entrance}} to which was protected by a large rocky ledge. Irresistible and Emerald negotiated this obstacle at around 14:30 and engaged the Spanish ships, which were <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay. The Spanish ships surrendered at approximately 16:00. Eighteen Spaniards were killed and 30 wounded during the fighting; one Briton was killed and one wounded. The remaining crew of Santa Elena avoided capture by cutting her cables and drifting her on shore so they could flee on foot. The British managed to drag Santa Elena off the beach but, badly damaged, she sank at sea.|$|E
