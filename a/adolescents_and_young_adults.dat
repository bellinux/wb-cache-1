Targeting <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E

The current paper reviews 23 studies reporting {{the occurrence of}} posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and associated predictors of these outcomes in <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>adult</b> {{cancer survivors}}. Results indicate considerable variability among prevalence estimates of PTSD (0 %– 34. 8 %) and PTSS (4. 4 %– 78 %). Measurement inconsistencies limiting the ascertainment of reliable prevalence and risk estimates {{are discussed in the}} context of the reviewed literature. Specifically, differences in assessment measures utilized, the timing of assessment relative to diagnosis, the criteria used to define the outcome, and identification of the precipitating traumatic event may account for discrepancies in prevalence and risk estimates across studies.

Such crashes represent a leading cause of death for <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>adults,</b> with the majority of deaths occurring in the developing world. In recent decades, while traffic fatalities have declined in industrialized nations, they have been on the rise in developing ones. Furthermore, developing nations tend to have a higher proportion of fatalities per number of vehicles for various reasons, including lower safety standards for vehicles. The lack of available emergency care in many developing countries only serves to exacerbate this problem. This higher rate of accident mortality per vehicle exists despite the fact that there are fewer cars in Asia and Africa than in the West. Odero et al. argue that this shows a need to improve emergency medical care.|$|E

This study was undertaken to identify the better indicator of Cardiac-risk factors by statistical comparison of BMI, Waist circumference, and Waist to Height (WtHr) ratio in apparently healthy <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>adult</b> female students of Tripura. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} a resource limited setup on 210 apparently healthy female <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>adult</b> students in Tripura. Mean (±SD) of all parameters were compared (ANOVA) to recognize significant independent (anthropometric measures) and dependent factors (blood pressure indices and so on). Correlation (r) analysis was used to identify the better (p) indicator of blood pressure indices (dependent variable) and its impact was assessed by Multiple Regression analysis. Results: blood pressure indices are comparatively higher in obese and overweight participants with statistically significant (95. 5 % confidence) mean differences. Significant correlation with dependent factors is observed with BMI followed by WtHr and Waist Circumference. Impact of anthropometric measures with blood pressure Indices is most significant for BMI (P ≤ 0. 020) followed by WtHr (P ≤ 0. 500) and waist circumference (P ≤ 0. 520).
