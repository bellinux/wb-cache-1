30|$|The {{study showed}} a {{significant}} positive role of access to training, extension service, and climate information in promoting farmers’ investment on <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures.</b> Providing agricultural extension services helps to increase {{the implementation of the}} <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> since farmers can able to acquire new skills and hence ensures sustainable use of the techniques. The knowledge gained through training can also capacitate farmers with the technical know-how required for implementing <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> in their agricultural production system and make them far-sighted to look for long-term benefits rather than immediate gains obtained at the expense land degradation. This is in agreement with the finding of Guteta and Abegaz (2015), Ketema and Bauer (2012) and Beshir et al. (2012) who reported that access to extension and training is instrumental for in promoting sustainable use of land-based climate change <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|R

40|$|Institutional {{feasibility}} {{defined as}} the ability of institutions to support adaptive capacity, is {{an important aspect of}} climate adaptation, through its influence on the implementation of <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> to climate change. The objective {{of this study is to}} create a framework for assessing institutional preconditions that enable or constrain climate change <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> in agriculture and to apply the framework to a case study in agriculture. We adopted and modified the Procedure for Institutional Compatibility Assessment (PICA). Institutions in our framework are characterized by a set of crucial institutional preconditions (CIPs) and indicators linked to each CIP. CIPs refer to both institutional incentives and constraints for implementation of <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> (here to climate change). We applied a combination of ranking and scoring techniques based on information from workshops, interviews and a literature review to assess institutional incentives and constraints for <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures,</b> together indicating the institutional feasibility of implementation of <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures.</b> We selected and assessed three <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> relevant to agriculture in Flevoland, a province in the Netherlands: (1) improvement of water management and irrigation facilities; (2) relocation of farms; and (3) development of new crop varieties. The two main constraining CIPs for the implementation of the measures were found to be (1) heterogeneity of actors’ interests and (2) availability of resources. Based on the institutional feasibility analysis, the implementation of water management and improvement of irrigation facilities will potentially face fewer institutional constraints compared to the other two measures. We conclude that our approach proves applicable for institutional analyses of <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> for current and future (climate) challenges at different levels of implementation, but that more applications are needed to test its validity and robustness...|$|R
40|$|The {{long term}} impact posed by climate change risk remains unclear and {{is subject to}} diverse interpretations from {{different}} maritime stakeholders. The inter-dynamics between climate change and ports can also significantly diversify in different geographical regions. Consequently, risk and cost data used to support climate adaptation is of high uncertainty and in many occasions, real data is often unavailable and incomplete. This paper presents a risk and cost evaluation methodology {{that can be applied}} to the analysis of port climate change <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> in situations where data uncertainty is high. Risk and cost criteria are used in a decision-making model for the selection of climate <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures.</b> Information produced using a fuzzy-Bayesian risk analysis approach is utilized to evaluate risk reduction outcomes from the use of <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> in ports. An evidential reasoning approach is then employed to synthesize the risk reduction data as inputs to the decision-making model. The results can assist policymakers in developing efficient <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> that take into account the reduction in the likelihood of risks, their possible consequences, their timeframe, and costs incurred. A technical study across 14 major container ports in Greater China is presented to demonstrate the interaction between cost and risk analysis, and to highlight the applicability of the stated methodology in practice. The paper offers a useful analytical tool for assessing climate change risks to ports and selecting the most cost-effective <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> in uncertain conditions. It can also be used to compare the practitioners' perceptions of climate risks across different geographical regions, and to evaluate improvements after implementation of the selected <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> with potential budgetary constraints. The methodology, together with the illustrative cases, provides important insights on how to develop efficient climate change <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> in a supply chain context to improve the sustainability of development and enhance <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> for ports, port cities, intermodal transport, supply chains, and urban and regional planning in general. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

30|$|The {{study found}} that {{household}} income has a negative and {{significant impact on the}} choice of adaptation options having crossbred animals and home feeding. This may be because higher income farmers may be less risk averse, and as a result, they may not pay for <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> against climate change. A study by Mandleni and Anim (2011 b) has shown that non-farm income decreased the likelihood of <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures.</b> On the other hand, contradicting findings were also reported in studies by Deressa et al. (2008), Sahua and Mishrab (2013), Getachew et al. (2014), Mabe et al. (2014), where household income is positively associated with <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|R

30|$|Finally, common {{household}} <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> {{should be}} valued {{according to their}} economic benefits. The reduction of costs depends {{on the type of}} adaptive measure; for example, temporary safety measures, such as door guards, reduce damage costs by 50 % (Thurston et al. 2008). However, in this study, comparable <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> (e.g. protective barriers) were found to be underrepresented in their implementation.|$|R
30|$|Further probing with FGDs {{participants}} {{revealed that}} some of these desired strategies, such as irrigation farming, development of water sources, and insurance for livestock assets, require an initial investment capital that is beyond the reach of many households. Similarly, although many households are interested in grain and fodder storage facilities, few would be interested in investing in these facilities bacause of pasture scarcity in the study area. While improved livestock breeds were mentioned as a desired effective <b>adaptation</b> <b>measure</b> to drought, access to livestock breeds and suitable veterinary services are problematic, because of financial constraints, the poor social and economic status of most households, and infrastructural challenges such as poorly developed markets in Turkana.|$|E
30|$|The {{relevance}} of different agronomic practices as <b>adaptation</b> <b>measure</b> is increasing over {{years in the}} study area to lessen the challenges of climate factors on agriculture.

This is in line with the findings of Lobell et al.

30|$|Broadly speaking, farmers {{adapt to}} varying climate either through the {{modification}} of the set of crops they choose to plant or improved cultural/management operations. Although many studies assume that no change in future in the set of crops cultivated, the importance of adopting crops or varieties which are tolerant to projected warmer and drier climate in the future cannot be glossed over. Adaptation options accessible by farmers include crop diversification, varying crop varieties, changing planting and harvesting dates, irrigation, use of water and soil conservation techniques and diversifying away from farming (Nhemachena and Hassan [2007]). A study by Corobov ([2002]) in Moldova shows that the adoption of late-maturing maize hybrids as an <b>adaptation</b> <b>measure</b> engenders considerable yield enhancement. The adoption of heat tolerant varieties of sorghum, millet, cotton, cowpeas and rice in Mali also attest to the yield- and welfare-enhancing effects of this <b>adaptation</b> <b>measure</b> (Butt et al. [2005]). Additionally, farmers can response to climate change in a more radical manner by changing the mix of crops grown. Kurukulasuriya and Mendelsohn ([2006]) and Seo and Mendelsohn ([2008]a) climate change adaptation studies for Africa and South America, respectively, have demonstrated how farmers change their planting decisions in response to warmer and drier climate. In dry and warm locations of Africa, farmers tend to choose millet and groundnut while maize and beans are chosen in wet but warm locations. Similarly, in warm locations of South America, farmers grow squash, fruits and vegetables while potatoes and maize are grown in cooler locations. Varying set of crops cultivated induces spatial shift of production pattern to places with mild climate. An assessment of global impact of climate change by Darwin et al. ([1995]) indicates that expansion of cultivable land will increase global food production. Butt et al. ([2005]) reports that the shift in crop production patterns southwards in Mali has helped to mitigate welfare losses.|$|E
40|$|A heat/health {{warning system}} (HHWS) was {{established}} in Germany as a climate change <b>adaptation</b> <b>measure</b> and as {{a direct consequence of}} the heat wave in 2003. The system used by the German weather service currently only provides information about outdoor conditions, i. e. no data on indoor climate - which may differ significantly from ambient conditions - are provided. This article describes an extension of the existing heat/health warning system based on a thermal building simulation model. It enables internal heat loads to be estimated based on predicted meteorological conditions. While the prediction model is limited to a worst-case scenario for practicability reasons, the information derived from the load values can nevertheless be very useful. The technique was used during summer 2007 in parallel with the conventional system, illustrating the added value...|$|E
30|$|The use of crop {{switching}} as <b>adaptation</b> <b>measure</b> is {{hindered by}} the fact that production decisions by farmers may not be motivated by yield- or profit-optimizing behavior. Farmers as consumers may have certain preferences for some crops over others. They are therefore likely to choose these crops although they may not be the ideal crop in terms of yield or welfare maximization (Chipanshi et al. [2003]). The disposition of farmers to risk may also stifle crop-switching efforts. Small-scale farmers are usually risk-averse and {{they are more likely to}} settle for crops with low yield variance rather than riskier but high yielding crops (Kaiser et al. [1993]). Finally, spatial shift in cropping patterns may result in degradation of tropical rainforest with its attendant effects on the ecosystem and loss of some economic benefits from utilization of forest resources (Darwin et al. [1995]).|$|E

In this paper, the effect of these passive climate <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> – applied at building component level – on the cooling and heating energy demand of a terraced house is analyzed using building energy simulations. It is shown that for this particular case the required cooling energy can be limited to a large extent (59 – 74 %) when external solar shading or additional natural ventilation is applied. In addition, it is shown that for a well-insulated terraced house the energy cost for heating is not strongly affected by the application of passive climate change <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Developing <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> in {{forestry}} is {{an urgent}} task because the forests regenerated today {{will have to}} cope with climate conditions that may drastically change during the life of the trees in the stand. This paper presents a comprehensive review of potential adaptation options in forestry in Europe based on three pillars: a review of the scientific literature, an analysis of current national response strategies, and an expert assessment based on a database compiled in the COST Action ECHOES (Expected Climate Change and Options for European Silviculture). The <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> include responses to both risks and opportunities created by climate change and address all stages of forestry operations. Measures targeted to reduce vulnerability to climate change may either aim to reduce forest sensitivity to adverse climate change impacts or increase adaptive capacity to cope with the changing environmental conditions. <b>Adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> mitigating drought and fire risk such as selection of more drought resistant species and genotypes are crucial. For adaptation to be successful it is of the utmost importance to disseminate the knowledge of suitable <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> to all decision makers from the practice to the policy level. The analysis of the ECHOES database demonstrates that this challenge is well recognized in many European countries. Uncertainty about the full extent of climate change impacts and the suitability of <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> creates a need for monitoring and further research. A better understanding of how to increase adaptive capacity is also needed, as well as regional vulnerability assessments which are crucial for targeting planned <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

To achieve this aim, an instrument (the Child <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Measure</b> of Potency, or CAMP) was developed to examine the construct of potency among this population. The psychometric properties of this new CAMP scale was analyzed among 90 preschool children and the scale was proven to be both reliable and valid. Sixty-six children participated in the intervention study itself: thirty-two children participated in an intensive intervention program while the remaining children served as a control group.
