40|$|Computer <b>aided</b> <b>assessment</b> (CAA) {{is widely}} used in higher education. However, the vast {{majority}} of current computer <b>aided</b> <b>assessment</b> systems provide only the following question types: multi-ple choice, multiple response, numeric answer, text string, “hot spot ” (or other graphic/mouse responses). Such question types have been criticized on many fronts. Only certain questions are suitable for these formats, other questions need to be rewritten to fit into the format, or worse dis-torted. In addition, there is consensus that such “objective tests ” promote surface and strategic, rather than deep, learning. This report deals with the principles behind, and technology to implement, automatic marking to assess higher level skills. There has been much educational research in this area, principally to design such questions within existing formats, or with minor modifications. Nevertheless automatic marking itself, and the technology underpinning it, may still only be described as primitive. The report details technologies to support automatic assessment of “higher skills”, with a partic-ular focus on scientific and engineering disciplines where the response to a question is an algebraic expression.

40|$|Assessment {{where there}} are {{concerns}} that an unborn child is likely to suffer significant harm {{is one of the}} most difficult tasks that social workers undertake; the legal and ethical context makes the process of assessment and intervention during this period complex. This paper explores pre-birth assessment guidance and practice in England. Local safeguarding guidance in 147 English localities was accessed and analysed, and interviews were conducted with 22 practitioners involved in pre-birth assessments. The findings showed that while most local safeguarding guidance was more detailed and explicit than the national guidance, legal and ethical issues were rarely addressed. Interview data showed that in general, guidance to support social work assessments during the pre-birth period was insufficient, and that few practitioners used standardised tools to <b>aid</b> <b>assessment.</b> Some practitioners regarded pre-birth assessments as less urgent than cases involving infants/older children, thereby increasing delays in decision-making.

In this manuscript the first draft of a minimum requirement for the description of the biological context of a meta-bolomic study involving mammalian subjects is described.

The experiments considered include functional genomic studies, drug toxicology, nutrigenomics, clinical trials, and other human studies. Two reporting requirements are described for pre-clinical (e. g. functional genomics, toxi-cology) and clinical (e. g. clinical trials, nutrigenomics) studies.

This study hypothesized an increase in parental support would increase academic achievement amongst AI/AN. A new trend recently emerged signifying a higher rate of young adults, especially college students, depending upon parental figures. An analysis of the Wave IV- ADD Health dataset revealed there was no significant relationship between the two variables. The insignificant relationship between academic achievement and parental support could mean attachment during adolescence may have contributed to attachment during young adulthood.

40|$|On-bottom {{pipelines}} for transporting {{oil and gas}} in {{deep water}} undergo significant changes in temperature and pressure during operating cycles, which cause a tendency for lateral buckling. Prediction and control of this phenomenon are required for the safe design and operation of these pipelines. However, the soil response under combined vertical and lateral loading is a significant area of uncertainty, and current practice relies on empirical expressions for the estimation of lateral pipe–soil resistance. This paper reports the results of finite element (FE) analyses of shallowly embedded pipelines under vertical and horizontal load. These analyses have been compared with collapse loads calculated using the upper-bound theorem of plasticity, and are used to construct yield envelopes defining the limiting combinations of vertical and horizontal load. The FE limiting loads were found to compare well with upper-bound plasticity solutions, and the internal soil displacements calculated in the FE analyses match the upper-bound and experimentally observed deformation patterns. The yield envelopes generated by the FE and upper-bound analyses have been fitted by simple solutions, which <b>aid</b> <b>assessment</b> of the ultimate resistance of shallowly embedded pipelines...|$|E

30|$|To <b>aid</b> <b>assessment</b> and {{comparison}} between individual cases, the spatial dose {{information can be}} combined into a (cumulative) dose-volume histogram (cDVH). These graphs express the {{fraction of the total}} VOI (be it a tumor, normal tissue, or entire liver) receiving a certain minimum absorbed dose. This expresses in a single graph how the absorbed dose is distributed over the volume (Fig.  4). The concept of cDVHs also enables the introduction of spatially dependent measures of absorbed dose such as D 70 (minimum absorbed dose to 70 % of VOI) and V 100 (percentage of VOI receiving at least 100  Gy) that might be expected to be good predictors of treatment effect [54, 55]. For example, it is clear from Fig.  4 a that the blue absorbed dose distribution clearly delivers a higher absorbed dose to more of the tumor volume (or conversely, red is less toxic when this is a cDVH of normal tissue). These metrics are widely used for the comparison between EBRT plans and are gaining some traction within the radioembolization dosimetry community to help better explain clinical outcomes [54, 56 – 59] (see “Dose-effect relationships” section).|$|E
