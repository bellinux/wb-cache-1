The Count dreamily, and ineffectually, pursues Concetta, while Concetta's younger sisters (Carolina and Caterina) dream romantically of Tancredi and the Count, and Tancredi and Angelica {{spend their time}} exploring the palace's many rooms, each of which contains some representation of a leopard, the family insignia. Narration describes how, on several occasions, Tancredi and Angelica <b>are</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> give in to their mutual sensual desire, but never do... and how this idyllic time of romantic, intimate gaming between them was a happy prelude to the miserable, unsuccessful marriage that followed.|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{governance}} {{mechanisms and}} controls {{are designed to}} reduce the inefficiencies that arise from moral hazard and adverse selection. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems. Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) {{in the case of}} privately held companies or a firm belonging to a business group. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior, occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the external auditor) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing incentive alignment toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals <b>are</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} of the film released in some countries, like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, differs. Instead of a pitch, the films are connected {{by a group of}} three teenagers searching for the most banned film in the world, Movie 43, which will ultimately lead to the destruction of civilization. Calvin Cutler (Mark L. Young) and his friend J.J. (Adam Cagley) make a video in the style of MTV's Jackass and upload it on YouTube where it instantly reaches over 1,000,000 views. This turns out to be an April Fool's prank from Calvin's younger brother Baxter (Devin Eash), who cloned YouTube and hyper-inflated the views while working on his science project. Calvin and J.J. attempt to get revenge. They tell Baxter of a film that's so dangerous it will cause the annihilation of the world. The movie is known as Movie 43. While J.J. and Baxter look for Movie 43 on Google, Calvin retrieves Baxter's laptop and loads it with viruses from porn sites, and masturbates to a strip tease video on the porn sites in a bathroom. Baxter finds hundreds of results for Movie 43 on a website referred to by him as a dark corner of the Internet. They find the sketches starting from the 43rd search on the list of results. As he and J.J. keep watching videos, they are interrupted by a man known as Vrankovich (Fisher Stevens) and a group of Chinese mobsters (Tim Chou and James Hsu) who <b>are</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> find Movie 43, even going as far as to take J.J.'s classmate Stevie Schraeder (Nate Hartley), film executive Griffin Schraeder's oldest son, hostage. Vrankovich warns them that if they find Movie 43, civilization will be left to ruins. They ignore his claims and keep searching. They eventually find the real, the one and only Movie 43, which turns out to involve Baxter as a profane commando who leads a group of recruits to survive after the world has ended. As Calvin finishes ruining Baxter's laptop, their mother (Beth Littleford) enters, wearing the same shirt and shorts that the woman in the strip tease video wore, causing Calvin to flip out after realizing that he had masturbated to a video of his mother. He also has visions, and finds semen from his erect crotch on his hand causing him to stare at his hand in shock and horror. Afterward, a deadly earthquake rumbles and mankind is lost. However, a few years later the only survivor, a crippled Calvin, finds Baxter's laptop still working despite viral infections. He watches the last remaining skits on the laptop. This version of the film was released in the U.S. as part of the Blu-ray Disc of Movie 43 as an unrated alternate cut of the film.|$|E
500|$|Homer is an [...] "everyman" [...] and embodies several American {{stereotypes}} of working class blue-collar men: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, dim witted, clumsy and a borderline alcoholic. Matt Groening describes him as [...] "completely ruled by his impulses". Dan Castellaneta calls him [...] "a dog {{trapped in a}} man's body", adding, [...] "He's incredibly loyal– not entirely clean– but you gotta love him." [...] In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Homer as [...] "the most American of the Simpsons" [...] and believes that while the other Simpson family members could be changed to other nationalities, Homer is [...] "pure American". In the book God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture, the authors comment that [...] "Homer's progress (or lack thereof) reveals a character who can do the right thing, if accidentally or begrudgingly." [...] The book [...] includes a chapter analyzing Homer's character {{from the perspective of}} Aristotelian virtue ethics. Raja Halwani writes that Homer's [...] "love of life" [...] is an admirable character trait, [...] "for many people <b>are</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> see in Homer nothing but buffoonery and immorality. [...] He is not politically correct, he is more than happy to judge others, and he certainly {{does not seem to be}} obsessed with his health. These qualities might not make Homer an admirable person, but they do make him admirable in some ways, and, more importantly, makes us crave him and the Homer Simpsons of this world." [...] In 2008, Entertainment Weekly justified designating The Simpsons as a television classic by stating, [...] "we all hail Simpson patriarch Homer because his joy is as palpable as his stupidity is stunning".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{cultures}} do {{not place}} a great emphasis on informing the patient of the diagnosis, especially when {{cancer is the}} diagnosis. [...] American culture rarely used truth-telling especially in medical cases, up until the 1970s. [...] In American medicine, the principle of informed consent now takes precedence over other ethical values, and patients are usually at least asked {{whether they want to}} know the diagnosis.. Additionally, The WMA International Code of Medical Ethics explicitly states, [...] "“A physician shall...report to the appropriate authorities those physicians who practice unethically or incompetently or who engage in fraud or deception." [...] There is also the conflict with physicians who <b>are</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> report made up incidents or make an incident worse than what it was for their own personal motives. In vice versa, a physician might be hesitant to report an incident because of a personal friendship he or she may have with his colleague.|$|E
2500|$|The Minority Rights Group {{report of}} 1985 (by Martin Short and Anthony McDermott) gave an {{estimate}} of 15% Kurds in the population of Turkey in 1980, i.e. 8,455,000 out of 44,500,000, with the preceding comment [...] "Nothing, apart from the actual 'borders' of Kurdistan, generates as much heat in the Kurdish question as the estimate of the Kurdish population. Kurdish nationalists <b>are</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> exaggerate it, and governments of the region to understate it. In Turkey only those Kurds who do not speak Turkish are officially counted for census purposes as Kurds, yielding a very low figure." [...] In [...] Turkey: A Country Study, a 1995 online publication of the U.S. Library of Congress, {{there is a whole}} chapter about Kurds in Turkey where it is stated that [...] "Turkey's censuses do not list Kurds as a separate ethnic group. Consequently, there are no reliable data on their total numbers. In 1995 {{estimates of the number of}} Kurds in Turkey is about 8.5 million" [...] out of 61.2 million, or 13% of the population at that time. Kurdish national identity is far from being limited to the Kurmanji-language community, as many Kurds whose parents migrated towards Istanbul or other large non-Kurdish cities mostly speak Turkish, which is one of the languages used by the Kurdish nationalist publications.|$|E
2500|$|He was {{the first}} to tell the {{audience}} that King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were even worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot. When the audience quieted, Kennedy acknowledged that many would be filled with anger. He said: [...] "For {{those of you who are}} black and <b>are</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man." [...] These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said that the country had to make an effort to [...] "go beyond these rather difficult times", and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, [...] "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." [...] In conclusion, Kennedy said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, quoting the Greeks again.|$|E
