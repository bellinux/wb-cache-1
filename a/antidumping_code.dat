5000|$|U.S. tariff {{concessions}} involved $8.5 {{billion worth of}} goods, and foreign {{tariff concessions}} on imports from the United States involved $8.1 billion. 64% of non-agricultural dutiable imports were covered by U.S. linear cuts, with an average tariff reduction of 35%. Foreign tariff reductions were on average 34%, and covered 48% of their non-agricultural dutiable imports. Non-tariff achievements included {{the establishment of the}} GATT <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Code</b> of 1967, which gave a procedural framework for negotiating dumping accusations and expanded upon the original Article VI in GATT. The round can also be seen as a success for developing nations. A [...] "Trade and Development" [...] section was added to the GATT charter; its most significant feature was excepting developing nations from the rule of reciprocity. It also called for the stabilization of raw material prices. Further, the agricultural grains arrangement provided for higher minimum trading prices as well as a food aid program to developing countries. Some progress was also made with negotiations on commodities. The round extended the Long Term Cotton Textile Arrangement for another three years and provided frameworks for negotiating steel, aluminum, chemicals, pulp, and paper tariffs.|$|E
40|$|This {{study reveals}} the {{determinants}} of injury decisions on antidumping duties under the WTO system using US data. The empirical evidence reveals that all commissioners consider the changes in profits of concerned industries seriously. Changes in profits/sales ratio influence the behaviour of a few commissioners. Changes in other factors illustrated in the <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Code,</b> the macroeconomic situation and the President's term do not influence commissioners' voting behaviour; nor are country effects found. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{voluntary}} {{export restraint}} (VER) is preferred to a tariff by a government concerned about electoral returns when the influence of industry profits is large relative to the losses to consumers from higher prices. If the foreign firm is uncertain of these pressures, the <b>antidumping</b> <b>code</b> facilitates the complete transfer of the relevant information and generates a VER rather than a tariff in equilibrium. The choice across instruments {{is determined by the}} political attributes. Domestic and foreign profits rise with the antidumping-generated VER, and the VER lowers the volume of trade by more than the expected duty. Copyright 1996 by American Economic Association. ...|$|E
40|$|Should the Uruguay Round negotiators on the <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Code</b> {{take the}} {{approach}} of the Tokyo Round and concentrate on a still more systematic interpretation of the existing notions embodied in current GATT texts on antidumping? Or should they adopt a wider approach to improve the basic notions on which GATT antidumping rules are based or to introduce new ones? So far, the proposals received by the Negotiating Group on antidumping rules have followed the first approach. They aim at tightening the interpretation of the basic notions embodied in GATT texts such as export price, normal and constructed values, comparison of normal value and export price, threat of injury, price undercutting, and undertaking. They do not introduce fundamentally new notions. This paper argues that the Uruguay Round negotiators should not feel limited to the first approach, which is based on a too narrow conception of "codification"...|$|E
40|$|It is usual {{to argue}} that the US <b>antidumping</b> <b>code</b> and legal {{practice}} have become a substitute for tariffs now severely limited by GATT and, somewhat like these displaced tariffs, they are intended to limit the extent of price competition by foreign sellers. However, there is one set of conditions under which the regulations and duties, and the accompanying increase in market price they bring about, increases domestic producer surplus more than they decrease consumer surplus and therefore increase domestic welfare. As is shown, these conditions require antidumping duties to exclude foreign manufacturers from the domestic market in a specific inverse relationship to the prevailing market price. While the duties imposed with an antidumping violation implicitly set out an exclusion rate for foreign manufacturers, there is little in the US code or legal practice which suggests that the duties and exclusion rates are established with this specific rule in mind.

40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} {{antidumping}} activity focus {{almost exclusively on}} the period since 1980. This paper puts recent U. S. antidumping experience in historical context by studying the determinants of annual case filings over the past half century. The conventional view that few antidumping cases existed prior to 1980 is not correct, although most {{did not result in}} the imposition of duties. The increased number of cases in recent decades largely reflects petitions that target multiple source countries; the number of imported products involved has actually fallen since the mid 1980 s. The annual number of antidumping cases is influenced by the unemployment rate, the exchange rate, import penetration (closely related to the decline in average tariffs), and changes in the antidumping law and enforcement in the early 1980 s.

40|$|During {{the period}} of {{structural}} changes in world economy, which increased in the 1970 s and 1980 s, with accompanying growth of trade protectionism, European Communities have more often than before reverted to antidumping procedures in trade protection. During that period a number of antidumping proceedings against Eastern European countries grew significantly. Antidumping regulations of European Communities, being in agreement with GATT rules (<b>Antidumping</b> <b>Code,</b> and Subsidies and Compensatory Customs Duties Code of 1979) are a very strong instrument of trade protectionism. Antidumping customs and price obligations are applied {{in order to protect}} the market against déstabilisation. When actions against subsidies increase, almost always antidumping proceedings are applied. Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, until they signed the association treaties with the European Communities, had been regarded by the Communities as the countries with centrally controlled economies. After the said treaties were signed, the European Communities have amended their antidumping regulations with respect to those countries. Since the date of the coming into force of the association treaties, these three countries have been treated as market economy countries. They have been obhgated to export their good for prices not lower than domestic prices. It allows to raise a few questions concerning mutual economic relations. Aform of protection against the increase of antidumping proceedings against Central-Eastern European countries may be the protection clauses. The application of such clauses may prove useful especially in the case of steel industry of the three countries. However, this could lead to the conflict of interests with the steel industry of the European Communities, which industry is "sensitive'' to external impulses.
