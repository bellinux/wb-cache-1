2500|$|Shortness of breath, {{also known}} as dyspnea, is a feeling like one cannot breathe well enough. The American Thoracic Society defines it as [...] "a {{subjective}} experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity", and recommends evaluating dyspnea by assessing {{the intensity of the}} distinct sensations, the degree of distress involved, and its burden or impact on activities of daily living.

2500|$|Awareness {{occurs when}} {{patients}} have anesthesia that is inadequate {{to keep them}} unconscious during an operation. [...] The incidence of this anesthesia complication is variable and seems to affect 0.2% to 0.4% of patients according to the surgical setting carried out. This variation reflects the surgical setting {{as well as the}} physiological state of the patient. Thus, the incidence is 0.2% in general surgery, about 0.4% during caesarean section, between 1 and 2% during cardiac surgery and between 10% and 40% for anesthesia of the traumatized. The majority of these do not feel pain although around one third did, in a range of experience from a sore throat due to the endotracheal tube, to traumatic pain at the incision site. The incidence is halved in the absence of neuro-muscular blockade. In this situation, the patient may feel the pain or pressure of surgery, hear conversation, experience <b>air</b> <b>hunger,</b> or have difficulty breathing. The patient may be unable to communicate any distress because they have been given a muscle relaxant; without this, they can move and the anesthesiologists are alerted and provide more anesthetic drugs to render the patient unconscious again. If anesthesia awareness does occur, about 42% feel the pain of the operation, 94% experience panic or anxiety, and 70% experience lasting symptoms which may be psychological and may be physical or neurological. The quoted incidences are controversial as many cases of [...] "awareness" [...] are open to interpretation. These usually involve feeling severe pain, clear recall of the conversations of the operating room staff or suffocation. Some patients undergo sedation for smaller procedures such as biopsies and colonoscopies and are told they will be asleep, although in fact they are getting a sedation that may allow some level of awareness as opposed to a general anesthetic.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the body}} {{requires}} oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels.

Deliberate hyperventilation has been used by underwater breath-hold divers for the purpose of extending dive time as it effectively reduces respiratory drive due to low [...] levels allowing one to break one's standard limit of breath holding at the risk of shallow water blackout (which is a significant cause of drowning) as while <b>air</b> <b>hunger</b> is reduced the oxygen levels are not increased, in fact hypocapnia reduces the oxygen levels available to the brain due to the elevated affinity of oxygen to hemoglobin (Bohr effect) hence highly increasing the chances of blackout.|$|E
50|$|The {{build-up}} of {{air into}} one of the pleural cavities, which causes a mediastinal shift. When this happens, the great vessels (particularly the superior vena cava) become kinked, which limits blood return to the heart. The condition can be recognized by severe <b>air</b> <b>hunger,</b> hypoxia, jugular venous distension, hyperressonance to percussion on the affected side, and a tracheal shift away from the affected side. The tracheal shift often requires a chest x-ray to appreciate (although treatment should be initiated prior to obtaining a chest x-ray if this condition is suspected). This is relieved by a needle thoracotomy (inserting a needle catheter) into the 2nd intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line, which relieves the pressure in the pleural cavity.|$|E
5000|$|An {{air choke}} or {{tracheal}} choke specifically {{refers to a}} [...] "true" [...] choke that compresses the upper airway (trachea, larynx or laryngopharynx), hence interfering with breathing, and leading to asphyxia.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} for plant to grow in mudstone area due to the fierce geologic and climatic condition. In order to improve the situation of continuing exposedness and advance the work of vegetation establishment. The most dominant plant Clerodendron inerme was chosen to test physiological influences and morphological changes in soil salinity and water stress. A portable photosynthesis system Li- 6400 {{was used to measure}} the physiological characteristics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: After drought acclimation treatment, Clerodendron inerme would defoliate to reduce the loss of water. The growth above ground for tested plants were slowly. The products of photosynthesis were transferred to roots in order to resist water stress. The net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of tested planted weren't decrease quickly during the early days of water withholding. The net photosynthetic rates were about 5 μmolm- 2 s- 1,and stomatal conductance were about 0. 045 molm- 2 s- 1 those were near the pre- treatment. With soil water contain decreased, the net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance decreased. After rewatering, the growth and physiology would revert to common states. During the flooding stress treatment, Clerodendron inerme would defoliated and growth was slowly, roots were restrained from <b>air</b> <b>hungered.</b> And the net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance would decrease quickly. Then photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance would increase, because of the tested plants had adapted to the flooding situation. After returned to the normal situation, the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were restored. There are few damages for tested plants during the process of flooding. After soil salinity treatment, the leaves of the tested plants would roll up, even more serious under high salinity conditions were to defoliate. The effects of salinity were growth slowly, and net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance would decrease. The salt of the soil would transferred to shoots, under the high soil salinity. 泥岩地區地質惡劣、氣候乾濕分明，環境條件不良，植物生長不易。為改善泥岩地區持續裸露情況，並加強植生復育工作，本研究選取泥岩地區優勢植物苦藍盤為試驗材料，探討苦藍盤在受土壤水分逆境與土壤鹽害後，植物形態與生理之反應，以LI- 6400 光合作用系統對不同處理之供試植物進行淨光合成率及氣孔導度等多種測定，對其生理之變化加以探討，茲將所得結果摘錄如下： 苦藍盤在缺水時，其形態上會以落葉來減少水分的損失，地上部生長變緩，光合成產物集中往地下部生長，來增加抗乾旱的能力。苦藍盤缺水時，其淨光合成率和氣孔導度在十天內，仍可維持與缺水前相當，淨光合成率約為 5 μmolm- 2 s- 1 ，氣孔導度約為 0. 045 molm- 2 s- 1 ，而後随著土壤水分含量的減少，淨光合成率與氣孔導度隨之下降。在恢復供水後，苦藍盤之淨光合成率與氣孔導度在七天後則有明顯之恢復。 苦藍盤在淹水時，植株上半的葉片易黃化枯萎、落葉，生長變緩慢，根部也因淹水缺氧而生長受到抑制，其淨光合成率和氣孔導度會因淹水而快速下降，而試驗十五天後因苦藍盤因適應淹水逆境，淨光合成率與氣孔導度均有增加之趨式。淹水逆境解除後淨光合成率與氣孔導度會慢慢回復，淹水對苦藍盤造成之傷害較少。 苦藍盤遭受土壤鹽害時，其植株葉片呈現捲曲狀態，嚴重者則葉片黃化枯萎、落葉。土壤鹽害會使苦藍盤生長受抑制，葉片淨光合成率與氣孔導度也因此下降。苦藍盤在土壤鹽分高時，會把植株體內的鹽分集中在新葉中，以排除植株體內鹽分。中文摘要 [...] - Ⅰ ABSTRACT [...] - Ⅱ 表次 [...] - Ⅳ 圖次 [...] - Ⅴ 壹、前言 [...] 1 貳、前人研究 [...] 3 一、泥岩地區植生困難之研究 [...] 3 二、植物對水分逆境之反應 [...] 5 三、植物對鹽分之反應 [...] - 10 參、試驗材料、項目與方法 [...] - 13 一、試驗材料之選定 [...] 13 二、供試之植物材料 [...] - 18 三、試驗項目與方法 [...] - 20 肆、結果與討論 [...] - 26 一、光合成對主要環境因子之反應 [...] - 26 二、斷水處理 [...] - 33 三、淹水處理 [...] - 43 四、鹽分處理 [...] - 51 伍、結論 [...] - 59 陸、參考文獻 [...] - 6...|$|R
50|$|Qualifiers, such as physical, mental, emotional, and psychological, {{are often}} {{used to refer to}} certain types of pain or suffering. In particular, mental pain (or suffering) may be used in {{relationship}} with physical pain (or suffering) for distinguishing between two wide categories of pain or suffering. A first caveat concerning such a distinction is that it uses physical pain in a sense that normally includes not only the 'typical sensory experience of physical pain' but also other unpleasant bodily experiences including <b>air</b> <b>hunger,</b> hunger, vestibular suffering, nausea, sleep deprivation, and itching. A second caveat is that the terms physical or mental should not be taken too literally: physical pain or suffering, as a matter of fact, happens through conscious minds and involves emotional aspects, while mental pain or suffering happens through physical brains and, being an emotion, involves important physiological aspects.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of heliophobia {{depends on the}} person. Mild sufferers may feel uncomfortable, shaky, nauseated, or numb. Severe sufferers may feel anxious or suffer panic attacks.

This physical pain may be expressed, for example, as a phantom sensation of their skin burning under direct sunlight, {{even when it is}} visually apparent that their skin is not actually burning any more than healthy skin would as a result of sun exposure, but nonetheless still feels like real pain for the sufferer. However, other differential diagnoses like the rare genetic defect erythropoietic protoporphyria characterized by a severe burning sensation of all exposed skin areas without leading to immediate visible signs have to be excluded.|$|E

Instead of having a bad death (dysthanasia) that can occur in hospitals, Martensen thought his father's death was relatively good. His father was 86, septic, had deteriorating lung function, an advance directive with a DNR, and he had started to receive morphine for <b>air</b> <b>hunger.</b> Alternatively, Martensen's father could have been put on a mechanical ventilator. However, that would have violated both Martensen and his father's wishes. Martensen explained that ... ventilators were developed to bridge difficult situations: somebody has a traumatic injury; somebody has an infection, their lungs are not functioning; somebody is recovering from surgery and their lungs are not functioning. You put them on a ventilator—the intention was to get them over a difficult patch and allow them to survive. For my dad, who was in his 86th year, who had a progressive deteriorating lung function, he had been doing pretty well till three weeks before he died, then things got worse. And to put him on a ventilator would have just extended that artificial functioning for an indefinite period of time. And ... your body can't tolerate a ventilator without being heavily sedated, particularly initially ... imagine something blocking your airway. Well, the brain reflex is so primitive and so powerful, you'll do anything to get it out. And the way medicine counters that is by initially paralyzing people but then sedating them and giving them pain meds and so forth. That to my father would have been anathema, and it also—from my father's point of view, and I happen to agree with him—would have been to no purpose, because ... he never would have gotten off the ventilator. Instead of dying in two days, he might have died in two weeks or two months later, but he never {{would have been able to}} get off the ventilator because he didn't have the lung function. [...] As the morphine began to act on Martensen's father, his anxiety from <b>air</b> <b>hunger</b> was lessening and he was still conscious.

40|$|Determining {{response}} {{dynamics of}} hypoxic <b>air</b> <b>hunger</b> may provide information of use in clinical practice, and will improve understanding of basic dyspnea mechanisms.

40|$|Dyspnoea has {{distinct}} sensory modalities, including <b>air</b> <b>hunger</b> and {{the sensation}} of excessive breathing "work/effort". Both have analgesic properties. In the case of work/effort, spinal mechanisms have been documented (inhibitory effect on the spinal nociceptive flexor reflex, RIII). This mechanism involves C-fibres. As C-fibres are unlikely {{to play a major}} role in <b>air</b> <b>hunger,</b> we hypothesised that inducing this type of dyspnoea would not result in RIII inhibition. Eight healthy volunteers were exposed to a hypercapnic hyperoxic gas mixture (5 % CO 2 and 95 % O 2) and asked to voluntarily fight the corresponding ventilatory reflex response by reducing tidal volume below its spontaneous level. Ventilatory variables and dyspnoea intensity (ordinal scale) were measured. Electromyography of the biceps femoris was used to record the amplitude of RIII in response to painful electrical sural nerve stimulation. <b>Air</b> <b>hunger</b> failed to inhibit the RIII reflex. We conclude that the mechanisms of <b>air</b> <b>hunger</b> induced analgesia do not include a spinal contribution and are therefore mostly central...|$|E
