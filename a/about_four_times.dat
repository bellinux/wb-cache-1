5|$|The {{combined}} {{analysis of}} imaging, mass spectrometry, and magnetospheric data {{suggests that the}} observed south polar plume emanates from pressurized subsurface chambers, similar to Earth's geysers,. The mechanism that drives and sustains the eruptions {{is thought to be}} tidal heating. The intensity of the eruption of the south polar jets varies significantly {{as a function of the}} position of Enceladus in its orbit. The plumes are <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> brighter when Enceladus is at apoapsis (the point in its orbit most distant from Saturn) than when it is at periapsis. This is consistent with geophysical calculations which predict the south polar fissures are under compression near periapsis, pushing them shut, and under tension near apoapsis, pulling them open.|$|E

Originally budgeted for US$800,000, the game ultimately cost $4.5 million to develop, and it was filmed in a $1.5 million studio Sierra built specifically for the game.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Scotland {{probably}} had about {{one quarter of the}} population of England, it had three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions, at an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 over the entire period. This was <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> the European average. The overwhelming majority were in the Lowlands, where the Kirk had more control, despite the evidence that basic magical beliefs were very widespread in the Highlands. Persecution of witchcraft in Orkney differed from the mainland with most trials taking place before 1650. Large series of trials included those in 1590–91 and the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597, which took place across Scotland from March to October. At least 400 people were put on trial for various forms of diabolism. The exact number of those executed {{as a result of these}} trials is unknown, but is believed to be about 200. Later major trials included hunts in 1628–31 and 1649–50. Probably the most intense witch-hunt was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRho GTPases act as {{molecular}} switches {{central in}} cellular {{processes such as}} cytoskeleton dynamics, migration, cell proliferation, growth or survival. Their activation is tightly regulated downstream of cell surface receptors by Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs), {{that are responsible for}} the specificity, the accuracy, and the spatial restriction of Rho GTPases response to extracellular cues. Because there is <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>time</b> more RhoGEFs that Rho GTPases, and GEFs do not always show a strict specificity for GTPases, it is clear that their regulation depends on specific interactions with the subcellular environment. RhoGEFs bear a peculiar structure, highly conserved though evolution, consisting of a DH-PH tandem, the DH (Dbl homology) domain being responsible for the exchange activity. The function of the PH (Pleckstrin homology) domain known to bind phosphoinositides, however, remains elusive, and reports are in many cases rather confusing. This review summarizes data on the regulation of RhoGEFs activity through interaction of the PH-associated DH domain with phosphoinositides which are considered as critical players in the spatial organization of major signaling pathways...|$|R

40|$|The locomotory {{behavior}} of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is often characterized by two distinct gaits - swimming when in fluids and crawling when on surfaces. Swimming is characterized by about a twice greater wavelength and <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>time</b> greater frequency of undulatory waves, compared with the crawling gait. These mechanisms which generate these gaits are not well-understood but have been suggested {{to be controlled by}} two separate neural circuits of central pattern generators. Here we studied the locomotion of young adult C. elegans in viscous fluids ranging from 0. 001 - 1000 Pa s to determine whether there is a sharp or continuous transition between swimming and crawling. We characterized the locomotion by two parameters: the wavelength and the frequency of the undulating gaits. Our results for both parameters show a smooth transition, which suggests {{that there is only one}} neural circuit controlling forward locomotion which is modulated by the mechanical loading of the environment. by Risa Kawai.
