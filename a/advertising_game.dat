5000|$|Tacit {{collusion}} is {{best understood}} {{in the context of}} a duopoly and the concept of game theory (namely, Nash equilibrium). Let's take an example of two firms A and B, who both play an <b>advertising</b> <b>game</b> over an indefinite number of periods (effectively saying 'infinitely many'). Both of the firms' payoffs are contingent upon their own action, but more importantly the action of their competitor. They can choose to stay at the current level of advertising or choose a more aggressive advertising strategy. If either firm chooses low advertising while the other chooses high, then the low-advertising firm will suffer a great loss in market share while the other experiences a boost. However if they both choose high advertising, then neither firms' market share will increase but their advertising costs will increase, thus lowering their profits. If they both choose to stay at the normal level of advertising, then sales will remain constant without the added advertising expense. Thus, both firms will experience a greater payoff if they both choose normal advertising (however this set of actions is unstable, as both are tempted to defect to higher advertising to increase payoffs). A payoff matrix is presented with numbers given: ...|$|E

Based on this setting, we discuss three <b>advertising</b> <b>game</b> models, that is, cooperative game, Boxed Pig game, and Prisoner’s game, derive the conditions for different advertising games, and characterize their equilibria. To be specific, {{it is found that}} the advertising spillover and the number of the small service providers directly determines the <b>advertising</b> <b>game</b> equilibria, while other market parameters, to some extent, can affect the results of the <b>advertising</b> <b>game</b> equilibria.

40|$|Vertical {{cooperative}} (co-op) {{advertising is}} a marketing strategy {{in which the}} retailer runs local advertising and the manufacturer pays {{for a portion of}} its entire costs. This paper considers vertical co-op advertising along with pricing decisions in a supply chain; this consists of one manufacturer and one retailer where demand is influenced by both price and advertisement. Four game-theoretic models are established in order to study the effect of supply chain power balance on the optimal decisions of supply chain members. Comparisons and insights are developed. These embrace three non-cooperative games including Nash, Stackelberg-manufacturer and Stackelberg-retailer, and one cooperative game. In the latter case, both the manufacturer and the retailer reach the highest profit level; subsequently, the feasibility of bargaining game is discussed in a bid to determine a scheme to share the extra joint profit.

40|$|A {{critical}} issue of distributed systems {{is concerned with}} the advertising task. Current solutions require an ex-ante agreement on a common shared language. Although such an approach is feasible from the technological point of view, it is not effective in practice. The process of managing this agreement may present social implications that make the solution difficult to achieve. Recent trends in research propose a new approach based on advertising games where the agreement on a common language is produced at run time. Nevertheless up to now such a model has been studied only through simulations with standalone platforms. Our contribution is the design and the development of the first web services oriented architecture for advertising games. Therefore we approached all the issues typical of distributed systems neglected by the simulators like asynchronous communications, denial of services, and so on. Finally we present a real world application where the architecture has been deployed to support the advertising task using an <b>advertising</b> <b>game</b> model. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Advertising plays a {{key role}} in service {{oriented}} recommendation over a peer-to-peer network. The advertising problem can be considered as the problem of finding a common language to denote the peers’ capabilities and needs. Up to now the current approaches to the problem of advertising revealed that the proposed solutions either affect the autonomy assumption or do not scale up the size of the network. We explain how an approach based on language games can be effective in dealing with the typical issue of advertising: do not require ex-ante agreement and to be responsive to the evolution of the network as an open system. In the paper we introduce the notion of <b>advertising</b> <b>game,</b> a specific language game designed to deal with the issue of supporting the emergence of a common denotation language over a network of peers. We provide the related computational model and an experimental evaluation. A positive empirical evidence is achieved by sketching a peer-to-peer recommendation service for bookmark exchanging using real data. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} {{theories}} of exposure order effects, developed in the psychology literature, to an industrial organization model to explore their role in advertising compe-tition. There are two firms and infinitely many identical consumers. The firms produce a homogeneous product and distribute their brands through a common retailer. Consumers randomly arrive at the retailer and buy their most preferred brands. The order in which a consumer sees the advertising messages affects his brand preferences. Under the primacy effect the consumer prefers the brand he first saw advertised, under the recency – the last encountered brand. The equilibrium of the <b>advertising</b> <b>game</b> is characterized separately under the primacy and the recency effects. In the first setting all consumers are initially unaware of the product existence. The equilibrium advertising intensities, remarkably, do {{not depend on the}} type of exposure order effect. In the other two settings some consumers have already formed their brand preferences. The primacy and the recency effects give rise to different equilibrium outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Cooperative {{advertising}} is {{a practice that}} a manufacturer pays retailers {{a portion of the}} local advertising cost in order to induce sales. Cooperative advertising plays a significant role in marketing programs of channel members. Nevertheless, most studies to date on cooperative advertising have assumed that the market demand is only influenced by advertising expenditures but not by retail price. This paper addresses channel coordination by seeking optimal cooperative advertising strategies and equilibrium pricing in a two-member distribution channel. We establish and compare two models: a non-cooperative, leader-follower game and a cooperative game. We develop propositions and insights from the comparison of these models. The cooperative model achieves better coordination by generating higher channel-wide profits than the non-cooperative model with these features: (a) the retailer price is lower to consumers; and (b) the advertising efforts are higher for all channel members. We identify the feasible solutions to a bargaining problem where the channel members can determine how to divide the extra profits.

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} theory of memory for advertising, {{developed}} in the consumer behavior literature, to an industrial organization setting to provide insight into advertising strategies in imperfectly competitive markets. There are two firms and infinitely many identical consumers. The firms produce a homogeneous product and distribute their brands through a common retailer. Consumers randomly arrive {{and are willing to}} buy one unit of the product. They are unaware of the existence of a particular brand unless they remember an ad describing it. Under "retroactive interference'' consumers remember recently seen ads and forget about ads they saw in the past. Under "proactive interference'' the ability of consumers to recall new ads is hampered by past ad exposure. The equilibrium of the <b>advertising</b> <b>game</b> is characterized for both proactive and retroactive interferences across three strategic settings. In the Simultaneous Move setting, the firms' equilibrium advertising frequencies, remarkably, do not depend on the type of interference. In the Sequential Move and Dynamic settings, proactive and retroactive interferences do give rise to different equilibrium outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The main {{question}} {{of this research}} is: Who should undertake promotional and brand-image advertising if the franchisor and franchisees act so as to maximize their respective profits? To address this question, we study a two-stage <b>advertising</b> <b>game</b> between a franchisor and two adjacent franchisees. In {{the first stage of}} the game, the franchisor chooses between three advertising models - centralizing or delegating the two types of advertising to the franchisees or delegating only promotional advertising. In the second stage, given the franchisor's choice of an advertising model, the two franchisees {{decide whether or not to}} cooperate. Our main findings are that (1) the franchisees should cooperate if the franchisor delegates either both brand-image and promotional advertising or promotional advertising, although cooperation between franchisees does not necessary improve the franchisor's profits. (2) The choice of an advertising arrangement critically depends on the margins as well as the costs of performing both promotional and brand-image advertising. We also discuss the conditions under which the three advertising models should be implemented. Game theory Marketing Franchising Cooperative advertising Horizontal cooperation...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{fragmentation of}} media markets and {{recent advances in}} technology, loss of advertising effectiveness {{has been a great}} concern for marketers. For consumers, the digital video recorder (DVR) offers the possibility to fast-forward through live programming. Whereas the DVR thus benefits consumers by reducing nuisance from commercials, industry observers believe that it may diminish advertisers' profits by rendering commercials ineffective. We use a model of informative advertising to study the effect of DVR penetration on competing advertisers' strategies and profits. We find that the overall effect of DVRs depends on the trade off between loss of advertising effectiveness and reduction in competition between firms. The latter effect arises because DVR penetration may increase the ratio of partially informed to fully informed consumers. We identify conditions under which an increase in DVR penetration counterintuitively leads firms to increase advertising levels and enjoy higher profits. Interestingly, we find that greater DVR penetration is beneficial for firms when the share of DVR owners in the population is above [...] rather than below [...] a threshold level. We also study the impact of different fast-forwarding ("zipping") behaviors on product market competition. <b>advertising,</b> <b>game</b> theory, competitive analysis, marketing strategy, advertising avoidance technologies...|$|E
