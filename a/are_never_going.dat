500|$|Abrams had {{at first}} been {{concerned}} about casting a Korean-American as a Japanese character, but George Takei reassured him that Sulu had been meant to represent all of Asia on Enterprise, so Abrams went ahead with Cho. Cho acknowledged that being an Asian-American, [...] "there are certain acting roles that you <b>are</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to get, {{and one of them}} is playing a cowboy. [...] is a realization of that dream – going into space." [...] He cited the masculinity of the character as being important to him, and spent two weeks fight training. Although Cho suffered an injury to his wrist during filming, a representative reassured the public that the injury was [...] "no big deal". James Kyson Lee had originally been interested in playing the part of Sulu, but both he and Quinto, who had already been cast as Spock, were at the time members of the cast of the television series Heroes, and its producers told Lee they did not want to lose another cast member for three months.|$|E

2500|$|The {{characters}} of Rosario + Vampire have received criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Theron Martin of Anime News Network describes Tsukune as a [...] "cookie-cutter harem male lead, an unfailingly kind-hearted, indecisive wimp who primarily has {{a thing for}} Moka but still treasures the other girls as friends." [...] Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, in reviewing the manga, noted Tsukune's character design as lazy: [...] "shove in any other male protagonist from a harem series and nobody would notice too much". He found the girls [...] "distinctive, if predictable (the beauty, the boobs, the jailbait)", but concluded in a later volume that [...] "The story's never going to go anywhere, the characters <b>are</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to go anywhere, and the artwork {{is always going to}} have that same polished-but-flawed look." [...] Stig Høgset of THEM Anime Reviews found Moka to be ditzy and a [...] "pink-haired dolt"; he criticized her lack of vampire weaknesses such as walking around in broad daylight at a beach, but found her alternate personality as [...] "pretty damn badass", [...] "a great addition to the show, if a severely underutilized one", and wished that her character was developed better. Deb Aoki of About.com called Moka a magical ditz who loves the doofus but also kicks butt. Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk noted that Kokoa is not another character that has a massive crush on the same guy; however, Høgset noted that her anime role was reduced to obnoxious comedy acts.|$|E
2500|$|Madame Nhu's brother-in-law, Ngo Dinh Diem, {{had been}} {{appointed}} Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by her mother's distant cousin, Emperor Bảo Đại, after the French had been defeated at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ. At the start of 1955, French Indochina was dissolved, leaving Diệm in temporary control of the south. After the French defeat at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, the French wanted {{to hang on to}} a zone of influence in the south by keeping the Emperor Bảo Đại, while the Americans wanted to push the French out by having Diem create a republic [...] Diem in the words of an American diplomat had developed [...] "a blind hatred of the French" [...] and the Americans believed that South Vietnam needed an anti-Communist leader who was not tainted with any associations with the French, which led them to back Diem. Madame Nhu had lobbied Bao Dai to appoint her brother-in-law Prime Minister and believed that it was her influence that led to the appointment. She was deeply shocked to learn the real reason why Bao Dai had appointed Diem Prime Minister was out of the expectation that he would fail in order to neutralize him as the State of Vietnam was in a serious political and economic crisis by 1954 that almost nobody expected Diem to master, and she never forgave either the Emperor or the French for their plot to ruin Diem. In order to ensure American support for Diem, Madame Nhu befriended Americans working at the embassy in Saigon known to be CIA agents. For their part, the French backed General Nguyễn Văn Hinh as Prime Minister, and he in his turn had won the support of the Binh Xuyen crime syndicate that dominated the economic life of Saigon. Giving Madame Nhu an additional reason to intrigue against Hinh was his repeated boasting when he deposed Diem he would make Madame Nhu into another of his concubines. At a party, Madame Nhu confronted Hinh to tell him: [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to overthrow this government because you don't have the guts. And if you do overthrow the government, you will never have me because I will claw your throat out first!" [...] To win support for Diem, Madame Nhu hit upon the idea of enlisting support from the million or so refugees, many of them Catholics who fled to the south after the Geneva accords had partitioned Vietnam, organizing them for a massive pro-Diem demonstration on 21 September 1954. The rally in Saigon led a confrontation on the streets between Madame Nhu and Binh Xuyen gunmen, with Nhu daring the thugs to kill her right then and there, which caused them to demurr, and the rally went on. Emboldened by this triumph, Diem saw a chance to put his puritanical Roman Catholic values into practice and to strike a blow at the Binh Xuyen at the same time by shutting down the brothels, gambling houses and opium dens of Saigon owned by the Binh Xuyen while having pornographic magazines burned on the streets (the Binh Xuyen were the largest producers and sellers of pornography in Vietnam).|$|E

6000|$|We had {{the pretty}} place almost to {{ourselves}} at that hour. There were a half-dozen or so nursemaids, pushing their perambulators about, or standing the vehicles across the walk {{in front of}} the benches where they sat, in the simple belief of all people who have to do with babies {{that the rest of the}} world may be fitly discommoded in their behalf. But they did not actively molest us, and they scarcely circumscribed our choice of seats. We were by no means driven to the little kiosk in the lake for them, and I should rather say that we were fatefully led there, so apt were the associations of the place to my purpose. Nothing could have been more natural than that I should say, as we sat down there, [...] "This was where I first saw Miss Gage with her friends"; and it was by a perfectly natural transition that I should go on to speak, in a semi-humorous strain, of the responsibility which Mrs. March and myself had incurred by letting our sympathy for her run away with us. I said I supposed that if we had not been willing from the first to try to realise for her some of the expectations we imagined she had in coming to Saratoga, she never would have fallen to our charge; that people really brought a great many more things upon themselves than they were willing to own; and that fate was perhaps more the fulfilment of our tacit ambitions than our overt acts. This bit of philosophy, which I confess I thought fine, did not seem to impress Kendricks. He merely said that it must be great fun to have the chance of baffling the malice of circumstance in a case like that, and I perceived that he felt nothing complex in the situation. In fact, I doubt whether youth perceives anything complex in life. To the young, life is a very plain case. To be sure, they are much more alarmed than their elders at getting tangled up in its web at times, but that is because they have not had our experience in getting untangled, and think they <b>are</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to get out alive. When they do, they think that it is the only tangle they are ever going to be in, and do not know that they are simply going on from one to another as long as there is enough of them left to be caught in a mesh. To Kendricks we Marches were simply two amiable people, who had fancied doing a pleasant thing for a beautiful girl that accident had thrown it in our power to befriend, and were by no means the trembling arbiters of her destiny we felt ourselves to be. The difference between his objective sense and my subjective sense was the difference between his twenty-seven years and my fifty-two, and while this remained I saw that it would be useless to try to get on common ground with him, or to give him our point of view. If I were to speak to him at all, it must be with authority, with the right of one who stood in the place of the girl's parents, and had her happiness at heart. That is, it was something like that; but my words say it too bluntly. I found myself beginning, [...] "I have rather had a notion that her father might come on, and take the enterprise off our hands," [...] though, to tell the truth, I had never imagined such a thing, which came into my head at that moment through an association with the thought of parents.|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Wanhope resumed, [...] "she {{says she}} scolded him, {{and it did}} not do the least good. She could not scold him out of that feeling, which was all mixed up in her retrospect with the sense of the weather and the season, the leaves just {{beginning}} to show the autumn, the wild asters coming to crowd the goldenrod, the crickets shrill in the grass, and the birds silent in the trees, the smell of the rowan in the meadows, and the odor of the old logs and fresh chips in the woods. She was not a woman to notice such things much, but he talked of them all and made her notice them. His nature took hold upon what we call nature, and clung fondly to the lowly and familiar aspects of it. Once she said to him, trembling for him, 'I should think you would be afraid to take such a pleasure in those things,' and when he asked her why, she couldn't or wouldn't tell him; but he understood, and he said: 'I've never realized before that I was {{so much a part of}} them. Either I am going to have them forever, or they are going to have me. We shall not part, for we are all members of the same body. If it is the body of death, we are members of that. If it is the body of life, we are members of that. Either I have never lived, or else I am never going to die.' She said: 'Of course you <b>are</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to die; a spirit can't die.' But he told her he didn't mean that. He was just as radiantly happy when they would get home from one of their drives, and sit down to their supper, which they had country-fashion instead of dinner, and then when they would turn into their big, lamplit parlor, and sit down for a long evening with his books. Sometimes he read to her as she sewed, but he read mostly to himself, and he said he hadn't had such a bath of poetry since he was a boy. Sometimes in the splendid nights, which were so clear that you could catch the silver glint of the gossamers in the thin air, he would go out and walk up and down the long veranda. Once, when he coaxed her out with him, he took her under the arm and walked her up and down, and he said: 'Isn't it like a ship? The earth is like a ship, and we're sailing, sailing! Oh, I wonder where!' Then he stopped with a sob, and she was startled, and asked him what the matter was, but he couldn't tell her. She was more frightened than ever at what seemed a break in his happiness. She was troubled about his reading the Bible so much, especially the Old Testament; but he told her he had never known before what majestic literature it was. There were some turns or phrases in it that peculiarly took his fancy and seemed to feed it with inexhaustible suggestion. 'The Angel of the Lord' was one of these. The idea of a divine messenger, embodied and commissioned to intimate the creative will to the creature: it was sublime, it was ineffable. He wondered that men had ever come to think in any other terms of the living law that we were under, and that could much less conceivably operate like an insensate mechanism than it could reveal itself as a constant purpose. He said he believed that in every great moral crisis, in every ordeal of conscience, a man was aware of standing in the presence of something sent to try him and test him, and that this something was the Angel of the Lord.|$|E
