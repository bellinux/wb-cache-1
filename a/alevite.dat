5000|$|Simko Shikak revolt {{refers to}} an armed Ottoman-backed tribal Kurdish {{uprising}} against the Qajar dynasty of Iran from 1918-1922, led by Kurdish chieftain Simko Shikak from Turcophone Shekak tribe. This tribal rebellion is sometimes regarded as first major bid for establishing independent Kurdistan in Iran, but scholars see revolt as attempt by a powerful tribal chief to establish his personal authority vis-à-vis the central government throughout the region. Although elements of Kurdish nationalism were present in this movement, historians agree these were hardly articulate enough to justify a claim that recognition of Kurdish identity was {{a major issue in}} Simko's movement, and he had to rely heavily on conventional tribal motives. It lacked any kind of administrative organization and Simko was primary interesting in plunder. Government forces and non-Kurds were not the only ones to suffer in the attacks, the Kurdish population was also robbed and assaulted. Simko's men do not appear to have felt any sense of unity or solidarity with fellow Kurds. Historian Ervand Abrahamian calls Simko as [...] "notorious" [...] for allegedly massacring thousands Assyrians and supposedly [...] "harassing" [...] democrats, and Mehrdad Izady holds him responsible for killing <b>Alevite</b> Kurds. Still, Kurdish ethnicists today revere Simko as a hero of independence.|$|E
50|$|The Tatars {{consider}} themselves good Muslims. The better educated and younger Tatars regard the Turks as fanatics and themselves as moderates - which {{they believe is}} an advantage. Respondents distinguish the two communities by the Islam-based segregation {{of women in the}} case of the Turks and the absence of such discrimination among the Tatars, as well as by the attitude to the Christians and the <b>Alevites.</b> The Tatars are tolerant towards the <b>Alevites</b> (Shias) while the Turks (who are Sunni) are not.|$|R
50|$|Ashure {{is one of}} {{the limited}} set of Turkish desserts which contain no animal products. One reason behind it is arguably protesting all kinds of {{violence}} and bloodshed. <b>Alevites</b> in Turkey are the prominent group to promote this pudding, traditionally cooking and sharing it following the days of fasting (coinciding Battle of Karbala) in which they abstain from eating meat. In the Battle of Karbala, Hussein ibn Ali and his followers were murdered.|$|R
50|$|The {{resistance}} committees (organized {{in factories}} or quarters) {{were put to}} the test during the incidents in Çorum in July 1980. Just like the conflict in Kahramanmaraş in December 1978 the clashes in Çorum seemed to emerge from religious tensions between the dominant Sunnites and the minority of <b>Alevites,</b> {{but at the same time}} were a battle between right and left wing groups for domination in the town. Talking about fascist aggression the committees in the quarters erected barricades trying to avoid further losses.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the roughly}} 4 million Muslims, most are Sunnis and <b>Alevites</b> from Turkey, {{but there are}} a small number of Shi'ites and other denominations. 1.3% of the country's overall {{population}} declare themselves Orthodox Christians, with Serbs, Greeks, and Ukrainians, Russians being the most numerous. Germany has Europe's third-largest Jewish population (after France and the United Kingdom). In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total Jewish population to more than 200,000, compared to 30,000 prior to German reunification. Large cities with significant Jewish populations include Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich. Around 250,000 active Buddhists live in Germany; 50% of them are Asian immigrants.|$|R
50|$|Islam is {{the second}} largest {{religion}} in the country. In the 2011 census 1.9% of Germans (1.52 million people) declared themselves to be Muslims, albeit the number {{was believed to be}} substantially higher. Other estimates suggested a number of 4 million in 2010 and between 3.2 and 3.5 million in earlier years. A study conducted by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees concluded there were about 4.5 million Muslims (5.5% of the population) living in Germany in 2015. The study also found that between 2011 and 2015 the Muslim population rose by 1.2 million people, mostly due to immigration. Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and <b>Alevites</b> from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations.|$|R
500|$|Islam is {{the second}} largest {{religion}} in the country. In the 2011 census, 1.9% of the census population (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is stated as being unreliable because {{a disproportionate number of}} adherents of this religion (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question. Figures from Religionswissenschaftlicher Medien- und Informationsdienst suggest a figure of [...] 4.4 to 4.7 million (around 5.5% of the population) in 2015. A study conducted by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees found that between 2011 and 2015 the Muslim population rose by 1.2 million people, mostly due to immigration. Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and <b>Alevites</b> from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations.|$|R
50|$|Islam is {{the largest}} non-Christian {{religion}} in the country. There are between 2.1 and 4.7 million Muslims. This lack of exactitude {{has to do with}} the fact that about half of the 4.2 million people with origins in the Muslim world are not religious believers, according to a study. The majority of Muslims in Germany are of Turkish origin (63.2%), followed by those from Pakistan, countries of the former Yugoslavia, Arab countries, Iran, and Afghanistan. This figure includes the different denominations of Islam, such as Sunni, Shia, Ahmadiyya, and <b>Alevites.</b> Muslims first came to Germany as part of the diplomatic, military, and economic relations between Germany and the Ottoman Empire in the 18th century. In World War I about 15,000 Muslim prisoners of war were interned in Berlin. The first mosque was established in Berlin in 1915 for these prisoners, though it was closed in 1930. After the West German Government invited foreign workers in 1961, the Muslim population continuously rose.|$|R
