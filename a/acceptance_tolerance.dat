40|$|Background Emotion {{regulation}} (ER) deficits {{have been}} linked to symptoms of anxiety in cross-sectional studies. However, the direction of the relationship between ER and anxiety symptom severity (ASS) is unclear. Methods In order to clarify the relationship between ER skills and ASS symptoms, we assessed skills and symptoms in 131 individuals twice over a 5 -year interval. Cross-lagged panel analyses were conducted to test whether ER skills were a significant predictor of subsequent ASS or vice versa. Additionally, we explored whether specific ER skills differed in regard to the strength of prospective associations with subsequent ASS. Results ER skills negatively predicted subsequent ASS over and above the effects of baseline ASS (whereas anxiety symptoms did not predict subsequent ER deficits). <b>Acceptance,</b> <b>tolerance,</b> and willingness to confront had the strongest prospective effects on lower subsequent ASS.

40|$|The {{well-being}} of the individuals, and the social groups, and not {{the welfare of the}} society as such, is always the ultimate end of morality. The welfare of society as a whole is a means to the welfare of the units. In the early stages of social evolution, egoism is strong and altruism weak. The moral code prohibits acts of aggression and imposes restraints on the individual in the interest of co-operation. Altruism is essential to the development of life and the increase of happiness, and self-sacrifice is no less primordial than self-preservation. The egoistic satisfactions of each individual in a society depend on such altruistic actions as being just, seeing justice done, upholding and improving the agencies for the administration of justice and improving others physically, intellectually, and morally, pure egoism and pure altruism are equally illegitimate. In the words of Auguste Comte Altruism is the opposite of Egoism. This paper discusses Gandhiji's view about Altruistic Education. The present educational system has to be such that every boy and girl is able to know, love and do good and promote a culture of <b>acceptance,</b> <b>tolerance</b> and love for social justice...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{three areas}} believed {{to play a}} central role in the pathogenesis and presenting clinical picture of the eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Measures of personal effectiveness, family dynamics, and traditional sex-role beliefs were assessed in groups of restricted anorexics, bulimic anorexics, normal weight bulimics and controls. Control subjects manifested the highest degree of psychological adjustment, resourcefulness, and self-direction, while restricting anorexics obtained the lowest score on this measure. Bulimics experienced the highest degree of personal effectiveness of the patient groups, with bulimic anorexics falling in-between restricting anorexics and bulimics. Control subjects also reported that they felt more independent, accepted and tolerated in their family than any of the eating disorder groups. Bulimic subjects scored closest to controls on this measure, with bulimic anorexics experiencing the least degree of <b>acceptance,</b> <b>tolerance</b> and independence of all groups. Finally, control subjects defined themselves in a more traditionally masculine role than did any of the eating disorder groups. Restricting anorexics were most likely to describe themselves as passive, submissive, constricted and sensitive; bulimic subjects were more likely to endorse such self-descriptive adjectives as assertive, uninhibited, self-confident and competitive. Bulimic anorexics perceived themselves to be less traditionally feminine than did restricting anorexics, but more than bulimics or controls. The results of this study support the theory that ego deficits contribute to the development of eating disorders...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the world, truth {{commissions}} {{have been}} created {{under the assumption that}} getting people to understand the past will somehow contribute to reconciliation between those who were enemies under the ancien regime. In South Africa, the truth and reconciliation process is explicitly based on the hypothesis that knowledge of the past will lead to <b>acceptance,</b> <b>tolerance,</b> and reconciliation in the future. My purpose here is to test that hypothesis, based on data collected in a 2001 survey of over 3, 700 South Africans. My most important finding is that those who accept the “truth ” about the country’s apartheid past are more likely to hold reconciled racial attitudes. Racial reconciliation also depends to a considerable degree on interracial contact, evidence that adds weight to the “contact hypothesis ” investigated by western social scientists. Ultimately, these findings are hopeful for South Africa’s democratic transition, since racial attitudes seem not to be intransigent. Throughout the world, nations in transition fromauthoritarian to democratic governance are hav-ing to face the issue of political atrocities commit-ted under the ancien regime. A common response to this dilemma is to empanel some sort of “truth commission,” often with the power to grant amnesty to those who come forward and confess their illicit deeds (on the prevalence and nature of truth commissions see Hayner 2000).

40|$|Abstract: Leadership, due to {{its power}} to influence, {{is one of the}} most {{important}} tools available to organisation in order to become competitive, and as such it is one of the recurring themes in social sciences. Today, new leadership strategies have emerged as new drivers of effectiveness in workplace relationships based on the leader–follower relationship. Oneof these leadership strategies is servant leadership, whose motto is ‘put and promote followers’ interests and needs first’, which makes this leadership style strongly linked to exercising high ethics. As agapao love and service to others are important distinctive features of these leaders’ decisions and behaviours, the ethical influence relationship with their collaborators is thought to reach high levels. It is no surprise then thatthis ethical influence relationship makes followers to serve others and inculcates in followers values such as <b>acceptance,</b> <b>tolerance,</b> empathy, love, or forgiveness. More importantly, these leaders might make followers to grow in matureness, intelligence, creativity, and self-management, among other aspects. However, despite findings in recent literature of positive effects of servant leadership on valuable employee outcomes, research is still lacking on the results of this phenomenon on collective organisational variables and its influence in work groups. A case study analysis of a historic and emblematic hotel situated in a small Spanish city declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site provides evidence of the relationship between servant leadership and valuable work-group outcomes such as empowerment climate and group creativity...|$|E
40|$|The {{full text}} of this article will not be {{available}} in ULIR until the embargo expires on the 30 / 9 / 2018 Background: Hand hygiene {{is the cornerstone of}} infection prevention and control practices, and reduces healthcare-associated infections significantly. However, international evidence suggests that medical doctors demonstrate poor compliance. Aim: To explore and compare practices and attitudes towards hand hygiene, particularly hand rubbing using alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR), among hospital-based physicians in Ireland between 2007 and 2015. Methods: In 2007, a random sample of doctors in a large teaching hospital was invited to complete a postal survey using a validated questionnaire. In 2015, the study was replicated among all doctors employed in a university hospital group, including the setting of the original study, using an online survey. Data were analysed using SPSS and Survey Monkey. Findings: Predominately positive and improving attitudes and practices were found, with 86 % of doctors compliant with hand hygiene before patient contact in 2015, compared with 58 % in 2007. Ninety-one percent of doctors were compliant after patient contact in 2015, compared with 76 % in 2007. In 2015, only 39 % of respondents reported that they ‘almost always’ used ABHR for hand hygiene. However, this represents 13. 5 % more than in 2007. Stated barriers to use of ABHR included dermatological issues, poor <b>acceptance,</b> <b>tolerance</b> and poor availability of ABHR products. Conclusion: Greater awareness of hand hygiene guidelines and greater governance appear to have had a positive impact on practice. However, despite this, practice remains suboptimal and there is scope for substantial improvement. Continued and sustained efforts are required in order to build on progress achieved since the World Health Organization hand hygiene guidelines were published in 2009. ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|E
