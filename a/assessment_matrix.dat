It has a form of a table with threats as columns and vulnerabilities as rows. The proposed here terms Threats and Vulnerabilities (not really defined in the origin) come from the field of risk management. The filled table helps the commander to prepare the strategy for handling the situation. Since the table is just virtual, in commander's head only, there is an underlying mnemonic scheme for naming the threats in German language (4A-1C-4E-Rule). For each vulnerability each likely threat is checked, not just the most likely/important one.|$|E

40|$|Two hazard risk <b>assessment</b> <b>matrices</b> for {{the ranking}} of {{occupational}} health risks are described. The qualitative matrix uses qualitative measures of probability and consequence to determine risk assessment codes for hazard-disease combinations. A walk-through survey of an underground metalliferous mine and concentrator {{is used to}} demonstrate how the qualitative matrix {{can be applied to}} determine priorities for the control of occupational health hazards. The semi-quantitative matrix uses attributable risk as a quantitative measure of probability and uses qualitative measures of consequence. A practical application of this matrix is the determination of occupational health priorities using existing epidemiological studies. Calculated attributable risks from epidemiological studies of hazard-disease combinations in mining and minerals processing are used as examples. These historic response data do not reflect the risks associated with current exposures. A method using current exposure data, known exposure-response relationships and the semi-quantitative matrix is proposed for more accurate and current risk rankings...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The United States is {{becoming}} a service oriented nation. As increasing amounts of {{the gross national product}} are spent on services, it becomes vitally important to ensure the productivity of these services. The purpose of this thesis is to identify which elements are needed in a service department productivity measurement tool, what techniques are currently being used, and then to develop a new improved technique. The result Is a Service <b>Assessment</b> <b>Matrix</b> [...] SAM. SAM is a combination of two matrices. The primary matrix is used by a service department to evaluate internal productivity and service quality using a multiple criteria approach. It summarizes data and produces a productivity indicator and a quality indicator. Because all of the key information needed for analysis is on this matrix, it represents the total evaluation system and provides the name [...] SAM. The second matrix is the Quality <b>Assessment</b> <b>Matrix</b> (QAM). As a subset of the Service <b>Assessment</b> <b>Matrix,</b> the QAM's format collects information about clients' perceptions of the quality of service. It is a source document for the primary matrix and is used by the clients. The Service <b>Assessment</b> <b>Matrix</b> uses five methods of evaluation: comparison of criteria analysis, pattern analysis, written analysis, productivity and quality indicator value analysis, and trend analysis. SAM was tested in the service departments of two large corporations: Electro Scientific Industries (ESI) in Portland, Oregon and Evanite Fiber Corporation in Corvallls Oregon. The results were very encouraging. Both service departments were able to identify critical problem areas in their respective departments. But, more important was the development of a communication system which allowed the clients of the services to get involved and to feel comfortable enough to make critical comments about the services being provided. The developmental work has been finished. The technique was tested and found successful. But the Service <b>Assessment</b> <b>Matrix</b> can be refined. Two studies could cause major revisions to the current SAM format. One is a study to determine if SAM is cost effective. The second study is to find a method which would allow the SAMs from several departments to be combined.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the potential {{relationships between the}} ecosystem services provided by the coastal and marine environment and the designation of marine protected areas. The hypothesis is that relationships exist between the provision of ecosystem services and the features protected by marine protected areas.

As the number of marine protected area designations grows, system-wide effects to communities from improvements in delivery of a range of ecosystem services may be realised. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the jurisdictional marine protected area policies proposed by the English, Welsh and Scottish Governments. It presents structured <b>assessment</b> <b>matrices</b> developed from the literature and expert opinion, of ecosystem service provision by marine protected habitats and species and applies the findings to a range of existing UK marine protected areas to demonstrate its relevance.

40|$|AbstractThe {{validity}} of the FSA's result depends mainly on whether its fuzzy arithmetic operator (FAO), <b>assessment</b> <b>matrix</b> (AM) and weight set are reasonable. It is usually not reasonable that the elements of an <b>assessment</b> <b>matrix</b> {{and the weight of}} an influence factor are demanded to be precise values in the current FAS's methods. A fuzzy number (FN) is general either a convex or a concave fuzzy subset of the real line, and is also a useful approach expressing fuzzy data. In this paper, the fuzzy number called positive bounded fuzzy number is used for measuring fuzzy information because it can express fuzzy data well, and the theory of interval number is used to operate fuzzy number. The fuzzy weight of a influence factor adopts a triangular fuzzy number. As a result, a new method of aeroengine reliability prediction is developed, in which the elements of an <b>assessment</b> <b>matrix</b> and the weights of influence factors are fuzzy numbers. Even when the data are more unsufficient for the decision making, the more objective assessment on an object can be still achieved by this method. This is the advantage of the method over other FSA methods. It is the main reasons that FSA's result at different confidence levels can be obtained and the weighting method is improved. The application of this method is illustrated with an example in the paper...|$|E

As a result, committees and {{organizations that are}} responsible for the tourism marketing of countries have embraced branding initiatives in order to attract more visitors.

This study investigates the visual characteristics of tourism logos of 96 countries from all over the world. An <b>assessment</b> <b>matrix</b> was developed to organize them in taxonomic and conceptual categories. The goal of this assessment tool is to provide information about what the most commonly used attributes are in tourism logos, and what types of visual motifs these attributes are used to communicate.

40|$|Across Australian {{and other}} Western universities, {{engineering}} schools routinely offer a capstone {{project at the}} end of their undergraduate degree programs. From a learning perspective, the capstone project represents an opportunity to apply and synthesise new knowledge from previous coursework. One of the key learning outcomes of the project at our university is to impart significant and demonstrable research skills to the students, as consistent with Honours level expectations. However, it was apparent that the project assessment framework in use until 2009 did not allow the explicit development and effective measurement of research skills. Based on positive experiences from a trial on the use of the Research Skill Development (RSD) Framework (Willison and O’Regan 2007) in a Masters coursework component in 2006, our School chose to base the re-design of the Honours project assessment scheme on the RSD in 2010. The key to the new scheme is to explicitly inform candidates about the range of research skills that are needed to perform their research effectively, and provide quality feedback on how these candidates are performing. The scheme informs objective diagnostic and summative assessment of individual candidate’s work and of the work done by teams. This presentation gives an overview of how the RSD was adopted and deployed in the capstone, Honours (final) year electrical & electronic engineering project. Examples of the <b>assessment</b> <b>matrices</b> will be presented, as well as discussions on pedagogical and logistical lessons learnt from the initial deployment of our scheme.
