40|$|A {{prospective}} mortality {{study of}} 839 men {{employed in the}} manufacture of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>products</b> in 1969 examined lung cancer risk in relation to lung fibrosis seen on chest x ray film, controlling for age, smoking, and exposure to asbestos. Twenty or more years after hire, no excess of lung cancer was found among workers without radiographically detectable lung fibrosis, even among long term workers (greater than or equal to 21. 5 years); nor was there a trend in risk by level of cumulative exposure to asbestos among such workers. By contrast, employees with small opacities (greater than or equal to 1 / 0; ILO classification) experienced a significantly raised risk of lung cancer (nine observed deaths v 2. 1 expected), even though their exposures to asbestos were similar to the exposures of long term workers without opacities. In this population, excess risk of lung cancer was restricted to workers with x ray film evidence of asbestosis, a finding consistent with the view that asbestos is a lung carcinogen because of its fibrogenicity...|$|R
40|$|A {{cohort study}} {{has been carried out}} of 2167 {{subjects}} employed between 1941 and 1983 at an <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> factory in England. The production process incorporated the use of chrysotile asbestos fibre only, except for a small amount of amosite during four months in 1976. Measured airborne fibre concentrations available since 1970 from personal samplers showed mean levels below 1 fibre/ml, although higher levels had probably occurred previously in certain areas of the factory. No excess of lung cancer was observed in the mortality follow up by comparison with either national or local death rates, and analyses of subgroups of the workforce by job, exposure level, duration of employment, duration since entry, or calendar years of employment gave no real suggestion of an asbestos related excess for this cause of death. There was one death from pleural mesothelioma and one with asbestosis mentioned as an associated cause on the death certificate, but neither is thought to be linked to asbestos exposure at this factory. Other suggested asbestos related cancers, such as laryngeal and gastrointestinal, did not show raised risks. Although the durations of exposure were short in this study, the findings are consistent with two other studies of workers exposed to low concentrations of chrysotile fibre in the manufacture of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>products</b> which reported no excess mortality...|$|R

40|$|In a {{study of}} the {{mortality}} experience of 6931 employees of two New Orleans <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>products</b> manufacturing plants over 95 % were traced. Chrysotile was the primary fibre used in both plants. Plant 1 also used small amounts of amosite and, later, crocidolite irregularly whereas plant 2 used crocidolite steadily in pipe production. Previously reported exposure concentration estimates were revised, based on additional air sampling data and re-evaluation of these data. Workers in the two plants had similar duration of employment (overall, a mean of 3. 8 years) and estimated exposure concentration (a mean of 7. 6 million particles per cubic foot (mppcf)). Mortality was similar for these plants and comparable with Louisiana rates for all causes combined, nonmalignant causes, and primary cancers of specified sites other than lung. Short term workers from both plants showed raised and similar risk of lung cancer, but risk among longer term workers differed [...] for example, for workers employed over one year there was no excess in plant 1 (16 observed, 17. 2 expected) but a significant excess in plant 2 (52 observed, 28. 9 expected, p less than 0. 001). After excluding short term workers, risk of lung cancer in plant 2 showed a significant trend with estimated cumulative asbestos exposure; using a conversion of 1. 4 fibres/ml = 1 mppcf, the slope of the line was 0. 0076. The slope for plant 1 was 0. 0003. Among all workers (the 6931, plus 167 early employees) ten mesotheliomas had occurred up to 1984 : two from plant 1, eight from plant 2. In plant 2 a case-control analysis found a relation between risk of mesothelioma and duration of employment (p less than 0. 01) and proportion of time spent in the pipe area (p less than 0. 01), thus adding to the evidence of a greater risk of mesothelioma from crocidolite than chrysotile asbestos.

40|$|<b>Asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> {{pipelines}} {{constitute a}} significant portion of the potable and waste water systems in many countries in the world, including Australia. Most of the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes in the developed countries were installed before 1980, and many utilities are observing that the breakage rate is increasing with the ageing of the pipe. Condition assessment for <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes is of important necessity for prioritising rehabilitation and preventing catastrophic pipe failure; however, few techniques are available for direct assessment of the condition of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes and most of them are localised and destructive. This article outlines a pilot field study of the non-invasive and non-destructive condition assessment of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipelines using fluid transient pressure waves. Fluid transient analysis previously conducted by the authors for metallic pipelines is further developed and adapted to <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes for the detection of localised defects. A new sub-sectional condition assessment technique is proposed for determining the effective wall thicknesses of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> sub-sections within a section of pipe bounded by two measurement points. A field trial is conducted in Australia on an <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> water main (which has class changes with varying wall thicknesses) to verify the proposed techniques. The wave speeds, lengths and wall thicknesses of sub-sections in different classes are determined and the results are consistent with the information in the design drawings provided by the water utility. This field study, for the first time, verifies that controlled fluid transient waves can be used as a tool for non-invasive and non-destructive condition assessment of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipelines.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} mortality from {{lung cancer}} {{and the risk}} attributable to asbestos separately for <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers and for the general (non-occupationally exposed) population {{in the town of}} Casale Monferrato, where the largest Italian <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> factory had been in operation in 1907 - 86. According to cancer registry data, in the same town the incidence of malignant mesothelioma in the general population is about 10 times higher than in comparable Italian provinces. METHOD: Decedents from lung cancer in 1989 - 95 were nominally identified in the list of decedents kept at the Local Health Authority of Casale Monferrato. Workers in the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> factory have been identified with a search in the nominal list of workers and the same was done for the wives of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers. These lists have already been used in cohort studies. Sensitivity and specificity of the linkage procedure with occupational activity in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production have been evaluated in a previous study. Population at risk was estimated on the basis of official figures and on the results of the cohort study of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers. RESULTS: 227 deaths from lung cancer were included (184 men and 43 women). Among the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers mortalities were 234. 0 x 100, 000 person-years among men and 35. 5 among women. Corresponding figures in the general (non- occupationally exposed) population in Casale Monferrato were 80. 6 and 18. 7. The rates in the general population were not higher than {{in the rest of the}} region. Attributable risk (AR) among the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers (and wives) is 67. 5 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 56. 8 to 78. 2) for men and 51. 3 % (95 % CI 14. 9 to 87. 8) among women. Population AR to occupational or paraoccupational exposure in the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production is 18. 3 % (95 % CI 11. 1 to 25. 6) among men and 10. 1 % (95 % CI 0 to 24. 6) among women. CONCLUSION: This work did not show an increase in mortality from lung cancer for the population not exposed occupationally, but a large excess was found among men and women occupationally exposed in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production. The total burden of lung cancer due to occupational exposure to asbestos may be underestimated, as only occupational exposure in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production was taken into consideration. Nevertheless even a single factory can be responsible for a considerable proportion of deaths from lung cancer in a population...|$|R

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{asbestos fibre}} type {{used in the}} production of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> is chrysotile. The use of asbestos in relation to fibre type in a Norwegian <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> plant during 1942 - 80 was 91. 7 % chrysotile, 3. 1 % amosite, 4. 1 % crocidolite, and 1. 1 % anthophyllite respectively.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: (i) the mapping of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> roofs in an urban area; and (ii) the {{development}} of a spectral index related to the roof weathering status. Aerial images were collected through the Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) sensor, which acquires data in 102 channels from the visible to the thermal infrared spectral range. An image based supervised classification was performed using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm. The SAM was trained through a set of pixels selected on roofs of different materials. The map showed an average producer’s accuracy (PA) of 86 % and a user’s accuracy (UA) of 89 % for the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> class. A novel spectral index, the “Index of Surface Deterioration” (ISD), was defined based on measurements collected with a portable spectroradiometer on <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> roofs that were characterized by different weathering statuses. The ISD was then calculated on the MIVIS images, allowing the distinction of two weathering classes (i. e., high and low). The <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> map was handled in a Geographic Information System (GIS) in order to supply the municipalities with the cadastral references of each property having an <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> roof.
