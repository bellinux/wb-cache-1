In general the decision to reopen the supply routes was met in Pakistan with a general sense of befuddlement and muted criticism that the Pakistani government had given up a much-trumpeted increase in transit fees for NATO trucks. Opposition politicians criticised the move and demanded more of an explanation from the Pakistani government and military.

2500|$|... Makin's most {{important}} piece of writing, was published in 1673, {{and is in the}} vein of other 17th-century tracts on education.
