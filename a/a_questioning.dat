5|$|Islamic feminists {{advocate}} women's rights, gender equality, {{and social}} justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage <b>a</b> <b>questioning</b> of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, hadith (sayings of Muhammad), and sharia (law) towards {{the creation of a}} more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{rejection}} of traditional forms and structures for poetry {{that began in}} the first half of the 20th century coincided with <b>a</b> <b>questioning</b> of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means. While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.|$|E

25|$|In {{particular}} the investigations of MS Scandinavian Star, MS Estonia and MS Jan Heweliusz during the 1990s caused <b>a</b> <b>questioning</b> {{of the quality}} of marine accident investigations, and the other Nordic countries established marine investigation boards during that decade. Work on reforming the marine system started in 1998 and resulted in a committee recommending the system be scrapped in favor of an accident investigation board. The prime reason was that the Institute of Maritime Enquiry was regarded as having insufficient competence to investigate major accidents. There were also concerns that the system mixed the criminal prosecution and the safety investigation aspects, which could hinder a proper learning to take place from an accident. The system used court interviews with witnesses, with owners, insurance companies and press present. Facing both legal and economic consequences, witnesses would often give testimonies of reduced accuracy, hindering proper investigation from a safety point of view.|$|E

25|$|A highly fictionalized {{version of}} Balian {{is the main}} {{character}} of the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven, played by Orlando Bloom {{as a young man}} with <b>a</b> <b>questioning</b> sensibility regarding religion and social attitudes. In the film, Balian's father, a fictional character named Godfrey the Baron of Ibelin (played by Liam Neeson), returns to Europe to find Balian, his long-lost illegitimate son, who is a blacksmith in France, and encourages him to come to the Holy Land as his heir. Balian is portrayed as having a love affair with Sibylla (this is possibly derived from the Old French Continuation of William of Tyres claims about her and Baldwin). The film depicts Balian as the sole commander of the defence of Jerusalem, and instead of working in close alliance with Patriarch Eraclius, Balian is depicted as his rival. In the film's coda, Balian returns to France (with Sibylla) where he meets Richard I of England, who rides up to Balian and says to him that he is looking for Balian, the defender of Jerusalem, to which Balian replies that he is a blacksmith. After some time passes Balian and Sibylla are seen to be riding up the crossroads his father had used when returning from Jerusalem.|$|E

It is to Berry's credit that a novel so freighted with ideas and ideology manages to project such warmth and luminosity." ...|$|E
2500|$|James Ingram Merrill (March 3, 1926 [...] February 6, 1995) was an American poet. [...] He {{was awarded}} the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (1977) for Divine Comedies (1976). His poetry falls into two {{distinct}} bodies of work: the polished and formalist lyric poetry of his early career, and the epic narrative of occult communication with spirits and angels, titled The Changing Light at Sandover (published in three volumes from 1976 to 1980), which dominated his later career. Although most of his published work was poetry, he also wrote essays, fiction, and plays. He also made a cameo in the 1992 film Lorenzo's Oil in a symposium scene where he played <b>a</b> <b>questioning</b> doctor, due to filmmakers wanting to emphasize the [...] "everyman" [...] storyline.|$|E

2500|$|Torrey {{has been}} a vocal critic of the {{failures}} of deinstitutionalization and inadequate community mental health services. He has generally linked this to issues of violence, homelessness and medication noncompliance, as well as lack of proper focus by the relevant governmental organizations. He {{has been a}}ccused of gaining influence by sensationalizing and exaggerating the incidence of violence and its link to medication noncompliance, including disseminating unsubstantiated and unreliable statistics. When a California NAMI journal editor included <b>a</b> <b>questioning</b> of Torrey's statistics, the local board glued together the pages and effectively shut down the journal. Others, while agreeing that public mental health care in the U.S. falls far short of what people with serious psychiatric disorders need and deserve, have argued that Torrey's solutions are outdated and that his book The Insanity Offense is based on unsubstantiated portrayals of certainty on the statistics on violence, outpatient commitment and medication, stigmatizing tens of thousands of people, deeply offending and insulting those who hold views differing from his own, and promulgating one-dimensional solutions. TAC's attempts to associate violent incidents in the news with lack of medication have been described as wild hyperbole, {{and the use of the}} term [...] "assisted treatment" [...] has been described as a euphemism for forced drugging.|$|E
