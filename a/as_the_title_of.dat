5|$|According to {{the film}} {{historian}} Randor Guy, Pelli Chesi Choodu {{was the first in}} a series of satirical comedies directed by Prasad and produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Guy said the film's box office performance made Prasad famous in both Telugu and Tamil cinema. After Pelli Chesi Choodu, Prasad and Vijaya Vauhini Studios collaborated on Missamma (1955) and Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1959). All three films were profitable ventures and achieved cult status in Telugu cinema. Pelli Chesi Choodu is considered as one of the acclaimed films in the careers of Prasad and Varalakshmi. Relangi Narasimha Rao's 1988 Telugu film, which was also about the negative effects of dowry system in India, was titled Pelli Chesi Choodu. Pelli Chesi Choodu was also used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> a 2014 theatrical play staged by Sri Sai Arts, which won a Nandi Award.|$|E

The title was chosen in honour of Horace Batchelor, who had been referenced in previous Bonzo Dog Band recordings. In the early 1960s, Batchelor became known through his regular advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for his football pools prediction service. When giving his contact address, he would slowly spell out 'Keynsham' letter by letter, and this became an amusing feature for many young listeners.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th birthday cake. No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home. He used this incident <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> his 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards. He had mistaken the room for that of a friend.|$|E

The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. While sources vary as to Susie's skin name (some indicating Napangarti, others Napaltjarri), the similar birth dates, locations, and work history indicate that all are referring to the one individual.|$|E
5|$|The Nawabs of Murshidabad succeeded the Nawab Nizams of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa as Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad, {{following}} Mansoor Ali Khan's abdication Nawabs of Murshidabad {{were the}} successors of the Nawabs of Bengal.

So they lavishly enjoyed their title, privileges alongside with the honours they received.

5|$|Nawabs of Murshidabad succeeded the Nawabs of Bengal as Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad, {{following}} Mansur Ali Khan's abdication They got {{the title}} changed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> the Nawab of Bengal was abolished in 1880. They {{had little or}} no say in the share of the revenue collected and were ceased to use any force. After Indian Independence in 1947 it was declared that the princely states must accede to either India or Pakistan (East/West Pakistan). Murshidabad (the capital city) became a part of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) for two days, as it had a Muslim majority. It became a part of India on 17 August 1947, following which the Pakistani flag was brought down from the Hazarduari Palace and the Indian tricolour was hoisted atop it. After merging with India, they had no power as the Government of India took over all the princely states in India. The house of the Nawabs appeared to have come to end in 1969 with Waris Ali Mirza being the last reigning Nawab and with no clear succession. Although he left three sons and three daughters there was no clear successor to the title after his death because he disinherited one and the others disputed his will.|$|E
