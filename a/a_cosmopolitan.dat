5|$|At {{the height}} of its medieval glory, Dhaka was {{regarded}} as one of the wealthiest and most prosperous cities in the world. It served as the capital of the Bengal province of the Mughal Empire twice (1608–39 and 1660–1704). The city's name was Jahangir Nagar (City of Jahangir) in the 17th century. It was central to the economy of Mughal Bengal, which generated 50% of Mughal GDP. It was <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> commercial center and the hub of the worldwide muslin and silk trade.|$|E
5|$|British {{nationality}} law as it {{pertains to}} Hong Kong has been unusual ever since Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842. From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to its modern role as <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> international financial centre of over seven million people, the territory has attracted refugees, immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life.|$|E
5|$|For centuries {{a fishing}} {{community}} of mostly Norman origin, where ethnic isolationism {{was a common}} practice, Póvoa de Varzim is today <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> town, with people originating from the Ave Valley who settled in the coastal Northern districts during the 20th century, the ancient immigration from Galicia, Portuguese-Africans (who arrived in significant numbers after the independence of Angola and Mozambique) in the late 1970s and people of diverse nationalities, the biggest immigrant communities are Ukrainians, Brazilians, Chinese, Russians, and Angolans.|$|E

5|$|Isopods first {{appeared}} in the fossil record during the Carboniferous period of the Paleozoic some 300 million years ago. They were primitive, short-tailed members of the suborder Phreatoicidea. At that time, Phreatoicideans were marine organisms with <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> distribution. Nowadays, the members of this formerly widespread suborder form relic populations in freshwater environments in South Africa, India and Oceania, the greatest number of species being in Tasmania. Other primitive, short-tailed suborders include Asellota, Microcerberidea, Calabozoidea and the terrestrial Oniscidea.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} {{had a profound impact}} on the structure of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|The black-headed sugar ant (Camponotus nigriceps), {{also known}} as the brown sugar ant, is a species of Formicinae ant endemic to Australia. Found {{throughout}} most states, the species {{is a member of the}} genus Camponotus, <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> genus of ants commonly known as carpenter ants. It was formally described and named by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858. These ants are characterised by their black head, reddish-brown mesosoma and black gaster, which can change in colour.|$|E

5|$|The {{empire of}} the Tang Dynasty (June 18, 618 – June 1, 907), {{successor}} of the Sui Dynasty, was <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> hegemon that ruled one of China's most expansive empires. Raids by the nomadic Khitans and Turks challenged Tang rule, and Tang rulers responded by pursuing strategies of divide and conquer, proxy warfare, tributes, and marriages.|$|E
5|$|As the {{historic}} capital of Imerina, Antananarivo is centrally {{located in the}} homeland of the Merina people, who comprise about 24 {{percent of the population}} and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group. The city's history as the island's major center for politics, culture and trade has ensured <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas. Most Antananarivo residents have strong ties to their tanindrazana (ancestral village), where the extended family and typically a family tomb or burial place is located; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis has <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> distribution, {{concentrated}} in cool-temperate to subtropical regions. It {{is common in}} Europe—from northern Scandinavia, south to the extremities of Greece and Italy—and North America, where its southern range extends {{as far south as}} Mexico. It is well known from the Borgotaro area of Parma, Italy, and has PGI status there. The European distribution extends north to Scandinavia and south to southern Italy and Morocco. In China, the mushroom can be found from the northeastern Heilongjiang Province to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and Tibet. It has been recorded growing under Pinus and Tsuga in Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal, {{as well as in the}} Indian forests of Arunachal Pradesh. In West Asia, the species has been reported from the northwest forests of Iran.|$|E

5|$|Coprinellus micaceus has <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> distribution, and {{has been}} {{collected}} in northern Africa, South Africa, Europe (including Turkey), North America (as far north as Alaska), the Hawaiian islands, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that the Hawaiian species form a distinct clade with little genetic diversity compared to Asian populations; {{this suggests that the}} Hawaiian populations have been introduced relatively recently and have not had much time to develop genetic variation. One study suggests that in South Africa, where C.micaceus is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing C.truncorum, a more common species in that region. A similar inference has been raised about North American species.|$|E
5|$|Crickets have <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> distribution, {{being found}} {{in all parts of}} the world with the {{exception}} of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number than this could have been present because some species are mute.|$|E
5|$|During the post-Civil-War period, {{leaders such}} as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, who headed the Texas Republican Party and {{promoted}} civil rights for freedmen, helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in Galveston and in Texas. Cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs. Galveston was <b>a</b> <b>cosmopolitan</b> city {{and one of the}} more successful during Reconstruction; the Freedmen's Bureau was headquartered here. German families sheltered teachers from the North, and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read. Its business community promoted progress, and immigrants stayed after arriving at this port of entry.|$|E
