A simple experimental <b>acoustic</b> wave <b>propagation</b> facility has been built at the University of Manitoba and initial experiments show conclusively that analytical methods do not predict well the acoustic amplitude and frequency above 100 Hz. The reasons, unknown at this time, must be sought through fundamental simple experiments on the various parameters that affect <b>acoustic</b> wave <b>propagation.</b> Thus, fundamental experiments on parametric effects have commenced at the University of Manitoba with the built facility.

Analytical closed form solutions are obtained for optical wave propagation in uniaxial fibers with field and modal power distributions investigated in detail for the first time. Optical dispersion characteristics in weakly biaxial fibers are studied by a perturbation method with the exact solution for the uniaxial fibers as the perturbation base. The analysis of optical second harmonic generation in LiNbO$ sb 3 $ fibers of practical interest is also carried out by a scalar coupled mode theory where the quasi-phase match grating design for cladded fiber geometry is obtained.
