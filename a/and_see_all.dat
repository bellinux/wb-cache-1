25|$|A {{novelisation}} of this serial, {{written by}} Terrance Dicks, {{was published by}} Target Books in January 1974, entitled Doctor Who and The Auton Invasion. This was the first novelisation commissioned by Target following the successful republishing of three books originally published in the mid-1960s. The Target Books novelisation series would run for {{the next twenty years}} <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> but six Doctor Who serials adapted. In the seventies, this book was translated into Finnish as Tohtori KUKA ja autonien hyökkäys, although Doctor Who never appeared on Finnish television until the broadcast of the 2005 revival series. There were also Dutch, Turkish, Japanese and Portuguese editions.|$|E

You can get it a second time in a way you never could have the first time around." [...] He also compared the film's structure to Citizen Kane (which also contained an interrogator and a subject who is telling a story) and the criminal caper The Anderson Tapes.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Karim biographer Sushila Anand, the Queen's own letters {{testify that}} [...] "her {{discussions with the}} Munshi were wide-ranging—philosophical, {{political}} and practical. [...] Both head and heart were engaged. [...] There {{is no doubt that}} the Queen found in Abdul Karim a connection with a world that was fascinatingly alien, and a confidant who would not feed her the official line." [...] Karim was placed in charge of the other Indian servants and made responsible for their accounts. Victoria praised him in her letters and journal. [...] "I am so very fond of him" [...] she wrote, [...] "He is so good & gentle & understanding all I want & is a real comfort to me." [...] She admired [...] "her personal Indian clerk & Munshi, who is an excellent, clever, truly pous & very refined gentle man, who says, 'God ordered it'... God's Orders is what they implicitly obey! Such faith as theirs & such conscientiousness set us a gt. example." [...] At Balmoral Castle, the Queen's Scottish estate, Karim was allocated the room previously occupied by John Brown, a favourite servant of the Queen's who had died in 1883. Despite the serious and dignified manner that Karim presented to the outside world, the Queen wrote that [...] "he is very friendly and cheerful with the Queen's maids and laughs and even jokes now—and invited them to come <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> his fine things offering them fruit cake to eat".|$|E

2500|$|Entity FX {{also had}} to create the first {{instance}} of Clark’s super hearing, an ability he acquires in the episode [...] "Whisper". As Beck describes the task: [...] "When you talk about someone flying, it’s something we all know, but this is super hearing {{and we need to}} see a visual for the hearing." [...] For the effect of showing Clark using his super hearing, Mat Beck and Entity FX decided that they wanted to travel into Clark’s ear <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> the different parts of his eardrum working together to create the sound he is hearing. The task proved difficult to achieve, and Beck asserts that changes will be made to perfect the look of Clark using his super hearing. Clark’s super hearing was originally to be revealed early in the season, but when The WB informed the Smallville team that Tarzan, the main character in the studio’s update of the classic legend, also had super hearing the team decided to delay the introduction so that the ability could be used in a manner that surpassed what was shown on Tarzan. Luckily for Smallville, The WB’s Tarzan was canceled before [...] "Whisper" [...] aired, allowing Smallville to be the only show on the network with a character who has superhuman hearing.|$|E
