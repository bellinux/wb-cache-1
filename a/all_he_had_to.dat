5|$|At Bound for Glory, Anderson {{failed in}} his attempt to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship when Jeff Hardy, with Hulk Hogan, and Eric Bischoff's assistance, pinned him in a {{three-way}} match (which also included Kurt Angle) to win the title, ending his partnership with Hardy in the process. On the October 21 edition of Impact!, Anderson was given an opportunity to earn a shot at Hardy and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Turning Point; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was survive an Ultimate X match with Fortune member Kazarian. Kazarian managed to win the match, following interference from his stable mates, but Anderson persevered and thus earned himself a World Heavyweight title shot against Hardy, who attacked him after the match. However, during the attack, Anderson suffered a legitimate concussion, which would sideline him for a few weeks and prevented him from taking part in the title match.|$|E
25|$|Allison would mathematically {{clinch the}} {{championship}} if he finished sixth or better, {{regardless of the}} other five drivers' performances. If Allison were to lead a single lap during the race, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was finish 7th or better; if he had led the most laps, he needed only to finish 8th or better. Numerous other championship scenarios generally favored Allison, provided he finished ahead of his competitors, and led a lap during the race. Allison led second-place Alan Kulwicki by 30 points and Bill Elliott by 40.|$|E
25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say about the present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E

25|$|For {{the cost}} of twelve {{aircraft}} (four Ju 87s), he helped attack French communication and supply positions, and supported Reichenau {{as he reached the}} Dyle river. At that time, he had moved into the Netherlands, at a Hotel, near Maastricht. He had a basic room, with a bath that did not work. In the afternoon, he received an order to cease operations in Belgium, and send <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> support Georg-Hans Reinhardt's XLI Corps, north of Sedan. Richthofen was incredulous, and he had to move his entire infrastructure 100 kilometres to the south. The failure of the OKL to inform him he was to support the breakthrough is difficult to explain. He later noted in his diary that it was a major oversight for the OKL not to have informed him of his expected input, but his diary also suggests he relished the fog of war and the unknown. His forces were split, with LG 1 and StG 2 continuing support in Belgium, while most were moved south. During the winding down of operations in the north, his units did help the Sixth Army capture Liege in Belgium on 17 May.|$|E
500|$|In his {{recollections}} {{from that}} period, writer Victor Eftimiu {{suggested that the}} relationship was not entirely harmonious: [...] "Camil Ressu, like other young unknown painters, {{found a lot of}} support and encouragement with Bogdan-Pitești. Truth be told, the maecenate was rather thrifty, it profited from the needs of the debuting and impoverished artist. But without it things would've been much worse, since others did not even offer as much". He also argued that, contrary to speculation about his wealth, Bogdan-Pitești [...] "maybe paid up so little because that is <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> spare". Reputedly, the Ileana boss was losing a fortune on maintaining the Vlaici manor, surrounded as it was by barren land.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the reign}} of King Henry VIII, {{it has been said}} that: [...] "at no time since its establishment, was [...] in higher estimation, nor in fuller employment, than in this reign." [...] Henry VIII was fond of pomp and magnificence, and thus gave the heralds plenty of {{opportunity}} to exercise their roles in his court. In addition, the members of the College were also expected to be regularly despatched to foreign courts on missions, whether to declare war, accompany armies, summon garrisons or deliver messages to foreign potentates and generals. During his magnificent meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, Henry VIII brought with him eighteen officers of arms, probably <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> <b>to</b> regulate the many tournaments and ceremonies held there.|$|E

500|$|Jerome {{otherwise}} had a {{dim view of}} the Arabs. His prejudices {{were those}} of a native Roman. Born in Strido (in modern Croatia or Slovenia), near Aquileia, and educated in Rome, Jerome was a lover of Latin, Italy, and the city of Rome. In about 374, he found himself accused in a dream while in Antioch on the way to Palestine: [...] "Ciceronianus es, non Christianus", [...] "you are a Ciceronian, not a Christian". In one of his letters, written while he was staying in the desert of Chalcis, he tells of the joy he had when he discovered that his correspondents had written a letter to him in Latin. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> hear during the day were the [...] "barbarous" [...] languages of the natives (that is, Syriac and Arabic). From this evidence, Shahîd concludes that Jerome would not honor the memory of an Arab emperor without a strong rationale.|$|E
500|$|During {{the siege}} of Bulawayo, these two men rode many times into the Matopos Hills on patrol, {{and it was in}} these hills that Burnham first {{introduced}} Baden-Powell to the ways and methods of the Native Americans, and taught him [...] "woodcraft" [...] (better known today as Scoutcraft). Baden-Powell had written at length about reconnaissance and tracking, but from Burnham he learned many new dimensions such as how to travel in wild country without either a compass or map, how to discover nearby dangers by observing animals, and the many techniques for finding potable water. So impressed was Baden-Powell by Burnham's Scouting spirit that he closely listened to <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tell. It was also here that Baden-Powell began to wear his signature Stetson campaign hat and neckerchief, like those worn by Burnham, for the first time. Both men recognized that wars were changing markedly and that the British Army needed to adapt. During their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training program in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. In Africa, no scout embodied these traits more than Burnham.|$|E
500|$|A {{murder of}} giant crows attacks the {{vegetable}} car during the drive, forcing Wirt to veer {{off into a}} cornfield and crash into a scarecrow pole, which scares off the crows. Crops then reveals that they have arrived at the [...] "big city," [...] {{which turns out to}} be an old-fashioned small farm community {{in the middle of the}} cornfield. While Wirt and Beatrice try to repair the car, Greg wanders off with Crops and they explore the city's gazebo garden party. Crops then bumps into a woman made of cabbage. Crops apologizes and there's a sudden announcement that the party's scheduled entertainment has been cancelled. Greg tells Crops that he could fill in for the party with his guitar and singing abilities, and the woman finds herself flattered after learning that Crops is a musician. Back at the car, Wirt, who can't figure out how to fix the vehicle as all it is to him is a cluster of vegetables, and Beatrice, who recommends that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was turn the crank on the car's front bumper to start the engine, knock over the scarecrow as they leave with the car working. This summons the giant crows, as well as giant turkeys, who terrorize the city and its vegetable inhabitants. Wirt and Beatrice drive up and pick up Greg, while Crops continues to woo the woman with his music, unaware of the chaos around him, even as a crow attacks one of the members of the band he's performing with and as Wirt tries to get his attention. As Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice attempt to escape without Crops, they are set upon by the giant animals, who start to devour the vegetable car. As Wirt tries to fend them off, Greg suddenly jumps out of the car unnoticed. Suddenly, they hear Greg's screams from the cornfield. The screams continue, until Wirt and Beatrice finally find Greg in the cornfield, unharmed and yelling with joy as he had finally found a goose big enough for them to ride. The city becomes peaceful once more, as Greg's screams had scared the birds off forever, and John Crops goes back to his countryside home with his soulmate, the cabbage woman. Wirt, Gregory, Beatrice, and their new companion Goose, continue to travel onwards, deeper and deeper, into the Unknown.|$|E

2500|$|Composer Zak Bellica {{originally}} {{wanted to}} hire an entire Eastern European orchestra with whom to record the score for the game. However, budget limitations made this impossible, as did the decision to make the music less [...] "soaring" [...] and more [...] "primitive". Ultimately, Bellica hired only one musician, cellist Lori Goldston; {{the rest of the}} score was created using instruments from sample libraries, which were then played back on a digital sampler. Due to the time constraints, Bellica had to compose the score without any access to footage from the game; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go on was the script, and notes from Scott Campbell. Bellica would compose a piece of music for a specific part of the game and then send it to the developers, who would send it back to him with notes on what they wanted him to change.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was only}} one catch and that was Catch-22, which {{specified}} that a concern for one's safety {{in the face of}} dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind.

If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to, but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to.

2500|$|Pytheas sailed northward {{with the}} intent of {{locating}} the Arctic Circle and exploring the [...] "frigid zone" [...] to the north of it at the extreme of the earth.

Strabo's angular report of this line as being at 24° may well be based on a tangent known to Pytheas, but he does not say that.
