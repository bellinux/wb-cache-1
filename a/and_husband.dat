5|$|Before the duel, Hamilton wrote {{a defense}} of his {{decision}} to duel {{while at the same}} time intending to throw away his shot. Hamilton viewed his roles of being a father <b>and</b> <b>husband,</b> putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his moral and religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his morals and political codes, respectively. His desire to be available for future political matters also played a factor.|$|E
5|$|Daydream is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, released on October 3, 1995, by Columbia Records. The follow-up to her internationally successful album Music Box (1993) and holiday album Merry Christmas (1994), Daydream differed from the two by leaning increasingly towards hip hop and urban music. Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote and produced most of her two previous albums. With Daydream, Carey took {{more control over the}} musical direction as well as the album's composition. Carey said she considered Daydream the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation, a change that became more apparent in her sixth album Butterfly (1997). During the album's production, Carey endured many creative differences with her label <b>and</b> <b>husband</b> Tommy Mottola.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{telescope}} was originally completed, Lovell <b>and</b> <b>Husband</b> started contemplating {{the idea of}} upgrading the telescope so {{that it had a}} more accurate surface, and was controlled by a digital computer. Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co., and were presented to Lovell in April 1964. Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in the elevation drive system in September 1967. The telescope was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years, <b>and</b> <b>Husband</b> had been warning about the decay of the telescope since 1963. The appearance of fatigue cracks was the first of these problems that threatened to stop the telescope working; if tey had not been put right, then the elevation system could have failed and perhaps jammed. The telescope was therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA; the £400,000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC. The upgrade was carried out in three phases, phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969, phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971.|$|E

5|$|While in Paraguay, Paranhos had to {{deal with}} another serious issue. Gaston d'Orléans, Count of Eu—grandson of King Louis PhilippeI of France <b>and</b> <b>husband</b> of Emperor PedroII's {{daughter}} and heir Dona Isabel—had succeeded Caxias as Commander-in-Chief of Brazilian forces. After a brilliant beginning which included victories over the remnants of López's army, the Count fell into depression. Paranhos became the unacknowledged, de facto commander-in-chief. López was found and killed on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to an end. On 20 June 1870 the Emperor granted Paranhos the title of Viscount of Rio Branco ("White River", the name of a river that Paraguay claimed as its border with Brazil) with the added Grandeza ("Greatness") distinction. After returning to Brazil, Rio Branco became an ordinary member of the Council of State on 20 October 1870.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{decided to}} return to Normandy in 1148, {{partially}} due to her difficulties with the Church. The Empress had occupied the strategically essential Devizes Castle in 1142, maintaining her court there, but legally it still belonged to Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, and in late 1146 Pope Eugene III intervened to support his claims, threatening Matilda with excommunication if she did not return it. Matilda first played for time, then left for Normandy in early 1148, leaving the castle to Henry, who then procrastinated over its return for many years. Matilda re-established her court in Rouen, where she met with her sons <b>and</b> <b>husband</b> and probably made arrangements for her future life in Normandy, and for Henry's next expedition to England. Matilda chose to live in the priory of Notre Dame du Pré, situated just south of Rouen, where she lived in personal quarters attached to the priory and in a nearby palace built by Henry.|$|E
5|$|The central {{character}} is the Avatar (voiced by Cam Clarke, Yuri Lowenthal, Stephanie Lemelin, Marcella Lentz-Pope or Danielle Judovits), whose name, gender, and appearance can be customized by the player. A {{member of the}} Hoshidan royal family, they were captured by Nohr at a young age. They have the unique ability of transforming into a dragon. The other {{central character}} is Azura (voiced by Rena Strober), {{a member of the}} Nohrian royal family who was kidnapped by Hoshido as part of their efforts to rescue the Avatar. Holding power over water, {{she is one of the}} companions to join the Avatar in whichever story route they choose. The main characters among the Hoshidan royal family include the Avatar's siblings Ryoma (voiced by Matthew Mercer), Takumi (voiced by Roger Rose), Hinoka (voiced by Elizabeth Daily), and Sakura (voiced by Brianna Knickerbocker). Ryoma and Takumi wield the Legendary Weapons of Hoshido, the Raijinto katana and the Fujin Yumi. The main characters from the Nohrian kingdom include the Avatar's guardian, Gunter (voiced by D. C. Douglas), and their adoptive siblings Xander (voiced by David Stanbra), Camilla (voiced by Paula Tiso), Leo (voiced by Max Mittelman), and Elise (voiced by Natalie Lander). Xander and Leo respectively wield the Legendary Weapons of Nohr: the sword Siegfried and the tome Brynhildr.

40|$|Gender {{differences}} in health {{have been linked}} to gender stratification in the United States. Women's relation to production, paid and unpaid work, and their experience of this gender inequality disadvantage their self-rated health compared to men. Men's consumption or health lifestyles disfavors their comparative health. This formulation is tested in the Czech Republic with a sample of matched wives <b>and</b> <b>husbands</b> (N = 577 households). This extends previous research in the United States on gender {{differences in}} health in two ways: into post-communist Europe and by comparing paired wives <b>and</b> <b>husbands.</b> Respondents completed questionnaires in 1994 on their health and well-being, jobs and finances, non-economic life events, marriage, psychological states, opinions about the changes in the Czech Republic, and socioeconomic background. Wives <b>and</b> <b>husbands</b> filled out separate questionnaires. The relation to production (both the objective relation and its subjective experience) did not impair wives' self-reported health any more than that of their <b>husbands,</b> <b>and</b> husbands' consumption or health lifestyles did not put them at a health disadvantage. Interpretations of these findings rest on both the extension of the study into post-communist Europe and by comparing matched wives <b>and</b> <b>husbands.</b> gender differences in health Czech Republic male and female health...|$|R
