5|$|Both {{independent}} and major record labels {{bid for the}} right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he {{wanted to be able to}} put the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100,000 records. Wilco decided to sign with <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> affiliate.|$|E
5|$|Not listed {{is perhaps}} the most notable 'acquisition', the 2001 merger with Time Warner to become <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner.</b> Due to the larger market {{capitalization}} of AOL, it gained ascendancy in the merger, with its executives largely displacing Time Warner's despite AOL's far smaller assets and revenues.

One of those jobs was Reprise Records president Howie Klein, who had been a big supporter of Wilco on the label. Klein's dismissal placed head A representative David Kahne in charge of the decision whether to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.|$|E

MACW, also known as Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), was purchased by Turner Broadcasting System in 1988, and subsequently renamed WCW. In March 2001, certain assets of WCW were sold by <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). As such these assets, including {{the rights to the}} WCW World Television Championship, inactive since April 10, 2000, were now WWF property. Before it was known as the WCW World Television Championship (starting in 1991 and continuing until the title's deactivation), it was known as the NWA Mid-Atlantic Television Championship (1974 to 1977), the NWA Television Championship (1977 to 1985), and the NWA World Television Championship (1985 to 1991).|$|E

Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> shareholders owned only 45%, so in actual practice <b>AOL</b> had acquired <b>Time</b> <b>Warner,</b> even though <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> had far more assets and revenues. <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> had been {{looking for a way to}} embrace the digital revolution, while AOL wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets.|$|R

WCW's properties were purchased for a mere $3,000,000. Most of the main event-level stars including Flair, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, and Sting were contracted directly to parent company <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> instead of WCW, and thus <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> was forced to continue to pay many of the wrestlers for years.

A sale nearly occurred in late 2000 to Bischoff {{and a group of}} private investors calling themselves Fusient Media Ventures, with news reports and even Eric Bischoff declaring a deal was in place. However, Fusient backed out when Turner networks head Jamie Kellner formally cancelled all WCW programming from its television networks. With no network on which to air its programming, WCW was of little value to Fusient, whose offer depended on being able to continue to air WCW programming on the Turner networks, despite the fact that WCW, according to Bischoff in his book, had received offers from FOX and NBC.|$|E

The album was released on April 23, 2002 to significant critical acclaim, including being named the best album of the year by The Village Voice.

50|$|As 2000 {{came to a}} close, {{a number}} of {{potential}} buyers for WCW were rumored to show interest in the company. Ted Turner, however, still had a position of influence at <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> prior to the final merger of <b>AOL</b> and <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> in 2001, and most offers were rejected. Eric Bischoff, working with Fusient Media Ventures, made a bid to acquire the company in January 2001 (shortly following the AOL/Time Warner merger), and it appeared that WCW would continue.|$|R
25|$|By {{the fall}} of 1999, the Attitude Era had turned the tide of the Monday Night Wars into WWF's favor. After Time Warner merged with AOL, Ted Turner's control over WCW was {{considerably}} reduced, and the newly merged company announced a complete {{lack of interest in}} professional wrestling as a whole, and decided to sell WCW in its entirety. Although Eric Bischoff, whom Time Warner fired as WCW president in October 1999, was nearing a deal to purchase the company, in March 2001 McMahon acquired the rights to WCW's trademarks, tape library, contracts, and other properties from <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> for a number reported to be around $7 million. Shortly after WrestleMania X-Seven, the WWF launched the Invasion storyline integrating the incoming talent roster from WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). With this purchase, WWF now became by far the largest wrestling promotion in the world. The assets of ECW, which had folded after filing for bankruptcy protection in April 2001, were purchased by WWE in mid-2003.|$|E

On July 1, 2001, Bagwell faced Booker T at a house show and he made his WWF televised debut on the July 2 episode of Raw is War, facing Booker T for the WCW Championship. The match went to a no-contest after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kurt Angle. When Bagwell arrived to the Raw tapings on July 9 in Atlanta, Georgia, he was informed he was being released from his contract due to complaints about his attitude and an altercation with fellow WCW alumnus Shane Helms. There were also accusations that Bagwell faked an injury at the July 3 SmackDown! tapings after receiving an aided powerbomb from the Acolytes Protection Agency. The accusations also claimed his mother Judy was calling WWF offices to request that her son get time off to heal from an injury supposedly inflicted to Bagwell from the aided powerbomb and to complain about her son's travel arrangements. However, Bagwell himself claims that he never understood why he was fired from the WWF.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{expiration}} of his <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> contract, Nash, along with Scott Hall and Hulk Hogan, were rehired by the WWF. Their rehiring was announced {{several weeks before}} their debut, with Vince McMahon claiming to have hired the nWo in order to destroy the WWF – of which Ric Flair was now a co-owner, which McMahon could not tolerate. Billed as the original nWo, Nash, Hall, and Hogan returned to the WWF at No Way Out on February 17, 2002. In {{the course of the}} evening, the nWo delivered an interview in which they claimed to have reformed, gave a six pack of beer to Stone Cold Steve Austin (which he refused), and traded insults with The Rock. They interfered in the main event of the evening, helping Chris Jericho retain his Undisputed WWF Championship against Austin. At WrestleMania X8, Nash continually interfered in the match between Hall and Austin {{to the point where he}} was forced to return backstage. Later that night, he and Hall turned on Hogan after he had offered congratulations to The Rock for defeating him. In March, Nash suffered a biceps injury that put him out of action for several weeks and almost immediately upon returning, suffered a quadriceps tear in a tag match on the July 8 episode of Raw. On the July 15 episode of Raw, the nWo was officially disbanded by Vince McMahon as Eric Bischoff became Raw General Manager.|$|E

25|$|While citing poor {{advertising}} {{sales and}} a rough climate for selling magazine subscriptions, Time Inc. executives said a key reason for closing the title in 2000 was to divert {{resources to the}} company's other magazine launches that year, such as Real Simple.

25|$|Following the {{expiration}} {{of his contract}} with WCW's parent company, <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner,</b> in March 2002, Borden held talks with the WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion and instead toured internationally with World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) – winning the WWA World Heavyweight Championship – before joining the then-upstart TNA in 2003. Over the following 11 years, he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on one further occasion and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship four times, {{as well as being}} the inaugural inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2012. He is the only man to hold the NWA, WCW (WWA and WCW international additionally) and TNA world championships in a career. Previously described by WWE as the greatest wrestler never to have performed for that promotion, Sting finally joined the company in 2014, making his first appearance at Survivor Series and having his debut match at WrestleMania 31 the following year. His last ever bout at Night of Champions in September 2015, marked his sole WWE pay-per-view main event and WWE World Heavyweight Championship contest for the organization. Sting headlined the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2016 on April 2, where he announced his retirement. His induction renders him the first performer to be inducted into both the WWE and TNA Hall of Fame, as well as the second man to be inducted while an active WWE wrestler after Ric Flair.|$|E

Gerald Levin, who had served as CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Chairman, J. Michael Kelly (from AOL) was the Chief Financial Officer, Robert W.

2500|$|Some of the WCW wrestlers' {{absences}} {{were out}} of the WWF's control. Many of WCW's top wrestlers had contracts with <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner,</b> WCW's parent company, and were willing to sit at home rather than wrestle for less money; Booker T, the reigning WCW Champion at the time of WWF's purchase, was a notable exception, agreeing to a buyout of the remainder of his contract with <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> in order to wrestle for the WWF immediately. McMahon had the option of taking on any contract he wanted with his purchase, but chose to let <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> continue to pay out what were considered bad deals. Ric Flair and Rey Mysterio were not signed {{until the end of the}} Invasion because they were tied to their contracts, and therefore their absence was out of the WWF's control. In addition, Scott Steiner was recovering from an injury. Others, such as Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Goldberg, were not signed until well after the storyline finished. As for WCW's other top superstars, Sting was still under contract to <b>AOL</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Warner,</b> and did not join the now-WWE until late 2014, while Lex Luger and Randy Savage would never reappear in the company on TV (in May 2011, Luger rejoined WWE in a backstage role related to the company's Wellness Program, while Savage died of a sudden heart attack later the same month). Fans were confused by McMahon's decisions seeing as the WWF would make more than enough to cover all these wrestlers contracts in 2001. Because of this, the WWF's opponent allegedly lacked the strong identity of WCW. In correlation with WCW, ECW was also missing most of their key superstars such as The Sandman, Sabu, Balls Mahoney, Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke (all of whom would later join WWE's relaunched ECW). Other wrestlers such as Shane Douglas, Masato Tanaka, Terry Funk, New Jack, 2 Cold Scorpio and Mikey Whipwreck would also be missing from the storyline. The WWF itself would be missing some of its biggest stars, most notably Triple H, who tore his left quadriceps muscle just before the start of the storyline and wouldn't return until the 2002 Royal Rumble, well after the Invasion angle ended. Shawn Michaels, who was under a four-year retirement at the time, was on hiatus from WWF and also didn't appear during the Invasion storyline and Rikishi was inactive throughout the entire storyline with an injured shoulder. Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit who were former [...] WCW/ECW stars, working for WWF at the time, were also absent from the storyline. Benoit was hinted to defect to WCW before his injury in June 2001.|$|E

The organizations that have committed some portion of their resources to this issue represent government, private industry, and philanthropic organizations.

The company was founded in 1950 as a cooperation between Telefunken and Decca Records. The name Teldec {{is the result of}} taking the first three letters of both labels: Telefunken and Decca. Records manufactured by Teldec mostly were released under the Telefunken or Decca label, but normally these records contained no hint that they were made by Teldec. In 1983 Telefunken and Decca pulled out of Teldec and in 1987 Teldec was sold to <b>Time</b> <b>Warner.</b> In 1997 the remaining compact-disc production facility in Nortorf was to be closed by <b>Time</b> <b>Warner,</b> but a management buyout was done and the new founded company OK Media is continuing CD production.
