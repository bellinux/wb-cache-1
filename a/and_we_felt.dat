5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|We {{knew that}} we had created a new means of warfare, and the {{question}} as to what nation, to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else. We wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> that only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided by the Bible could such an assurance to the world be best secured.|$|E
25|$|After {{having worked}} {{with members of}} 27 as guest musicians on {{previous}} full-length Oceanic, for Panopticon Isis turned to Justin Chancellor, bassist of tour-mates Tool. According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> like he was a person that understood what we were doing and could maintain a focus on what we were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E

60|$|We {{knew well}} enough that old John {{was not at}} all likely to do {{anything}} that would cut off the nice little revenue he was making out of our camp, <b>and</b> so <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> no concern on that score.|$|R
500|$|On {{the series}} having an episode {{revolving}} around a single character, Whedon said, [...] "We {{have a lot}} of people on the show <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> like this year was the year to start branching off into things like this. So, we just committed wholeheartedly". In casting Casey as Daniels, the producers wanted someone who was older than Henstridge, physically unlike De Caestecker, and [...] "doesn’t look like [...] type", to make it less clear that they would end up together.|$|E
500|$|Despite their lasting {{influence}} on modern music, the band {{has attempted to}} disassociate themselves {{with many of the}} bands they inspired. Following the band's reformation, guitarist Jim Suptic undertook an interview with website Drowned in Sound, in which he said, [...] "The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like glam rock now. We played the Bamboozle fests this year <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> really out of place... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologise." [...] He went on to say they were grateful for the acknowledgements they have received, though explaining [...] "the problem is most of [...] aren't very good." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} and journalists {{have argued that}} the {{decision}} stemmed from Disney and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' belief that Adams, predominantly a film actress, would ultimately not be able to perform [...] "That's How You Know" [...] as adequately as the more experienced Chenoweth. Additionally, critics noted that while Chenoweth's Academy Award performance was staged and choreographed as a large, extravagant number featuring [...] "dozens of colorfully costumed dancers", Adams performed by herself on a mostly barren stage highlighted by a [...] "single spotlight". Vulture.com commented about the performance, [...] "Adams didn't do terribly, but she's no Broadway star, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> kind of awful for her." [...] During an interview, Adams told the New York Post that she was not upset by the Academy's decision, instead feeling that [...] "That's How You Know" [...] was the [...] "perfect" [...] for Chenoweth to perform.|$|E
5000|$|... "had {{decided to}} take a break, but {{it soon became clear that}} our ambitions were too {{different}} and it didn't feel as exciting as before. The chemistry <b>and</b> excitement <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> before on stage and in the studio was suddenly gone." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It wasn't on {{the album}} as it didn't really fit <b>and</b> <b>we</b> never <b>felt</b> the {{production}} {{was as good as}} it could have been - again I personally preferred the demo." ...|$|R
60|$|Nobody {{could answer}} this question, and, not liking the warlike {{appearance}} of the old gentleman <b>and</b> his sword, <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> a little anxious.|$|R
500|$|In February 2011, {{the game}} was refused {{classification}} by the Australian Classification Board due to [...] "violence that exceeds strong in impact". Warner Bros. unsuccessfully appealed the decision to the Classification Review Board, who ruled [...] "the impact of the violence in Mortal Kombat is higher than strong and thus could not be accommodated within the MA15+ classification." [...] The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service listed the game as a prohibited item and the Australian Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor asked to be briefed on the Mortal Kombat decision, citing [...] "public disquiet on the issue". In 2012, the Vita version of Mortal Kombat was banned in Australia as well. A spokesperson for Warner Bros. commented: [...] "We felt {{that because of the}} Vita's size, the smaller screen would minimise the impact of the violence in the game <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> it might fit within the MA15+ category. Obviously, the Classification Board of Australia did not agree." [...] In 2013, however, following the introduction of an R18+ classification, Mortal Kombat was released uncensored on May 1, 2013, with the R18+ rating.|$|E
500|$|The {{content of}} Illmatic is also {{informed}} by notions of artistic authenticity. The promotional press sheet {{that accompanied the}} album's release implied Nas’s refusal to conform to commercial trends, stating: “While it's sad that there's so much frontin' in the rap world today, this should only make us sit up and pay attention when a rapper comes along who's not about milking the latest trend and running off with the loot.” At {{the time of the}} album's release, the hip hop community was embroiled in a debate about artistic authenticity and commercialism in popular music. Rapper Common, describes in the preface to Born to Use Mics: Reading Nas's Illmatic the concerns that were felt by him and his contemporaries: “It was that serious for so many of us. We didn’t just grow up with hip hop; we grew up with hip-hop as hip-hop was also growing, and so that made for a very close and intimate relationship that was becoming more and more urgent – <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> it. Our art was being challenged in many ways as the moneymen began to sink their teeth into us.” ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E
60|$|Now, {{this was}} {{something}} like sport, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> all <b>felt</b> encouraged, <b>and</b> went to work again with a will, only Menendez untied the line from Rectus's waist and fastened it to his button-hole.|$|R
40|$|I {{received}} a NY Ag + Markets FAID grant in 2006.   A {{number of people}} that would be involved in the project got together <b>and</b> <b>we</b> discussed the best way to accomplish the goal of promoting NY potatoes.   First, <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> needed to gather more culinary information on an expanded list of potato varieties grown in NY.   <b>And</b> second, <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> needed local involvement with chefs throughout NY.   We wanted chefs throughout NY to speak for us, the potato industry...|$|R

500|$|Director Radha Mohan {{expressed}} a desire to remake the film but decided against it: [...] "If there is one film I want to remake, [...] will be the one, but I know I will not, because I believe classics should be left alone." [...] Director and choreographer Prabhu Deva ranked Server Sundaram among his favourite films. A restaurant named [...] "Hotel Server Sundaram" [...] is located in the Thuraipakkam area of Chennai. In December 2014, G. Babu Jayakumar of The New Indian Express included the film in his list of Balachander's noted films. Clips from Server Sundaram were screened along with clips from other films such as Iru Kodugal (1969), Arangetram (1973), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Avargal (1977) and Azhagan (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death. Server Sundaram is also used as the title of an 2017 film starring Santhanam and Nagesh's grandson Bijesh, with its producer Selva having bought the title rights from AVM Productions. On why that title was chosen, Selva said, [...] "Santhanam plays a chef in the film <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> that Server Sundaram, in which Nagesh played the role of a server, would be apt for this film, too. It is amazing how well the title suited the concept of our film, which is why we went right ahead with our decision." [...] S. Jegathiswaran, writing for Daily News Sri Lanka, noted, [...] "In [...] Sundaram, [...] showed that after having gained the social status one shouldn't forget one's past." [...] Actor Vikram, who became popularly known by the moniker [...] "Chiyaan" [...] after the release of Sethu in 1999, stated in August 2016, [...] "After Nagesh sir [...] becomes something else, he still holds his server uniform close to his heart as a memento. Chiyaan is something like that to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with the ProGGnosis—Progressive Rock & Fusion website, Godley explained: [...] "We left because we no longer liked what Gouldman and Stewart were writing. We left because 10cc was becoming safe and predictable <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> trapped." ...|$|E

60|$|It was a gentle, harmless, old ghost, too, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> all <b>felt</b> {{very sorry}} for it, and pitied it. The women folk, indeed, made quite a pet of it, for a while. Its {{faithfulness}} touched them so.|$|R

5000|$|Cohn {{said that}} one of the reasons she did The Facts of Life Reunion in 2001 was that the actors in the long-running series have been wrongly denied a cut of the {{syndication}} and DVD profits from the series.

2500|$|Lostprophets {{cancelled}} {{their show}} at Reading and Leeds Festival in 2003 {{to continue their}} work on the album. Lead singer Ian Watkins said they did it because [...] "We {{want to make the}} best record possible {{and did not want to}} rush anything" [...] and continued with [...] "unfortunately these shows are at the final stages of making the record <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> it was more important." [...] The Scottish rock band Biffy Clyro replaced Lostprophets at the festival.|$|E
2500|$|Osegueda {{left the}} group and moved to New York to pursue a life outside of music, and Cavestany later {{explained}} that [...] "e weren't {{going to try to}} replace him and with all that stuff happening we were just totally disgusted at how things had turned out <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> that this was a sign that the band was not going to go on." [...] The remaining members performed a few acoustic-only shows in the Bay Area, appearing as [...] "The Past." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 8, 2008 the New York Times {{reported}} that North Korea had missed a deadline to submit {{an inventory of}} its nuclear arms programs and that Hill said that failure to meet a deadline should be confronted with patience and perseverance.

2500|$|A {{major theme}} {{throughout}} much of Bishop's work (and especially so in his short fiction) {{is the role of}} religion in the daily lives of human beings.
