You'll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.' And it was bad, very bad. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> what I was told. After watching the first two minutes I had {{to turn it off}} and hide under the covers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004 Europe went on a festival tour through the European continent. The concert setlists {{included}} the old hits, but also introduced the title track from Start from the Dark. The album was released on 22 September 2004, {{the same day that}} John Norum became a father. Start from the Dark featured a more modern sound compared to Europe's previous albums. [...] "We wanted to be doing something <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a little bit relevant now; bit of a dry mix, detuned a bit," [...] Tempest said, [...] "So we felt like we didn't want to do an 1980s album per se, we just wanted to start like a fresh band really." [...] Eventually, the album sold in excess of 600,000 copies worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Yet {{it would}} be a mistake to {{conclude}} that Ivar was nothing but a crook. Reality was more nuanced. For one thing disclosure rules in his days were much less stringent. Many corporations refused to reveal details for fear competitors would gain an advantage. (<b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the claim often made.) [...] Some firms did not even publish quarterly results. Ivar, too, was very secretive and not only with investors. When he was on the verge of hiring somebody he usually asked: [...] "Can he keep a secret?" [...] He was also very fond of quoting his motto for success: [...] "Silence, more silence, and still more silence." [...] Also one cannot fault him for the speculative fever in the 1920s. Without the hunger for ever larger profits many of Ivar's schemes would not have been possible. Incidentally this facilitated a transfer of capital from the USA to Europe where it was, often desperately, needed. He sold shares in the USA worth 250 million dollars (equivalent to c. 3.75 billion today) and transferred almost all of it to his holding company in Liechtenstein, Continental Investment Corporation. Shareholders of International Match had given him authority to do this so there was nothing wrong with it. There was also a tax advantage because of the advantageous deal he had negotiated with Liechtenstein. But Ivar did it above all to have the flexibility to manipulate balance sheets and financial statements so they would look more attractive to investors as well as helping him – to some extent - pay the high dividends of Swedish Match and Kreuger & Toll. He got the nickname [...] "Saviour of Europe" [...] by lending about $400 million (equivalent to c. $6 billion today) to rebuild their shattered economies after World War I. He invented new financial instruments to help him raise funds and, of course, make him money. Indeed, many consider Ivar to be the father of modern financial schemes. Oscar Rydbeck, his Swedish banker, said Ivar was the third richest man in the world. He, however, claimed [...] "money as such means nothing to me". Ivar was also a successful speculator for much of his life making lots of money until shortly before the end. Trying to support the collapsing share prices of many of his companies (including ways which were—if not illegal—questionable, e.g. using straw men for share transactions. In the case of his acquisition of Diamond Match shares it was clearly illegal because of anti-trust laws.) ...|$|E
