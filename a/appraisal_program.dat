40|$|The {{creative}} project (4 hrs) {{which will}} be undertaken by the student is entitled Performance Appraisal Interview Skills: A Communicative Perspective. This study examines {{the problem of the}} professional practice of performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>programs</b> that have been typified as relatively ineffective. A lack of effective communication skills {{on the part of the}} appraiser/interviewer contributes to the dissatisfaction arising from the performance appraisal process. While improvement of rapport establishment and listening skills is believed to be a means for increasing effectiveness in such a program, it cannot expect to bring about total effectiveness. The value and significance of this project is that there exists a need for improving communication skills within the context of a performance appraisal interview. A large majority of American organizations conduct performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>programs.</b> By enhancing managerial rapport establishing and listening skills, this project attempts to increase the effectiveness of performance appraisal interviews. This project contributes to the field of research concerning communication skills in interviewing as well as the field of human resource management. The method {{which will be}} used to conduct this creative project is two fold.

The purpose was to see the correspondence between Bank project appraisal methods, assumptions, and criteria and the iterative/participatory development model. The findings suggest that despite the Bank's awareness of the inherent value of the iterative/participatory development model and expressed interest in changing the direction of the Bank's development practices towards it, the project approach with appraisal emphasis on monetary and quantitative measures of development continue to dominate. The findings also imply the importance of broadening the Bank's professional mix if significant movement towards an iterative/participatory strategy is to be realized.

The second {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between performance appraisal reform, job satisfaction, and employee engagement. A large polyester and textile corporation had 2046 non-operational employees in February 2014. The valid participants were 1474 (72. 04 %) in this study. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, one-way MANOVA, Pearson correlation, Content Validity Index, the exploratory factor analysis, and reliability analysis. The general results showed that employees who received the new performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>program</b> evaluated the program more positively and showed more job satisfaction than those who did not. In particular, the implementation effects of this new performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>program</b> were most highly rated by employees who used the KPI to rate their job performance.

40|$|During the {{preclinical}} {{phase of}} medical school, most students rely on instructor-provided lecture notes and required textbooks, and note taking during lectures. By the time medical students begin their clinical clerkships, they {{are accustomed to}} accepting the word of authority at face value. Paradoxically, physicians {{must be able to}} critically evaluate and solve patient problems from a rapidly expanding body of biomedical literature. To address this discrepancy and to help show the relevance of histology to medicine, we implemented a program to introduce critical reading of biomedical literature throughout our 21 -week histology course. During weeks one through four, students in the class of 2003 (N = 224) were randomly divided into 56 groups (n = 4) and taught how to conduct a MEDLINE search. Groups were required to submit a biomedical publication abstract from their MEDLINE search that contained histological and clinical elements by week eight. Subsequently, students attended two 60 -minute critical appraisal seminars. By week 15, groups submitted a one-page summary of their selected journal publication and answered a set of critical appraisal questions. During weeks 16 - 19, students prepared a four-minute oral presentation. Three years later, these students were asked to assess the value of our critical <b>appraisal</b> <b>program.</b> Most respondents agreed and strongly agreed (96. 1 %) that the time needed to complete Critical <b>Appraisal</b> <b>program</b> was manageable.

40|$|Objective Contracting Q fever during {{pregnancy}} carries {{a risk of}} developing obstetric complications. The {{aim of this study}} was to gain insight into pregnant women's decisions regarding participation in a future Q fever screening and treatment program. Methods Pregnant women (N = 148) in Q fever high-risk areas in The Netherlands were recruited via midwives' practices and via an online panel for a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The outcome measures included intention to participate in the program, Q fever exposure risk, perceived Q fever risk, trust in health professionals and authorities, disease-related knowledge and additional outcome measures. Results Fifty-six percent of the respondents intended to participate in the screening and treatment program. The sole determinant of a higher intended program uptake was a more positive <b>appraisal</b> of <b>program</b> efficacy and convenience. This appraisal was in turn associated with perceived risk and knowledge. Conclusion Women's <b>appraisal</b> of <b>program</b> efficacy and convenience, their disease-related knowledge and perceived Q fever risk seem to be crucial for their intended program uptake. A successful implementation of a Q fever screening and treatment program may thus depend on the benefits and downsides of the program, and on securing that women are aware of the risks of the disease.

40|$|Appraisal {{programs}} {{undertaken by}} {{exploration and production}} (E&P) companies are designed to resolve subsurface uncertainties that contribute to uncertainty in the economic potential of undeveloped fields. Value-of-information (VOI) assessments allow E&P players to quantify the economic value of their proposed appraisal programs before carrying them out. This study proposes a VOI methodology that is tuned {{to the nature of}} the subsurface uncertainties in unconventional plays and is capable of assessing a wide range of appraisal strategies (defined as the number and configuration of wells). It addresses two main problems. The first is how to characterize the uncertainty (in a play) that an <b>appraisal</b> <b>program</b> is intended to reduce or resolve. The second is how to cast that characterization of the uncertainty in a VOI context so that the merits of various appraisal programs can be evaluated. This paper characterizes the subsurface uncertainty that arises because of inadequate sampling of natural geologic variability. In this work, three quantities are assumed to be uncertain: the mean and standard deviation (SD) (variability) of the expected ultimate recovery (EUR) of the population of wells to be drilled, should development go ahead, and the range of the variogram that describes the spatial correlation of EUR as a function of the distance between wells. The optimal <b>appraisal</b> <b>program</b> would presumably depend on the true values of these quantities. The methodology is illustrated by application to a typical unconventional play. The VOI of an <b>appraisal</b> <b>program</b> can be optimized in terms of the number of the appraisal wells to be drilled and the placement of those wells. This VOI increases as the placement of the set of wells is changed from being clustered in the central part of the appraised area to approaching uniform distribution across the area. To obtain the optimal well placement, the incremental learning from changing the well locations should be balanced against the incremental costs that are required to increase the spacing of the appraisal wells. The study results demonstrate how the VOI of each incremental appraisal well decreases with the number of appraisal wells and how an optimal number of appraisal wells can be determined. Bart J. A. Willigers, Steve Begg, and Reidar Bratvol...|$|E
