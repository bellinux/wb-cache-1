5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, <b>all</b> <b>well</b> and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E

The film was shot with a HK$4million (RM1.86mil) budget. On 12 May 2008, a press conference was held in a Tsuen Wan shopping mall, where Wong had announced that a HK$4 million investment would be put into making the 2009 version of <b>All's</b> <b>Well,</b> Ends Well. When asked if Stephen Chow or Maggie Cheung would appear in the new film, Wong described that the casting of the two actors would be difficult and was grateful that Sandra Ng would be joining the cast. [...] While developing the film, Wong had immediately thought of working with Sandra Ng, since they had not appeared together after the first film, <b>All's</b> <b>Well,</b> Ends Well.

25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Powell joined his regiment as a Second Lieutenant {{at the age of}} 34, more than ten years older than most of his fellow subalterns, not at <b>all</b> <b>well</b> prepared and lacking in experience.

He eventually secured an assignment with the Intelligence Corps and additional training. His military career continued with assignment to the War Office in Whitehall, where he was attached to the section known as Military Intelligence (Liaison), and later—for a short time—to the Cabinet Office to serve on the Secretariat of the Joint Intelligence Committee, securing promotions along the way.|$|E
25|$|After {{many years}} of {{involvement}} in literary, cultural and political clubs, Griffith and the other board members were <b>all</b> <b>well</b> known in Dublin's nationalist circles. They were also influential personalities {{in their own right}} in their respective social and professional fields. Griffith was not only a pillar of the Irish-Ireland movement but also, thanks, to his father's leadership role in the printing trade and his own very substantial experience in the newspaper industry, a respected figure in Dublin's printing and typographical community. Both Thomas Kelly and the fruit trader Walter Cole were popular Dublin Corporation aldermen; John O'Mahony was a hotel proprietor; Henry Dixon was a lawyer and influential IRB veteran; and Seumas McManus, the nationalist novelist, already had a flourishing reputation {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. From April 1906 onwards, this group actively sought a return on this social investment from their friends, family, neighbours, colleagues, and former classmates.|$|E
25|$|These passes {{include the}} Soledad Pass, the Cajon Pass, and the San Gorgonio Pass, <b>all</b> <b>well</b> known for exaggerating Santa Anas {{as they are}} funneled through. As the wind narrows and is {{compressed}} into the passes its velocity increases dramatically, often to near-gale force or above. At the same time, as the air descends from higher elevation to lower, it is heated adiabatically, warming about 5°F for each 1,000feet it descends (10°C for each 1,000m). As it warms, its capacity to hold moisture increases, so its relative humidity decreases. The air has already been dried by orographic lift before reaching the Great Basin, {{as well as by}} subsidence from the upper atmosphere, so this additional warming often causes relative humidity to fall below 10 percent. The end result is a strong, warm, and very dry wind blowing out of the bottom of mountain passes into the valleys and coastal plain.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} thought {{is central to}} {{psychology}} and related fields. Cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes' underlying behavior. It uses information processing {{as a framework for}} understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are <b>all</b> <b>well</b> researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as cognitivism, whose adherents argue for an information processing model of mental function, informed by positivism and experimental psychology. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing {{on the development of the}} human mind through the life span, developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or moral development. Psychologists have developed intelligence tests and the concept of intelligence quotient in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its distribution among population.|$|E
25|$|The Charlotte Three, {{consisting}} of T.J. Reddy, James Grant, and Charles Parker, were {{a group of}} men arrested and convicted in Charlotte, North Carolina for the burning of Lazy B Stables, a horse stable. The burning took place on September 24, 1968, one year after Lazy B Stables was integrated. All three men were arrested and implicated in the arson on December 1971, a full three years after the incident. The men were eventually convicted for their presumed actions, and were unsuccessful in having their appeals accepted, with the Supreme Court rejecting their motions. They were <b>all</b> <b>well</b> known radical activists in Charlotte and some people claimed their arrest was aimed at stopping their political motives. Many observers believed that this case was a representation of the still heavily racist Southern United States of the 1970s, and the various underhanded methods prosecutors were willing to utilize to obtain convictions against African Americans. The Charlotte Three were victims in the eyes of some, of an American South that was still reeling from widespread integration and general mistrust in Black affairs. The men were held against their will incorrectly not for crimes that they did not commit, but because of the social change they worked hard to attain. Finally, in 1979, North Carolina Jim Hunt commuted all three men's sentences after a vigorous campaign by state, national, and international activists on their behalf.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{there had}} been {{discussion}} connecting copy number variations to gene families. Gene families are defined {{as a set of}} related genes that serve similar functions but have minor temporal or spatial differences and these genes likely derived from one ancestral gene. The main reason copy number variations are connected to gene families {{is that there is a}} possibility that genes in a family may have derived from one ancestral gene which got duplicated into different copies. Mutations accumulate through time in the genes and with natural selection acting on the genes, some mutations lead to environmental advantages allowing those genes to be inherited and eventually clear gene families are separated out. An example of a gene family that may have been created due to copy number variations is the globin gene family. The globin gene family is an elaborate network of genes consisting of alpha and beta globin genes including genes that are expressed in both embryos and adults as well as pseudogenes. These globin genes in the globin family are <b>all</b> <b>well</b> conserved and only differ by a small portion of the gene, indicating that they were derived from a common ancestral gene, perhaps due to duplication of the initial globin gene.|$|E
