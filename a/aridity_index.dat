The {{goal of this}} study was to explore the spatial and temporal variations of the de Martonne and Pinna <b>aridity</b> <b>indices</b> over Iran based on temperature and precipitation data from 41 stations for 40 years (1966 e 2005).

As a result the country experienced droughts in different years with different magnitudes. Raya valley is huge agricultural corridor of Tigray region, but often exposed to water shortage. Though, studying aridity distribution is a key for agricultural management (Croitoru et al. 2013), the spatial distribution of <b>aridity</b> <b>indices</b> in Raya valley is not studied yet. Therefore, this paper focused to assess the spatial distribution of <b>aridity</b> <b>indices</b> in Raya valley.|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to analyze spatial {{distribution}} of climatic characterization using climate indices. For this purpose, an analysis of aridity is presented using climate indices over Raya valley based on meteorological data from eight stations. Spatial distribution of the <b>aridity</b> <b>indices</b> was performed throughout the studied region. The station values of three indices indicated a high coefficient of determination, which in common reveals area prone to dry and semi-dry risk. The spatial distribution of De Martonne index and Pinna combinative index was similar. However, evaluating the results of these two indices, the De Martonne index was found more appropriate for the considered area since it defines more precisely the climate of each location using seven classes and it can be computed at specific season and month. The spatial distribution of the De Martonne index emphasized increased irrigation requirements in the northern east part of the study area. The study area needs irrigation in most of the months with different percentage coverage. Therefore, it is helpful to consider aridity analysis for the water resources utilization and irrigation systems of the study area. Increasing in aridity implies that drought may persist, and it is important to predict the future <b>aridity</b> <b>indices</b> of the study area.|$|R

50|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} (PET) is {{the amount}} of water that would be evaporated and transpired if there were sufficient water available. High temperatures result in higher PET. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the Earth's land surface to atmosphere. Evapotranspiration can never be greater than PET.

Coldest /\ / \ PET - -- - RainColdest regions have not much evapotranspiration nor precipitation, hence polar deserts. In the warmer regions, there are deserts with maximum PET but low rainfall that make the soil even drier, and rain forests with low PET and maximum rainfall causing river systems to drain excess water into oceans.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the climate}} (both {{temperatures}} and humidity) in today's northern Siberia {{is in fact}} {{similar to that of}} the mammoth steppe. The radiation <b>aridity</b> <b>index</b> for northern Siberia on Mikhail Budyko's scale is 2 (= steppe bordering on semi-desert). [...] Budyko's scale compares the ratio of the energy received by the earth's surface to the energy required for the evaporation of the total annual precipitation. The 'humid climate' argument was based on other scales, which compare precipitation to potential evapotranspiration. Moss has a very low transpiration rate and thus causes humidity without necessarily needing humidity for its establishment. Using these other scales as a proof for humidity being the cause of the disappearance of the grasslands therefore constitutes a scientifically not viable circular argument.|$|E
50|$|Position on {{the scale}} is {{determined}} not from rainfall records but from field observation because humidity is influenced by several factors such as altitude or prevailing winds. Savory used the term brittleness because an easy practical observation {{is whether or not}} a dead grass stem or small dead twig is soft and easily bent by hand or so brittle it snaps. For these reasons it differs from an <b>aridity</b> <b>index.</b> Thus, some high rainfall environments, e.g., Zambia, with 2,000 mm annual rainfall and distinct wet and dry seasons, is higher on the brittleness scale because of the long portions of the year without rainfall. An environment with lower total rainfall distributed fairly evenly throughout the year, such as parts of England with 600 mm annually, are lower on the brittleness scale.|$|E

The higher the <b>aridity</b> <b>indices</b> classification of a region is, the greater the water resources variability (Deniz et al. 2011).

30|$|Droughts {{have become}} a {{recurrent}} phenomenon in many {{regions of the world}} affecting more and more ecosystems and society. Therefore, climate indices become good indicator for analyzing climate change (Zubler et al. 2014). Climate indices, function of two or more climate variables, are diagnostic tools used to define the state of climate system, and the understanding of various climate mechanisms has been improved based on several climate variables (Deniz et al. 2011). Climate indices facilitate the interpretation of projected climate change impacts for many sectors in society (Zubler et al. 2014).

50|$|The Indian Ganga River Basin {IGRB} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fertile and densely {{populated}} river basins in the world. IGRB is facing cascading effects of human interference and climatic change. Aridity as measured by <b>aridity</b> <b>index</b> (AI) is projected to increase over land under climate change. Aridity has adversely affected the vegetation. For example Anogeissus Pendula forest in Jaipur has been adversely affected by aridity. Only few of the trees in this forest are left. Long term change in inherent and dynamic qualities of soil has accelerated the land degradation in many regions throughout IGRB. Construction of dams and canals around IGRB has also resulted in diminishing soil fertility in IGRB. Soil salinity has also increased. The present analysis clearly elucidated an alarming increase in aridity that could cause other cascading impacts in future thereby making it unfit for human use.|$|E
5000|$|This {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{attempts}} at defining an <b>aridity</b> <b>index,</b> one that reflects the effects of the thermal regime and the amount and distribution of precipitation in determining the native vegetation possible in an area. It recognizes the significance of temperature in allowing colder places such as northern Canada to be seen as humid with the same level of precipitation as some tropical deserts because of lower levels of potential evapotranspiration in colder places. In the subtropics, the allowance for the distribution of rainfall between warm and cold seasons recognizes that winter rainfall is more effective for plant growth that can flourish in the winter and go dormant in the summer than the same amount of summer rainfall during a warm-to-hot season. Thus a place like Athens, Greece that gets most of its rainfall in winter can be considered to have a humid climate (as attested in lush foliage) with roughly the same amount of rainfall that imposes semi-desert conditions in Midland, Texas, where rainfall largely occurs in the summer.|$|E
50|$|Kerala {{has been}} {{experiencing}} increasing incidents of drought {{in the recent}} past due to the weather anomalies and developmental pressures resulting from the changes in land use, traditional practices, and life style of the people. The increase in population and subsequent expansion in irrigated agriculture, and industrial growth necessitated the exploitation of more water resources. The changes in the land and water management practices affected the fresh water availability during summer months. Although the deviation in the annual rainfall received in Kerala, in any year from the long term average is very small, there is considerable variation in the rainfall availability during the different seasons. About 95 percent of annual rainfall is confined to a six-month monsoon period between June and November, leaving the remaining six months as practically dry. Soman (1988) reported that over major part of the Kerala State, extreme as well as these where the rainfall is more compared to other areas. The changes in rainfall pattern may have association with the environmental modifications due to human interventions on the natural ecosystems. The State of Kerala experiences seasonal drought conditions every year during the summer months. Even in the years of normal rainfall, summer water scarcity problems are severe in the midland and highland regions. Severe drought conditions often result from the anomalies in monsoon rainfall combined with the various anthropogenic pressures. A study on the incidence of droughts based on the <b>aridity</b> <b>index</b> shows that during the period 1871- 2000, the State of Kerala experienced 66 drought years, out of which, twelve each were moderate and severe droughts. The droughts have a large dimension of economic, environmental and social impacts. With the implementation of a number of irrigation projects, the idea of drought in Kerala slowly shifted to unirrigated paddy, and upland crops. The water scarcity in summer is mainly reflected in dry rivers and lowering of water table. This adversely affects the rural and urban drinking water supply. As seen in the majority of drought incidents, even a 20% fall in the northeast monsoon, can make the water scarcity situation worse during the summer. Since the State has more of perennial plantation crops compared to other places of India, the effect of a drought year in Kerala continues to be felt for several more years after it has occurred. Thus, for better planning of the drought management measures, the term drought with reference to plantation crops should be redefined based on rainfall received or available soil moisture during summer months instead of total monsoon rainfall.|$|E

In sparrows from the mesic area, TEWL was higher than predicted by their body mass for passerines from and environments (133 %), but very close (97 %) to the expectation for passerines from mesic areas. BMR values were 25 % lower in sparrows from the semi-arid region.

The impacts of meteorological variables on RET were assessed through sensitive analysis by comparing the resulting RETs from artificially disturbed meteorological variables. The results indicated that the RET for 16 stations in Mongolia showed an increasing trend, particularly in the center and south. The calculated RET was higher than precipitation, which means severe droughts in Mongolia. The spatial patterns of RET are significantly influenced by climatic conditions as well as characteristics of the underlying surface (e. g., elevation and vegetation). The mean annual RET decreased from the south to the north, owing to sparse vegetation in the south of Mongolia.

Here we show that the carbon isotopic compositions (δ 13 C) of pollen, sporopollenin, leaf and stem tissues of Cedrus atlantica are strongly related. Untreated pollen δ 13 C has a significant linear relationship with sporopollenin δ 13 C (r 2 = 0. 97, p < 0. 0001) which is relatively depleted in 13 C by an average 1. 5 ‰. Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ 13 C) by sporopollenin (derived from pollen δ 13 C values) is related to mean annual (r 2 = 0. 54, p < 0. 001) and summer precipitation (r 2 = 0. 63, p < 0. 0001). A 100 mm increase in mean annual precipitation results in sporopollenin Δ 13 C increasing by 0. 52 ‰, or by 1. 4 ‰ per 100 mm summer precipitation. There is a stronger relationship between sporopollenin Δ 13 C and long-term annual scPDSI (r 2 = 0. 86, p < 0. 0001) and summer scPDSI (r 2 = 0. 86, p < 0. 001) <b>aridity</b> <b>indexes,</b> with reduced Δ 13 C as aridity increases.

To characterize the mean rate and historical variance of direct recharge derived from precipitation, unsaturated zone profiles of chloride and υ 18 O in the dry river bed of the Beiyishui River were employed. The results show that archival time scale of the profile covers the duration from 1980 to 2002 (corresponding to depths from 5 to 2 m) which is indicated by matching the υ 18 O peaks in the isotope profile with the <b>aridity</b> <b>indexes</b> gained by instrumental records of annual precipitation and annual potential evaporation.

Further, the direct recharge rates vary from 2 Ð 1 to 6 Ð 8 mm year 1 since 1980. Despite the subhumid climate, the estimate of recharge rates is in line with other findings in semiarid regions.

30|$|Global {{concern for}} climate change {{has led to}} pay {{significant}} attention for analyzing drought in quantitative forms. Over the years, a number of indices have been in use for drought portrayal Keyantash and Dracup (2002), Mishra and Singh (2010, 2011), Zargar et al. (2011) have reviewed dozens of such indices. However, drought indices based on only rainfall data are simple to compute and found to perform better (Oladipo 1985). Among the commonly used indices that use rainfall data, Standardized Precipitation Index, SPI (Mckee et al. 1993) is frequently applied worldwide (Hosseinizadeh et al. 2015) for drought assessment. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) considered SPI as a standard drought monitoring index (Hayes et al. 2011). It {{is one of the}} two <b>indices</b> (other being <b>Aridity</b> Anomaly <b>Index)</b> used by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Since SPI is standardized and has a probabilistic interpretation (Guttman 1998), the present study is going to utilize this.|$|R
