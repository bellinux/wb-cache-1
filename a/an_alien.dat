Shortly after finding a surviving, cocooned colonist whose chest bursts to reveal <b>an</b> <b>Alien,</b> Apone grabs a flamethrower from Frost to incinerate it. In the subsequent Alien attack, he is captured alive. Hudson later states that the life sign computer readouts indicate that Apone was not killed in the attack; presumably impregnated by <b>an</b> <b>Alien,</b> he died when the atmosphere processor exploded or from <b>an</b> <b>Alien</b> gestating in his body.|$|E

5|$|Harris {{reportedly}} {{joined the}} cast of Prometheus in February 2011 with Idris Elba and Kate Dickie.

During its evolution into Prometheus, Ridley Scott decided to diverge from the previous films and establish a separate canon. In a deleted take of Fifield's mutated face he is more deformed and reminiscent of <b>an</b> <b>Alien,</b> with an elongated cranium under the melted, translucent helmet, long arms and sharp teeth. The character's final depiction retained Fifield's human appearance.|$|E
