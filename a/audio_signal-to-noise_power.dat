40|$|A polarity-coincidence {{detector}} with biased polarity indicators (biased hard limiters) is {{studied to}} determine the effects of the bias on the detector output mean value, output variance, and output <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>power</b> ratio. The mean value of the detector output is derived for the case of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with arbitrary spectra for the signal and noise. The mean value is expressed as a function of the input <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>power</b> ratio, and as a function of the biases in the input channel and the reference channel polarity indicators. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a spurious component in the output mean value. The variance of the defector output is derived for the cage of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with RC low-pass spectra for signal and noise, for small input <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>power</b> ratios only. The variance is expressed as a function of the biases in the input channel and reference channel polarity indicators, and as a function of the input signal-to-noise band-width radio. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a spurious component in the output variance. The output <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>power</b> ratio (the square of the output mean divided by the output variance) is derived for both an ideal polarity-coincidence detector (no bias) and for a biased polarity-coincidence detector. The output <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>power</b> ratio is expressed as a function of the input <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>power</b> ratio, the biases in the input channel and the reference channel polarity indicators, and input signal-to-noise band-width ratio, for small input <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>power</b> ratios only. It is shown that the output <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>power</b> ratio of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of a correlation detector. When the input signal-to-noise band-width ratio is unity, the degradation is about 1. 4 db. The degradation increases to about 2. 2 db. when the input signal-to noise band-width ratio becomes either very small or very large. It is also shown that the output <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>power</b> ratio of a biased polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector. A simple expression for the degradation is presented. Limits on the biases are given, such that when the biases are smaller than these limits, the degradation of the output <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>power</b> ratio is negligible...|$|R

40|$|Waveform {{clipping}} is {{a common}} problem in digital audio signal processing. Clipping effect changes the audio amplitude distribution and brings noise, which results in the decrease of <b>audio</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> ratio (SNR). To estimate the degree of clipping effect, we propose a method for SNR estimation of clipped signals base on audio amplitude distribution. We first locate the clipping intervals of audio signal with high precision based on {{the differences between the}} amplitude probability density functions (PDFs) of normal and clipped audio signals. Then, the clipped amplitude PDF is restored using Gamma distribution to estimate the non-clipped amplitude distribution. Finally, based on the restored PDF, the estimated SNR of distorted audio signals are calculated, which can indicate the degree of clipping effect. Experiments on 3200 audios show that our approach can achieve a low error of 0. 017 in clipped values locating, and an error less than 0. 5 dB in SNR estimation.
