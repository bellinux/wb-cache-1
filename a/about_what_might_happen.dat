25|$|During most dreams, {{the person}} dreaming is {{not aware that}} they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or {{eccentric}} the dream is. The reason for this {{may be that the}} prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream without thinking <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen,</b> since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.|$|E
500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said.

[...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself.

2500|$|Yet Singelenberg, a Dutch social anthropologist, {{found that}} amid the {{conflict}} of Watch Tower Society statements from the era <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> that year, its sense of urgency on a probable apocalyptic event, and later {{the possibility of a}} cataclysm, expectations of a significant event in 1975 had a [...] "startling impact" [...] on the proselytizing activities of Jehovah's Witnesses and membership growth. His analysis of Watch Tower Society data showed annual growth of [...] "publishers", which had averaged 2.8 percent annually between 1961 and 1966, leapt to between 10.4 and 12.4 percent from 1967 to 1975, with the number of active Witnesses through the 1970s peaking at almost 28,000 in November 1975. The number of average annual baptisms more than doubled, from 750 to 1851, with the ratio of defections to recruitments plummeting. The percentage of [...] "pioneers" [...] (Witnesses devoting at least 60 hours a month in preaching work) more than tripled from 2.3 percent of members to almost 8 percent in 1974 and 1975. He also found major increases in the number of [...] "back calls" [...] (return visits to interested members of the public who purchased publications) and average hours spent in service by individuals in the same two years.|$|E

60|$|This lady, whose fortune {{so great}} and so {{distinguished}} an assembly {{had chosen to}} hear as a happy forerunner and lucky omen of all their own, which were to be asked afterwards in their turns, proving so contrary to their expectations, already unfortunate in the prediction, and having been in tears about the matter, disheartened {{all the rest of}} the beauties from consulting him farther that day. The person who kept the tavern, by name, Mrs. Irwin, alleged that as some people were very fortunate, and others unfortunate upon the same day, so one lady might be before told a mishap one minute, and another lady all the prosperity in nature the very next minute following, and therefore that what the unfortunate lady had heard was not to be taken as ominous, or as what could malignantly influence the day, neither ought it to be the least hinderance to any who had the curiosity of being let into the secrets of time beforehand. However, whether the ladies were convinced or no; if she prevailed over their belief in that point, she could not prevail over their humour, which, though they might not believe the former prediction ominous to themselves, were naturally awed for fear of the like, peradventure, for a time, and so it was agreed, nemine contradicente, as a witty lady wrote it down, That no more petitions should for that day be presented by any of that company to his dumb, yet oracular, majesty. Mrs. Irwin, however, would have her way; said she did not presume to such honour as to call herself of that company, and that therefore she might consult him without breaking through the votes of the assembly. Many endeavoured to dissuade her, but as she was passionately fond of knowing future events; and had a mighty itch to be very inquisitive with the oracle <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen,</b> not only to herself, but her posterity; it was agreed that he should have the liberty of satisfying her curiosity, since she presumed her fortune was sure to be so good, and was so forward and eager for the knowledge of it. But, alas! such is too often the fantastical impulse of nature unluckily depraved, that it carries us often into wishes of knowing, what when known we would be glad to unknow again, and then our memory will not let us be untaught.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{develops}} a counterfactual {{reading of the}} Romantic {{period in which the}} topos of China is more significant.

Situated in contemporary histories of sinology, this essay uses the premise of a more sympathetic and pervasive British understanding of Chinese culture to interrogate Sino-British cultural relations in the early nineteenth century...|$|R

Senior pathologist James McNamara was consulted <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have <b>happened</b> to Holt's body, and suggested that it may have trapped by kelp and then consumed by sea creatures (specifically sharks, crayfish, and/or sea lice).

40|$|Sense-making {{software}} for crime investigation {{should be based}} on a model of reasoning about evidence that is both natural and rationally well-founded. A formal model is proposed that combines AI formalisms for abductive inference to the best explanation and for defeasible argumentation. Stories <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have <b>happened</b> in a case are represented as causal networks and possible hypotheses can be inferred by abductive reasoning. Links between stories and the available evidence are expressed with evidential generalisations that express how observations can be inferred from evidential sources with defeasible argumentation. It is argued that this approach unifies two well-known accounts of reasoning about evidence, namely, anchored narratives theory and new evidence theory. After the reasoning model is defined, a design is presented for sense-making software that allows crime investigators to visualise their thinking about a case in terms of the reasoning model. ...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable periods of Malta's history is the temple period, {{starting}} around 3600 BC. The Ġgantija Temple in Gozo {{is one of the}} oldest free-standing buildings in the world. The name of the complex stems from the Maltese word ġgant, which reflects the magnitude of the temple's size. Many of the temples are in the form of five semicircular rooms connected at the centre. It has been suggested that these might have represented the head, arms and legs of a deity, since one of the commonest kinds of statue found in these temples is a fat woman — a symbol of fertility. The Temple period lasted until about 2500 BC, at which point the civilization that raised these huge monoliths seems to have disappeared.
