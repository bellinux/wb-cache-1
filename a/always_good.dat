5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty. Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will. No other virtue has this status because every other virtue {{can be used to}} achieve immoral ends (the virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person, for example). The good will is unique in that it is <b>always</b> <b>good</b> and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Mail is {{regulated}} by Ofcom, while consumer interests {{are represented by}} the Citizens Advice Bureau. The {{relationship between the two}} bodies' predecessors (Postcomm and Postwatch) was not <b>always</b> <b>good,</b> and in 2005, Postwatch took Postcomm to judicial review over its decision regarding rebates to late-paying customers.|$|E
25|$|Management {{considered}} the campaign a success, but some customers thought the campaign exhibited grandiose behavior and bragging when service levels were not <b>always</b> <b>good.</b> Braniff, however, reported an 80 {{percent increase in}} business during {{the life of the}} campaign in spite of an economic downturn the following year.|$|E

25|$|Social {{psychologists have}} studied {{attitude}} formation, {{the structure of}} attitudes, attitude change, the function of attitudes, {{and the relationship between}} attitudes and behavior. Because people are influenced by the situation, general attitudes are not <b>always</b> <b>good</b> predictors of specific behavior. For example, for a variety of reasons, a person may value the environment but not recycle a can on a particular day.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{in times}} of high inflation, tokens have {{sometimes}} taken on a currency role. An {{example of this is}} Italian or Israeli telephone tokens, which were <b>always</b> <b>good</b> for the same service (i.e., one phone call) even as prices increased. New York City Subway tokens were also accepted sometimes in trade, or even in parking meters, since they had a set value.|$|E
25|$|The debate {{developed}} over the economic concept of a general glut, {{and the possibility of}} failure of Say's Law. Malthus laid importance on economic development and the persistence of disequilibrium. The context was the post-war depression; Malthus had a supporter in William Blake, in denying that capital accumulation (saving) was <b>always</b> <b>good</b> in such circumstances, and John Stuart Mill attacked Blake on the fringes of the debate.|$|E

25|$|When flying {{visually}} {{the visibility}} is not <b>always</b> <b>good</b> {{enough to see}} long distances, so pilots use geographic features to confirm their position with what is shown on their charts. The Roach flows past Purdeys Industrial Estate, Rochford, which {{is very close to}} the threshold of Runway 24. Pilots returning from a flight north east of the airport would use the Roach to help align themselves with the runway.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the early}} {{problems}} for the Unit was the difficulty in sourcing film stock. At the time, the only wildlife cameramen were amateurs, and the footage wasn't <b>always</b> <b>good</b> enough for broadcast. The embryo unit's first film camera, a clockwork Bolex, was bought from a Bristol camera shop with petty cash by Desmond's assistant, Tony Soper. Some of Scott's own expedition films were used for early episodes of Look. One particularly outstanding film from 1955, shot by Heinz Sielmann, showed woodpeckers inside a nest hole.|$|E
25|$|At least 1/2 of all {{edges are}} <b>always</b> <b>good.</b> PROOF: Build a {{directed}} version of G by directing each {{edge to the}} node with the higher degree (breaking ties arbitrarily). So for every bad node, the number of out-going edges is more than 2 {{times the number of}} in-coming edges. So every bad edge, that enters a node v, can be matched to a distinct set of two edges that exit the node v. Hence the total number of edges is at least 2 times the number of bad edges.|$|E

She informs him of where he is and allows him to explore his {{memories}} for one last time, but warns him that memories aren't <b>always</b> <b>good.</b> Upon finding a hidden key inside a tree that he had put there in his childhood, Wilson {{opens the door to}} a nearby cabin. Inside he discovers old drawings he and his friend Amelia had made when they were children. He remembers that she made him promise to fly her away from here when they grew up so she could go to the Big City. Wilson then explores a nearby barn, in which he and Amelia had kissed for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Girardengo {{took the}} first of his Giro d’Italia wins in 1919 (including seven stage wins), however his form in the Giro was not <b>always</b> <b>good</b> and he {{abandoned}} the race in the early stages in 1920, 1921 and 1922 before dominating in 1923. 1923 was undoubtedly Girardengo’s best year with 16 victories, he took his second Giro d’Italia win including eight of the ten stages as well as many of the top Italian one day races. Despite racing in Italy for most of his career, Girardengo had a burning desire to win Paris–Roubaix, he first raced there in 1921 but he was unlucky on several occasions, breaking his bike when well placed and never coming close to winning. In 1924 Girardengo won the GP Wolber in France, then regarded as the unofficial World Championship.|$|E
