5|$|Feminist economists <b>also</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} agency is not {{available}} to everyone, such as children, the sick, and the frail elderly. Responsibilities for their care can compromise the agency of caregivers as well. This is a critical departure from the homo economicus model.|$|E
5|$|Discussion {{continues}} {{about the}} relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts <b>also</b> <b>point</b> out that the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do {{not take into account}} differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{believe that}} these {{elements}} cannot completely explain the dramatic rise and fall in tulip prices. Garber's theory has also been challenged for failing to explain a similar dramatic rise and fall in prices for regular tulip bulb contracts. Some economists <b>also</b> <b>point</b> to other factors associated with speculative bubbles, such as a growth in the supply of money, demonstrated {{by an increase in}} deposits at the Bank of Amsterdam during that period.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series {{has not been}} universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same-sex relationships {{has long been a}} sore spot with LGBT fandom, some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, <b>also</b> <b>point</b> to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>also</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} the {{relationship}} between the two men is addressed with the same words and emphasis as other love relationships in the Hebrew Testament, whether heterosexual or between God and people: e.g. 'ahava' or אהבה.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consumers}} <b>also</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} government-enforced pasteurization {{law has been}} used as a tool for large business to shut out competition from smaller producers. See the case of the FDA's shut down of Goodflow Juice in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Affirmation of the {{classification}} of Macedonian as a separate language {{is an important issue}} for the ethnic Macedonian self-view. Critics often treat it as a dialect of Bulgarian, due to their close structural affinity and mutual intelligibility in both written and spoken forms; they <b>also</b> <b>point</b> to Macedonian's recent emergence as a separate standard language, and the political motivation behind its promotion in the mid-20th century.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{supporting}} the Satem {{character of the}} Illyrian languages highlight particular toponyms and personal names such as Asamum, Birzinimum Zanatis etc. in which these scholars claim that there is clear evidence of the Satem character of the Illyrian language. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> to other toponyms including Osseriates derived from /*eghero/ (lake) or Birziminium from PIE /*bherǵh/ or Asamum from PIE /*aḱ-mo/ (sharp).|$|E
25|$|Defenders of Thomson's {{argument}} {{reply that}} the alleged disanalogies between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion do not matter, either because {{the factors that}} critics appeal to are not genuinely morally relevant, or because those factors are morally relevant but {{do not apply to}} abortion in the way that critics have claimed. Thomson's defenders <b>also</b> <b>point</b> to her 'people-seeds' argument as a strong analogy to typical cases of abortion.|$|E

25|$|Funding for Tertiary Institutions {{has been}} criticised {{recently}} {{due to high}} fees and funding not keeping pace with costs or inflation. Some <b>also</b> <b>point</b> out that high fees are leading to skills shortages in New Zealand as high costs discourage participation and graduating students seek well paying jobs off shore {{to pay for their}} student loans debts. As a result, education funding has been undergoing an ongoing review in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Brown consecrated Francis Schuckardt {{without a}} pontifical mandate (i.e. {{permission}} from the Pope), which is normally required by the Code of Canon Law under penalty of excommunication. However, traditionalists cite over a dozen historical instances where Bishops were legitimately consecrated {{in a period of}} sede vacante. Traditionalists <b>also</b> <b>point</b> out the superiority of the essential doctrine of Apostolic Authority over the changeable dictates of ecclesiastical law, and hold that Christ would not leave his flock without shepherds.|$|E
25|$|The authors <b>also</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} the study's {{assessments}} strongly agree with the conclusions of earlier studies conducted by faculty at West Point, the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA), and the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). All four studies concluded that the program suffered from multiple problems in its creation and implementation, which inhibited {{the effectiveness of the}} teams in the field. Yet, all agree that a high majority of commanders were extremely supportive of the teams and found them effective.|$|E

25|$|Critics during Sage’s {{lifetime}} frequently compared {{her work}} {{to that of}} Tanguy, who was better known, and usually assumed that, when their work had features in common, those features must have originated with him. More recent feminist scholars have stated that the influence more likely was mutual—what Judith Suther calls “a constant, usually unconscious interchange.” Suther and others <b>also</b> <b>point</b> out {{differences between the two}} artists: for example, the large architectural constructions that dominate Sage’s paintings are quite unlike the smaller biomorphic or metallic forms that people Tanguy’s landscapes.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphological}} {{features of}} the cave bear chewing apparatus, including loss of premolars, have long been suggested to indicate their diets displayed {{a higher degree of}} herbivory than the Eurasian brown bear. Indeed, a solely vegetarian diet has been inferred on the basis of tooth morphology. Results obtained on the stable isotopes of cave bear bones <b>also</b> <b>point</b> to a largely vegetarian diet in having low levels of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13, which are accumulated at a faster rate by carnivores as opposed to herbivores.|$|E
25|$|Marlovians (as {{those who}} {{subscribe}} to the theory are usually called) base their argument on supposed anomalies surrounding Marlowe's reported death and on the significant influence which, according to most scholars, Marlowe's works had on those of Shakespeare. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> out the coincidence that, despite their having been born only two months apart, {{the first time the}} name William Shakespeare is known to have been connected with any literary work whatsoever was with the publication of Venus and Adonis just a week or two after the apparent death of Marlowe.|$|E
