5|$|Soon after in 2004, Favre's wife, Deanna Favre, was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer. Following <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment</b> through 2004, she recovered. She created The Deanna Favre Hope Foundation which supports breast cancer education and women's breast imaging and diagnosis services for all women, including those who are medically underserved.|$|E
5|$|Treatment and {{outcomes}} {{depends on the}} risk group a person is in. Treatments may include observation, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation. Low-risk disease in babies typically has a good outcome with surgery or simply observation. In high-risk disease chances of long term survival, however, are less than 40% despite <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment</b> of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} course of {{treatment}} of DNT is surgery. About 70-90% of surgery are successful in removing the tumour. Since the tumour is most often benign, and does not impose immediate threat, <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments</b> such as chemotherapy and radiation are not needed, and therefore patients especially {{children and young adults}} do not {{have to go through the}} grueling side effects of these <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{classification}} is {{to select the}} best treatment. The effectiveness of a specific treatment is demonstrated for a specific breast cancer (usually by randomized, controlled trials). That treatment may not be effective in a different breast cancer. Some breast cancers are aggressive and life-threatening, and must be treated with <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments</b> that have major adverse effects. Other breast cancers are less aggressive and can be treated with less <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments,</b> such as lumpectomy.|$|R
5|$|Without treatment, {{episodes of}} acute gout may develop into chronic gout with {{destruction}} of joint surfaces, joint deformity and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% {{of those who}} are untreated for five years, often in the helix of the ear, over the olecranon processes, or on the Achilles tendons. With <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment,</b> they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people and occur due to low urine pH promoting the precipitation of uric acid. Other forms of chronic kidney dysfunction may occur.|$|E
5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment,</b> mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or tramadol are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E
25|$|Corneal {{ulceration}} is a {{very common}} disease of the equine eye and can have sight-threatening consequences. <b>Aggressive</b> <b>treatment</b> is always indicated, as even apparently mild ulcers can progress quickly, causing serious complications.|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{outcomes}} of osteosarcoma have dramatically improved {{with the use}} of modern combination therapies.

50|$|Pain medication, such as {{morphine}} and oxycodone, and antiemetics, {{drugs to}} suppress nausea and vomiting, are very {{commonly used in}} patients with cancer-related symptoms. Improved antiemetics such as ondansetron and analogues, as well as aprepitant have made <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments</b> much more feasible in cancer patients.|$|R
25|$|The {{management}} {{of breast cancer}} depends on various factors, including {{the stage of the}} cancer and the age of the patient. Increasingly <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments</b> are employed in accordance with the poorer the patient's prognosis and the higher the risk of recurrence of the cancer following treatment.|$|R
25|$|Of {{all people}} with aortic dissection, 40% die {{immediately}} {{and do not}} reach a hospital in time. Of the remainder, 1% die every hour, making prompt diagnosis and treatment a priority. Even after diagnosis, 5–20% die during surgery or in the immediate postoperative period. In ascending aortic dissection, if surgery is decided to be not appropriate, 75% die within 2 weeks. With <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment,</b> 30-day survival for thoracic dissections may {{be as high as}} 90%.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{treating}} withdrawal symptoms. If delirium tremens occurs, <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment</b> improves outcomes. Treatment {{in a quiet}} intensive care unit with sufficient light is often recommended. Benzodiazepines are the medication of choice with diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and oxazepam all commonly used. They should be given until a person is lightly sleeping. The antipsychotic haloperidol may also be used. The vitamin thiamine is recommended. Mortality without treatment is between 15% and 40%. Currently death occurs in about 1% to 4% of cases.|$|E
25|$|Clostridial {{enterocolitis}} due {{to infection}} by Clostridium perfringens is most commonly seen in foals under 3 months of age. Clostridial toxins damage the intestine, leading to dehydration and toxemia. Foals usually present with signs of colic, decreased nursing, abdominal distention, and diarrhea which may contain blood. Diagnosis {{is made with}} fecal culture, and while some foals do not require serious intervention, others need IV fluids, antibiotics, and <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment,</b> and may still die. Other bacterial infections {{that may lead to}} enterocolitis include Salmonella, Klebsiella, Rhodococcus equi, and Bacteriodes fragilis.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to update {{knowledge}} on therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN), {{taking into account the}} new 2008 WHO classification, new genome-wide approaches for the definition of susceptibility towards t-MN and the introduction of new more <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments</b> in cancer patients. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{purpose of this}} review is to update knowledge on therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN), taking into account the new 2008 WHO classification, new genome-wide approaches for the definition of susceptibility towards t-MN and the introduction of new more <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments</b> in cancer patients. RECENT FINDINGS: t-MN are an increasing matter in cancer survivors treated with chemoradiotherapy. One of the major concerns in hematologic malignancies is childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in which the leukemogenic role of extended etoposide/teniposide treatment, concomitant intensive antimetabolite and asparaginase, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and prophylactic cranial radiotherapy use have been established.

30|$|The {{treatment}} options for rectal fistulas have been classified into two types: conservative measures and <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments.</b> The former includes interventional radiology (percutaneous drainage) and colostomy, {{and the latter}} includes local repair [4] and re-anastomosis. In our case, a conservative measure, i.e., colostomy, was selected for treating the symptom of frequent defecation. However, if it fails to improve these symptoms, we will schedule local repair.|$|R
25|$|Leukemia {{is rarely}} {{associated}} with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women. How it is handled depends {{primarily on the}} type of leukemia. Nearly all leukemias appearing in pregnant women are acute leukemias. Acute leukemias normally require prompt, <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment,</b> despite significant risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive first trimester. Chronic myelogenous leukemia can be treated with relative safety at any time during pregnancy with Interferon-alpha hormones. Treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemias, which are rare in pregnant women, can often be postponed until {{after the end of the}} pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|From 6 to 11 July 1997 {{there were}} mass protests, fierce riots and gun battles in Irish {{nationalist}} districts of Northern Ireland. Irish nationalists/republicans, {{in some cases}} supported by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), attacked the police (Royal Ulster Constabulary – RUC) and British Army. The protests and violence were sparked by the decision to allow the Orange Order (a Protestant, unionist organization) to march through a Catholic/nationalist neighbourhood of Portadown. Irish nationalists were outraged by the decision and by the RUC's <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment</b> of those protesting against the march. There had been a bitter dispute over the march for many years.|$|E
25|$|No {{controlled}} {{clinical trials}} {{have been conducted}} on ADEM treatment, but <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment</b> aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone. Oral tapers of {{less than three weeks}} duration show a higher chance of relapsing, and tend to show poorer outcomes. Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect.|$|E
50|$|Childhood leukemia {{is a type}} of leukemia, usually acute {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (ALL), and a type of childhood cancer. The cure rate of childhood leukemia is generally higher than adult leukemia, approaching 90%, although some side effects of treatment last into adulthood. The older <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments</b> of cranial irradiation and anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin) caused increased risk of solid tumors, heart failure, growth retardation, and cognitive defects.|$|R

25|$|Endotoxemia is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of colic and warrants <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment.</b> Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) is released from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria when they die. Normally, endotoxin is prevented from entering systemic circulation by the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa, antibodies and enzymes which bind and neutralize it and, for the small amount that manages to enter the blood stream, removal by Kupffer cells in the liver. Endotoxemia occurs {{when there is an}} overgrowth and secondary die-off of gram negative bacteria, releasing mass quantities of endotoxin. This is especially common when the mucosal barrier is damaged, as with ischemia of the GI tract secondary to a strangulating lesion or displacement. Endotoxemia produces systemic effects such as cardiovascular shock, insulin resistance, and coagulation abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{renal failure}} occurs in 55–70% of {{patients}} with STEC-HUS, although up to 70–85% recover renal function. Patients with aHUS generally have poor outcomes, with up to 50% progressing to ESRD or irreversible brain damage; as many as 25% die during the acute phase. However, with <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment,</b> more than 90% of patients survive the acute phase of HUS, and only about 9% may develop ESRD. Roughly one-third of persons with HUS have abnormal kidney function many years later, and a few require long-term dialysis. Another 8% of persons with HUS have other lifelong complications, such as high blood pressure, seizures, blindness, paralysis, {{and the effects of}} having part of their colon removed. The overall mortality rate from HUS is 5–15%. Children and the elderly have a worse prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Prognosis {{is usually}} {{given for the}} {{probability}} of progression-free survival (PFS) or disease-free survival (DFS). These predictions are based on experience with breast cancer patients with similar classification. A prognosis is an estimate, as patients with the same classification will survive a different amount of time, and classifications are not always precise. Survival is usually calculated as an average number of months (or years) that 50% of patients survive, or the percentage of patients that are alive after 1, 5, 15, and 20 years. Prognosis is important for treatment decisions because patients with a good prognosis are usually offered less invasive treatments, such as lumpectomy and radiation or hormone therapy, while patients with poor prognosis are usually offered more <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment,</b> such as more extensive mastectomy and one or more chemotherapy drugs.|$|E

25|$|Excisional biopsies may {{remove the}} tumor, but further surgery is often {{necessary}} {{to reduce the}} risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate surgical margins and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a wide local excision (WLE) with 1 to 2cm margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually 0.2 to 0.5cm. Many surgeons consider 0.5cm the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ, but 0.2cm margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery (Mohs surgery, or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment</b> during the last decades.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{healthcare}} costs were approximately $3.2 trillion or nearly $10,000 per person on average in 2015. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%). U.S. costs in 2016 were substantially higher than other OECD countries, at 17.2% GDP versus 12.4% GDP {{for the next}} most expensive country (Switzerland). For scale, a 5% GDP difference represents about $1 trillion or $3,000 per person. Some of the many reasons cited for the cost differential with other countries include: Higher administrative costs of a private system with multiple payment processes; higher costs for the same products and services; more expensive volume/mix of services with higher usage of more expensive specialists; <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment</b> of very sick elderly versus palliative care; less use of government intervention in pricing; and higher income levels driving greater demand for healthcare. Healthcare costs are a fundamental driver of health insurance costs, which leads to coverage affordability challenges for millions of families. There is ongoing debate whether the current law (ACA/Obamacare) and the Republican alternatives (AHCA and BCRA) do enough to address the cost challenge.|$|E
25|$|Betty Francis (née Hofstadt, {{formerly}} Draper) (January Jones): Don Draper's {{ex-wife and}} mother of their three children; Sally, Bobby, and Eugene Scott. Raised in the Philadelphia suburb of Elkins Park, Pennsylvania {{and a graduate of}} Bryn Mawr College, she met Don when she was a model in Manhattan and married him soon thereafter. At the start of the series, they have been married for seven years (since 1953) and live in Ossining, New York. Over the course of the first two seasons, Betty gradually becomes aware of her husband's womanizing. After a brief separation, Betty allows Don to return home when she learns she is pregnant with their third child, but first has a one-night stand of her own. She leaves for Reno at the end of Season 3, in December 1963, with the intention of divorcing Don. At the start of Season 4, in November 1964, she has divorced Don and married Henry Francis. She and her children and new husband move to Rye. Betty's relationship with her children, particularly Sally, is often strained. At the end of Season 7, Betty learns that she has an advanced stage of lung cancer and is given {{six months to a year}} to live, even with <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatment.</b> She quickly accepts that her life will soon be over and makes plans for her funeral and her children's future care.|$|E

40|$|Oncological {{treatment}} of cancer patients still requires {{in the majority}} of cases chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Due to their lack of specificity, they are <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments</b> that can cause different toxicities. Nowadays, new more selective and, therefore, less <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments</b> against healthy tissues are being developped. Meanwhile, it is essential to inform patients against the expected toxicity of each drug, to inform them about toxicity prevention and about the treatment required on each case. Moreover, {{it is very important to}} prepare them psychologically, to relieve them and to prepare them to face the treatment in the best possible way. In order to achieve so, it is extremely valuable to know that paradoxically the more common or potentially lethal toxicities from the doctor’s point of view might not match in some cases with those that distress the patient. Therefore, if this information is not taken into account in advance, all the help that might be given could result in fact worthless. The aim is to minimize cancer and chemotherapy consequences improving quality of life...|$|R
50|$|The onset {{and type}} of {{symptoms}} depends on the radiation exposure. Relatively smaller doses result in gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and symptoms related to falling blood counts, and predisposition to infection and bleeding. Relatively larger doses can result in neurological effects and rapid death. Treatment of acute radiation syndrome is generally supportive with blood transfusions and antibiotics, with some more <b>aggressive</b> <b>treatments,</b> such as bone marrow transfusions, being required in extreme cases.|$|R
