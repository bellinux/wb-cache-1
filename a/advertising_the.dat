Instead, if products are sufficiently differentiated, loss leader pricing may result only if firms <b>advertise</b> <b>the</b> low reservation value product, otherwise <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> good is a low margin leader. Thus, whether <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> good is a loss leader or a low margin leader is primarily a function of the extent of differentiation between competing firms. ...|$|R

That year, with Carol Göbl press, he also published a devotional text, Isus, fragment ("Jesus, A Fragment"). The theme of decadence continued to fuel Caion's essays: in Carmen magazine (September 1902), he covered Castanier's Lotus du Gange, implicitly <b>advertising</b> <b>the</b> book's lewd content and titillating illustrations. His {{take on the}} Caragiale affair was outlined in the Carol Göbl essay Moravuri literare în 1902 ("Literary Morals as of 1902").|$|E

5|$|In the mid-2000s, German sect experts {{expressed}} concerns that Scientologists were becoming {{active in the}} German after-school tutoring market.

Brochures <b>advertising</b> <b>the</b> tutoring services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, but not Scientology itself.|$|E

5|$|Although Morgan {{had been}} ordered to {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was {{no longer able to}} issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed. Morgan was not entirely friendly to pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and <b>advertising</b> <b>the</b> capture publicly.|$|E

5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as <b>advertising</b> <b>the</b> event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E

The graphics also underwent changes, being particularly noticeable with Marth's hair color and style. The game was advertised on television with a live-action commercial featuring a version of the Fire Emblem theme. Filming the commercial proved troublesome: the actors overheated due to their heavy costumes, and the light and sound effects made the actor horse skittish. The commercial required twenty retakes. The game released on April 20, 1990. Future ports were released through Nintendo's Virtual Console. It released for the Wii on October 20, 2009; for Nintendo 3DS on August 1, 2012; and for Wii U on June 4, 2014.|$|E
