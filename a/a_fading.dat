5|$|The {{success of}} the first Spider-Man film led Dunst to reprise her role as Mary Jane Watson in 2004 in Spider-Man 2. The movie was well {{received}} by critics and a financial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With revenue of $783million worldwide, {{it was the second}} highest-grossing film in 2004. Also in 2004, Dunst co-starred opposite Paul Bettany in the romantic comedy Wimbledon where she portrayed a rising tennis player in the Wimbledon Championships, while Bettany portrayed <b>a</b> <b>fading</b> former tennis star. The film received mixed reviews, but many critics enjoyed Dunst's performance. Claudia Puig of USA Today reported that the chemistry between Dunst and Bettany was potent, with Dunst doing a fine job as a sassy and self-assured player.|$|E
5|$|In {{the end of}} 2012, {{and before}} her divorce from Josh Brolin in early 2013, Lane {{returned}} to her theater roots and headlined a production of the David Cromer directed Sweet Bird of Youth (by Tennessee Williams) at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Lane played Princess Kosmonopolis, <b>a</b> <b>fading</b> Hollywood movie star, opposite Finn Wittrock, who portrayed Chance, her attractive gigolo. This {{was the first time}} she had done a stage play since 1989, when she played Olivia in William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Lane returned to theatre in the winter of 2015, starring with Tony Shalhoub in the off-Broadway original production of Bathsheba Doran's The Mystery of Love and Sex. In 2016, nearly four decades after she first appeared on Broadway, Lane starred in a play in which she previously performed: Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard (1977). While Lane played a child peasant (with no lines) in Broadway's 1977 run of the play, this time she played the lead role of Madame Lyubov Andreyevna Ranevskaya.|$|E

The film opened on December 21, 2007, and Hanks {{received}} a Golden Globe nomination. In the comedy-drama film The Great Buck Howard (2008), Hanks played the on-screen father {{of a young man}} (played by Hanks' real-life son, Colin) who chooses to work as road manager for <b>a</b> <b>fading</b> mentalist (John Malkovich). His character was less than thrilled about his son's career decision. In the same year, he executive produced the musical comedy, Mamma Mia and the miniseries, John Adams.|$|E
25|$|By early 2009 he was {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>fading</b> force, despite going 4-1 the previous year, with two wins in K-1. However, he had not competed in the World Grand Prix 2008, and ended the year with a loss to Freddy Kemayo. Dropped out of almost every top 10 heavyweight rankings, Leko began to compete almost exclusively in the Netherlands and Germany, with varying results. He returned to fight for It's Showtime in May 2009, facing another smaller but popular big name heavyweight in Melvin Manhoef. On the back of two consecutive losses in K-1, Leko went into the fight as an underdog, but he ended up dominating Manhoef for two rounds, picking him apart with boxing and leg kicks. Unfortunately, {{in the final round}} he broke his foot, and the fight was called off. Manhoef magnanimously admitted that Leko had outclassed him, and offered a rematch to the Golden Glory fighter.|$|E
25|$|The All-Palestine Government however lacked any {{significant}} authority {{and was in}} fact seated in Cairo. In 1959 it was officially merged into the United Arab Republic by the decree of Nasser, crippling any Palestinian hope for self governance. With the establishment in 1948 of the State of Israel, along with the migration of the Palestinian exodus, the common experience of the Palestinian refugee Arabs was mirrored in <b>a</b> <b>fading</b> of Palestinian identity. The institutions of a Palestinian nationality emerged slowly in the Palestinian refugee diaspora. In 1950 Yasser Arafat founded Ittihad Talabat Filastin. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, most of the Husseini clan relocated to Jordan and the Gulf States. Many family heads that remained in the Old City and the northern neighborhoods of East Jerusalem fled due to hostility with the Jordanian government, which controlled {{that part of the}} city; King Abdullah's assassin was a member of an underground Palestinian organization led by Daoud al-Husayni.|$|E

Even without sponsorship for the other 21 races, Purvis got a shot from Finch to do the whole 1996 schedule. Immediately, he won the pole {{for two of the}} first three races, at Daytona and Richmond. He finished third at Rockingham in the second race of the season. Then after winning the pole at Richmond, Purvis led 38 laps and shot by Joe Nemechek for his first career Busch Series win. Despite a disappointing mid-season, Purvis rebounded with a second-place finish at Myrtle Beach, sixth at Talladega, and a seventh at IRP. After the seventh at IRP, Purvis rolled on to Michigan, where, after blowing past <b>a</b> <b>fading</b> Mark Martin, he held off Terry Labonte for the second win of his career. By season's end, Purvis had seven top-10s in 26 starts, earning seventh place in the final standings.|$|E
25|$|In the April 19 episode, Perino read a {{prepared}} statement about O'Reilly's dismissal equivalent {{to what the}} network had released earlier in the day. The reasons for his firing and the sexual harassment allegations were {{not mentioned in the}} program itself. The termination of employment of the former host was a major feature of news coverage on both MSNBC and CNN; outside of the prepared statements, it was not mentioned on-air during the program and other regular topics were covered. The following day, images of the host were removed from the front windows of the News Corp. Building. O'Reilly was not given an opportunity to sign-off on-air, instead releasing a statement through his agency about the matter, while continuing to deny the sexual harassment allegations against him. During the final episode Gutfield spoke about the program's legacy and the loyalty of the show's staff after a segment with Tucker Carlson, followed by <b>a</b> <b>fading</b> of the stage's lighting to a dark state, revealing the set now blank of anything identifying the show.|$|E
25|$|Pompey and Crassus {{conducted}} the levy for their campaigns in their provinces. This created discontent. Some of the plebeian tribunes instituted {{a suit against}} their lieutenants that was actually aimed at them. They then tried to annul levies and rescind the vote for the proposed campaigns. Pompey was not perturbed because had already sent his lieutenants to Hispania. He had intended to let them deal with Hispania while he would gladly stay in Rome with the pretext {{that he had to}} stay there because he was the praefectus annonae. Crassus, instead needed his levy for his campaign against Parthia. He considered using force. The unarmed plebeian tribunes avoided confrontation, but they did criticise him. While Crassus was offering the prayers, which were customary before war, they claimed bad omens. One of the tribunes tried to have Crassus arrested. However, the others objected and while they were arguing Crassus left the city. He then headed for Syria and invaded Parthia. Plutarch thought that Crassus, the richest man in Rome, felt inferior to Pompey and Caesar only in military achievement and added a passion for glory to his greed. His achievements in the Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC) and in the Third Servile War (71 BC) were now <b>a</b> <b>fading</b> memory. Plutarch also wrote that Caesar wrote to Crassus from Gaul. He approved of his intentions and spurred him to war.|$|E

500|$|Several {{models for}} the origin of gamma-ray bursts {{postulated}} that the initial burst of gamma rays should be followed by slowly fading emission at longer wavelengths created by collisions between the burst ejecta and interstellar gas. This fading emission would be called the [...] "afterglow". Early searches for this afterglow were unsuccessful, largely because {{it is difficult to}} observe a burst's position at longer wavelengths immediately after the initial burst. The breakthrough came in February 1997 when the satellite BeppoSAX detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 970228) and when the X-ray camera was pointed towards the direction from which the burst had originated, it detected fading X-ray emission. The William Herschel Telescope identified <b>a</b> <b>fading</b> optical counterpart 20 hours after the burst. Once the GRB faded, deep imaging was able to identify a faint, distant host galaxy at the location of the GRB as pinpointed by the optical afterglow.|$|E
