40|$|Introduction: A <b>subdural</b> <b>haematoma</b> is an {{accumulation}} of blood between the brain and its surrounding dural covering which acts as a space-occupying lesion causing increased intracranial pressure and cerebral compression. Chronic <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas</b> (CSDH) differ from <b>acute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas</b> {{in so far as}} occurring mainly in the elderly. A history of direct head trauma is absent in upto 50 % of cases. Case report: A 64 -year old man, presented to the emergency centre with a sudden onset of right leg weakness. He initially denied any head injury but later recalled a minor head injury some weeks prior. Half an hour after presentation, his weakness progressed to a complete quadriparesis, while his sensory function remained intact and two hours after presentation he developed a complete flaccid quadriplegia. A CT scan was performed and revealed bilateral CSDH. Bilateral posterior and frontal burr holes were made under local anaesthesia, and 100  ml of blood was evacuated. Clinical improvement was almost immediately noted. After two days, his neurologic examination was without any abnormality. Discussion: CSDH is more common in the elderly. As reported here, clinical features may be delayed after the causal head injury (often weeks), and the trauma may even be forgotten. Cases manifesting bilateral haematomas are quite rare. The mechanism for quadriparesis is not fully understood. Motor deficit in the arms can be explained by direct compression or distortion of the cerebral hemispheres. This would not, however, account for motor weakness in the legs because the cortical areas responsible for the lower limbs would be relatively protected from the direct effect of compression. CSDH can present in many clinical scenarios, and may develop {{in the absence of a}} reported head injury. The diagnosis of CSDH should be considered in the differential when investigating cases of quadriplegia of uncertain aetiology, especially in the elderly population...|$|R

40|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>haematoma</b> (ASDH) {{is one of}} the {{conditions}} most strongly associated with severe brain injury. Reports prior to 1980 describe overall mortality rates for acute subdural haematomas (SDH's) ranging from 40 % to 90 % with poor outcomes observed in all age groups. Recently, improved results have been reported with rapid diagnosis and surgical treatment. The elderly are predisposed to bleeding due to normal cerebral atrophy related to aging, stretching the bridging veins from the dura. Prognosis in ASDH is associated with age, time from injury to treatment, presence of pupillary abnormalities, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) or motor score on admission, immediate coma or lucid interval, computerized tomography findings (haematoma volume, degree of midline shift, associated intradural lesion, compression of basal cisterns), post-operative intracranial pressure and type of surgery. Advancing age is known to be a determinant of outcome in head injury. We present the results of a retrospective study carried out in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland's national neurosurgical centre. The aim of our {{study was to examine the}} impact of age on outcome in patients with ASDH following severe head injury.

METHODS: The less invasive surgical technique of bedside percutaneous subdural tapping and spontaneous haematoma efflux after twist drill craniostomy under local anaesthesia was prospectively analysed in 118 adult patients, 99 with unilateral and 19 with bilateral CSDH. RESULTS: The mean number of subdural tappings was 3. 2. Ninety two of the patients with unilateral CSDH were successfully treated by up to five subdural tappings, 95 % of the patients with bilateral CSDH were successfully treated by up to 10 subdural tappings. The mean duration of inpatient treatment was 12 days. In 11 patients (9 %) the treatment protocol had to be abandoned because of two <b>acute</b> <b>subdural</b> bleedings, two subdural empyemas, and seven cases of insufficient haematoma efflux and no neurological improvement.
