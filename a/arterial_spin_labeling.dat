25|$|The primary form of fMRI {{uses the}} blood-oxygen-level {{dependent}} (BOLD) contrast, discovered by Seiji Ogawa. This {{is a type}} of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to energy use by brain cells. Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not require people to undergo shots or surgery, to ingest substances, or to be exposed to ionising radiation. This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal. The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied. The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds. Other methods of obtaining contrast are <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> and diffusion MRI. The latter procedure is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain.|$|E

40|$|A healthy cerebrovasculature is {{important}} in maintaining constant delivery of blood carrying oxygen and nutrients required for normal cerebral function. There is a considerable body of research into the regulation of the cerebrovasculature and cerebral blood flow, which has improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cerebrovascular pathology. However, a severe confound in research concerning the cerebrovasculature is the limited amount of in vivo human data available that assesses function and physiology of key cerebral structures: the brainstem and the cerebral arteries themselves. The work presented in this thesis aims to provide non-invasive imaging tools {{that can be used}} to further the understanding of cerebrovascular function and physiology. Herein, innovations of <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labelling,</b> an established magnetic resonance imaging technique to measure perfusion, are presented that address the challenges of measuring brainstem cerebrovascular physiology and facilitate a novel measurement of cerebral arterial compliance, a marker of cerebrovascular health. Regulation of the cerebrovasculature by the sympathetic nervous system is used throughout this thesis as an example process that can be investigated with <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labelling</b> based imaging methods, because the brainstem is an important sympathetic control centre and changes in sympathetic outflow directly affect the cerebral arteries. Firstly, <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labelling</b> is adapted to measure cerebral blood flow in the brainstem. The <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labelling</b> method tailored for the brainstem is then applied in the investigation of cerebral blood flow in the presence of poly-cystic ovary syndrome, a pathology recently associated with elevated sympathetic outflow. Secondly, an <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labelling</b> based approach to measure cerebral arterial compliance is introduced. Lastly, this thesis shows that a combination of the optimised brainstem perfusion imaging method and the novel arterial compliance measurement is able to investigate clinically relevant processes, including cerebral autoregulation and Cushing’s mechanism...|$|R

5000|$|A {{limitation}} of BOLD fMRI is its spatial resolution, as flow increase in somewhat large arteries or veins feed or drain large neuronal territories.

50|$|While BOLD signal {{analysis}} {{is the most}} common method employed for neuroscience studies in human subjects, the flexible nature of MR imaging provides means to sensitize the signal to other aspects of the blood supply. Alternative techniques employ <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> (ASL) or weighting the MRI signal by cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV). The CBV method requires injection of a class of MRI contrast agents that are now in human clinical trials.

50|$|Two {{parallel}} {{developments in}} endogenous contrast {{set the stage}} of methods to map brain activity without injection of tracers or contrast agents. Contemporaneous work a decade earlier by Thulborn, and Wright at Stanford, had shown that blood oxygenation levels could be measured by NMR methods. Later groundbreaking experiments by Ogawa, et al., and by Turner had shown that oxygen depletion led to significant drops in MRI signal changes in large veins and the brain cortex itself, respectively, via a magnetic susceptibility mechanism analogous to that used by Belliveau with exogenous tracers, {{but in this case}} using deoxygenated blood itself as the contrast agent. At the same time, methods to directly measure brain perfusion using spin inverted water (<b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labeling)</b> were pioneered in animal models by John Detre and Alan Koretsky. All of this was possible without the introduction of blood borne contrast agents.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{objective}} imaging markers of Parkinson’s disease status and progression. Positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography studies have suggested patterns of abnormal cerebral perfusion in Parkinson’s disease as potential functional biomarkers. This study aimed to identify an <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labelling</b> magnetic resonance-derived perfusion network as an accessible, non-invasive alternative. We used pseudo-continuous <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labelling</b> to measure cerebral grey matter perfusion in 61 subjects with Parkinson’s disease with a range of motor and cognitive impairment, including patients with dementia and 29 age- and sex-matched controls.

Region of interest analysis of absolute perfusion values revealed that the Parkinson’s disease pattern was characterized by decreased perfusion in posterior parieto-occipital cortex, precuneus and cuneus, and middle frontal gyri compared with healthy controls. Perfusion was preserved in globus pallidus, putamen, anterior cingulate and post- and pre-central gyri. Both motor and cognitive statuses were significant factors related to network score.

Arterial vasculature imaging by saturation data of activation and hypercapnia conditions showed increases in phase accompanying blood flow increases. An <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> functional magnetic resonance im-aging study yielded significant activation by magnitude-only, phase-only, and complex analyses when preserving the whole <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> signal.

Methods Ten patients with proximal arterial occlusion within 4. 5 hours after symptom onset were prospectively enrolled. All patients received intravenous thrombolysis during the magnetic resonance imaging examination. Repeated <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> perfusion images were acquired during the 60 -minute therapy and at follow-up after 24 to 72 hours. Clinical data, magnetic resonance imaging features, and cerebral perfusion changes were analyzed. Results Before thrombolysis, <b>arterial</b> <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> hypoperfusion and fluid-attenuation inversion recovery vascular hyperintensity in the territory of the occluded arteries were observed in all patients. In 5 patients, extensive arterial transit artifacts (ATA) developed in the hypoperfused area. The ATA corresponded with fluid-attenuation inversion recovery vascular hyperintensities. All 5 patients who developed extensive ATA in the hypoperfused area had complete reperfusion after thrombolysis, whereas the 5 without extensive ATA showed no or only partial reperfusion (P< 0. 01). The development of ATA preceded the normalization of tissue perfusion.
