5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its <b>acrid</b> taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, <b>acrid</b> taste is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically <b>acrid</b> tastes.|$|E
5|$|Mycologist Roger Phillips {{claims that}} L.blennius is edible when cooked, but not recommended, while others {{describe}} it as inedible or even poisonous. The milk tastes very hot and <b>acrid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is valued}} for its peppery flavor and eaten after {{suitable}} preparation in Russia and Finland, {{the species is}} highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or <b>acrid</b> taste, are destroyed by cooking. Studies have identified several chemicals present in the mushrooms, including ergosterol and derivatives thereof, and the pungent-tasting velleral.|$|E
5|$|L. vellereus {{is larger}} {{with a thick}} stipe, woolly cap and less crowded gills, but is not as tall. Russula delica is similar in colour and shape, though has adnate blue-green tinged gills and no milk. L. deceptivus is also similar, but is {{differentiated}} by its less crowded gills, firmer cap margin and less <b>acrid</b> milk. Close to L. piperatus is L. glaucescens, which is differentiated by its milk that dries with a greenish colour.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills. Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a taste reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less <b>acrid</b> taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckii {{is similar}} in appearance, but has an <b>acrid</b> taste, and clamp {{connections}} in its hyphae. Hydnellum spongiosipes is readily confused with H.ferrugineum, and several authors have historically considered the two species to be the same; molecular studies, however, indicate that the two fungi are closely related, but distinct. In contrast with H.ferrugineum, H.spongiosipes has a darker cap when young, darker flesh, and occurs in deciduous woods. Old fruit bodies of H.ferrugineum can be confused with those of Hydnellum concrescens.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or butterscotch when dried. Another lookalike is Lactarius thiersii, {{but it has a}} smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. The flesh and latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly <b>acrid</b> taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} a hot to very <b>acrid</b> taste {{and can cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms. Despite this, such species are eaten in some regions, e.g. Lactarius torminosus in Finland or Russia. Often, they are parboiled or pickled to make them palatable, and sometimes, they are used as spice, for example Russula emetica in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly poisonous: the East Asian and North American Russula subnigricans causes rhabdomyolysis and is potentially lethal, and Lactarius turpis from Eurasia contains a mutagenic substance.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy <b>acrid</b> mucus, which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius nordmanensis was {{described}} by Alexander Smith in 1960 to account for a North American species closely resembling L.torminosus in appearance, but with a slightly larger range of spore sizes (9–11 by 6.5–8μm). In contrast to the unchanging latex of L.torminosus, L.nordmanensis has whitish latex that slowly changes to pale yellow upon exposure to air; the latex also stains mushroom tissues and paper yellow. Hesler and Smith reduced L.nordmanensis {{to the status of}} a variety under L.torminosus in 1979. Lactarius torminosus var. nordmanensis has been recorded from California, Idaho, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the United States, Quebec in Canada, and Switzerland. The variety resembles Lactarius pubescens var. betulae, but differs in its longer pleurocystidia, larger spores with slightly different spore ornamentation, and strongly burning <b>acrid</b> taste. The holotype specimen of L.torminosus var. nordmanensis was collected by Smith in 1956 near Nordman, Idaho.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus (commonly {{known as}} the grey milkcap) is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae, first {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries. It produces moderately sized and brittle mushrooms, which grow {{on the forest floor}} or on rotting wood. The flattened-convex cap can vary in shape, sometimes forming the shape of a wide funnel. It is typically grey, but the colour varies. The species has crowded, light-coloured gills, which produce white milk. The spore print is typically whitish, but also varies considerably. The mushrooms typically have a strong, <b>acrid</b> taste and have been described as inedible, but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling. L.vietus feeds by forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with surrounding trees, and it favours birch. It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe, North America and eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius xanthogalactus {{has nearly}} {{identical}} microscopic features to L.vinaceorufescens, but macroscopically, {{it does not}} have the reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem of L.vinaceorufescens, and it grows on the ground under oak. Another lookalike is L.colorascens, but it may be distinguished from L.vinaceorufescens by several features: a smaller fruit body; a whitish cap that becomes brownish red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown; bitter to faintly <b>acrid</b> latex; and slightly smaller spores. L.chrysorrheus is also similar, but it has a whitish to pale yellowish-cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown.|$|E
5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an <b>acrid,</b> corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The subalpine waxy cap (Hygrophorus subalpinus) is {{somewhat}} similar in appearance to R.brevipes but lacks its brittle flesh, {{and it has}} a sticky, glutinous cap. The Pacific Northwest species Russula cascadensis also resembles R.brevipes, but has an <b>acrid</b> taste and smaller fruit bodies. Another lookalike, R.vesicatoria, has gills that often fork near the stipe attachment. R.angustispora is quite similar to R.brevipes, but has narrower spores measuring 6.5–8.5 by 4.5–5µm, and it does not have the pale greenish band that sometimes develops in the latter species. The European look-alike R.delica is widely distributed, although rarer in the northern regions of the continent. Similar to R.brevipes in overall morphology, it has somewhat larger spores (9–12 by 7–8.5µm) with a surface ornamentation featuring prominent warts interconnected by a zebra-like patterns of ridges. The milk-cap mushroom Lactifluus piperatus can be distinguished from R.brevipes by the production of latex when the mushroom tissue is cut or injured.|$|E

25|$|The {{taste of}} {{potassium}} cyanide {{has been described}} as <b>acrid</b> with a burning sensation.|$|E
25|$|Phenolic resin {{products}} may swell slightly {{under conditions of}} extreme humidity or perpetual dampness. When rubbed or burnt, Bakelite has a distinctive, <b>acrid,</b> sickly-sweet or fishy odor.|$|E
25|$|Species: Elutherococcus senticosus. Pinyin: Ci Wu Jia. Common Name: Siberian Ginseng. Quality: Pungent (<b>Acrid),</b> Slightly bitter, Warm. Meridians: Spleen, Heart, Kidney. Actions: Tonifies spleen and kidney, mildly tonifies heart qi, {{promotes}} blood circulation, calms shen.|$|E

25|$|Private {{burning of}} dry cellulosic/paper {{products}} is generally clean-burning, producing no visible smoke, but plastics in household waste can cause private burning {{to create a}} public nuisance, generating <b>acrid</b> odors and fumes that make eyes burn and water. Most urban communities ban burn barrels, and certain rural communities may have prohibitions on open burning, especially those home to many residents not familiar with this common rural practice.|$|E
25|$|Sebaceous gland {{activity}} (which is {{triggered by}} androgens) lessens, reducing oil production {{on the skin}} and scalp. Consequently, the skin becomes less prone to acne. It also becomes drier, and lotions or oils may be necessary. The pores become smaller because of the lower quantities of oil being produced. Many apocrine glands – a type of sweat gland – become inactive, and body odor decreases. Remaining body odor becomes less metallic, sharp, or <b>acrid,</b> and more sweet and musky.|$|E
25|$|The corms, {{which have}} a light purple color due to {{phenolic}} pigments, are roasted, baked or boiled, and the natural sugars give a sweet nutty flavor. The starch is easily digestible, and since the grains are fine and small it is often used for baby food. Young taro leaves and stems can be eaten after boiling twice to remove the <b>acrid</b> flavor and the leaves are {{a good source of}} vitamins A and C and contain more protein than the corms.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of {{the trade}} argue that {{developing}} countries utilize methods that are more harmful and more wasteful. An expedient and prevalent method is simply to toss equipment onto an open fire, in order to melt plastics and to burn away non-valuable metals. This releases carcinogens and neurotoxins into the air, contributing to an <b>acrid,</b> lingering smog. These noxious fumes include dioxins and furans. Bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into drainage ditches or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies.|$|E
25|$|Certainly, {{there are}} a number of stories {{sloshing}} around the news now that have raised discussions of Israel and of the posture of American Jews to an <b>acrid</b> level. The purveyor of anthrax may have been a former government scientist, Jewish, with a record of baiting a colleague of Arab origins, and with the intent to blame the anthrax on Muslim terrorists. Rocketing around the web and spilling into the press are many stories about Israeli spies in America at the time of 9/11. On various accounts, they were trailing Mohamed Atta and his associates, knew what was going to happen but did nothing about it, or were simply spying on US facilities.|$|E
25|$|L. glyciosmus is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} agaric, which typically has a convex cap measuring between 2 and 5.5 centimetres, with a small central depression developing with age. Sometimes there is a central pimple, and the cap is typically coloured a greyish lilac, sometimes varying to a pale buff. It is thin fleshed, with an incurved margin in younger specimens. The stem measures between 25 and 65 millimetres in height, with a width between 4 and 12 millimetres. The cylindrical stem is typically widest at the bottom becoming narrower towards the top, or sometimes club shaped. The stem is concolorous with the cap, but sometimes is a little paler or with a yellowish hue. The stem is particularly soft and easily broken, and can become hollow. The flesh is buff. The gills are decurrent and crowded, and vary in colour from a pale yellowish to a pale flesh, turning to a greyish lilac with age. The milk is white with an initially mild, later hot and <b>acrid</b> taste. The mushroom has a strong smell of coconuts.|$|E
25|$|Acrolein is a {{pyrolysis}} {{product that is}} abundant in cigarette smoke. It gives smoke an <b>acrid</b> smell and an irritating, lachrymatory effect and is {{a major contributor to}} its carcinogenicity. Like PAH metabolites, acrolein is also an electrophilic alkylating agent and permanently binds to the DNA base guanine, by a conjugate addition followed by cyclization into a hemiaminal. The acrolein-guanine adduct induces mutations during DNA copying and thus causes cancers {{in a manner similar to}} PAHs. However, acrolein is 1000 times more abundant than PAHs in cigarette smoke and is able to react as is, without metabolic activation. Acrolein has been shown to be a mutagen and carcinogen in human cells. The carcinogenicity of acrolein has been difficult to study by animal experimentation, because it has such a toxicity that it tends to kill the animals before they develop cancer. Generally, compounds able to react by conjugate addition as electrophiles (so-called Michael acceptors after Michael reaction) are toxic and carcinogenic, because they can permanently alkylate DNA, similarly to mustard gas or aflatoxin. Acrolein is only one of them present in cigarette smoke; for example, crotonaldehyde has been found in cigarette smoke. Michael acceptors also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in tobacco disease.|$|E
500|$|Lactarius argillaceifolius var. dissimilis, {{a variety}} {{reported}} from South Carolina, is nearly identical in appearance, {{but it has}} white latex that tastes bitter then <b>acrid.</b> The structure of the cap cuticle differs from the nominate variety in that it has dextrinoid (staining yellowish or reddish brown with Meltzer's reagent) incrustations on the hyphae. The variety megacarpus has a larger cap (up to [...] wide with flesh that is up to [...] thick), and white and unchanging latex with an <b>acrid</b> taste. Its stem measures [...] long by [...] wide near the top. Microscopically, the spores of var. megacarpus are more reticulate than the nominate variety.|$|E
500|$|Panellus stipticus is {{considered}} {{too small and}} bitter to be edible. Its taste {{has been described as}} acidic, <b>acrid,</b> or astringent. One 1992 study reported that the taste of the fruit bodies varies across the geographic range of the species. Those from eastern North America have a mildly <b>acrid</b> taste that takes time to develop, and cause uncomfortable drying in the mouth. In contrast, specimens from Japan, New Zealand, and Russia produce no sensation in the mouth, but cause significant constriction and a nauseating taste in the throat. The fruit bodies are reputed to have been used in traditional Chinese medicine as a styptic to staunch bleeding, and also as a [...] "violent purgative".|$|E
500|$|Allegro. In Copland's {{view this}} is, with the third, the most approachable of the Préludes, [...] "with its dry, <b>acrid</b> {{brilliance}} (so rarely found in Faure)." [...] Morrison {{describes it as}} [...] "a repeated-note scherzo" [...] going [...] "from nowhere to nowhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, {{and nearly}} equal in width {{throughout}} or tapering downward. Its surface may be slimy or dry, {{depending on the}} moisture in the environment. It is whitish, but in age becomes spotted with brownish stains. The flesh is firm, and white to buff. Its odor is not distinctive, while its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly <b>acrid.</b> The latex is creamy-white on initial exposure, and stains the gills grayish-brown to dark brown or olive-brown; its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly <b>acrid.</b> Older fruit bodies tend to have less abundant and weaker-tasting latex. The spore print is pinkish-buff. The edibility of L.argillaceifolius is unknown. The cap surface will turn yellow to orange when a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide is applied.|$|E
500|$|The stem is [...] {{long and}} [...] thick, nearly equal in width {{throughout}} or tapered downward, dry, hard, coarsely pitted, and whitish to cream yellowish. It is initially solid, then becomes hollow with age. The flesh is thick, hard, whitish, and slowly stains pale yellow after the mushroom {{has been cut}} open. It has no distinctive odor, while the taste is immediately [...] The latex is sparse, white on exposure to air, and unchanging or very slowly changing color to yellow. It stains cut flesh yellow, and tastes <b>acrid.</b> According to mycologist David Arora, the oak-loving central and southern Californian population of this species has a more latent <b>acrid</b> taste. The spore print may range slightly in color: thin deposits are white, thick deposits are more yellow. The mushroom is considered inedible because of the intensely peppery taste.|$|E
500|$|Novice {{mushroom}} hunters may mistake L.alnicola for the edible species Cantharellus cibarius, {{a choice}} edible species [...] {{that has a}} vase-shaped fruit body with strongly decurrent gills. Other similar Lactarius species include [...] L.zonarius, L.payettensis, L.yazooensis, L.olympianus, and L.psammicola f. glaber. L.olympianus also associates with conifers, and has a pale yellow-ochre, frequently zonate cap, but may be distinguished by its stem, which is usually covered with spots. L.payettensis has a roughened, not smooth, cap margin. L.yazooensis has a zonate cap and extremely <b>acrid</b> flesh. Its gills change color from pale vinaceous [...] to light pinkish-brown in maturity. L.psammicola f. glaber has a pinkish-buff spore print. Mature fruit bodies of L.scrobiculatus var. montanus have been confused with L.alnicola. Its fruit bodies feature a smooth cap margin, <b>acrid</b> taste, white latex which slowly (over several minutes) turns yellow on exposure or stains the flesh yellow, and do not turn [...] "clay color" [...] when bruised.|$|E
500|$|Caps can be dull to very colourful, {{the latter}} {{especially}} in Russula; their size ranges from 17mm diameter {{or less in}} Russula campinensis to [...] in Lactifluus vellereus. Concentrically ringed (zonate) caps occur in all Multifurca and several Lactarius species. Laterally stiped (pleurotoid) fruitbodies exist in some, mainly tropical Lactifluus and Russula species. Taste is a distinguishing characteristic in many species, from mild to very <b>acrid.</b> A conspicuous feature of the [...] "milk-caps" [...] in Lactarius, Lactifluus, and Multifurca furcata is the latex or [...] "milk" [...] their fruitbodies exude when bruised.|$|E
500|$|Inocybe godeyi flesh has {{a strong}} smell, which has been {{variously}} described as [...] "unpleasant", [...] "earthy or mealy", and [...] "not distinctive". The flesh has an <b>acrid</b> taste. The mushrooms {{are known to be}} poisonous, containing toxic compounds of muscarine. Consumption of the mushroom could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
500|$|In {{conditions}} of high humidity, several species can form striking colored drops on the actively growing caps: red drops in H.peckii, H.diabolus, H.ferrugineum, and H.cruentum, yellow drops in H.caeruleum, and coffee-colored drops in H.mirabile. The common names of H.peckii reflect its appearance: [...] "strawberries and cream" [...] and [...] "bleeding tooth fungus". Some Hydnellum species have a mealy odor (e.g. H.mirabile and H.pineticola) similar to freshly ground flour. H.zonatum smells like melilot, while H.suaveolens has a sweet odor resembling anise or peppermint. All are too tough and woody to be edible, {{and many have}} an <b>acrid</b> taste anyway.|$|E
