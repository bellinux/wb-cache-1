5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests <b>and</b> <b>very</b> wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips <b>and</b> <b>very</b> large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E

60|$|I do {{not pretend}} to {{understand}} these words. I preach on them because the Church has appointed them for this day. And most fitly. At Christmas we think of our Lord's birth. What more reasonable, than that we should go on to think of our Lord's boyhood? To think of this aright, {{even if we do}} not altogether understand it, ought to help us to understand rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ; the right faith about which is, that he was very man, of the substance of his mother. Now, if he were <b>very</b> <b>and</b> real man, he must have been also <b>very</b> <b>and</b> real babe, <b>very</b> <b>and</b> real boy, <b>very</b> <b>and</b> real youth, <b>and</b> then <b>very</b> <b>and</b> real full-grown man.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a proof-of-concept {{implementation of the}} probabilistically checkable proof of proximity (PCPP) system described by Ben-Sasson and Sudan in [BSS 05]. In particular, we implement a PCPP prover <b>and</b> <b>verier</b> for Reed-Solomon codes; the prover converts an evaluation of a polynomial on a linear set into a valid PCPP, while the verier queries the evaluation and the PCPP to check that the evaluation is close to a Reed-Solomon codeword. We prove tight bounds on the various parameters associated with the prover <b>and</b> <b>verier</b> <b>and</b> describe some interesting programmatic issues that arise during their implementation. ...|$|R

5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} very tall <b>and</b> <b>very</b> short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull {{was nearly as}} tall as it was long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so {{the front of the}} snout was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ceciliae {{was first}} {{described}} by Miles Joseph Berkeley, an English cryptogamist and clergyman, and Christopher Edmund Broome, a British mycologist, in 1854.

5|$|Before modern whaling {{began in}} the late 19th century, blue whales were obscure <b>and</b> <b>very</b> poorly understood. They, along with other large whales were mythologized and indistinguishable from sea monsters. Even after the first {{specimens}} were described, the blue whale went by many names and scientists often described their specimens as new species. Descriptions and illustrations were inaccurate. The taxonomy was eventually resolved, but many mysteries remained.|$|E

5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.

5|$|Due to Tool's {{incorporation}} {{of visual arts}} <b>and</b> <b>very</b> long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock.

5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than Dark <b>and</b> <b>Very</b> dark, which are both dark {{and have an}} intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the season}} tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, <b>and</b> <b>Very</b> Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E
