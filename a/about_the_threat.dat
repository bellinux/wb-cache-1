5|$|After the war many castles were slighted, damaged to {{put them}} beyond {{military}} use, but Parliament was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of a royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared. Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside, {{at a cost of}} £1,703 a year. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables, Beaumaris appears to have been stripped of its valuable lead and remaining resources, including the roofs.|$|E
5|$|Fears grew <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of French raids across England {{from the}} 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were {{particularly concerned about}} the potential of a French raid on the city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich {{and the experience of}} Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated by a French attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the recent events of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, concerns grew in the British government <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of German invasion along the east coast of England. The bays just to the north of Dunstanburgh Castle were vulnerable targets for an enemy amphibious landing, and efforts were made to fortify the castle and the surrounding area in 1940, as part of a wider line of defences erected by Sir Edmund Ironside.|$|E
5|$|With this pace {{of change}} {{concerns}} had begun to grow {{by the middle of}} the century <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> to medieval buildings in Britain, and in 1877 William Morris established the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. One result of public pressure was the passing of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882, but the provisions of the act focused on unoccupied prehistoric structures and medieval buildings such as castles were exempted from it leaving no legal protection.|$|E

5|$|During the 1550s, Henry II became {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of an English or Holy Roman Empire attack on Paris, and strengthened the defences of the Bastille in response. The southern gateway into the Bastille became the principal {{entrance to the}} castle in 1553, the other three gateways being closed. A bastion, a large earthwork projecting eastwards from the Bastille, was built to provide additional protective fire for the Bastille and the Arsenal; the bastion was reached from the fortress across a stone abutment using a connecting drawbridge that was installed in the Bastille's Comté tower. In 1573 the Porte Saint-Antoine was also altered – the drawbridges were replaced with a fixed bridge, and the medieval gatehouse was replaced with a triumphal arch.|$|E
5|$|Innocent {{gave some}} dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic {{communities}} {{were allowed to}} celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches {{appear to have been}} steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU was {{internally}} divided when it purged Communists {{from its}} leadership in 1940, and that ambivalence continued as it {{decided whether to}} defend alleged Communists during the late 1940s. Some ACLU leaders were anti-Communist, and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims. Some ACLU leaders felt that Communists were entitled to free speech protections, and the ACLU should defend them. Other ACLU leaders were uncertain <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> posed by Communists, and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes. This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation {{of most of the}} anti-Communist leaders.|$|E

5|$|The British Government and Royal Navy were {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> Tirpitz posed once she re-entered service. Allied intelligence tracked {{the progress of}} work on the battleship using decrypted German radio signals, photo reconnaissance flights and eyewitness reports from agents in Norway. It was feared the battleship could sortie and attack convoys in the Norwegian Sea or Atlantic Ocean after the repairs were completed. The need to guard against this possibility would also occupy warships needed to support the planned invasion of France. As a result, it was decided in late 1943 to make further attempts to sink the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Traveling {{towards the}} northeast, Conson headed towards Okinawa where schools {{were closed and}} local {{transportation}} was disrupted due to the storm. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned residents <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of heavy rains and high winds resulting from the storm. A United States naval base located in Okinawa was placed under a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCR) Four as Typhoon Conson was approaching. As the storm neared the islands, the naval base was put under TCCR Three, indicating that winds of 92km/h (57mph) were anticipated within 48hours. Ahead of the storm, upwards of 254mm (10in) fell across the islands, which were indirectly related to the storm. In southern Japan, several airlines canceled flights due to poor weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|While {{the storm}} was passing near Dominica, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau warned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of the {{hurricane}} which would strike the island {{within a day or}} two. The advisory was sent via telegraph to 75police districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours; this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio. Warnings were also posted for 12ports along the southern coast, causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port. Effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312, and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. By comparison, the weaker 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane killed approximately 3,000people.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{were raised}} about {{these changes in}} society. William Langland wrote the poem Piers Plowman {{in the years before}} 1380, praising peasants who {{respected}} the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages. The poet John Gower feared England might see an uprising similar to the French Jacquerie revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against their masters. There was a moral panic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters. New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy laws were more widely applied and the treason laws were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands. By the 1370s, there were fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.|$|E
5|$|On September2, the National Hurricane Center issued gale {{warnings}} and hurricane watches for Guadeloupe, Desirade, Antigua and Barbuda.

After Christine weakened to a tropical depression, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands. Schools were closed in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands as a precaution. Six scientists {{had to be}} evacuated from the small island of Aves once the storm posed a threat to them. On St. Thomas, nine emergency shelters were opened, mainly in schools. On September5, an emergency meeting was held by disaster officials in Puerto Rico <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of flooding from Christine.

Both Beamer and Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry were among the longest-tenured coaches in college {{football}} at the time. DeBerry had been a college coach for 19years, while Beamer had coached for 16 years. The game would be an opportunity for DeBerry to gain his 150th career win and defeat a ranked team {{for the first time}} since 1999. Ticket sales {{prior to the}} game were sluggish, as both teams failed to sell out their assigned allotments, and local sales registered fewer than 8,000tickets sold.
