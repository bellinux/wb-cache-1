It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong <b>acid</b> <b>solution</b> and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions.|$|E
5|$|Tin(II) chloride, {{also known}} as stannous chloride, is a white {{crystalline}} solid with the formula 2. It forms a stable dihydrate, but aqueous solutions tend to undergo hydrolysis, particularly if hot. SnCl2 is widely used as a reducing agent (in <b>acid</b> <b>solution),</b> and in electrolytic baths for tin-plating. Tin(II) chloride {{should not be confused}} with the other chloride of tin; tin(IV) chloride or stannic chloride (SnCl4).|$|E
5|$|More complex {{protactinium}} fluorides {{are also}} known such as Pa2F9 and ternary fluorides {{of the types}} MPaF6 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs or NH4), M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb, Cs or NH4) and M3PaF8 (M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs), all being white crystalline solids. The MPaF6 formula can be represented as a combination of MF and PaF5. These compounds {{can be obtained by}} evaporating a hydrofluoric <b>acid</b> <b>solution</b> containing these both complexes. For the small alkali cations like Na, the crystal structure is tetragonal, whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations K+, Rb+, Cs+ or NH4+. A similar variation was observed for the M2PaF7 fluorides, namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for Cs2PaF7 and M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb or NH4).|$|E

5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day would be on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and the engine room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic <b>acid</b> <b>solution</b> that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric <b>acid</b> <b>solution</b> into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric <b>acid</b> <b>solution.</b> This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

40|$|Formation {{of silver}} citrate/citric <b>acid</b> {{complexed}} <b>solutions</b> was investigated. Although, silver citrate is minimally soluble in water, it can successfully be dissolved in citric <b>acid</b> <b>solutions.</b> The maximum concentration of Ag(I) in solution {{is estimated at}} 23 to 25 [*]g/L if the concentration of citric acid is at least 4 [*]mol/L or higher. The dissolution of silver citrate in citric <b>acid</b> <b>solutions</b> was attributed {{to the formation of}} silver citrate complexes of a general formula [Ag 3 (C 6 H 5 O 7) n+ 1] 3 n−. The silver citrate/citric <b>acid</b> <b>solutions,</b> containing more than about 13 [*]g/L Ag+ ion, have exhibited a decrease in Ag(I) concentration in solution over time, due to crystallization.

25|$|If two {{solvents}} {{can form}} a negative azeotrope, then distillation of any mixture of those constituents {{will result in}} the residue being closer in composition to the azeotrope than the original mixture. For example, if a hydrochloric <b>acid</b> <b>solution</b> contains less than 20.2% hydrogen chloride, boiling the mixture will leave behind a solution that is richer in hydrogen chloride than the original. If the solution initially contains more than 20.2% hydrogen chloride, then boiling will leave behind a solution that is poorer in hydrogen chloride than the original. Boiling of any hydrochloric <b>acid</b> <b>solution</b> long enough will cause the solution left behind to approach the azeotropic ratio.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, the city's {{graffiti}} epidemic surged {{to levels}} never seen before; nearly every subway car was tagged with graffiti {{by the end}} of the year. It was aided by the budgetary restraints on New York City, which limited its ability to remove graffiti and perform transit maintenance.
