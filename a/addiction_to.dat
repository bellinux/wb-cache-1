5000|$|Since {{addiction}} involves abnormalities in glutamate and GABAergic neurotransmission, receptors {{associated with}} these neurotransmitters (e.g., AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and GABAB receptors) are potential therapeutic targets for addictions. [...] N-acetylcysteine, which affects metabotropic glutamate receptors and NMDA receptors, has shown some benefit in preclinical and clinical studies involving <b>addictions</b> <b>to</b> cocaine, heroin, and cannabinoids. It may also be useful as an adjunct therapy for <b>addictions</b> <b>to</b> amphetamine-type stimulants, but more clinical research is required.|$|R
5|$|Gascoigne {{developed}} an <b>addiction</b> <b>to</b> gaming machines, frequently spending {{all his money}} on them, and also began shoplifting to fund his addiction.

5|$|After a long {{discussion}} {{about how the}} episode should end, the writers decided {{that they did not}} want Barney to return to being drunk {{at the end of the}} episode.

The character's new <b>addiction</b> <b>to</b> coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.|$|E

5000|$|ΔFosB, a gene {{transcription}} factor, {{has been identified}} as playing a critical {{role in the development of}} addictive states in both behavioral addictions and drug addictions. Overexpression of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for many of the neural adaptations seen in drug addiction; it has been implicated in <b>addictions</b> <b>to</b> alcohol, cannabinoids, cocaine, nicotine, phenylcyclidine, and substituted amphetamines as well as <b>addictions</b> <b>to</b> natural rewards such as sex, exercise, and food. [...] A recent study also demonstrated a cross-sensitization between drug reward (amphetamine) and a natural reward (sex) that was mediated by ΔFosB.|$|R
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, friends were {{concerned}} about the Marquess's <b>addiction</b> <b>to</b> drugs, particularly since multiple prison sentences had done nothing to alleviate it. He was deported from Australia in April 1990 and charged with drug possession in November 1991 and March 1992. That October, his estate company was liquidated with debts over £650,000. In June 1993, he avoided a jail sentence by being ordered to attend a rehabilitation clinic, but travelled to the South of France instead and was sentenced to 10 months in an open prison, where he was released after five. He was arrested again in September 1994 for possession.|$|E
5|$|Fighters such as Bob Probert and Boogaard {{have been}} posthumously {{diagnosed}} with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative {{disease of the}} brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head. It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible <b>addiction</b> <b>to</b> painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol. His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.|$|E

5|$|Louisiana {{attempted}} {{to pass a}} law that would exempt fantasy sports from its anti-online gambling laws, but the bill was defeated as the result of lobbying by both the Louisiana Family Forum (which showed concerns that players could develop an <b>addiction</b> <b>to</b> daily fantasy games), and the Louisiana Video Gaming Association (which felt that DFS would cannibalize the legal video poker industry, and needed to be highly regulated).|$|E
5|$|On December 22, People {{magazine}} {{reported that}} Tyler had entered a rehabilitation facility to manage his <b>addiction</b> <b>to</b> painkillers, {{brought on by}} injuries to his knees, legs, and feet, that resulted from years of performing.

5|$|Richards' <b>addiction</b> <b>to</b> heroin delayed {{his arrival}} in Toronto; the other members had already arrived, waiting for him, and sent him a {{telegram}} asking him where he was.

5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks on each other, enjoying games like hide and seek, and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from a traumatic miscarriage and an <b>addiction</b> <b>to</b> laudanum; she would die of an overdose in February 1862.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Sorkin {{started using}} {{marijuana}} and cocaine. He {{has said that}} in cocaine he found a drug that gave him relief from certain nervous tensions he deals with on a regular basis. In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, {{on the advice of}} his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his <b>addiction</b> <b>to</b> cocaine. In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|E
50|$|ΔFosB, a gene {{transcription}} factor, {{has been identified}} as playing a critical {{role in the development of}} an addiction. Overexpression of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for many of the neural adaptations seen in drug addiction; it has been implicated in <b>addictions</b> <b>to</b> alcohol, cannabinoids, cocaine, nicotine, phenylcyclidine, and substituted amphetamines as well as <b>addictions</b> <b>to</b> natural rewards such as sex, exercise, and food. Moreover, reward cross-sensitization between amphetamine and sexual activity, a property in which exposure to one increases in the desire for both, has been shown to occur preclinically and clinically as a dopamine dysregulation syndrome; ΔFosB expression is required for this cross-sensitization effect, which intensifies with the level of ΔFosB expression.|$|R
50|$|Davide Sorrenti’s death {{caused the}} fashion {{industry}} to declare heroin chic improper and passé, and by summer 1997 a new healthy look was introduced on its magazine spreads. Jaime King went to rehabilitation the following year for her <b>addictions</b> <b>to</b> heroin and alcohol.|$|R
