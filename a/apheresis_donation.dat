40|$|AbstractThis study {{sought to}} compare {{demographics}} and donation motivations among plasma/platelet donors (PPDs) and whole blood donors (WBDs), in a voluntary and non-remunerated context. Motives to donate blood and demographic characteristics were collected through questionnaires completed by 795 WBDs and 473 PPDs. Comparison of WBDs and PPDs under chi-square tests showed that 17 out of 23 motivators were statistically different according to various demographic variables. These results demonstrate the existence of specific donor profiles both for WBDs and PPDs. Agencies should develop new recruitment strategies tailored to these donors, especially {{if they wish to}} convince WBDs to convert to <b>apheresis</b> <b>donation...</b>|$|E

In this study, {{we compared the}} BMD of 20 postmenopausal apheresis donors (mean donation number 115 times in up to 15 years) with that of 20 whole blood donors (for 15 years or more) aged 55 - 70. BMD in the lumbar spine was not lower in apheresis donors than in blood donors (mean ± SD 1 · 00 ± 0 · 18 vs. 0 · 92 ± 0 · 12, P = 0 · 09). In the hip, BMD was not different between the groups...|$|E
40|$|Regulations {{concerning}} {{the storage of}} transfusable plasma differ internationally. In Canada, plasma obtained from whole blood donations and frozen within 24 hours of phlebotomy (frozen plasma, FP) may be thawed and transfused within 120 hours of refrigerated storage. However, plasma frozen within 8 hours of phlebotomy following <b>apheresis</b> <b>donation</b> (FFPA) must be transfused within 24 hours of thawing and refrigeration. Our objectives were to measure coagulation factors (F) V, VII, and VIII, fibrinogen activities, and the prothrombin time (PT) in thawed refrigerated FFPA at 0, 24, and 120 hours of storage and to compare these values to those in thawed refrigerated FP. Fibrinogen activity remained unchanged over time, while mean factor levels in 28 FFPA units declined by 17 % (FV), 19. 7 % (FVII), and 54. 6 % (FVIII) over 120 hours, while PT values rose to 7. 6 %. Factor activities were significantly higher in FFPA than FP after 120 hours of refrigerated storage. Residual FVIII activities in thawed FFPA met predefined noninferiority criteria compared to thawed FP after 120 hours. These results support a change in Canadian regulations to permit transfusion of thawed FFPA made in a closed system and refrigerated for up to 120 hours, one that could reduce wastage of transfusable plasma...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Given {{the paucity}} of {{published}} data regarding reaction rates in younger teenaged donors, we evaluated the reaction rates {{in all of our}} first time teenaged donors after New York Blood Center lowered the minimum permissible age for blood donations from 17 to 16 yr in 2005. The overall rates of vaso-vagal reactions in donors aged 16 to 19, and those resulting in syncope, occurring in 72, 769 consecutive first time whole blood, 3, 822 double red cell, and 777 platelet <b>apheresis</b> <b>donations</b> were calculated. They were correlated with age and compared to those found in donors aged 20 - 29. Separate rates were calculated by gender, age in yr, and donation type, and then compared to each other. The overall reaction rate among first time teenaged whole blood donors was 8. 2 % and was significantly greater than among plateletpheresis donors (4. 0 %; p < 0. 0002). The rate in female whole blood donors (10. 0 %) was significantly higher than in males (6. 4 %; p < 0. 0002). In male double red cell donors the overall reaction rate of 3. 5 % was significantly lower than that found in male whole blood donors (p < 0. 002). Among both male and female whole blood donors a significant correlation with decreasing donor age between 19 and 16 yr was found (r 2 = 0. 981; p = 0. 01) and (r 2 = 0. 988; p = 0. 006), respectively. We conclude that teenaged donors have increased reaction rates when compared to adults and the reaction rates increase with decreasing age. In addition, females have higher reaction rates than males. Finally, reaction rates associated with <b>apheresis</b> <b>donations</b> are significantly lower than those associated with whole blood donations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUNDIn August 2016, the Food and Drug Administration advised US blood {{centers to}} screen all whole blood and <b>apheresis</b> <b>donations</b> for Zika virus (ZIKV) with an individual-donor nucleic acid test (ID-NAT) {{or to use}} {{approved}} pathogen reduction technology (PRT). The cost of implementing this guidance nationally has not been assessed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSScenarios were constructed to characterize approaches to ZIKV screening, including universal ID-NAT, risk-based seasonal allowance of minipool (MP) NAT by state, and universal MP-NAT. Data from the 2015 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS) were used to characterize the number of donations nationally and by state. For each scenario, the estimated cost per donor (322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 9 for MP-NAT, 722 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 13 for ID-NAT) was multiplied by the estimated number of relevant donations from the NBCUS.

40|$|In today’s {{blood bank}} {{environment}} several plasma products {{are available for}} transfusion. In 2006, 77. 2 % of the plasma transfused in the USA was fresh frozen plasma (FFP). 1 This product is prepared from whole blood or <b>apheresis</b> <b>donations</b> and is frozen within 8 hours of collection. 2 Once thawed, plasma contains all clotting factors at physiological levels although there is considerable variability between donors in their level of individual clotting factors. 3 However, since anti-HLA antibodies are often implicated in causing transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), 4 and because multiparous females are often sensitized to HLA antigens, 5 many donor centers are diverting the plasma component of female donations to fractionation. To make up the shortfall in plasma supply, {{there are several other}} plasma products that can be prepared. Plasma frozen within 24 hours of phlebotomy (FP 24) is an AABB/FDA approved plasma product, which as its name suggests, represents plasma that is frozen between 8 - 24 hours after collection. In 2006 it made up approximately 15 % of the transfused plasma in the USA.

40|$|Continuous {{attention}} to transfusion safety through improvement of disease screening and donor selection {{has succeeded in}} reducing the risks of transfusion transmitted disease to practically immeasurable levels. Despite this progress, surprisingly {{little is known about}} disease occurrence among blood donors and whether there are possible long-term effects of repeated whole-blood or <b>apheresis</b> <b>donation.</b> Several investigations have addressed possible inadvertent non-infectious health effects of blood transfusions per se, but to date there is no conclusive evidence regarding whether blood transfusions from donors with preclinical cancer can result in cancer development in the recipient. To address such research questions, we assembled the Scandinavian Donations and Transfusions (SCANDAT) database, containing detailed data on blood donors and their donations, with transfusions and transfusion recipients encompassing more than three decades. All studies described in this thesis were based on this database. In the first study, we describe the creation of the SCANDAT database and its contents, as well as the results from our analyses of its quality. In total, the database contains 1, 134, 290 donors with 15, 091, 280 donations, and 1, 311, 079 recipients with 11, 693, 844 recorded transfusions. Although direct evaluations of data quality were not possible, we assessed quality by various indirect methods and judged the database to be of a sufficiently high standard for epidemiological research investigations. In the second study, we compared the mortality and cancer incidence in a cohort of 1, 110, 329 blood donors to the rates in background population. The relative risks were expressed as standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Blood donors had an overall mortality 30 % lower (99 % confidence interval [CI] 29 %- 31 %) and cancer incidence 4 % lower (99 % CI 2 %- 5 %) than the background population. Furthermore, blood donors recruited in more recent years exhibited a lower relative mortality than those who started earlier. Within the cohort of blood donors from the second study, the third study was conducted using a nested case-control design. Relative risks of cancer in relation to number of donations made, or iron loss endured, was estimated with conditional logistic regression. We identified a total of 10, 866 donors who were diagnosed with a malignancy between their first recorded blood donation and study termination and selected 107, 140 individually matched controls. We found no clear association between number of donations and risk of cancer overall. The risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was increased among frequent plasma donors, the odds ratio among donors with ≥ 20 plasma donations relative to those with < 3 donations in the period from 3 - 12 years before diagnosis, was 2. 00 (95 % CI 1. 15 - 3. 46). Further, among male donors only, we found that the risk for selected cancers decreased with increasing iron loss in the period 3 - 7 years before diagnosis of the case (p< 0. 001). Of the 354, 094 transfusion recipients eligible for analysis in the fourth study, 12, 012 (3. 4 %) were exposed to blood products from donors who developed cancer within 5 years. The relative risk of cancer overall comparing recipients of blood from precancerous donors to recipients of blood from non-cancerous donors was 1. 00 (95 % CI, 0. 94 - 1. 07). We also did not find any excess risk when we considered the site and severity of the cancer in the donor, nor when we assessed site-specific cancer risks among the recipients...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{quality of}} fresh-frozen plasma is {{affected}} by different factors. Factor VIII is sensitive to blood component storage processes and storage as well as pathogen-reduction technologies. The level of fibrinogen in plasma is not affected by the collection processes but it {{is affected by}} preparation and pathogen-reduction technologies. Materials and methods. The quality of plasma from whole blood and <b>apheresis</b> <b>donations</b> harvested at different times and treated with a pathogen-reduction technique, methylene blue/light, was investigated, considering, in particular, fibrinogen and factor VIII levels and recovery. Results. The mean factor VIII level after methylene blue treatment exceeded 0. 5 IU/mL in all series. Factor VIII recovery varied between 78 % and 89 % in different series. The recovery of factor VIII was dependent on plasma source as opposed to treatment time. The interaction between the two factors was statistically significant. Mean levels of fibrinogen after methylene blue/light treatment exceeded 200 mg/dL in all arms. The level of fibrinogen after treatment correlated strongly with the level before treatment. There was a negative correlation between fibrinogen level before treatment and recovery. Pearson's correlation coefficient between factor VIII recovery and fibrinogen recovery was 0. 58. Discussion. These results show a difference in recovery of factor VIII and fibrinogen correlated with plasma source. The recovery of both factor VIII and fibrinogen was higher in whole blood plasma than in apheresis plasma. Factor VIII and fibrinogen recovery {{did not appear to}} be correlated. © SIMTI Servizi Srl...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{steadily}} increasing demands for single-donor apheresis platelet (PLT) concentrates (APCs) are {{a challenge to}} the PLT supply system. Therefore, efforts to improve plateletpheresis yield, allowing apheresis products to be split into 2 or more units, are valuable strategies. No data to demonstrate in vivo transfusion efficacy of these high-yield split-APCs are currently available, however. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The transfusion efficacy of APCs produced by two apheresis methods involving different harvest and storing procedures and varying PLT yields was investigated. Efficacy measures were the 1 -hour percent PLT recovery (PPR(1 h)) and the 1 -hour corrected count increment (CCI(1 h)). In total, 400 APCs, produced with either an Amicus device (Baxter) and stored in PLT additive solution (T-Sol; Amicus method [AM], n = 107) or a Trima device (Gambro) and stored in plasma (Trima method [TM], n = 293), were transfused to 55 children (31 girls; median age, 9. 5 years; range, 0. 2 - 18. 5 years) with thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy or aplastic anemia (median, 4 APCs per child; range, 1 - 68). RESULTS: Transfusion efficacy was significantly lower for AM-APCs than for TM-APCs (median PPR(1 h), 17 and 33 %; median CCI(1 h), 7. 9 and 15. 6, respectively; p /= 6 x 10 (11)) for AM-APCs (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Although in vitro validation of AM- and TM-APCs has been performed, only by evaluating transfusion efficacy in vivo did the AM turn out to be not suitable for high-yield thrombocytapheresis.

40|$|BACKGROUNDFew African {{countries}} separate blood donations into components; however, {{demand for}} platelets (PLTs) is increasing as regional capacity to treat causes of thrombocytopenia, including chemotherapy, increases. Namibia introduced single-donor apheresis PLT collections in 2007 to increase PLT availability while reducing exposure to multiple donors via pooling. This study describes the impact this transition had on PLT availability and safety in Namibia. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSAnnual national blood collections and PLT units issued data were extracted from a database {{maintained by the}} Blood Transfusion Service of Namibia (NAMBTS). Production costs and unit prices were analyzed. RESULTSIn 2006, NAMBTS issued 771 single and pooled PLT doses from 3054 whole blood (WB) donations (drawn from 18, 422 WB donations). In 2007, NAMBTS issued 486 single and pooled PLT doses from 1477 WB donations (drawn from 18, 309 WB donations) and 131 single-donor PLT doses. By 2011, NAMBTS issued 837 single-donor PLT doses per year, 99. 1 % of all PLT units. Of 5761 WB donations from which PLTs were made in 2006 to 2011, a total of 20 (0. 35 %) were from donors with confirmed test results for human immunodeficiency virus or other transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs). Of 2315 single-donor <b>apheresis</b> <b>donations</b> between 2007 and 2011, none of the 663 donors had a confirmed positive result for any pathogen. As apheresis replaced WB-derived PLTs, apheresis production costs dropped by a mean of 8. 2 % per year, while pooled PLT costs increased by an annual mean of 21. 5 %. Unit prices paid for apheresis- and WB-derived PLTs increased by 9 and 7. 4 % per year on average, respectively. CONCLUSIONNamibia's PLT transition shows that collections from repeat apheresis donors can reduce TTI risk and production costs...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a cross-sectional study to elucidate {{factors contributing to}} vasovagal reaction (VVR), the most frequent side effect following whole blood and <b>apheresis</b> <b>donations.</b> Complications recorded at the collection sites after voluntary donations by the Japanese Red Cross Tokyo Blood Center (JRC), in the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years, were analyzed by both univariate analysis and the multivariate conditional logistic regression model. Of 1, 119, 716 blood donations over the full two years, complications were recorded for 13, 320 donations (1. 18 %), among which 67 % were VVR. There were 4, 303 VVR cases which had sufficient information and {{could be used for}} this study. For each VVR case, two sex- and age-matched controls (n = 8, 606) were randomly selected from the donors without complications. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), predonation blood pressure, pulse and blood test results, including total protein, albumin, and hemoglobin, were compared between the VVR group and the control group. In univariate analysis, the VVR group was significantly younger, with a lower BMI, higher blood pressure and higher blood protein and hemoglobin levels than the control group (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, blood protein and hemoglobin levels showed dose-dependent relationships with VVR incidences by the Cochran-Armitage trend test (p< 0. 01). For both sexes, after adjusting for confounders with the multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the higher than median groups for total protein (male: OR 1. 97; 95 %CI 1. 76,- 2. 21; female: OR 2. 29; 95 %CI 2. 05 - 2. 56), albumin (male: 1. 75; 1. 55 - 1. 96; female: 1. 76; 1. 57 - 1. 97) and hemoglobin (male: 1. 98; 1. 76 - 2. 22; female: 1. 62; 1. 45 - 1. 81) had statistically significant higher risk of VVR compared to the lower than median groups. These elevated serum protein and hemoglobin levels might offer new indicators to help understand VVR occurrence...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) {{mitigation}} strategies {{include the}} deferral of female donors from <b>apheresis</b> platelet (PLT) <b>donations</b> {{and the distribution}} of plasma for transfusion from male donors only. We studied the implications of these policies in terms of component loss at six blood centers in the United States. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We collected data from allogeneic blood donors making whole blood and blood component donations during calendar years 2006 through 2008. We analyzed the distribution of donations in terms of the sex, transfusion and pregnancy histories, and blood type. RESULTS: A TRALI mitigation policy that would not allow plasma from female whole blood donors to be prepared into transfusable plasma components would result in nearly a 50 % reduction in the units of whole blood available for plasma manufacturing and would decrease the number of type AB plasma units that could be made from whole blood donations by the same amount. Deferral of all female apheresis PLT donors, all female apheresis PLT donors with histories of prior pregnancies, or all female apheresis PLT donors with histories of prior pregnancies and positive screening test results for antibodies to human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) will result in a loss of 37. 1, 22. 5, and 5. 4 % of all <b>apheresis</b> PLT <b>donations,</b> respectively. CONCLUSION: A TRALI mitigation policy that only defers female apheresis PLT donors with previous pregnancies and HLAs would result in an approximately 5 % decrease in the inventory of apheresis PLTs, but would eliminate a large proportion of components that are associated with TRALI. © 2010 American Association of Blood Banks...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} {{contains}} {{the data collected}} in 2007, pursuant to Section 21 German Transfusion Act, and {{an analysis of the}} supply situation over the past 8 years. As in previous years, all blood donation centres located in Germany transmitted data on the collection, manufacture, import and export of blood components for transfusion. According to these data, a total of 6. 7 million blood collections were performed in 2007. With 4. 7 million, the portion of whole blood donations was at the level of previous years, whereas the number of <b>apheresis</b> <b>donations</b> rose again, to 1. 9 million. The portion of autologous blood collections accounts for only 1. 1 % and thus continues to decline. Since 2003, the number of red blood cell concentrates prepared has been a constant 4. 5 million transfusion units. The decay of red blood cell concentrates on the user side in 2000 accounted for 5 % while in 2007 it was just above 3 %, referred to the total quantity of data reported as transfused and decayed. The manufacture of platelet concentrates rose from 366, 000 to 480, 000 transfusion units between 2003 and 2007. The production of therapeutic single plasmas, too, markedly increased in 2007 (to 1. 2 million transfusion units). In 2007, 2. 2 million I of plasma for fractionation were collected in Germany. In addition, 1. 0 million I were imported, and 1. 8 million I were exported. The quantity available in Germany from a pure arithmetic point of view of 1. 4 million I was almost entirely allocated to basic fractionation so that a sufficient plasma supply can be assumed. Due to the fact that manufacturing capacities are still lacking in Germany, recombinant factors need to be imported in their entirety. Since 2003, Germany has by far been the leader in Europe with more than 20 I of fractionation plasma collected per 1, 000 inhabitants. Furthermore, regarding the manufacturing figures of red blood cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, and therapeutic single plasma, Germany is in the top third for all these products compared with other European countries. The manufacture of allogeneic stem cell products for haematopoietic reconstitution, obtained by apheresis, has continuously risen to 4, 700. A large portion of this (1, 810 transplants) could be exported while only a small number (179 preparations) had to be imported. The manufacture of autologous stem cell preparations from cord blood has risen drastically to more than 10, 000 in 2007. The interest in the figures collected in compliance with Section 21, German Transfusion Act remains high both in Germany and at an international level. Meanwhile reliable data are available...|$|R
40|$|Hypocalcemic {{toxicity}}, {{because of}} return of citrate anion to the donor, {{is the major}} toxicity of <b>apheresis</b> platelet <b>donation.</b> Oral calcium carbonate, given prophylactically {{at the start of}} donation, has shown limited ability to alleviate this toxicity. We examined whether repeated prophylactic doses of calcium carbonate, or of a liquid preparation containing calcium citrate, calcium phosphate, and vitamin D 3, would be more effective at preventing symptoms of hypocalcemic toxicity. Symptoms were reported by 48 % of donors who received no prophylaxis and 60 % of donors who received 1000 mg of oral calcium carbonate at the start of, and every 20 minutes during, donation (P = 0. 711). Only 19. 2 % of donors who received the liquid preparation (1000 mg calcium, 1000 IU vitamin D 3) reported symptoms (P = 0. 040 versus no prophylaxis, P = 0. 039 versus calcium carbonate). This difference was not because of gender, weight, age, or blood volume of the donor. Neither calcium preparation prevented a measurable fall in plasma ionized calcium during donation.

The current study investigated whether the repetitive stimulation of the hematopoietic system caused by regular whole blood (WB) and PLT donations would affect PBL TEL. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PBLs were obtained from healthy donors (n= 94) with a history of at least 3 years of WB donation (median, 7. 7 years; range, 3. 0 - 43. 0 years) plus additional <b>apheresis</b> PLT <b>donations.</b> The median (range) numbers of WB and PLT donations were 22. 0 (6. 0 - 194. 0) and 42. 0 (7. 0 - 336. 0), respectively. Additionally, samples were obtained from healthy nondonors (n= 47). PBL TEL was measured with fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry (flow-FISH). Flow-FISH results were expressed in molecular equivalents of soluble fluorochrome units (MESF; 1000 MESF= 1 kMESF) either as absolute (TEL) or as age-adjusted TEL (DeltaTEL). RESULTS: Donor granulocyte and lymphocyte TELs were 12. 6 +/- 0. 3 (mean +/- SEM) and 13. 2 +/- 0. 3 kMESF, respectively. No differences were observed when compared with corresponding nondonor data (granulocytes, 12. 5 +/- 0. 4 kMESF; lymphocytes, 13. 6 +/- 0. 5 kMESF). Furthermore, DeltaTEL values did not differ between the two groups and were not different from previously established reference values. In addition, neither donor data for age-adjusted TEL for granulocytes nor DeltaTEL for lymphocytes were correlated with either total years or total numbers of WB and/or PLT donations. CONCLUSION: Long-term WB and PLT donation does not affect PBW TEL as measured by flow-FISH, arguing against a significantly increased stem cell turnover...|$|R
40|$|Background: Blood Fee Reimbursement Policy (BFRP) in Guangzhou was {{implemented}} in 2004, where costs of blood use could be reimbursed from the Guangzhou Blood Center based on blood donation history. Required volume for donors {{and their family}} including spouse and lineal relatives being beneficiaries of BFRP in Guangzhou is 600 ml/donor for whole blood donation or 1 U/ donor for <b>apheresis</b> platelets <b>donation.</b> Objective: To study influence of BFRP in Guangzhou and donors’ socio-demographics on voluntary blood donation. Design: Cross-sectional study. Data: 1, 113, 608 donors from 2009 - 2014 were included for descriptive statistics and six random samples with 40, 000 eligible donors in each sample were used for regression analysis. Main outcomes: Total volume of blood products donated per donor, frequency of donations per donor and volume per donation. Results: 1 % Whole blood donors (Odds ratio (OR) : 5. 72, 95 % CI: 4. 06 - 8. 05) and 9 % apheresis platelets donors (OR: 1. 29, 95 % CI: 1. 19 - 1. 39) who had received blood fee reimbursement had higher odds to donate more than 600 ml/donor and 1 U/ donor respectively. Besides, 1 % whole blood donors who had received blood fee reimbursement had higher frequency to donate blood (OR: 1. 57, 95 % CI: 1. 47 - 1. 68) and higher odds to choose 400 ml/donation (OR: 1. 78, 95 % CI: 1. 36 - 2. 34). However, 3 % apheresis platelets donors who had received blood fee reimbursement had lower frequency to donate blood (OR: 0. 75, 95 % CI: 0. 63 - 0. 9) and lower odds to choose 2 U/donation (OR: 0. 70, 95 % CI: 0. 62 - 0. 79). Male donors had higher odds to donate more than 600 ml/donor (OR: 1. 25, 95 % CI: 1. 17 - 1. 34) and 1 U/ donor (OR: 1. 39, 95 % CI: 1. 33 - 1. 45), as well as higher frequency to donate whole blood (OR: 1. 03, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 05) and apheresis platelets (OR: 1. 31, 95 % CI: 1. 25 - 1. 38) and higher odds to choose 400 ml/donation (OR: 1. 70, 95 % CI: 1. 63 - 1. 78) and 2 U/donation (OR: 1. 79, 95 % CI: 1. 71 - 1. 838). Older donors were associated with higher odds to donate more than 600 ml/donor but lower odds to donate more than 1 U/donor, as well as higher frequency to donate whole blood and apheresis platelets and higher odds to choose 2 U/donation. Donors in junior college group had lower frequency (OR: 0. 74, 95 % CI: 0. 63 - 0. 87) to donate apheresis platelets but higher odds (OR: 1. 24, 95 % CI: 1. 07 - 1. 45) to choose 400 ml/donation. Besides, donors had lower frequency to donate whole blood in senior high school group (OR: 0. 92, 95 % CI: 0. 85 - 0. 99) and below high school group (OR: 0. 87, 95 % CI: 0. 8 - 0. 95) while higher odds to choose 400 ml/donation in senior high school group (OR: 1. 83, 95 % CI: 1. 56 - 2. 13) and below high school group (OR: 2. 06, 95 % CI: 1. 73 - 2. 45). Certain occupation groups including medical service, worker and peasant were associated with higher odds to donate more than 600 ml/donor, as well as higher frequency to donate blood and higher odds to choose 400 ml/donation. Conclusion: The findings suggested that BFRP in Guangzhou had limited impact to blood supply. Thus any changes to this policy might not affect volume and frequency of blood products donated substantially. More effort could be done on recruiting more female donors and retaining male donors and donors aged 18 - 25 in Guangzhou. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
