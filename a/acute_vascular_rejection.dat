40|$|Activation of endothelial {{cells and}} {{platelet}} sequestration play major roles in rejection of xenografts. The histopathology of both hyperacute and <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> or delayed <b>rejection</b> of vascularized discordant xenografts {{is characterized by}} interstitial hemorrhage and intravascular thrombosis. Agents that prevent platelet activation and consequent microthrombus formation have proven beneficial in xenograft rejection but do not fully preclude vascular thrombosis. Recently, several new anti-platelet therapies have undergone extensive clinical testing for atherosclerotic thrombotic vascular disorders; other putative therapies are undergoing pre-clinical evaluation. We have investigated the effect of several of these novel agents on platelet aggregation in baboons in order to screen for future potential in xenograft rejection models...|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} delayed xenoactive {{rejection}}, {{this type of}} rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if hyperacute rejection is prevented. The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood. <b>Acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly macrophages and natural killer cells (with small numbers of T cells), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.|$|E
50|$|If hyperacute and <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> are avoided {{accommodation}} is possible, {{which is}} {{the survival of the}} xenograft despite the presence of circulating XNAs. The graft is given a break from humoral rejection when the complement cascade is interrupted, circulating antibodies are removed, or their function is changed, or there is a change in the expression of surface antigens on the graft. This allows the xenograft to up-regulate and express protective genes, which aid in resistance to injury, such as heme oxygenase-1 (an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme).|$|E

40|$|Following renal transplantation, {{immunosuppression}} {{is usually}} increased to treat presumed rejection episodes. However, a) many conditions mimic rejection in the post-transplant period, and b) many rejection episodes are irreversible. As increased immunosuppressive therapy {{is associated with}} an increased risk of infection, it would be ideal to limit antirejection therapy to only the rejection episodes that are reversible. The role of percutaneous allograft biopsy was studied as an aid to decide which patients to treat for rejection, to limit unnecessary immunosuppression and to predict allograft survival. One hundred thirty-five patients with suspected rejection underwent 206 allograft biopsies without complication. Two hundred four biopsies were available for study. Biopsies were coded on a 1 - 4 scale (minimal, mild, moderate, severe) for acute and chronic tubulointerstitial infiltrate and <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection,</b> as well as no rejection (e. g., recurrence of original disease). Treatment decisions were {{made on the basis of}} the biopsy combined with clinical data. All patients have been followed two years and outcome correlated with biopsy findings (death, nephrectomy, and return to dialysis defined as kidney loss). The results were the following: 1) biopsies represented changes within the kidney. Of 16 kidneys removed within one month of biopsy, no nephrectomy specimen showed less rejection than that seen on biopsy. 2) Eighty-one biopsies (39. 7 %) led to tapering or not increasing immunosuppression (either no rejection, minimal rejection, or irreversible changes). 3) Kidneys having either severe <b>acute</b> or chronic <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (less than 30 % function at three months) had significantly (p less than 0. 05) decreased survival three to 24 months postbiopsy than those with minimal or mild <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> or tubulointerstitial infiltrate (83 % function at three months). 4) Kidneys with moderate chronic <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> and those with severe acute tubulointerstitial infiltrate had significantly (p less than 0. 05) decreased survival at six to 24 months. 5) Kidneys with moderate chronic <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (MCV) without an acute infiltrate (ATI) had significantly better survival than those having both MCV and ATI. 6) Similarly, kidneys having severe ATI alone had better survival than those with ATI plus <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> It was concluded that a) percutaneous allograft biopsy can be done without graft loss or infection; b) biopsy represents changes throughout the kidney; c) biopsy aids in deciding when to treat for rejection and in deciding when to withhold increased immunosuppression, and d) allograft biopsy predicts the outcome of treatment of a rejection episode...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{challenges}} in human allogenic organ transplantation. The aim of the treatment is the elimination of circulating de novo donor specific antibodies (DSA). The extracorporeal elimination of DSA with immunoadsorption is a specific and efficient treatment option. We report about our results with immunoadsorption for patients with <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> after renal transplantation. Material and Methods: We retrospectively analysed the results of immunoadsorption in our transplantation centre. 365 renal transplantation were performed in Rostock centre between 2002 and 2009. In all cases of <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (n= 16), patients were treated with immunoadsorption. Extracorporeal elimination of antibodies was carried out with Ig TheraSorb® columns (Miltenyi, Germany). Results: Overall 89 sessions of immunoadsorption were performed in the 16 patients. The individual number of sessions ranged from 2 to 9 per patient (mean 5. 6). 12 / 16 patients showed improved graft function with a decrease of serum creatinine > 50 % (responders). The remaining 4 patients had only a marginal improvement of graft function (non-responders). The graft survival rate was significantly better in the responder group compared to non-responders. All grafts of the responder group except one show stable function (maximum follow up 60 months). There were no relevant side effects of the treatment.

40|$|Chronic {{allograft}} nephropathy: An update. Chronic allograft nephropathy is {{the most}} prevalent cause of renal transplant failure in the first post-transplant decade, but its pathogenesis has remained elusive. Clinically, it {{is characterized by a}} slow but variable loss of function, often in combination with proteinuria and hypertension. The histopathology is also not specific, but transplant glomerulopathy and multilayering of the peritubular capillaries are highly characteristic. Several risk factors have been identified, such as advanced donor age, delayed graft function, repeated <b>acute</b> <b>rejection</b> episodes, <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> episodes, and rejections that occur late after transplantation. A common feature of chronic allograft nephropathy is that it develops in grafts that have undergone previous damage, although the mechanism(s) responsible for the progressive fibrosis and tissue remodeling has not yet been defined. Hypotheses to explain chronic allograft nephropathy include the immunolymphatic theory, the cytokine excess theory, the loss of supporting architecture theory, and the premature senescence theory. The most effective option to prevent chronic allograft nephropathy is to avoid graft injury from both immune and nonimmune mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Preformed and {{elicited}} Ab’s {{against the}} Galα 1, 3 Gal terminating carbohydrate chains (αGal Ab’s) {{are the primary}} cause of hyperacute and <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> xenograft <b>rejection</b> in pig-to-primate transplantation. αGal Ab’s are produced by long-lived Ab-producing cells that are not susceptible to pharmacological immunosuppression. We reasoned that antigen-specific elimination of αGal Ab’s might be achieved in vivo by systemic administration of nonimmunogenic polyvalent αGal structures with high avidity for αGal Ab’s. We devised GAS 914, a soluble trisaccharide-polylysine conjugate of approximately 500 kDa that effectively competes for αGal binding by αGal IgM (IC 50, 43 nM) and IgG (IC 50, 28 nM) in vitro. Injections of GAS 914 in cynomolgus monkeys, at the dose of 1 mg/kg, resulted in the immediate decrease of more than 90 % of circulating αGal Ab’s and serum anti-pig cytotoxicity. In baboons, repeated injections of GAS 914 effectively reduced both circulating αGal Ab’s and cytotoxicity over several months. Studies with [14 C]GAS 914 in rhesus monkeys and Gal–/– mice indicate that GAS 914 binds to circulating αGal Ab’s and that the complex is quickly metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidney. Remarkably, posttreatment αGal Ab titers never exceeded pretreatment levels and no sensitization to either αGal or the polylysine backbone has been observed. Furthermore there was no apparent acute or chronic toxicity associated with GAS 914 treatment in primates. We conclude that GAS 914 may be used therapeutically for the specific removal of αGal Ab’s...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: One major {{barrier to}} {{successful}} xenotransplantation is <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection,</b> a process pathologically characterized by microvascular thrombosis and diffuse fibrin deposition in transplant blood vessels. This pathologic picture {{may result from}} a disturbance in the coagulant or fibrinolytic pathways that regulate normal vascular patency. This study evaluated the regulation of fibrinolytic activity defined by tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 as it may exist {{in the setting of}} <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS, RESULTS: Serial biopsies from cardiac xenotransplants evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated progressive decreases in tissue plasminogen activator and increases in plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1. In vitro studies measuring fibrinolytic activity of cell culture medium from porcine aortic endothelial cells stimulated with human serum or autologous porcine serum revealed that human serum triggered as much as 93 % increase in antifibrinolytic activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that porcine vascular endothelial cells change toward an antifibrinolytic state following stimulation with human xenoreactive antibodies and complement. The shift is at least partly explained by an increased ratio of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 to tissue plasminogen activator, and is at least in part mediated by the activation of complement. This increased antifibrinolytic activity may contribute to the thrombotic diathesis seen in <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> in pig-to-primate xenografts...|$|E

In a retrospective study of 42 pediatric and 77 adult subjects with primary FSGS, transplanted from 1990 to 2007 at a single center, we analyzed the degree of donor/recipient HLA compatibility and other clinical variables associated with FSGS recurrence. There were total of 131 allografts for primary FSGS (11 subjects were transplanted twice, and 1 had a third allograft) with 20 cases of FSGS recurrence (17 children) in the primary allograft, and two children who had FSGS recurrence in the second allograft.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: In this study, we {{describe}} {{the development of a}} nonallogeneic animal model of obliterative bronchiolitis–like lesions. Furthermore, we examined whether chronic rejection alone can lead to the development of obliterative bronchiolitis or whether additional nonspecific airway inflammation is required. Methods: Part I: Rats were intratracheally injected with 0. 2 ml of activated charcoal or sorbitol solution (carrier for charcoal control). Animals were put to death beginning at 2 weeks up to 20 weeks. Part II: Animals were divided into three groups: group I, underimmunosuppressed Brown Norway to Lewis lung allografts; group II, charcoal-treated underimmunosuppressed allografts; and group III, charcoal-treated rats. Animals were put to death at 3 months after transplantation. Results: Part I: In charcoal-laden bronchioles, subacute nonspecific airway inflammation was detected at 2 weeks. Slow, subclinical fibroproliferation ensued during the following weeks. Obliterative bronchiolitis–like lesions were observed in 80 % of charcoal-treated animals at 12 weeks. Part II: Allografts developed extensive vascular lesions consistent with <b>acute</b> and chronic <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> Obliterative bronchiolitis–like lesions were scarcely detected. Charcoal-treated allografts demonstrated evidence of diffuse and severe obliterative bronchiolitis–like lesions. Conclusions: Transtracheal injection of activated charcoal into native lungs results in slowly progressive airway injury and inflammation leading to obliterative airway lesions. Inadequate immunosuppression primarily results in chronic <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> but not obliterative bronchiolitis. Underimmunosuppressed allografts subjected to nonspecific airway inflammation develop obliterative airway lesions that are more prominent than in native lungs.

40|$|Xenotransplantation holds {{promise to}} solve the ever {{increasing}} shortage of donor organs for allotransplantation. In the last 2 decades, major {{progress has been made}} in understanding the immunobiology of pig-into-(non) human primate transplantation and today we are on the threshold of the first clinical trials. Hyperacute rejection, which is mediated by pre-existing anti-alphaGal xenoreactive antibodies, can in non-human primates be overcome by complement- and/or antibody-modifying interventions. A major step forward was the development of genetically engineered pigs, either transgenic for human complement regulatory proteins or deficient in the alpha 1, 3 -galactosyltranferase enzyme. However, several other immunologic and nonimmunologic hurdles remain. <b>Acute</b> <b>vascular</b> xenograft <b>rejection</b> is mediated by humoral and cellular mechanisms. Elicited xenoreactive antibodies play a key role. In addition to providing B cell help, xenoreactive T cells may directly contribute to xenograft rejection. Long-term survival of porcine kidney- and heart xenografts in non-human primates has been obtained but required severe T and B cell immunosuppression. Induction of xenotolerance, e. g. through mixed hematopoietic chimerism, may represent the preferred approach, but although proof of principle has been delivered in rodents, induction of pig-to-non-human primate chimerism remains problematic. Finally, it is now clear that innate immune cells, in particular macrophages and natural killer cells, can mediate xenograft destruction, the determinants of which are being elucidated. Chronic xenograft rejection is not well understood, but recent studies indicate that non-immunological problems, such as incompatibilities between human procoagulant and pig anticoagulant components may play an important role.

Human kidney biopsies obtained from living kidney donors and patients with acute tubular necrosis, <b>acute</b> cellular and <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) were used. Translating results from animal studies to the clinical situation is highly important considering the upcoming clinical studies with TLR inhibitors in human renal transplantation.

In healthy human kidneys, TLR 2 is expressed on the endothelium and Bowman's capsule, while TLR 4 is expressed on the endothelium only. No tubular staining was found for both receptors in human kidneys. In contrast to human biopsies, TLR 2 and TLR 4 expression in rodents was observed on tubular epithelial cells.

40|$|RATIONALE: Endothelial {{apoptosis}} {{is increased}} {{in association with}} <b>acute</b> and chronic <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (VR) of solid allografts. Apoptotic endothelial cells (EC) release LG 3, a C-terminal fragment of perlecan of potential importance in vascular remodeling and neointima formation. OBJECTIVE: Our 2 goals were to determine whether circulating levels of LG 3 are increased in association with acute VR of renal allografts and to evaluate the impact of LG 3 on vascular remodeling. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a case-control study to compare serum LG 3 levels in human renal transplant patients with acute VR, tubulo-interstitial rejection (ATIR) and normal graft function. Aorta transplantation between fully MHC-mismatched mice in association with intravenous LG 3 injection was used to characterize the impact of LG 3 on vascular remodeling. Scratch assays evaluated the promigratory activity of LG 3 on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro. Serum LG 3 levels were significantly elevated in human renal transplant patients with acute VR (n = 16) compared to ATIR (n = 16) and normal graft function (n = 32, P = 0. 004). In patients with acute VR, graft loss was associated with elevated LG 3 levels. Increasing LG 3 serum levels in aortic allograft recipients significantly increased neointima formation. LG 3 injection fostered accumulation of 3 ̆b 1 -smooth muscle actin-positive cells and decreased the number of CD 31 positive EC. LG 3 increased the migration of VSMC through extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 / 2 -dependent pathways.

40|$|Acute humoral rejection, {{also known}} as <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection,</b> is a devastating {{condition}} of organ transplants and a major barrier to clinical application of organ xenotransplantation. Although initiation of acute humoral or vascular rejection is generally linked to the action of antibodies and complement on the graft, other factors such as ischemia, platelets, T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages have also been implicated. Central to any understanding of the pathogenesis of acute humoral rejection, and to developing means of preventing it, is to know whether these factors injure the graft independently or through one or few pathways. We addressed this question by examining early events in a severe model of vascular rejection in which guinea pig hearts transplanted heterotopically into rats treated with cobra venom factor (CVF) develop disease over 72 hours. The early steps in <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> were associated with expression {{of a set of}} inflammatory genes, which appeared to be controlled by availability of interleukin (IL) - 1. Interruption of IL- 1 signaling by IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra) averted expression of these genes and early tissue changes, including coagulation and influx of inflammatory cells. These findings suggest IL- 1 {{plays an important role in}} initiation of acute humoral rejection...|$|E

This study {{was performed to}} analyze the expression, distribution and cellular localization of CX 3 CR 1 in human renal transplant biopsies and to assess its role as potential diagnostic and prognostic marker. CX 3 CR 1 was prospectively analyzed in 174 renal graft biopsies from patients with normal morphology (n= 76), antibody-mediated acute rejection (n= 6), acute tubulointerstitial rejection (n= 27), <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (n= 31), and with acute tubulus necrosis (n= 34). Double immunofluorescence was additionally performed for CX 3 CR 1 and CD 4, CD 8, CD 20, CD 68, and CD 209 /DC-SIGN. The number of CX 3 CR 1 positive interstitial cells was significantly higher in the biopsies with acute tubulointerstitial and <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> as compared to normal renal allograft biopsies. CX 3 CR 1 positive cells were mainly CD 68 positive monocytes/macrophages and CD 209 /DC-SIGN positive dendritic cells. The percentage of the CX 3 CR 1 positive staining area was a predictor for steroid responsiveness and for worse clinical outcome 3 and 12 months after transplantation. CX 3 CR 1 positive macrophages and/or dendritic cells are significantly elevated in acute renal allograft rejection. As CX 3 CR 1 was associated with outcome parameters, {{it has to be}} further evaluated as a prognostic marker in human renal transplantation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In the pig-to-baboon model, <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> {{remains the}} main hurdle for {{successful}} long-term xenograft survival. The production of galactosyl knockout pigs could solve concomitantly {{the problem of}} hyperacute and <b>acute</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> This work studies in vitro the cell-mediated cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) and T cells after priming of baboon peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with pig antigens to evaluate whether cytotoxicity is galactosyl-dependent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PBLs from naive and primed baboons were used as effectors on primary porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) to assess cytotoxicity. Untreated or galactosidase-digested PAECs were used to evidence the role of galactosyl residues on cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Two rat-anti baboon monoclonal antibodies were tested to inhibit either T+NK cells (LO-CD 2 b) or NK cells alone (LO-CD 94). RESULTS: When using PBLs from naive animals, spontaneous lysis occurred and was inhibited by both LOCD- 2 b and LO-CD 94. In comparison, lysis of PAECs was significantly higher when baboon PBLs were first primed in vivo with pig xenoantigens. In this case, cytotoxicity was completely inhibited by LO-CD 2 b but only partially by LO-CD 94. Reduction of galactosyl residues by galactosidase digestion showed that PAEC lysis almost completely disappeared with naive baboon PBLs but not with primed baboon PBLs, thereby indicating that anti-pig T-cell response is not dependent on galactosyl residues. CONCLUSION: Galactosyl knockout pigs could solve hyperacute rejection and also prevent the activation of NK cells even after xenogeneic priming. T cells will then be the next hurdle {{for the success of}} xenografting...|$|E
40|$|Pig-to-human {{xenotransplantation}} {{might be}} an option to overcome the increasing shortage of human donor organs. However, naturally occurring antibodies in human blood against the Galα 1 → 3 Gal antigen on pig endothelial cells lead to hyperacute or, if prevented, <b>acute</b> or delayed <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> of the pig graft. The {{purpose of this study}} was therefore to evaluate synthetic oligosaccharides with terminal Galα 1 → 3 Gal to inhibit antigen-binding and cytotoxicity of anti-αGal antibodies against pig cells. Different oligosaccharides were synthesized chemically and by a combined chemico-enzymatic approach. These included monomeric di-, tri-, and pentasaccharides, a polyacrylamide-conjugate (PAA-Bdi), as well as di-, tetra-, and octamers of Galα 1 → 3 Gal. All were tested for inhibitory activity by anti-αGal ELISA and complement-dependent cytotoxicity tests. PAA-Bdi was the best inhibitor of binding as well as cytotoxicity of anti-αGal antibodies. Monomeric oligosaccharides efficiently prevented binding of anti-αGal IgG, but less well that of anti-αGal IgM, with tri- and pentasaccharides showing a better efficacy than the disaccharide. The two trisaccharides Galα 1 → 3 Galβ 1 → 4 GlcNAc and Galα 1 → 3 Galβ 1 → 3 GlcNAc were equally effective. Oligomers of Galα 1 → 3 Gal were more effective than monomers in blocking the binding of anti-αGal IgG. However, they could not block IgM binding, nor could they match the efficacy of PAA-Bdi. We conclude that oligosaccharides with terminal Galα 1 → 3 Gal, most effectively as PAA-conjugates, can prevent binding and cytotoxicity of human anti-αGal in vitro. The PAA-Bdi conjugate might be most suited for use as a Sepharose-bound immunoabsorption materia...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The {{complement}} system, {{and especially}} C 5 a, {{plays an important}} role in the pathophysiology of renal diseases and post-transplant renal injury. The two receptors for C 5 a are C 5 a receptor (C 5 aR) and C 5 a-like-receptor- 2 (C 5 L 2). Only renal C 5 aR expression has been reported, although exact localization and alterations in expression after transplantation are unknown. Materials and results: Renal C 5 aR and C 5 L 2 expression and localization were analyzed immunohistochemically. C 5 aR and C 5 L 2 expression was analyzed in human kidney biopsies obtained from living donors and patients suffering from acute tubular necrosis, <b>acute</b> cellular and <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> or IF/TA. C 5 aR was expressed in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and first part of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Under inflammatory conditions. C 5 aR was de novo expressed in proximal tubuli. C 5 L 2 was expressed in the kidney and localized to DCT 1, DCT 2 and connecting tubule. Persistent distal tubular expression of both receptors was demonstrated after renal transplantation. Conclusions: This study shows distinct renal expression patterns for C 5 aR and C 5 L 2. Our findings suggest a functional role for renal C 5 L 2 rather than being a C 5 a decoy receptor. Future studies focusing on renal C 5 a-C 5 aR interaction should take differential C 5 aR and C 5 L 2 expression into account, alongside abundant C 5 aR expression on infiltrating cells.

Patients were separated into four classifications, according to Banff 1997 criteria: <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (36 patients); <b>acute</b> cellular rejection ([ACR] 30); no rejection (194); and 974 recipients from the same era who did not undergo biopsy. Other than graft histology, the groups did not differ for known adverse prognostic factors. The mean follow-up period was 6 · 03 years (SD 4 · 7). Graft survival is presented in the table. The graft attrition rate for the ACR group was significantly higher than for the no rejection group (6 · 5 vs 3 · 8 % per year) and no biopsy groups (6 · 5 vs 2 · 8 % per year). In the group that experienced <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> in the 1 st month after transplantation, 12 (33 %) grafts were lost to the first episode. These grafts failed within 4 · 3 weeks (SD 3 · 3). Two grafts recovered marginal function and failed within the 1 st year.
