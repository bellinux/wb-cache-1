5|$|S.e.caesia, {{the most}} {{widespread}} of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except for a white throat <b>and</b> <b>cheeks.</b> The other western forms mainly differ in the exact shade of the underparts, although some southeastern forms also show a white forehead and supercilium. S.e.sinensis and S.e.formosana, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.|$|E
5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In both cases, the physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, <b>and</b> <b>cheeks.</b> The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E

5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} (Setophaga caerulescens) is a small {{passerine}} bird of the New World warbler family. Its breeding ranges {{are located}} in the interior of deciduous and mixed coniferous forests in eastern North America. Over the cooler months, it migrates to islands in the Caribbean and Central America. It is very rarely found in western Europe, where it {{is considered to be a}} non-indigenous species. The black-throated blue warbler is sexually dimorphic; the adult male has a black face <b>and</b> <b>cheeks,</b> deep blue upperparts and white underparts, while the adult female is olive-brown above and light yellow below.|$|E
5|$|The sexes differ, or are dimorphic, {{in their}} plumage, {{and have a}} similar pattern {{to that in the}} {{corresponding}} sex of house sparrow. There is some variation between the three subspecies, especially in the colouration of the underparts. Birds of the subspecies rutilans are off-white on their cheeks and the sides of their necks, and have pale grey underparts. Birds of the subspecies intensior have a pale yellow wash on their underparts <b>and</b> <b>cheeks,</b> as well as darker upperparts, while those of the subspecies cinnamomeus have a heavy yellow tinge to their underparts.|$|E
5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead <b>and</b> <b>cheeks</b> of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E

5|$|Spielberg wanted Donovan's death {{shown in}} one shot, {{so it would}} not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's {{forehead}} <b>and</b> <b>cheeks</b> that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, {{as well as a}} mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.|$|E
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat <b>and</b> <b>cheeks</b> have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E

25|$|The didgeridoo {{is played}} with {{continuously}} vibrating lips {{to produce the}} drone while using a special breathing technique called circular breathing. This requires breathing in through the nose whilst simultaneously expelling stored {{air out of the}} mouth using the tongue <b>and</b> <b>cheeks.</b> By use of this technique, a skilled player can replenish the air in their lungs, and with practice can sustain a note for as long as desired. Recordings exist of modern didgeridoo players playing continuously for more than 40 minutes; Mark Atkins on Didgeridoo Concerto (1994) plays for over 50 minutes continuously.|$|E

If the person is unconscious they may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin <b>and</b> <b>cheeks,</b> ensuring that the mouth and nose are well above the water.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Hathaway’s weight loss, Hugh Jackman also lost an extreme {{amount of weight}} for the opening scene as Jean Valjean when he is imprisoned in a labor camp. To achieve an emaciated look, Jackman committed to a minimalistic diet and intense work outs. In an interview with Epix, Jackman revealed that he went on 45 minute morning runs {{on an empty stomach}} which Hathaway later used as a weight loss tactic with Jackman's help, and he went on a 36-hour liquid fast. This allowed him to rapidly lose ten pounds and caused his eyes <b>and</b> <b>cheeks</b> to sink severely. With these efforts, Jackman was able to successfully look unrecognizable as Jean Valjean in the opening scene.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{differences}} between the [...] "pain face" [...] of mice and rats. In mice, the nose <b>and</b> <b>cheek</b> at baseline have a smooth appearance, but {{in the presence of}} pain, change to distinct bulges in both the nose <b>and</b> <b>cheek</b> regions. By contrast, in rats at baseline, the nose <b>and</b> <b>cheek</b> regions show distinct bulging, and with pain, the bridge of the nose flattens and elongates causing the whisker pads to flatten. As a consequence of these differences, the GS for rats sometimes use four FAU, i.e. Orbital Tightening, Nose/Cheek Flattening, Ear Changes and Whisker Changes. Nose/Cheek Flattening, appears to show the highest correlation with the presence of pain in the rat.|$|R

25|$|In winter, {{the coat}} is usually of a dirty-brownish grey or dirty grey colour. The hairs of the mane are light grey or white at the base, and black or dark brown at the tips. The muzzle is dark, greyish brown, brownish-grey or black, while {{the top of}} the head <b>and</b> <b>cheeks</b> are more lightly coloured. The ears are almost black. A large black spot is present on the front of the neck, and is {{separated}} from the chin by a light zone. A dark field ascends from the flanks ascending to the rear of the cheeks. The inner and outer surface of the forelegs are covered with small dark spots and transverse stripes. The flanks have four indistinct dark vertical stripes and rows of diffused spots. The outer surface of the thighs has 3–4 distinct vertical or oblique dark bands which merge into transverse stripes in the lower portion of the legs. The tip of the tail is black with white underfur.|$|E
500|$|It is {{the only}} member of its genus, and it is most closely related to {{honeyeaters}} of the genus Melithreptus. Three subspecies are recognised. At around [...] in length, the blue-faced species is large for a honeyeater. Its plumage is distinctive, with olive upperparts, white underparts, and a black head and throat with white nape <b>and</b> <b>cheeks.</b> Males and females are similar in external appearance. Adults have a blue area of bare skin {{on each side of the}} face readily distinguishing them from juveniles, which have yellow or green patches of bare skin.|$|E
500|$|Breed {{specific}} markings include large, symmetrical dark patches {{incorporating the}} ears, eyes <b>and</b> <b>cheeks,</b> {{and a dark}} cape over the dorsal part of the neck and shoulders. The face should have a white blaze extending from the poll to the muzzle. The muzzle itself should be dark. The classic Jacob face {{is often referred to}} as [...] "badger-faced", consisting of black cheeks and muzzle with a white blaze running down the front of the face. In addition to these markings, random spots may occur on the rest of the body and legs (including the carpi, hocks, and pasterns). Certain markings are common in particular lines: large muzzle markings, lack of leg markings, lack of muzzle markings, etc.|$|E
