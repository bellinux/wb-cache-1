After the ducklings are born, Mr. Mallard decides to take a trip up the river to see what the rest of it is like. Mr. and Mrs. Mallard agree to meet at the Public Garden in one week. In the meantime, Mrs. Mallard teaches the eight ducklings <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to know about being ducks, such as swimming, diving, marching along, and to avoid dangers such as {{bicycles}} and other wheeled objects.|$|E
500|$|The term honesty {{in animal}} {{communication}} is controversial because in non-technical usage it implies intent, to discriminate deception from honesty in human interactions. [...] However, biologists {{use the phrase}} [...] "honest signals" [...] in a direct, statistical sense. [...] Biological signals, like warning calls or resplendent tail feathers, are honest if they truly convey useful information to the receiver. [...] That is, the signal trait conveys to the receiver {{the presence of an}} otherwise unobservable factor. [...] Honest biological signals {{do not need to be}} perfectly informative, reducing uncertainty to zero; <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to be useful is to be correct [...] "on average", so that certain behavioural responses to the signal are advantageous, statistically, compared to the behaviour that would occur in absence of the signal. Ultimately the value of the signalled information depends on the extent to which it allows the receiver to increase its fitness. Hence, [...] "honest" [...] signals are evolutionarily stable.|$|E

2500|$|Other journalistic {{media are}} satirized as well. [...] "Homer Badman" [...] is a satire of shows like Hard Copy. David Mirkin, the show runner at the time, felt very {{strongly}} about the [...] "tabloidization of the media" [...] and {{has said that the}} episode is as current today as it was at the time and things have since gotten worse. Several gags in the episode are based on what real life shows like Hard Copy would do, such as making people look to be guilty without a trial as well as a complete invasion of privacy by setting up camp outside people's homes. The talk show [...] "Ben" [...] reflects the writers' feeling that anyone could host a talk show because <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> is a microphone and an audience. This leads to Homer using public access TV to try to clear his name. The character Birch Barlow, who hosts a conservative radio talk show in Springfield, is a take-off of American talk show host and political commentator Rush Limbaugh.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} {{of the same year}} (540), the Sassanids invaded Byzantine areas. They avoided the fortresses of Mesopotamia, heading for the easier targets of Syria and Cilicia. Bouzes was {{stationed}} at Hierapolis {{at the beginning of this}} campaign season. By mid-summer, the Sassanids had captured Sura. Bouzes left Hierapolis at the head of his best troops. He promised to return if the city came under Persian threat, but Procopius accuses Bouzes of simply vanishing, with neither the Hierapolitans or the Sassanids able to locate him. [...] "Bouzes therefore at first remained at Hierapolis, keeping his whole army with him; but when he learned what had befallen Sura, he called together the first men of the Hierapolitans and spoke as follows: [...] "Whenever men are confronted with a struggle against an assailant with whom they are evenly matched in strength, it is not at all unreasonable that they should engage in open conflict with the enemy; but for those who are by comparison much inferior to their opponents it will be more advantageous to circumvent their enemy by some kind of tricks than to array themselves openly against them and thus enter into foreseen danger. How great, now, the army of Chosroes is, you are assuredly informed. And if, with this army, he wishes to capture us by siege, and if we carry on the fight from the wall, it is probable that, while our supplies will fail us, the Persians will secure <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> from our land, where there will be no one to oppose them. And if the siege is prolonged in this way, I believe too that the fortification wall will not withstand the assaults of the enemy, for in many places it is most susceptible to attack, and thus irreparable harm will come to the Romans. But if with a portion of the army we guard the wall of the city, while the rest of us occupy the heights about the city, we shall make attacks from there at times upon the camp of our antagonists, and at times upon those who are sent out for the sake of provisions, and thus compel Chosroes to abandon the siege immediately and to make his retreat within a short time; for he will not be at all able to direct his attack without fear against the fortifications, nor to provide any of the necessities for so great an army." [...] So spoke Bouzes; and in his words he seemed to set forth the advantageous course of action, but of what was necessary he did nothing. For he chose out all that portion of the Roman army which was of marked excellence and was off. And where in the world he was, neither any of the Romans in Hierapolis, nor the hostile army was able to learn." ...|$|E
