5|$|Controversy {{has arisen}} since the {{creation}} of the awards; there have been two occasions when no award was given because no titles were judged to be odd enough, Bent has complained <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> winners chosen by the public, and the 2008 winner, The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais, proved controversial because rather than being written by its listed author, Philip M. Parker, it was instead written by a machine of Parker's invention. The most recent winner, in July 2017, was The Commuter Pig Keeper: A Comprehensive Guide to Keeping Pigs when Time is your Most Precious Commodity by Michaela Giles.|$|E
5|$|When {{he assumed}} his Senate seat in 1855, Crittenden was sixty-nine years old, the eldest {{member of that}} body. The Whig Party had {{practically}} dissolved by this time, and he joined many of his fellow Kentuckians in associating with the Know Nothing Party. Although he {{did not agree with}} all of the party's principles, he would not associate with the Democrats, the party he had spent much of his career denouncing, nor would he associate with the new Republican Party because of their stance against slavery. Despite his misgivings <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party's candidate in the 1856 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|While Hopkins was {{initially}} lauded {{for the success}} at Nassau, the failure to capture the Glasgow and crew complaints <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captains led {{to a variety of}} investigations and courts martial. As a result of these, the Providence captain was relieved of his command, which was given to Jones. Jones, who had performed well in the Glasgow encounter in spite of a crew reduced by disease, thereafter received a captain's commission in the Continental Navy.|$|E
5|$|Pope Gregory VII canonised Ælfheah in 1078, with a feast day of 19April. Lanfranc, {{the first}} post-Conquest archbishop, was dubious <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saints venerated at Canterbury. He was persuaded of Ælfheah's sanctity, but Ælfheah and Augustine of Canterbury {{were the only}} pre-conquest Anglo-Saxon archbishops kept on Canterbury's {{calendar}} of saints. Ælfheah's shrine, which had become neglected, was rebuilt and expanded in the early 12th century under Anselm of Canterbury, who was instrumental in retaining Ælfheah's name in the church calendar. After the 1174 fire in Canterbury Cathedral, Ælfheah's remains together with those of Dunstan were placed around the high altar, at which Thomas Becket {{is said to have}} commended his life into Ælfheah's care shortly before his martyrdom during the Becket controversy. The new shrine was sealed in lead, and was north of the high altar, sharing the honour with Dunstan's shrine, which was located south of the high altar. A Life of Saint Ælfheah in prose and verse was written by a Canterbury monk named Osbern, at Lanfranc's request. The prose version has survived, but the Life is very much a hagiography: many of the stories it contains have obvious Biblical parallels, making them suspect as a historical record.|$|E
5|$|The uniform {{used by the}} Confederate States Marine Corps resembled that {{prescribed}} for the Confederate Army. However, there is controversy <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exact details of the uniform, since the CSMC was not as large, {{and many of its}} records were destroyed. In 1865, right after the war's end, Lloyd J. Beall, commander of the CSMC, had a fire at his home which destroyed most of the CSMC's records. It is clear, however, that the Marines were often equipped out of the stores of whichever garrison was nearest their location. One description has the Marines dressed in frock coats of a particular (and undetermined) shade of gray, and dark blue or black trousers. It appears that Confederate Marines wore forage caps although it is unclear if there was any ornamentation on the cover. Much of the gear worn by the CSMC was imported from Russia, and from Great Britain and its empire, mainly Canada. This created a fairly unusual look.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} received official endorsement by the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, but {{it found}} that being perceived as government-endorsed was double-edged.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Paley and his news staff {{was not always}} smooth. His friendship with Edward R. Murrow, {{one of the leading}} lights in the CBS news division (and by then a vice president of CBS), suffered during the 1950s over the hard-hitting tone of the Murrow-hosted See It Now series. The implication was that the network's sponsors were uneasy <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controversial topics of the series, leading Paley to worry about lost revenue to the network as well as unwelcome scrutiny during the era of McCarthyism. In 1955, Alcoa withdrew its sponsorship of See It Now, and eventually the program's weekly broadcast on Tuesdays was stopped, though it continued as a series of special segments until 1958.|$|E
