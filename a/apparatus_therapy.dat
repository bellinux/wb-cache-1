40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} a conceptual framework for cognitive distortions, which notably allows to specify more accurately their intrinsic relationships. This conceptual framework aims at inserting itself within the <b>apparatus</b> of cognitive <b>therapy</b> and of critical thinking. The present analysis is based on the following fundamental concepts: the reference class, the duality and the system of taxa. With the help of these three notions, each cognitive distortion can be defined. A distinction is also made between, on the one hand, general cognitive distortions and on the other hand, specific cognitive distortions. The present model allows then to define within the same conceptual framework the general cognitive distortions such as dichotomous reasoning, disqualifying a given pole, minimisation and maximisation. It also allows to describe as specific cognitive distortions: disqualifying the positive, selective abstraction and catastrophism. Furthermore, the present model predicts the existence of two other general cognitive distortions: the omission of the neutral and requalifying in the other pole...|$|R

30|$|The dilute {{colloidal}} fluids of nanosized {{particles in}} the heat transfer liquids are a matter of interest due to their single thermal behavior. Stable colloidal solutions that consist of magnetite, hematite and maghemite are called ferrofluids [1]. Ferrofluids have a great potential for development in the medical applications, mechanical engineering, electronic packing aerospace, etc. [1, 2, 3, 4]. The low toxicity and water-soluble qualities of some polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol), PEG make them suitable for industrial applications. PEG and its derivatives are applied as surfactants, excipients in some drugs, lubricants, heat transfer fluid in electronic <b>apparatus,</b> gene <b>therapy</b> vectors, etc. [5]. Rheological properties are {{used to describe the}} flow behavior of fluids and also deformation of structures made in fluids. Rheological measurements also give the useful information for designing the colloidal solutions in the food industry, paint industry and heat transfer applications [6]. Because of large application field of ferrofluids, colloidal solutions containing Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles and polymers are topic of interest for some authors in the recent years. For example, the molar heat capacity for water-based α-Fe 2 O 3 nanofluid prepared over a simple biomolecule-assisted hydrothermal method was measured by a high-precision automatic adiabatic calorimeter at T = (290 – 335) K by Wei et al. [7]. Guo et al. [8] have used a two-step method for preparation of magnetic nanofluids containing γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles, ethylene glycol and water. Thermal transport properties for these nanofluids were also investigated by Guo et al. [8]. Colla et al. [9] measured the viscosity and thermal conductivity of water-based Fe 2 O 3 nanofluid. Influence of the several surfactants in the colloidal stability, particle size distribution and thermal conductivity of water-based α-Fe 2 O 3 nanofluids have been investigated by Gayadhthri et al. [10]. The structural changes of the oil-based ferrofluids were investigated under external magnetic fields by Rajnak et al. [11]. The magnetoviscous effect in the oil-based ferrofluids containing superparamagnetic oxide (Fe, Ni) in the presence of magnetic field was investigated by Katiyar et al. [12]. Felicia et al. [13] reviewed the recent advances in magnetorheological properties of ferrofluids. Rheology of a very dilute magnetic suspension with micro-structures of nanoparticles in mineral oil has been studied by Cunha et al. [14]. The stability and rheological properties of TiO 2 nanofluids containing PEG and also thermal conductivity of nanofluids containing carbon-coated metal nanoparticles and PEG were investigated previously [15, 16]. Rheological, magnetorheological and volumetric properties of nanofluids containing Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles and PEG have been investigated in our previous work [17].|$|R

In order to lower {{the resistance of the}} animals, they were irradiated previous to inoculation, using a high voltage Roentgen <b>therapy</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The following factors were employed: 170 kv. peak constant potential (equivalent to 190 kv. peak pulsating current); 80 cm. distance; ~ ram. copper filter; 8 ma. With this setting, 10 Roentgen units per minute, measured in air, was obtained. The most suitable exposure for the rats was found to be 600 r; that is, a 60 minute treatment time. Immediately after irradiation, the rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with a suspension of Mexican typhus virus from a guinea pig's infected tunica vaginalis, which was not richer in Rickettsiae than the average obtained in routine transfer. By this technique, the authors mentioned developed a sure and practical method of obtaining a highly concentrated suspension of specific Mexican typhus Rickettsiae which they used principally in the preparation of typhus vaccine and specific immune horse serum. The use of this vaccine in Mexico by Varela and Parada (2) and by Sanchez Casco (3) and the study of the therapeutic value of the serum by the Mexican Commission headed by Dr. Landa have given such promising results that it would seem advisable to recommend the extension of this method to those countries affected by the disease. * At the time of doing this work, Dr. MacchiaveUo held a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation...|$|R

Subjects and methods. Forty children whose mean age was 2. 67 ± 0. 35 years were examined; thermal injuries accounted for 25. 05 ± 1. 01 % of the total body surface area; of them degrees IIIaIIIb was  19. 04 ± 0. 85 %. A comparison group (n= 15) received conventional therapy without taking into account and correcting baseline and current hemostasiological disorders. On day 1, a study group (n= 25) had programmed anticoagulant therapy and intravenous laser therapy at different radiation frequencies with a Mustang 20002 + laser <b>therapy</b> <b>apparatus</b> (patent for invention No. 2482894) {{in addition to the}} conventional therapy. The laser therapy cycle was 6 to 16 sessions. The investigators estimated and compared the following examined parameters: white blood cell count; leukocytic index of intoxication; plasma average mass molecules at a wavelength of 254 nm; toxogenic granularity of neutrophils; wound exudate discharge time; surgical plasty area; and hospitalization time. Results. The positive laboratory and clinical effects of the performed combined intravenous laser therapy in the combined therapy of burn disease in young children were comparatively shown in the study group patients.  The significant decrease in the level of an inflammatory response and endogenous intoxication led to a rapider burn wound cleansing, active epithelization, and reduced surgical plasty volumes. Conclusion. Combined intravenous laser therapy signif icantly exerts antiinflammatory and detoxifying effects in young children with 40 % thermal injuries in the acute period of burn disease.

Brandi C, D'Aniello C, Grimaldi L, Caiazzo E, Stanghellini E. Source Plastic Surgery Unit of Siena, University of Siena, Italy. brandices@unisi. it Abstract For a successful conventional or superficial liposuction, {{it is necessary to}} consider the competence of the surgeon who is to administer the procedure necessary for this type of surgery as well as the physical and psychological evaluation of the determined patient. A poor result often is related to the persistence of adipose tissue irregularity in the form of fatty tissue accumulation. This complication, common to this type of surgery, has called for research to determine methods for its treatment. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) therapy refers to the transcutaneous and subcutaneous administration of CO 2 for therapeutic purposes. This treatment originated at the Royal Spas of France in 1932 with the treatment of patients affected by obliteration of arteriopathies. Recent studies have demonstrated the effect of subcutaneous CO 2 therapy performed to improve local parameters of circulation (performed by Doppler, laser-Doppler, and trans-cutaneous partial pressure of oxygen determination), and to reduce localized adiposities (verified reporting variations in maximum circumference and performing histologic studies). With these results, the absence of toxicity, and the relevant side effects related to this treatment taken into consideration, the Plastic Surgery Unit of Siena has been committed to researching the role that CO 2 therapy can play in the treatment of skin irregularity and as a complement to liposuction. The authors report their experience using Carbomed programmable automatic CO 2 <b>therapy</b> <b>apparatus</b> and 30 GA 1 / 2 0, 3 X 13 microlance needles for the treatment of patients with adipose tissue accumulations located on the thighs and knees. In their study, 42 patients were divided into three groups: A, B, and C. In Group A, only liposuction was performed. In group B 3 weeks after liposuction CO 2 therapy was administered in two weekly subcutaneous applications of CO 2 for 10 consecutive weeks. In group C, CO 2 therapy alone was administered with the same contingencies used for group B (two weekly subcutaneous applications of CO 2 for 10 consecutive weeks). The objective was to assess the effectiveness of CO 2 therapy for skin irregularity and as a complement to liposuction for adipose tissue accumulation by reporting variations in circumference and skin elasticity monitored by the Cutometer SEM 474 in all treated areas. The data obtained were analyzed statistically. Values of p less than 0. 05 were considered significant. The authors report their experience and the results achieved from the stud...|$|R
