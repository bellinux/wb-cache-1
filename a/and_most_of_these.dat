The Sweethearts {{were the first}} {{integrated}} all women's band in the United States. Nat Towles also led an important territory band out of Omaha during the swing era, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> bands were represented by the National Orchestra Service, which was also based out of Omaha. It was a nationally regarded company which acted as agent for dozens of bands.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are members of a European-level political party. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and the nature of coalition governments {{in a number of states}} means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing on the nature of the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the European Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are members of a European-level political party. These frequently hold pre-meetings of their European Council members, prior to its meetings. However, the European Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and decisions are generally made on these lines, though ideological alignment can colour their political agreements and their choice of appointments (such as their president).|$|E

5|$|Another 30 {{artificial}} radioisotopes {{of tungsten}} have been characterized, {{the most stable}} of which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4days, 178W with a half-life of 21.6days, and 187W with a half-life of 23.72 h. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3hours, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> have half-lives below 8minutes. Tungsten also has 4meta states, the most stable being 179mW (t1/2 6.4minutes).|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi {{was ready}} now for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Abéché, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were artillery and logistic units. This {{may have been due}} to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{military}} and civil defenses {{were unable to}} stop the Allied attacks. The number of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guns assigned to defensive duties in the home islands was inadequate, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> aircraft and guns had difficulty reaching the high altitudes at which B-29s often operated. Fuel shortages, inadequate pilot training, {{and a lack of}} coordination between units also constrained the effectiveness of the fighter force. Despite the vulnerability of Japanese cities to firebombing attacks, the firefighting services lacked training and equipment, and few air raid shelters were constructed for civilians. As a result, the B-29s were able to inflict severe damage on urban areas while suffering few losses.|$|E

5|$|Planescape: Torment is {{primarily}} story-driven and combat is not prominently featured. The protagonist, known as The Nameless One, is an immortal {{who has lived}} many lives but has forgotten all about them, even forgetting his own name. The game focuses on his journey through the city of Sigil and other planes to reclaim his memories of these previous lives. Several characters in the game may join The Nameless One on his journey, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> characters have encountered {{him in the past}} or have been influenced by his actions in some way.|$|E

June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for {{encouraging}} him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind. Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> relationships were insubstantial.|$|E

5|$|Scientists will {{probably}} never be certain {{of the largest and}} smallest dinosaurs to have ever existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork.|$|E
5|$|The {{commuter}} rail system serves 39 railway stations, {{most of which}} predate the {{commuter rail}} service. When the Røros, Meråker and Nordland Lines were built, stations buildings were built at all places with a passing loop, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> stations the buildings remain, although they are not necessarily open to travelers. However, only Trondheim, Stjørdal, Steinkjer and Røros are manned. Several of the station and operation buildings along the line have been preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. These include the stations at Singsås, Hell, Skatval, Langstein, Skogn and Levanger. The system's depot is located at Marienborg, although trains also overnight at terminal stations.|$|E

He had four decades of seafaring experience and had served as captain of , from which he was transferred to command Titanic. The {{vast majority of the}} crew who served under him were not trained sailors, but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines; or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers. The 6watch officers and 39able-bodied seamen constituted only around 5percent of the crew, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> had been taken on at Southampton so had not had time to familiarise themselves with the ship.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 262 species of bird have been {{recorded}} living in the wild {{on the island of}} Tasmania, nearby islands and islands in Bass Strait, 182 of which are regularly recorded, while another 79 are vagrants and one is extinct. Birds of Macquarie Island are not included in this list. Twelve species are unique (endemic) to the island of Tasmania, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are common and widespread. However, the forty-spotted pardalote is rare and restricted, while the island's two breeding endemic species, the world's only migratory parrots, are both threatened. Several species of penguin are late summer visitors to Tasmanian shores. Tasmania's endemic birds have led to it being classified as an Endemic Bird Area (EBA), one of 218 such areas worldwide. Priority regions for habitat-based conservation of birds around the world, they are defined by containing two or more restricted-range (endemic) species.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1945, {{cities and}} {{industrial}} {{facilities in the}} Japanese home islands were under sustained attack from United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers based in the Mariana Islands. Attacks by Allied submarines and surface ships had also cut most of the country's trade routes, and US Navy aircraft carrier task groups had raided locations in the home islands on several occasions. Shortages of fuel had confined most of the Imperial Japanese Navy's surviving ships to port and forced them and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service to hold its air units in reserve against the Allied invasion that {{was expected to be}} launched late in the year. Prior to the war, the Japanese military had assessed that coastal artillery was no longer suited to the country's circumstances. As a result, only a few strategic ports were protected by artillery capable of engaging enemy warships, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> guns were of relatively small calibers.|$|E

5|$|In 1801, the {{population}} of Wales was 587 thousand, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> would {{have been living in}} rural areas and employed in agriculture. By 1911, {{the population}} had swelled to 2.4 million, more than half of whom lived in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, where they were employed in mining, steel and other industries. There was a shift away from the land with many dwellers in the rural west emigrating in the 1830s and 1840s and migrating to the cities {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. By 1911, agriculture was a minor industry in Glamorgan, and migrant labour from England was needed to help get in the harvest. Rural craftsmen were also lost and their supply was replenished from depressed areas of southwestern England and by mass immigration from Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The local {{region was}} heavily settled by Scots in the mid/late 1700s, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were Gaelic-speaking Highlanders. The vast {{majority}} of Highland Scots, recent immigrants, remained loyal to the British government and rallied to the call to arms from the Royal Governor. Despite this, they were eventually defeated by a larger Revolutionary force at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. The area also included a number of active Revolutionaries.|$|E
