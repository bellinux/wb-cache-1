25|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{state that}} the essential nature of the messengers is twofold: they <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> human and divine. They are divine in that they all {{come from the same}} God and expound His teachings. In this light they are seen as one and the same. At the same time they are separate individuals (their human reality) and known by different names. Each fulfills a definite mission, and is entrusted with a particular revelation.|$|E
25|$|The great {{breadth of}} the Mesoamerican pantheon of deities {{is due to the}} {{incorporation}} of ideological and religious elements from the first primitive religion of Fire, Earth, Water and Nature. Astral divinities (the sun, stars, constellations, and Venus) were adopted and represented in anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and anthropozoomorphic sculptures, and in day-to-day objects. The qualities of these gods and their attributes changed {{with the passage of time}} and with cultural influences from other Mesoamerican groups. The gods <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> three: creator, preserver, and destroyer, and at the same time just one. An important characteristic of Mesoamerican religion was the dualism among the divine entities. The gods represented the confrontation between opposite poles: the positive, exemplified by light, the masculine, force, war, the sun, etc.; and the negative, exemplified by darkness, the feminine, repose, peace, the moon, etc. (European ideology, Manichaeism).|$|E

500|$|Matt Zoller Seitz, {{writing on}} RogerEbert.com, gave the film {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "a huge and {{technically}} dazzling film and that the film's panoramas of astronauts tumbling against starfields and floating through space station interiors <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> informative and lovely". Justin Chang, writing for Variety, said that the film [...] "restores a sense of wonder, terror and possibility {{to the big screen}} that should inspire awe among critics and audiences worldwide". Richard Corliss of Time praised Cuarón for playing [...] "daringly and dexterously with point-of-view: at one moment you're inside Ryan's helmet as she surveys the bleak silence, then in a subtle shift you're outside to gauge her reaction. The 3-D effects, added in post-production, provide their own extraterrestrial startle: a hailstorm of debris hurtles at you, as do a space traveler's thoughts at the realization of being truly alone in the universe." ...|$|E
500|$|Abeel praised how, by [...] "voiding the docu-style {{string of}} anecdotes of many fact-based films, {{it offers the}} {{shapeliness}} and irony of classic drama". Hammond commended Madsen as the film [...] "achieves a sense of psychological complexity– and a pervasive atmosphere of fear and confusion– without sacrificing the rhythm and dramatic tension necessary to a war film". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised its combination of [...] "sharp scenes of moral inquiry with {{a few too many}} functional, oldfangled espionage twists". Fuchs applauded the interpolation of emotional relations as they [...] "help to make Flame & Citrons taut action even more effective. Beautifully choreographed and filmed in deep shadows that cut the violence into shadowy, brutal fragments, Flame and Citron's jobs <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> thrilling and disconcerting". Kate Taylor from The Globe and Mail, however, said the romantic relationship, [...] "predictable in a James Bond kind of way, is the weakest link in the script".|$|E

Coker at Rolling Stone called the album Shakur's best {{and said it}} was [...] "by and large a work of pain, anger and burning desperation [...] is the first time 2Pac has taken the conflicting forces tugging at his psyche head-on". Jon Pareles, writing in The New York Times, called Shakur the [...] "St. Augustine of gangster rap" [...] due to his ambivalence towards the behavior and nature of the gangster lifestyle. In a negative review, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice felt that Shakur is [...] "witless" [...] when dealing with fundamental hip hop themes of persecution and accused him of [...] "self-pity": [...] "The subtext of his persecution complex is his self-regard". [...] "This may be the first hip-hop blues LP," [...] observed Matt Hall in Select. [...] "Not so much in the music, although the harp blasts owe more to Howlin' Wolf than Tupac's previous two solo efforts, but more with Shakur's vocals, which <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> rebellious and resigned... Me Against the World is a statement of intent, a note from the depths of America, and a fine, thoughtful LP." ...|$|E

Shame on such a morality that is worthy of pariahs, chandalas, and mlechchhas, and that fails to recognize the eternal essence that exists in every living thing...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his time}} the {{financial}} {{situation of the}} Empire was troubling, and certain social classes had long been under oppression under difficult taxes. [...] In dealing with the complicated questions that therefore arose, Mahmud II is considered to have demonstrated the best spirit {{of the best of}} the Köprülüs. A Firman of February 22, 1834 abolished the vexatious charges which public functionaries, when traversing the provinces, had long been accustomed to take from the inhabitants. By the same edict all collection of money, except for the two regular half-yearly periods, was denounced as abuses. [...] "No one is ignorant," [...] said Sultan Mahmud II in this document, [...] "that I am bound to afford support to all my subjects against vexatious proceedings; to endeavour unceasingly to lighten, instead of increasing their burdens, and to ensure peace and tranquility. Therefore, those acts of oppression <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> contrary to the will of God, and to my imperial orders." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the height}} of limerence, {{thoughts}} of the limerent object (or person) <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> persistent, involuntary and intrusive. Such 'intrusive thoughts about the LO ... appear to be genetically driven': indeed, limerence {{is first and foremost}} a condition of cognitive obsession. This may be caused by low serotonin levels in the brain, comparable to those of people with obsessive–compulsive disorder. All events, associations, stimuli, and experiences return thoughts to the limerent object with unnerving consistency, while conversely the constant thoughts about the limerent object define all other experiences. If a certain thought has no previous connection with the limerent object, immediately one is made. Limerent fantasy is unsatisfactory unless rooted in reality, because the fantasizer may want the fantasy to seem realistic and somewhat possible. [...] At their most severe, intrusive limerent thoughts can occupy an individual's waking hours completely, resulting—like severe addiction—in significant or complete disruption of the limerent's normal interests and activities, including work and family. [...] For serial limerents, this can result in debilitating, lifelong underachievement in school, work, and family life. [...] Comparisons made between limerence and substance addiction may draw attention to the constant, free availability of the limerent's [...] "drug of choice".|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{interest}} in the film following its 2012 Blu-ray release in the United States. Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly rates the film as [...] "A" [...] grade, positing that examination of the students' different motives for survival or subversion of the Program is a [...] "sick blast". A.O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, stating [...] " [...] expertly choreographed scenes of mayhem <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> comical and appalling, and [...] young cast embraces the melodramatic extremity of the story with impressive conviction", adding that Battle Royale [...] "is {{in many ways a}} better movie [...] and in any case a fascinating companion, drawn from a parallel cultural universe. It is a lot uglier and also, perversely, a lot more fun." [...] Entertainment critic for the Cary Darling describes Battle Royale as [...] "tense, tragic and timely... a modern-day horror story imbued with an electric sense of drama and dread." [...] Alexandra Cavallo of the Boston Phoenix writes, [...] "Battle Royale is The Hunger Games not diluted for young audiences" [...] while giving the film three stars out of four. Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, calling it a [...] "gloriously sick and twisted story" [...] and claiming that it is [...] "endlessly entertaining, by turns gory and hilarious, disturbing and exciting." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert's Australia correspondent Michael Mirasol praised Battle Royale for its [...] "thoughtful characterisation" [...] that is [...] "lavished upon all the students" [...] and concluded that it is an [...] "intensely violent fable aimed at a young audience, but with true feeling, intelligence, and respect." [...] Jake Mulligan of The Suffolk Voice gave it five out of five stars, stating that [...] "the influence of [...] "Royale" [...] on works as disparate as [...] "Kill Bill" [...] and [...] "The Hunger Games" [...] cannot be measured" [...] and describing Battle Royale as [...] "Provocative, funny, violent, and aided by a script that somehow gives equal attention to most of the students while also displaying the well-thought out minutia behind the narrative." ...|$|E
