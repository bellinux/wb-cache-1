Davison's attempts to interest the French composer Charles Gounod in Bennett's music led to polite but sardonic responses.|$|E

5|$|Born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria), Cartier {{initially}} {{studied to}} become an architect, before changing career paths and enrolling to study drama at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. There he was taught by Max Reinhardt, who proved {{a major influence on}} Cartier.

5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>musician</b> in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E

5|$|Musicians {{and critics}} {{vary in their}} {{appraisal}} of Tristano <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>musician.</b> Some describe his playing as cold and suggest that his innovations had little impact; others state {{that he was a}} bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than he should be because commentators found him hard to categorize and because he chose not to commercialize.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a {{second-hand}} drum kit {{consisting of}} a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>musician</b> while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, {{who went on to}} book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.|$|E

5|$|On Zelter's {{death in}} 1832, Mendelssohn had hopes of {{succeeding}} him as {{conductor of the}} Sing-Akademie zu Berlin; but at a vote in January 1833 he was defeated for the post by Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen. This may have been because of Mendelssohn's youth, and fear of possible innovations; it was also suspected {{by some to be}} attributable to his Jewish ancestry. Following this rebuff, Mendelssohn divided most of his professional time {{over the next few years}} between Britain and Düsseldorf, where he was appointed musical director (his first paid post <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>musician)</b> in 1833.|$|E

The Documentaly sessions led Yamaguchi to decide to live <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>musician</b> for a full-time career.|$|E
