2500|$|These, {{together}} with his Dichos de Luz y Amor (or [...] "Sayings of Light and Love") and Saint Teresa's writings, {{are the most important}} mystical works in Spanish, and have deeply influenced later spiritual writers all around the world. Among these <b>are</b> <b>T.</b> S. Eliot, Thérèse de Lisieux, Edith Stein (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross) and Thomas Merton. John has also influenced philosophers (Jacques Maritain), theologians (Hans Urs von Balthasar), pacifists (Dorothy Day, Daniel Berrigan and Philip Berrigan) and artists (Salvador Dalí). Pope John Paul II wrote his theological dissertation on the mystical theology of Saint John of the Cross.|$|E
