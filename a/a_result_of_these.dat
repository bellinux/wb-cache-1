5|$|During {{the course}} of the fly-off, the gun turrets proved troublesome, their drive motors proving to be underpowered, and issues with wind blast through the gun slots were also encountered.

Also, Aardsma was wearing a red dress at the time. <b>As</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two facts, the first responders thought that perhaps she had experienced a seizure or some other medical ailment. It was not until Aardsma was examined at the Health Center that anyone realized that she had been stabbed.|$|R

Later, Stern was hired at WWWW Detroit (which Dahl had left when he moved to Chicago).|$|E
5|$|Among the {{earliest}} cases of rumination {{was that of}} a physician in the nineteenth century, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, who acquired the condition as the result of experiments upon himself. As a way of evaluating and testing the acid response of the stomach to various foods, the doctor would swallow sponges tied to a string, then intentionally regurgitate them to analyze the contents. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of reactive collisions involving laser excited metastable 5 p 3 P 1 Cd atoms and ground state Na 2 molecules. <b>As</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> collisions the NaCd intermetallic excimer is formed in a bound excited electronic state and its typical bound-free emission to the ground state is detected. Experimental comparison of this new collision channel with the photochemical production of NaCd in collisions between electronically excited Na 2 and ground state Cd atoms is presented...|$|R
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> changes, a {{group of}} fans met on various Internet forums to {{construct}} higher quality cuts as fan edits by using the available home media and blending the Special Edition DVDs with the LaserDisc transfers. One such edit for The Empire Strikes Back was created by Star Wars fan Adywan.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> collaborations, Rock Steady {{touches on}} many musical styles, {{focusing}} on electropop, dancehall, and new wave.

Singer Gwen Stefani wrote her lyrics quickly in comparison to previous records, and dealt with topics ranging from partying to ruminations on her relationship with Gavin Rossdale.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> developments, a {{dedicated}} community, centered on forums such as XDA Developers, emerged surrounding {{the creation of}} custom firmware ("ROMs") built from the Android source code.

In the end I will analyze <b>a</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> benchmarks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Series of AZ 91 alloy {{samples are}} {{prepared}} by adding {{different levels of}} Mg-Zn-Y quasicrystal master alloy under normal casting condition. The microstructure and mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>these</b> samples are investigated by using of XRD, SEM, EDS and tensile test. It is shown that morphology of β- Mg 17 Al 12 phase changes from continuous nets to discontinuous nets or even to particles. <b>As</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> changes, the mechanical properties of AZ 91 alloys are significantly improved until the addition level passes 6 %...|$|R
5|$|By 1943, Japanese expansionary {{moves in}} the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) had ceased. Their advance in Papua New Guinea had been halted the {{previous}} year by the blocking action that Australian forces had fought along the Kokoda Track. Subsequent defeats at Milne Bay, Buna–Gona, Wau and on Guadalcanal had forced the Japanese on to the back foot. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> victories, the Allies were able to seize the initiative in the region in mid-1943 and began making plans to continue to push the Japanese back in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got {{at least as far}} as breaking into the prison within the castle. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327. The political situation remained unstable, and new plots appear to have been formed to free him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the Singaporean Hunter fleet was {{upgraded}} and modified by Lockheed Aircraft Services Singapore (LASS) {{with an additional}} hardpoint under the forward fuselage and another two inboard pylons (wired only for AIM-9 Sidewinders) before the main gears, bringing {{to a total of}} seven hardpoints for external stores and weapons delivery. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> upgrades, they were redesignated as FGA.74S, FR.74S and T.75S. The RSAF Black Knights, Singapore Air Force's aerobatic team, flew Hunters from 1973 until 1989.|$|E

5|$|Kieswetter's {{career was}} cut short owing to an injury {{sustained}} while batting for Somerset in July 2014: a ball penetrated the gap between his helmet's grille and visor and struck him in the face, damaging his vision. There was initially some hope of a full recovery and he was named in a provisional England squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, but he continued to experience difficulties with his vision. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> problems, in June 2015, aged 27, he announced his retirement from professional cricket. In 2017, he became a professional golfer.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{week after}} the {{trespassing}} incident, four people—three male parachutists (one of whom was a construction worker at the site) and their lookout—were arrested for a BASE jump they conducted on September 30, 2013.

50|$|During {{the mid to}} late 20th century, a {{study showed}} that two-thirds of American adults with disabilities did not have a job. It was also found that around eighty percent of those {{unemployed}} had the desire to work. Employers often said they did not provide adequate accommodations for those with disabilities. They were also unsure if they could trust those persons with disabilities to perform requested tasks correctly. <b>As</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> problems the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 was ratified. This prevented discrimination against those with disabilities in both private and governmental business sectors. Furthermore the ADA placed the responsibility of providing needed accommodations on the employer.|$|R

Neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass, which is about a tenth as abundant as in the Sun. Helium is also depleted to about 80% of the Sun's helium composition. This depletion is <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> precipitation <b>of</b> <b>these</b> elements into the interior of the planet.|$|R
