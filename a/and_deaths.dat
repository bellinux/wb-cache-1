40|$|Charles Fu's Dignity of <b>Death</b> <b>and</b> Dignity of Life, {{released}} in 1993, caused a great sensation. Ever since then, universities in Taiwan have rushed to offer life-and-death related courses. Nanhua University, for instance, formed Graduate Institute of Life <b>and</b> <b>Death</b> Studies, publishing journals of Life <b>and</b> <b>Death</b> Studies. Secondary schools also put life education into their curricula. People in Taiwan, inspired by Charles Fu, {{have started to}} look at death issues openly, thus leading to a boom in life <b>and</b> <b>death</b> research. As Dignity of <b>Death</b> <b>and</b> Dignity of Life set the trend, it has been regarded as a milestone in life <b>and</b> <b>death</b> studies in Taiwan and a must-have book {{for those who want}} to study life <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> This paper is divided into the following chapters. Chapter one is the foreword, with the introduction of Charles Fu's life and the chapter outline of Dignity of <b>Death</b> <b>and</b> Dignity of Life. Chapter two presents the origin of Fu's life <b>and</b> <b>death</b> issues <b>and</b> the book's academic framework, with sections of a. the relations between Fu's personal "life history" <b>and</b> "life <b>and</b> <b>death</b> studies" b. the academic origin of Fu's construction of life <b>and</b> <b>death</b> studies. Chapter three looks at the reviews on Dignity of <b>Death</b> <b>and</b> Dignity of Life. Chapter four is the conclusions. 傅偉勳《死亡的尊嚴與生命的尊嚴》一書在 1993 年在臺灣出版後，造成極大的轟動，各大學陸續開授生死學相關課程，南華大學更創立生死學研究所並出版《生死學研究》期刊。各中學也將生命教育納入課程之中。由於他的啟迪，國人開始正視「死亡」課題，並帶動了「生死學」的研究熱潮。本書實開風氣之先，在臺灣生死學研究上，有樹立里程碑之歷史地位，也是研究生死學之學者必備之書。本書殊勝之處：如首創「生死學」一詞、提出「心性體認本位」與「科際整合」的生死學、揭櫫「生命十大層面與價值取向」模型與「宗教構成要素十項」、融合知識性與體驗性的生死智慧、開創「死亡品質」一詞、建構生、愛、死「生死學三部曲」等。而本書較為不足之處有如下幾端：生死學理論陳義過高，恐不容易推行、強調「生死學」雙重關照，然全書卻偏向「死亡學」、對制度化宗教之批評不是很允當、缺乏東方化、本土化、性別化的觀照...|$|R
