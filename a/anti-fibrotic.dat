HGF binds to c-met receptors found on mesenchymal cell types to produce its many different effects such as increased cellular motility, morphogenesis, proliferation and differentiation.

50|$|Terguride (INN), {{also known}} as trans-dihydrolisuride, is a {{serotonin}} receptor antagonist and dopamine receptor agonist of the ergoline family.

Serotonin stimulates the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, and induces fibrosis in the wall of pulmonary arteries. Together, this causes vascular remodeling and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries. These changes result in increased vascular resistance and PAH. Due to the potential anti-proliferative and <b>anti-fibrotic</b> activity of terguride, this potential medicine could offer the hope of achieving reversal of pulmonary artery vascular remodeling and attenuation of disease progression.|$|E

50|$|When {{faced with}} {{pressure}} overload, the heart attempts to compensate {{with a number}} of structural alterations including hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and increase of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Rapid accumulation of ECM proteins causes excessive fibrosis resulting in decreased myocardial compliance and increased myocardial stiffness. The exact mechanisms involved in excessive fibrosis are not fully understood but there is evidence that supports involvement from local growth factors FGF-2, TGF-beta and platelet-derived growth factor. TGF-β1 {{plays an important role in}} cardiac remodelling through the stimulation of fibroblast proliferation, ECM deposition and myocyte hypertrophy. The increase in TGF-beta 1 expression in a pressure-overloaded heart correlates with the degree of fibrosis, suggesting TGF-beta 1 involvement in the progression from a compensated hypertrophy to failure. Through an autocrine mechanism, TGF-beta 1 acts on fibroblasts by binding TGF-beta 1 receptors 1 and 2. Upon receptor activation, the receptor-associated transcription factor Smad becomes phosphorylated and associates with Co-Smad. This newly formed Smad-Co-Smad complex enters the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor modulating gene expression.Cardiac remodelling of the ECM is also regulated by the CNP/NPR-B pathway as demonstrated by the improved outcomes in transgenic mice with CNP over-expression subjected to myocardial infarction. Binding of CNP to NPR-B catalyzes the synthesis of cGMP, which is responsible for mediating the <b>anti-fibrotic</b> effects of CNP.Fibrotic heart tissue is associated with an increase risk of ventricular dysfunction which can ultimately lead to heart failure. Thus, <b>anti-fibrotic</b> strategies are a promising approach in the prevention and treatment of heart failure.|$|E
5000|$|Prostacyclin is {{synthesized}} from {{arachidonic acid}} in endothelial cells. In vascular smooth muscle cells, prostacyclin binds {{mainly to the}} prostaglandin I receptor. This sends a signal to increase adenylate cyclase activity, which leads to increased synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This in turn leads to increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase or PKA (protein kinase A) activity, ultimately promoting vasodilation and inhibiting cell proliferation. Prostacyclin signaling also leads to anti-thrombotic, <b>anti-fibrotic,</b> and anti-inflammatory effects. Levels of cAMP (which mediates most of the biological effects of prostacyclin) are reduced by phosphodiesterases 3 and 4.The vasoconstrictor thromboxane is also synthesized from arachidonic acid.

50|$|Wound repair {{results from}} a complex and highly orchestrated {{cellular}} and biochemical response to tissue injury. Given that the wound repair constitutes {{a major issue in}} clinical practice with enormous healthcare costs, NFB is developing several scaffold-based platforms to induce wound healing and to restore function. For example, in cases of chronic healing (e.g. diabetic patients), a fibrin-based scaffold has been used to target a vector encoding eNOS to the wound site. This enhances transfection efficiency of the vector resulting in greater eNOS expression, greater production of NO and better healing in an impaired wound model. Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) is a particularly severe genetic condition which leads to extensive blistering, repeated wounding and poor healing ability. RDEB is caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene which results in the reduction or loss of type VII collagen in the skin. One of the projects at NFB aims to deliver the COL7A1 gene encapsulated with a thermal responsive and crosslinkingable hydrogel scaffold to EB cells on the wounds through a non-viral gene-delivery system. NFB is also using natural and synthetic hollow microspheres to encapsulate <b>anti-fibrotic</b> drugs and incorporate them into implantable devices in order to inhibit fibrotic capsule formation. Another strategy developed by NFB in the area of soft tissue augmentation with the use of cholecyst-derived extracellular matrix (CEM). NFB studies have shown it to be very effective in the augmentation of body wall defects primarily because of its strength and inherent biological properties. Optimal stabilisation and functionalisation offers control over degradation that can match the rate of the healing process.|$|E

We previously showed that albumin and its derivative designed for stellate cell-targeting, retinol-binding protein–albumin domain III fusion protein (referred to as R-III), inactivate cultured HSCs. Here, we investigated the mechanism of action of albumin/R-III in HSCs and examined the <b>anti-fibrotic</b> potential of R-III in vivo. R-III treatment and albumin expression downregulated retinoic acid (RA) signaling which was involved in HSC activation. RA receptor agonist and retinaldehyde dehydrogen-ase overexpression abolished the <b>anti-fibrotic</b> effect of R-III and albumin, respectively. R-III uptake into cultured HSCs was signifi-cantly decreased by siRNA-STRA 6, and injected R-III was localized predominantly in HSCs in liver. Importantly, R-III administration reduced CCl 4 - and bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis. R-III also exhibited a preventive effect against CCl 4 -inducd liver fibrosis.

Activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) is the key initiating step in pancreatic fibrosis, which is a characteristic feature associated with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Methods: The <b>anti-fibrotic</b> effect of eruberin A and the underlying mechanisms of its <b>anti-fibrotic</b> action in LTC- 14 cells, which retained essential characteristics and morphological features of primary PSCs, were examined by means of real-time polymerase chain reactions, Western blotting and immunostaining. Results: The application of eruberin A (20 µg/ml) effectively inhibited the expression levels of fibrotic mediators namely alpha-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin and type I-collagen, so as the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway components post transforming growth factor-beta (5 ng/ml) stimulation. Eruberin A treatment also led to a notable decrease in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&# 954;B) and the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /serine-threonine kinase (AKT).

40|$|Background/Aims: Current {{cell culture}} models contributed {{significantly}} to the study of liver fibrosis and the testing of <b>anti-fibrotic</b> drugs but mimic the complex in vivo milieu poorly. Therefore, we evaluated fibrotic rat liver slices as a new, more physiologic in vitro model to test <b>anti-fibrotic</b> compounds. Methods: Precision-cut slices (8 mm diameter, 250 pm thickness) were prepared from fibrotic rat livers three weeks after bile-duct ligation and incubated for 0 - 48 h, during which viability and progression of the fibrotic process was evaluated. In addition, the effects of pentoxifylline, gleevec, and dexamethasone on mRNA expression of markers for fibrosis were determined. Results: Fibrotic liver slices remained viable during 48 h of incubation, with increasing alpha SMA and pro-collagen 1 a 1 mRNA expression, and alpha SMA and collagen protein content after prolonged incubation. Addition of pentoxifylline, gleevec, or dexamethasone during incubation dose-dependently inhibited pro-collagen- 1 a 1 and alpha SMA mRNA expression after 24 h of incubation without influencing slice viability.

40|$|AbstractTyrosine kinases {{regulate}} a broad {{variety of}} physiological cell processes, including metabolism, growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Abnormal tyrosine kinase activity disturbs the physiological cell homeostasis {{and can lead}} to cancer, vascular disease, and fibrosis. In regard to fibrosis, different tyrosine kinases have been identified as determinants of disease progression and potential targets for <b>anti-fibrotic</b> therapies. This includes both receptor tyrosine kinases (e. g., PDGF receptor, VEGF receptor, EGF receptor, and JAK kinases) as well as non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e. g., c-Abl, c-Kit, and Src kinases). Given their central role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, researchers of our field study the <b>anti-fibrotic</b> effects of monoclonal antibodies or small-molecule inhibitors to block the aberrant tyrosine kinase activity and treat fibrosis in preclinical models of various fibrotic diseases (e. g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, renal fibrosis, liver fibrosis, and dermal fibrosis).

We have shown previously that hAM patching is a potential approach to counteract liver fibrosis. Indeed, when fresh hAM was used to cover the liver surface of rats with liver fibrosis induced by the bile duct ligation (BDL) procedure, the progression and severity of fibrosis were significantly reduced. Since cryopreservation enables safety and long-term storage of hAM but may influence its functional properties, here we compared the <b>anti-fibrotic</b> effects of fresh and cryopreserved hAM in rats with BDL-induced liver fibrosis. After BDL, the rat liver {{was covered with a}} piece of fresh or cryopreserved hAM, or left untreated.

40|$|Fibrotic {{processes}} in chronic kidney diseases {{are the leading}} cause of renal failure. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), effecting organ restructuring by its mitogenic, motogenic, morphogenic and anti-apoptotic activities, is one of the central mediators involved in tubular repair and regeneration after acute renal injury. In addition, HGF acts as an anti-inflammatory and <b>anti-fibrotic</b> factor antagonizing pro-fibrotic actions of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the <b>anti-fibrotic</b> function of HGF in chronic kidney disease are not well understood. Therefore, in the present study HGF signaling and HGF induced expression profiles were studied in renal interstitial fibroblasts that represent a central cell type in tubulointerstitial fibrosis due to their prominent production of extracellular matrix proteins. Furthermore, gene therapeutical HGF application using different serotypes of the adeno-associated viral vector (AAV), namely AAV 2, AAV 8 and AAV 9, was tested in order to treat tubulointerstitial fibrosis in a COL 4 A 3 knockout mouse model. Analyses of HGF signaling demonstrated that in agreement to signaling in epithelial cells HGF stimulation results in the activation of the Erk 1 / 2 and the Akt pathway. However, the Stat 3 signal transducer was not phosphorylated. Smad 2 / 3 phosphorylation in response to Erk 1 / 2 activation in HGF stimulated fibroblasts supports previous data showing the antagonistic interaction of the HGF- and TGF-beta-signaling. A comprehensive expression profiling of HGF-stimulated renal fibroblasts by microarray hybridisation could further define the <b>anti-fibrotic</b> signals mediated by HGF. Functional cluster analyses and quantitative PCR assays indicated that the HGF-stimulated pathways transfer the <b>anti-fibrotic</b> effects in renal interstitial fibroblasts by reducing expression of extracellular matrix roteins, various chemokines, and members of the CCN family. Interruption of the HGF signaling via the Akt pathway or support of the HGF signaling via the Erk 1 / 2 pathway by RNA interference, using Akt-siRNA or Smad 4 -siRNA, proved that not only Erk 1 / 2 activation but also Akt activation is responsible for <b>anti-fibrotic</b> signal transduction by HGF. These data clearly point out that the Akt signaling upon HGF stimulation acts as an auxiliary pathway in the <b>anti-fibrotic</b> function of HGF. In order to apply the <b>anti-fibrotic</b> effect of HGF to chronic kidney diseases, a gene therapeutical system was established, intended to reduce renal interstitial fibrosis by the use of HGF as transgene and the adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) as gene vehicle. COL 4 A 3 knockout mice mimicking the human Alport syndrome served as model system for renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Different natural occurring AAV serotypes, namely AAV 2, AAV 8 and AAV 9, were studied with regard to their capability to target renal epithelial cells compared to liver parenchyma. Furthermore, a mammalian promoter construct was generated that restricted transgene expression to the kidney and the liver for a combined endocrine and paracrine expression of HGF. Systemic application of AAV 8 and AAV 9 carrying HGF as transgene resulted in high serum levels of HGF in COL 4 A 3 knockout mice, however, AAV 9 achieved the highest HGF expression in both the liver and the kidney. HGF serum levels were associated with pronounced repression of fibrotic markers such as collagen 1 A 1, PDGF-receptor-beta, and alpha-smooth-muscle actin.
