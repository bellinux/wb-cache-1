25|$|A {{credit card}} {{is part of}} a system of {{payments}} named after the small plastic card issued to users of the system. The issuer of the card grants a line of credit to the consumer from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as <b>a</b> <b>cash</b> <b>advance</b> to the user. In 1946, American banker John C. Biggins of the Flatbush National Bank of Brooklyn invented the first bank-issued credit card.|$|E

25|$|Many {{credit cards}} {{can also be}} used in an ATM to {{withdraw}} money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer cashback on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered <b>a</b> <b>cash</b> <b>advance.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A {{credit card}} is a payment card issued to users ({{cardholder}}s) {{to enable the}} cardholder to pay a merchant {{for goods and services}} based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts so paid plus the other agreed charges.

[...] Complex fee structures in the credit card industry may limit customers' ability to comparison shop, help ensure that the industry is not price-competitive and help maximize industry profits.

2500|$|The {{tension and}} {{isolation}} {{in the recording}} process led to complications in the song selection, which would, in turn create further tensions within the band. Firstly was the song [...] "Slow Motion", a controversial ballad written by Jenkins about a student shooting a teacher's son. While Jenkins insisted that the song was satirical parody, and actually anti-violence, Elektra disapproved of the track being on the album, feeling it could cause controversy due to {{the proximity of the}} Columbine High School massacre, which had just happened in April of that year. The band and the label fought over the song's inclusion for four months, with the label proposing a compromise that would allow only the instrumental to be on the album, and in return, the label would finance an EP to be released after the album, where the band could release the song in its entirety and have complete creative freedom, without restriction. Cadogan, already unhappy with his lack of ownership over the band, was the sole member of the band to object to the deal, knowing he would not have any control over the deal's terms of <b>a</b> <b>cash</b> <b>advance</b> and imprint label creation for the EP.|$|E
