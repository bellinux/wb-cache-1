5|$|New {{walls were}} built by Tarade and Vauban in the 17th century. They {{were in their}} turn {{destroyed}} in 1874. Only small portions survive: two bastions and the Porte de Strasbourg ("Strasbourg gate"), <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of French architecture under Louis XIV. Sélestat still has two old arsenals, Sainte-Barbe on the main square (1470) and Saint-Hilaire (1518). The first, with a large crenelated gable, is {{a fine example of}} Gothic architecture.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of {{convergence}} {{in plants}} is {{the evolution of}} edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E

50|$|The 19th {{century was}} also a period of active {{building}} of new churches, the Uspenski Cathedral being {{the most important of}} them. The garrisons needed Orthodox churches and so did the new emigrants to the towns. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> are the Orthodox church of Tampere and Turku.|$|R
5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to set <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more {{as a warning to}} the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the site}} was {{considered}} for scheduling by English Heritage, because of its national importance as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of a late 20th-century power station. It was also important because of its use as a testing ground for various generating sizes, from which came success in the UK's electricity industry. However, by then the station's buildings were in poor condition {{and it would have}} been financially difficult to ensure their long term preservation. Instead, it was decided a comprehensive study and photographic record of the station would be commissioned.|$|E

This doesn't mean that Cookie rounds out his diet with plates, trucks, ukuleles, and other objects the munching monster {{has been known to}} devour. This means that Cookie now eats a fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> for viewers at home. And Cookie doesn't mind a bit. Sure he loves cookies, but he likes the act of eating in general. As long as his mouth is full, his heart is happy.|$|E
5|$|The {{many forms}} of dance provide {{entertainment}} for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when {{it is used to}} express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines {{many forms of}} entertainment music, movement, storytelling, theatre it provides <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{new focus}} was on women's self-discovery; and the ACWF {{launched}} the Four Self Campaign consisting of: self-respect, self-confidence, self-improvement, and self-reliance. An example of the ACWF balancing its government responsibilities with its responsibility to the women of China {{can be seen in}} the One-Child Policy. The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content, but questioned if the policy respected the rights of women. In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} these new routes offered a more {{efficient}} way {{to get into the}} lower town than the cramped streets of rue du Midi/Zuidstraat, rue des Fripiers/Kleerkopersstraat and rue Neuve and helped revitalize the lower quarters of the town. In order to accomplish this revitalization and attract investment, public buildings were constructed as part of the Léon Suys project including the Brussels Stock Exchange. The vast Halles Centrales/Centrale Hallen, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of metallic architecture, replaced unhygienic open-air markets, though it was torn down in 1958. The monumental fountain that was to break the monotony of the boulevards at Fontainas Square was abandoned for budgetary reasons.|$|E
5|$|The palace chapel of the Myrelaion in Constantinople {{was built}} around 920 as a cross-in-square church and remains <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example.</b> The {{earliest}} cross-in-square in Greece is the Panagia church at the monastery of Hosios Loukas, dated {{to the late}} 10th century, but variations of the type can be found from southern Italy to Russia and Anatolia. They served {{in a wide variety}} of church roles, including domestic, parish, monastic, palatial, and funerary.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.|$|E

5|$|This {{larger scale}} {{building}} activity, from the mid-8th century on, was {{a manifestation of}} the emergence of tribal organisms, a new civilizational quality that represented rather efficient proto-political organizations and social structures on a new level. They were based on these fortifications, defensive objects, of which the mid-8th century and later Vistulan gords in Lesser Poland are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example.</b> The threat coming from the Avar state in Pannonia could have had provided the original motivation for the construction projects.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{made several}} {{painting}} excursions during {{visits to the}} landscape around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond. At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in The Wheat Field series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.|$|E
5|$|Ambler's Texaco Gas Station, {{also known}} as Becker's Marathon Gas Station, is a {{historic}} filling station located {{at the intersection of}} Old U.S. Route 66 and Illinois Route 17 in the village of Dwight, Illinois, United States. The station has been identified as the longest operating gas station along Route 66; it dispensed fuel for 66 continuous years until 1999. The station is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of a domestic style gas station and derives its most common names from ownership stints by two different men. North of the station is an extant outbuilding that once operated as a commercial icehouse. Ambler's was the subject of major restoration work from 20052007, and reopened as a Route 66 visitor's center in May 2007. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Anthropomorphised ants {{have often}} been used in fables and children's stories to {{represent}} industriousness and cooperative effort. They also are mentioned in religious texts. In the Book of Proverbs in the Bible, ants are held up as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> for humans for their hard work and cooperation. Aesop did the same in his fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. In the Quran, Sulayman {{is said to have}} heard and understood an ant warning other ants to return home to avoid being accidentally crushed by Sulayman and his marching army. In parts of Africa, ants are considered to be the messengers of the deities. Some Native American mythology, such as the Hopi mythology, considers ants as the very first animals. Ant bites are often said to have curative properties. The sting of some species of Pseudomyrmex is claimed to give fever relief. Ant bites are used in the initiation ceremonies of some Amazon Indian cultures as a test of endurance.|$|E
5|$|Barton Academy is a {{historic}} Greek Revival school building and local landmark on Government Street. The Bishop Portier House and the Carlen House {{are two of the}} many surviving examples of Creole cottages in the city. The Mobile City Hospital and the United States Marine Hospital are both restored Greek Revival hospital buildings that predate the Civil War. The Washington Firehouse No. 5 is a Greek Revival fire station, built in 1851. The Hunter House {{is an example of the}} Italianate style and was built by a successful 19th-century African American businesswoman. The Shepard House is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of the Queen Anne style. The Scottish Rite Temple is the only surviving example of Egyptian Revival architecture in the city. The Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Passenger Terminal is an example of the Mission Revival style.|$|E
5|$|During World WarI, the palace, {{then the}} home of King GeorgeV and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more {{valuable}} contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much {{to the dismay of}} his guests and household. To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to set <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.|$|E
