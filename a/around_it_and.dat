5|$|In Boston, after Vivien (Connie Britton) catches Ben (Dylan McDermott) {{cheating}} on her, he begs for her forgiveness, {{and says he}} {{would do anything to}} save their marriage. This includes getting out of Boston and relocating to a different city. He shows her pictures of a great house in an older district of Los Angeles, claiming Vivien loves old houses. He tells her the price of the house is strangely lower than those <b>around</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> {{that it would be a}} great place for the family to start over.|$|E
5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile to human life. On the brink of extinction, humanity creates Basel, a giant air purification module controlled by the Zenith System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding Basel, the remnants of humanity gathered <b>around</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> built a great city {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While Basel and the Zenith System control the surrounding environment to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: each person has their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. Basel evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those {{at the top of the}} tower are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the people into a religion deifying the Zenith System.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was forecast to strengthen slowly to reach peak winds of 45mph (75km/h). Within {{three hours of}} forming, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto. A small cyclone, the storm continued to organize quickly as it turned north-northeastward, while radar imagery suggested {{the formation of an}} eye by early on September 13. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, Humberto was upgraded to a hurricane at 0515UTC on September 13, while located about 15miles (20km) off the coast of Texas. The hurricane made landfall a few miles to the east of High Island at around 0700UTC. A well-defined eye was maintained with strong convection <b>around</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> Hurricane Hunters reported sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) about two hours after landfall. However, post-storm analysis later determined that the winds were a bit stronger—about 90mph (150km/h).|$|E

25|$|Russia {{also signed}} over its 25-year {{leasehold}} rights to Port Arthur, including the naval {{base and the}} peninsula <b>around</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> ceded the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan.

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{in this area}} extends also to modern scholarship. Since the discovery of ancient Anshan, and the realization of its great importance in Elamite history, the definitions were changed again. Some modern scholars argued that the centre of Elam lay at Anshan and in the highlands <b>around</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> not at Susa in lowland Khuzistan.|$|E

25|$|Geologically Lofn {{is divided}} {{into a number of}} zones {{including}} the flat central floor zone, ring of massifs <b>around</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> the outer rings of bright and dark impact ejecta. Lofn was probably formed by an oblique impactor coming from the north-west. The relative shallowness of it is explained by either fragmentation of the impactor prior to the contact with the surface or by the post impact relaxation of Callisto's ductile crust.|$|E
25|$|Although many Toda {{abandoned}} their traditional distinctive huts for houses made of concrete, {{in the early}} 21st century, a movement developed to build the traditional barrel-vaulted huts. From 1995 to 2005, forty new huts were built in this style, and many Toda sacred dairies were renovated. Each has a narrow stone pit <b>around</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> the tiny door is held shut with a heavy stone. Only the priest may enter it. It is used for storage of sacred buffalo milk.|$|E

Soon after these demands were issued, the Ukrainian National Guard issued an ultimatum to the separatists, asking them to surrender. This was subsequently rejected. Government forces then launched an assault on separatist positions at the airport with paratroopers and airstrikes. Attack helicopters were also used by government forces. They targeted a separatist-operated anti-aircraft gun.|$|E

25|$|The fusion {{reactions}} release high-energy particles, some {{of which}} (primarily alpha particles) collide with the high density fuel <b>around</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> slow down. This heats the fuel further, and can potentially cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuelhigh enough density and temperaturethis heating process {{can result in a}} chain reaction, burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as ignition, which can lead to {{a significant portion of the}} fuel in the target undergoing fusion, and the release of significant amounts of energy.|$|E
25|$|Rowling {{noted in}} an {{interview}} that because Snape abandoned his post before dying or officially retiring, a portrait of him does not immediately appear in the Headmaster's office following his death. She adds, however, that she would like to think Harry made Snape's true loyalty and heroism known in the Wizarding world, and that he lobbied to ensure that a portrait be installed in the office. In a separate interview, Rowling discussed Snape's back story, saying she had planned it ever since she wrote the first book because the whole series is built <b>around</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> she considers him {{one of the most important}} characters of the seventh book.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, The State Fair of Virginia {{purchased}} Meadow Farm {{for development}} as a new site for the annual Virginia State Fair. Long held at locations {{in the capital of}} Richmond and Henrico County, the fair was increasingly squeezed out by expanding development <b>around</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> the growth of the event. Most recently, it was held at Strawberry Hill in central Henrico County, at the facility which became the Richmond International Raceway. Beginning in September 2009, the annual Virginia State Fair has been held at the new Meadow Event Park in Caroline County. The annual Meadow Celtic Games and Festival (formerly Richmond Celtic Games and Festival) will also be held at the new facility.|$|E

Inverness is one of Europe's fastest growing cities, with {{a quarter of the}} Highland population living in or <b>around</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> is ranked fifth out of 189 British cities for its quality of life, the highest of any Scottish city. In the recent past, Inverness has experienced rapid economic growth: between 1998 and 2008, Inverness {{and the rest of the}} central Highlands showed the largest growth of average economic productivity per person in Scotland and the second greatest growth in the United Kingdom as a whole, with an increase of 86%. Inverness is twinned with one German city, Augsburg, and two French towns, La Baule and Saint-Valery-en-Caux.|$|E
25|$|Beauty is a Wound is a {{novel by}} Indonesian author Eka Kurniawan, {{published}} in 2002. The novel weaves history into satire, tragedy and the supernatural to depict {{the state of the}} nation before, during and after the 1965 incidents. There is less focus on the military aspect of the coup, but a good deal of focus on the communists themselves through the form of interpersonal relationships and communist ghosts who could not find peace. Without meaning to, perhaps, the novel also gives readers a glimpse of the economy of Indonesia at the time using the example of a flourishing prostitute business and a temporary swimsuit business, among others. Kurniawan projects his feelings about the revolution and coup by constructing a story of theatrical characters <b>around</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> delivers a history of the nation all the way from Dutch occupation to Suharto.|$|E

Armenia was {{to be given a}} significant portion of the east, known as Wilsonian Armenia, extending as far down as the Lake Van area and as far west as Mush, Greece was to be given Smyrna and the area <b>around</b> <b>it</b> (<b>and</b> likely would have gained Constantinople and all of Thrace, which was administered as internationally controlled and demilitarized territory), Italy was to be given control over the south-central and western coast of Anatolia around Antalya, France to be given the area of Cilicia, and Britain to be given all the area south of Armenia. The Treaty of Lausanne, by contrast, forfeited all arrangements and territorial annexations.|$|E
