5|$|After {{a company}} night {{out to the}} Springfield drag races, Smithers fails to protect Mr. Burns from being harassed by a drunken Lenny. Though he tries to make amends the next day, Smithers again bungles his duties and {{attempts}} to drown himself in the water cooler out of guilt, so Burns suggests he take a vacation. Seeking a replacement who will not outshine him, Smithers purposely selects Homer for the job. Burns soon proves to be ridiculously demanding {{for someone who has}} not devoted his life to him like Smithers. After putting up with Mr. Burns' constant abuse for several days, Homer finally snaps <b>and</b> <b>punches</b> Burns. Fearing he has killed the old man, Homer runs away in panic, and hides at home.|$|E
5|$|In {{his next}} title defense, Hughes fought Gil Castillo at , {{defeating}} the former Middleweight contender via TKO. Hughes started the match {{with a big}} slam {{and then began to}} attack from Castillo's guard with elbows <b>and</b> <b>punches.</b> Hughes easily avoided any submission attempts and looked far stronger than Castillo. As he passed to half guard, Castillo was bleeding above his left eye. The challenger's only offense was a weak triangle choke that went nowhere. The round ended with Hughes on top, ground-and-pounding his opponent. Between rounds doctors ruled that the resulting cut was too severe to continue, and Hughes was declared the winner due to stoppage.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1989, the Phillies {{faced the}} Mets {{in their home}} finale at Shea Stadium in New York after a disappointing Mets season. The Mets had won the East in 1988 but were in third place on September 26 behind the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. McDowell was closing out a 5–3 win for the Phillies when, with two outs in the ninth, he induced former {{teammate}} Gregg Jeffries to ground out to second to end the game. As Jeffries was running out the play, McDowell said something to him prompting Jeffries to charge the mound and wrestle McDowell to the ground. The benches cleared <b>and</b> <b>punches</b> were exchanged before the umpires could separate the teams. Jeffries later claimed that McDowell had thrown at him during a 2–1 Phillies victory on September 25.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effect of the die <b>and</b> <b>punch</b> radii on the {{springback}} in the air V-die free bending process of stainless steel sheet metal. The experiment was performed on sheet metal using various die <b>and</b> <b>punch</b> radius values while their springback behavior was observed. The design of experiment approach was used in these experiments using the full factorial and analysis of variance methods to identify whether or not the die <b>and</b> <b>punch</b> radii are significant input parameters in predicting springback. From the statistical analysis, it shows that the die <b>and</b> <b>punch</b> radius parameters are significant factors contributing to the springback effect in the V-die bending of stainless steel sheet metal at the significance level of 0. 05 because their p-value is less than 0. 05. The results from the experiments showed that springback is affected by the die <b>and</b> <b>punch</b> radius values in the air V-bending experiments. From this analysis, it can be concluded that the springback values can be decreased by decreasing the values of the die <b>and</b> <b>punch</b> radii. In the air V-die bending process, the punch radius is the most important factor to be considered. The experimental method agreed well with the design of experiment results...|$|R

5|$|Spider-Man Unlimited is {{an endless}} runner {{game in which}} Spider-Man runs across New York rooftops, {{including}} that of the Oscorp building, as well as Sinister Six spaceships and a giant Doctor Octopus machine, as he dodges obstacles, defeats enemies, and collect power-ups and vials. Regular enemies are defeated by slide attacks <b>and</b> <b>punches,</b> while bosses requires the player to fling projectiles at them. Players earn combos by overthrowing enemies; almost hitting an obstacle or going through a ring also increases the player's combo count. Sections in which Spider-Man swings through streets, climbs the sides of buildings and free-falls from buildings are interspersed with the running portions of the game.|$|E
5|$|The first {{championship}} {{defense of}} WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied {{to the ring}} by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts <b>and</b> <b>punches</b> on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee what had happened and the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count-out as Valentine failed to re-enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not change hands through count-out.|$|E
5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she is not just a sweet and {{innocent}} old lady and that he has no idea whom he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in <b>and</b> <b>punches</b> Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E

5|$|Kate {{is upset}} about Sawyer not wanting {{her to come}} back to the beach with him to rescue Sayid, Jin and Bernard. Jack tells her it is because Sawyer was trying to protect her. When she asks why Jack is {{defending}} Sawyer, Jack informs Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) that it is because he loves her. Kate also witnessed a kiss between him and Juliet. Ben and Alex intercept Jack's group; Ben informs Jack that Naomi is not who she says she is, and making contact with her boat will be disastrous for everyone. Ben orders the shooting of Sayid, Jin, and Bernard, and when Jack hears three shots, he attacks Ben <b>and</b> <b>punches</b> him in the face repeatedly. Unknown to Jack, the shots were fired into the sand, following earlier orders from Ben. Rousseau meets her sixteen-year-old daughter Alex, who was kidnapped by the Others shortly after her birth, and they tie Ben up. The trek party, now able to get a signal, arrives at the radio tower. Rousseau disables her distress signal, freeing the frequency for Naomi. However, Naomi is knifed in the back by Locke, who threatens to kill Jack if he calls Naomi's boat. Locke cannot bring himself to kill Jack, who communicates with George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on Naomi's boat. Minkowski tells the survivors they will be sending rescue.|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to Dover. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals Vincent Hubbard's (Richard Blackwood) credit card to pay for a dog pen for Lady Di (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken her purse and goes to give it to her. Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives <b>and</b> <b>punches</b> the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of the Vic without his knowledge to pay for an operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.|$|E
