5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 300 to 500 mercenaries, Katanga had approximately 14,000 to 17,000 gendarmes in its service, of whom around 7,000 had not received military training. Through reconnaissance, the UN had learned that these forces were concentrated on defending the southern tier of the province (much of the north was already under central government control), with about 5,150 troops {{in and around the}} towns of Jadotville, Kolwezi, and Bunkeya. Another 2,000 garrisoned Élisabethville. The UN also estimated that the Katangese Air Force possessed a number of Harvards, Magisters, and de Havilland Vampires, amounting to a dozen combat aircraft, as well <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> transport aircraft and small planes. However, they believed that many Katangese aircraft were unserviceable. ONUC intelligence observed limited stockpiles of ammunition, petroleum, oil, and lubricants at a few airfields.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah, like {{virtually}} all {{species in the}} genus, is a scrambling vine. The stem usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. The stem is relatively thick (≤30mm) and may reach up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. N. rajah does not produce runners <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> species in the genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from tissue culture, where numerous offshoots may form at a young age.|$|E

The environmental concerns were resolved by the developer for $3.07 million and an agreement to work outside breeding times for the endangered species involved in May of that year; in return, the environmental groups agreed not to appeal the court decision. Some community groups also opposed the project.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no record}} of Molotov {{attempting}} to moderate {{the course of the}} purges or even to save individuals, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> Soviet officials did. During the Great Purge, he approved 372 documented execution lists, more than any other Soviet official, including Stalin. Molotov was one of few with whom Stalin openly discussed the purges. Although Molotov and Stalin signed a public decree in 1938 that disassociated them from the ongoing Great Purge, in private, and even after Stalin's death, Molotov supported the Great Purge and the executions carried out by his government.|$|E
5|$|While Denver {{may not be}} as {{recognized}} for historical musical prominence <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> American cities, it has an active pop, jazz, jam, folk, and classical music scene, which has nurtured several artists and genres to regional, national, and even international attention. Of particular note is Denver's importance in the folk scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Well-known folk artists such as Bob Dylan, Judy Collins and John Denver lived in Denver at various points during this time, and performed at local clubs. Also, three members of the widely popular group Earth, Wind, and Fire are from Denver. More recent Denver-based artists include Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats, The Lumineers, Air Dubai, The Fray, Flobots, Cephalic Carnage, Axe Murder Boyz, Deuce Mob, and Five Iron Frenzy.|$|E

5|$|The koala is {{featured}} in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of indigenous Australians. The Tharawal people believed that the animal helped row the boat that {{brought them to the}} continent. Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people {{from other parts of the}} world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a game animal and the length of its intestines. Several stories tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy. Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren lands into lush forests. The animal is also depicted in rock carvings, though not as much <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> species.|$|E
5|$|While the FPÖ is {{currently}} {{not a member}} of any European or international organisations, the party has ties with several European political parties and groupings. From 1978 to 1993, under the party's liberal leadership, the party {{was a member of the}} Liberal International. In the early years of Haider's leadership, meetings were held with figures such as Jean-Marie Le Pen of the French National Front and Franz Schönhuber of the German Republicans. In the late 1990s he however chose to distance himself from Le Pen, and refused to join Le Pen's EuroNat project. Following the FPÖ's entrance in government in 2000, Haider sought to establish his own alliance of right-wing parties. For his project, Haider tried to establish stable cooperations with the Vlaams Blok party in Belgium and the Northern League party in Italy, as well <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> parties and party groupings. In the end, the efforts to establish a new alliance of parties were not successful.|$|E
