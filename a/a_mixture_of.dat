40|$|The article {{deals with}} the moist air {{equation}} of state. There are equations of state discussed in the article, i. e. the model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> ideal gases, the model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> real gases and the model based on the virial equation of state. The evaluation of sound speed based on the ideal mixture concept is mentioned. The sound speed calculated by the model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> ideal gases is compared with the sound speed calculated by using the model based on the concept <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> real gases. The comparison of enthalpy end entropy based on the model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> ideal gases and the model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> real gases is performed. It is shown that the model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> real gases deviates from the model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> ideal gases only {{in the case of}} high pressure. An impossibility of the definition of partial pressure in the <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> real gases is discussed, where the virial equation of state is used...|$|R

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of,</b> those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
