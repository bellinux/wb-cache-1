Anopheles minimus <b>A</b> and <b>C</b> {{and several}} {{closely related species}} of {{mosquitoes}} {{have been identified in}} Vietnam, where some have been implicated in malaria transmission. Mor-phological variation within and between Anopheles minimus <b>A</b> and <b>C</b> makes <b>identification</b> us-ing alpha taxonomy difficult and several molecular techniques have been developed to sepa-rate them. However the difficulties of applying these techniques and the benefits of morpho-logical identification in the field have seen morphological characteristics, such as the humeral pale spot on the costa, being used to separate these two species. In this study, the morpho-logical and molecular examinations of 2, 206 specimens collected in Vietnam indicate that pale scaling on the proboscis reliably separates An. aconitus from An. minimus s. l., but hind tarsal banding cannot separate An. jeyporiensis from An. minimus s. l., and {{the presence or absence of}} the humeral pale spot is not a reliable characteristic for differentiating An. minimus <b>A</b> from <b>C</b> due to variation of this characteristic in An. minimus C. c ies: Anopheles aconitus, Anopheles jeyporiensis, Anopheles varuna, Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles pampani.

40|$|AbstractClassification, and {{particularly}} taxonomic revision, {{have not been}} generally addressed by computational models of scientific discovery. In this paper we present a framework for the automation of taxonomic revision in biological domains. This framework views taxonomy formation as an interaction of: (a) observation; (b) creation and structuring of <b>a</b> taxonomic hierarchy; (<b>c)</b> <b>identification</b> of relevant taxonomic descriptors; and (d) use of background knowledge. We describe a prototype system for taxonomic revision, ReTAX, which implements relevant aspects of such a framework. ReTAX receives as input a pre-established taxonomy, and is presented with new items which contradict in some way the original classification. Using a set of consistency criteria, ReTAX identifies the inconsistencies between the new information and the taxonomy. The system then applies a set of refinement operators to modify the taxonomy and resolve the inconsistencies. ReTAX has been tested on a botanical domain, replicating taxonomic revisions which had been suggested by professional botanists for the family Ericaceae. Finally, we propose extensions to ReTAX, which we hope {{will enable us to}} further develop the framework, and subsequently create an aid which taxonomists can use to revise existing taxonomies...|$|R

Recent studies have identified components of a gene regulatory network that underlies PMC specification and differentiation. In previous work, we identified novel gene products expressed specifically by PMCs (Illies, M. R., Peeler, M.

P 16 is not required for PMC specification, ingression, migration, or fusion, but is essential for skeletal rod elongation. We have compared the predicted sequences of P 16 from two species and show that this small, acidic protein is highly conserved in both structure and function. The predicted amino acid sequence of P 16 and the subcellular localization of a GFP-tagged form of the protein suggest that P 16 is enriched in the plasma membrane. It may function to receive signals required for skeletogenesis or may play a more direct role in the deposition of biomineral.

To date, the association between antidiabetic agents and glycemic control in this specific patient population is not well established. Purpose: This study aimed to identify antidiabetic regimens {{as well as other}} factors that associated with glycemic control in T 2 DM patients with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients and methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study involved 242 T 2 DM inpatients and outpatients with renal complications from January 2009 to March 2014 and was conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Malaysia. Glycated hemoglobin (<b>A</b> 1 <b>C)</b> was used as main parameter to assess patients’ glycemic status. Patients were classified to have good (<b>A</b> 1 <b>C</b> < 7 %) or poor glycemic control (<b>A</b> 1 <b>C</b> ≥ 7 %) based on the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association. Results: Majority of the patients presented with CKD stage 4 (43. 4 %). Approximately 55. 4 % of patients were categorized to have poor glycemic control. Insulin (57. 9 %) was the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic medication, followed by sulfonylureas (43 %). Of all antidiabetic regimens, sulfonylureas monotherapy (P< 0. 001), insulin therapy (P= 0. 005), and combination of biguanides with insulin (P= 0. 038) were found to be significantly associated with glycemic control. Other factors including duration of T 2 DM (P= 0. 004), comorbidities such as anemia (P= 0. 024) and retinopathy (P= 0. 033), concurrent medications such as erythropoietin therapy (P= 0. 047), a-blockers (P= 0. 033), and antigouts (P= 0. 003) were also correlated with <b>A</b> 1 <b>C.</b> Conclusion: <b>Identification</b> of factors that are associated with glycemic control is important to help in optimization of glucose control in T 2 DM patients with renal complication.

Different approaches could be adopted to tacklethe classification problem: statistical tools may contribute to increase the degree of confidencein the classification scheme. A classi#cation algorithm for mutual funds style analysis is proposed,which combines di 3 erent statistical techniques and exploits information readily availableat low cost. Objective, representative, consistent and empirically testable classification schemesare strongly sought for in this field in order to give reliable information to investors and fundmanagers who are interested in evaluating and comparing di 3 erent #nancial products.
