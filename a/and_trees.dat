40|$|Traditionally, {{data that}} has both linear and {{hierarchical}} structure, such as annotated linguistic data, is modeled using ordered <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> queried using <b>tree</b> automata.

We study various classes of automata over nested words, and show that while they enjoy expressiveness and succinctness benefits over word <b>and</b> <b>tree</b> automata, their analysis complexity and closure properties are analogous to the corresponding word <b>and</b> <b>tree</b> special cases. In particular, we show that finite-state nested word automata can be exponentially more succinct than <b>tree</b> automata, <b>and</b> pushdown nested word automata include the two incomparable classes of context-free word languages <b>and</b> context-free <b>tree</b> languages...|$|R

5|$|Despite these measures, the {{conservation}} of Ambohimanga is challenged by human and natural factors. The rapidly growing but relatively impoverished population around Ambohimanga occasionally engages in illegal harvesting of plants <b>and</b> <b>trees</b> from the surrounding forests, threatening {{the integrity of the}} natural environment. The forests and wooden structures on the site are also susceptible to fire. Following the 1995 destruction by fire of Ambohimanga's sister rova at Antananarivo, widely believed to have been a politically motivated arson, rumors have circulated that Ambohimanga could suffer a similar fate. Cyclone Giovanna, which passed over Madagascar in February 2012, caused considerable damage at the site. The wooden shingles of Andrianampoinimerina's house were torn off by the wind, exposing the historic objects inside to damage from the elements. The wooden fence surrounding the Mahandrihono compound was also badly damaged. Worst affected are the plants <b>and</b> <b>trees</b> at the site. Large swaths of endemic medicinal plants <b>and</b> <b>trees</b> in the forest were destroyed. Many of the sacred trees shading the royal city were uprooted, including sacred fig trees around the Fidasiana courtyard and inside the zebu pen. Two of the uprooted trees were of particular symbolic significance, having served as physical anchors for certain royal rituals since the 17th century. Shortly after the storm, OSCAR unveiled plans to plant a substitute fig for the uprooted one that had shaded the sacred stone in the Fidasiana courtyard. Most of the historic jacarandas planted over a century ago under French colonial rule were also destroyed. The extent of damage to the site has prompted traditionalists to demand renewed respect for the sanctity of the site by requesting adherence to traditional taboos put in place by Merina monarchs. These include banning pigs at the site, as well as the consumption of pork, tobacco, alcohol and cannabis {{on the grounds of the}} royal city.|$|E
40|$|In {{agricultural}} landscapes, {{patches of}} natural or semi-natural habitat are {{crucial for the}} survival of plant and animal populations, which in turn are essential to maintain ecosystem functioning. Species composition <b>and</b> diversity of <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> birds among woody habitat islands were compared in a Colombian rangeland to assess how habitat characteristics influence bird community composition, bird species traits and their potential ecosystem services. Bird <b>and</b> <b>tree</b> diversity was higher in gallery forest fragments compared to hedgerows <b>and</b> isolated <b>tree</b> islands within rangelands. Forest fragments shared over 50 % of their bird <b>and</b> <b>tree</b> species with <b>tree</b> islands <b>and</b> hedgerows, yet communities differed markedly. <b>Tree</b> islands <b>and</b> hedgerows had relatively more endozoochorous <b>and</b> small-seeded <b>tree</b> species <b>and</b> hosted birds of forest, savanna and shrubland, while forest fragments had more synzoochorous <b>and</b> large-seeded <b>tree</b> species <b>and</b> primarily hosted forest birds. Hedges <b>and</b> <b>tree</b> islands contribute to the conservation of forest bird <b>and</b> <b>tree</b> biodiversity in rangeland, but gallery forests are essential for the conservation of less tolerant forest species. The savanna rangeland acts as an ecological filter between the gallery forests and the hedges <b>and</b> <b>tree</b> islands, which in turn facilitate the spillover of tolerant forest birds and their ecological functions, including tree seed dispersal, into the rangeland, and thus support regional forest conservation and restoration. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Aims Many {{mechanisms}} of forest patterns {{have been examined}} in tropical rain forest; however, {{there are only a}} handful of similar studies on subtropical broad-leaved evergreen forest. Our objective is to analyze the main {{mechanisms of}} distribution pattern of Castanopsis eyrei and Schima superba in GTS (Gutianshan) forest plot. Methods Based on a stem map of a 24 hm 2 permanent plot in the middle subtropical broad-leaved evergreen forest at Gutianshan National Reserve, we analyzed the distribution pattern of the dominant species C. eyrei and S. superba in saplings, juvenile trees, adult <b>trees,</b> large <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> old <b>trees</b> using spatial point pattern analysis. We also examined spatial associations among different growth stages. Important findings Castanopsis eyrei and S. superba had a clustered distribution across a range of scales (0 – 100 m). Saplings, juvenile <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> adult <b>trees</b> tended to be more clumped than big trees. Old trees tended to be somewhat more clumped than big trees. Our results suggested that the two species have obvious habitat preferences at larger scales. For C. eyrei, saplings were significantly positively associated with juvenile trees at scales ≤ 100 m, as were saplings <b>and</b> adult <b>trees,</b> juvenile <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> adult <b>trees,</b> adult <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> big <b>trees.</b> Generally there was no correlation between big <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> old <b>trees</b> at scales ≤ 10 m, whereas their association tended to be positive at larger scales (10 – 100 m). Generally there were negative or no correlations between other size classes. For S. superba, the saplings were significantly positively associated with juvenile trees at scales ≤ 100 m, as were saplings <b>and</b> adult <b>trees,</b> juvenile <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> adult <b>trees.</b> Generally there were negative or no correlations between juvenile <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> old <b>trees,</b> adult <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> old <b>trees,</b> big <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> old <b>trees,</b> saplings <b>and</b> big <b>trees,</b> juvenile <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> big <b>trees,</b> adult <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> big <b>trees.</b> Generally there was negative correlation between saplings <b>and</b> old <b>trees</b> at scales ≤ 20 m, whereas their association tended to be positively at larger scales (25 – 100 m). These results suggested that dominant species facilitated coexistence of other species through emptying space for colonization of other species, which is probably attributed to density dependence or the Janzen-Connell effect. Both processes depended on species in intensity and acting time...|$|R

40|$|This chapter gives {{a general}} {{overview}} of two emerging techniques for discrete optimization that have footholds in mathematics, computer science, and operations research: branch decompositions <b>and</b> <b>tree</b> decompositions.

The dynamic programming techniques utilizing branch decompositions <b>and</b> <b>tree</b> decompositions, called branch decomposition <b>and</b> <b>tree</b> decomposition based algorithms, fall into a class of algorithms known as fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and {{have been shown to}} be effective in a practical setting for NP-hard problems such as minimum domination, the travelling salesman problem, general minor containment, and frequency assignment problems...|$|R
