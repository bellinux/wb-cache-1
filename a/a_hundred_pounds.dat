5|$|By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a {{subscription}} of 1,000 shillings to be {{contributed to the}} Gould testimonial. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) complained and the IRFB reacted by informing the WFU that only a plate up {{to the value of}} <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>pounds</b> sterling could be given to Gould, and that the remaining funds should be donated to charity; otherwise Wales would lose their international fixtures. The WFU stood down and withdrew their subscription. The reaction in Wales was one of anger, with the people feeling that the WFU had bowed to English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people's wishes.|$|E
5|$|On 7 and 8 March 1894, he {{experimented with}} {{expanding}} his shows {{and held his}} first Cat conformation show. The first show had over 600 entries, becoming easily the biggest of its kind so far, with patrons that included the Duchess of Newcastle, the Countess de Sefton and Lady de Trafford. The publication Fur and Feather praised the new venture and encouraged more. Crufts however wasn't so sure as the initial show had lost over <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>pounds,</b> and entries {{in some of the}} classes were restricted to only a handful of cats. He held a second show in March 1895, which once again Fur and Feather heaped praise upon, despite the cutbacks that Cruft had initiated to make the show more profitable. Fur and Feather announced in March 1896 that the cat show had been postponed due to Cruft's other business commitments, but he never went on to run such a show again.|$|E
25|$|Regulations {{introduced}} for Tobacco in 1926 and Cotton in 1934 {{required the}} registration of African peasant growers on Native Trust Land; the first also created the Native Tobacco Board (NTB). Settler demands for {{the regulation of}} the peasant tobacco and cotton sectors were partly motivated by fears that profitable smallholder farming could reduce the availability of cheap African labour for the estates. The Nyasaland administration did not encourage independent peasant tobacco production in the Southern Province where most settler estates were located, and it tolerated the Native Tobacco Board operating to preserve and promote settler tobacco interests. The formation of the Native Tobacco Board stimulated African production in the Central Region, but registered growers paid heavily for it. At first, the Board charged a levy of thirty pence <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>pounds</b> of tobacco, 10% of the price it paid growers. In 1930, this was raised to {{one third of the}} price paid to meet increased costs. In the Second World War and after the Board recovered its costs and underpaid growers, retaining between 25% and 35% of the auction prices it obtained to meet costs equal to only 15% to 20% of those prices. In 1930-1931, the Native Tobacco Board had 29,515 registered growers in the Central Region, where it purchased 4.9 million pounds of tobacco. The number of growers varied with demand until the Second World War when it expanded markedly. The Board had fewer growers in the Southern Province, partly because of European growers’ opposition. The Native Tobacco Board (later renamed the African Tobacco Board) limited tobacco growing by smallholders by imposing heavy dues until demand and prices rose after the war, when these dues became proportionately lower.|$|E

500|$|After {{the more}} {{produced}} Rings Around the World, which {{relied heavily on}} computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power [...] "a little more human" [...] with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: [...] "with technology {{you can do anything}} these days, but sometimes less is more". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded [...] "pretty good right from the start" [...] which also contributed to the decision to avoid [...] "over-tweak them in the studio". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of [...] "sound effect and light music" [...] vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: [...] "he knocked on the door just as we were beginning the album: [...] "hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?"

This chapter also includes an incomplete description of Blake's method of illuminated printing. The description begins in the middle, with at least one preceding page missing, as Quid explains his method to Mrs. Gittipin; [...] "... them Illuminating the Manuscript-Ay said she that would be excellent.

[...] He was also {{a friend of the}} Duke of Clarence (later William IV), and during the 1832 reform crisis was placed on the King's private list of those to be made peers. [...] However, several Government ministers opposed his appointment on the grounds of his close association with his American relatives, and his name was dropped from the list. Coffin was a noted patron of charities, and a few weeks before his death donated <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>pounds</b> to the Royal Naval Charity, with the note that he did so 'fearful I might suddenly slip my wind, and in the hurry of my departure forget to order ... £100 to be set aside. Elizabeth Coffin died on 27 January 1839, with Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin dying sixth months later on 23 July 1839, at the age of 80. He was buried at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. As he had no sons, the baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} seventies, Jones {{spiraled}} out of control. [...] Already drinking constantly, a manager named Shug Baggot {{introduced him to}} cocaine before a show {{because he was too}} tired to perform. [...] The drug would increase Jones' already considerable paranoia. [...] During one drunken binge he shot at, and very nearly hit, his friend and occasional songwriting partner Earl [...] "Peanutt" [...] Montgomery after Montgomery had quit drinking after finding religion. [...] He was often penniless and acknowledged in his autobiography that Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash came to his financial aid during this time. [...] Jones also began missing shows at an alarming rate and lawsuits from promoters started piling up. [...] In 1978, owing Wynette $36,000 in child support and claiming to be one million dollars in debt, he filed for bankruptcy. [...] Jones appeared incoherent at times, speaking in quarrelling voices that he would later call [...] "the Duck" [...] and [...] "the Old Man". [...] In his article [...] "The Devil In George Jones", Nick Tosches states, [...] "By February 1979 he was homeless, deranged, and destitute, living in his car and barely able to digest the junk food on which he subsisted. [...] He weighed under <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>pounds,</b> and his condition was so bad that it took him more than two years to complete My Very Special Guests, an album on which Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Elvis Costello, and other famous fans came to his vocal aid and support. [...] Jones entered Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. [...] Upon his release in January 1980, {{the first thing he did}} was pick up a six-pack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jardine, one {{of seven}} children, was born in 1784 on a small farm near Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. [...] His father, Andrew Jardine (abt. 1750- d. 1793), {{died when he was}} nine, leaving the family in some {{economic}} difficulty. Though struggling to make ends meet, Jardine's older brother David (1776-1827) provided him with money to attend school. Jardine began to acquire credentials at the age of sixteen. In 1800 he entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School where he took classes in anatomy, medical practice, and obstetrics among others. While his schooling was in progress, Jardine was apprenticed to a surgeon who would provide housing, food, and the essential acquaintance with a hospital practice, with the money his older brother, David, provided. He graduated from the Edinburgh Medical School on 2 March 1802, and was presented a full diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He chose to join the service of the British East India Company and in 1802 at the age of 18 boarded the East Indiaman Brunswick. On 15March, after satisfying the entry requirements, William Jardine, was paid two months advanced wages as a surgeon's mate in the East India Company’s Maritime Marine Service. One advantage of service with the East India Company was that employees were allowed to trade in goods on their own account. Each employee was allowed cargo space equivalent to two chests or about <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>pounds</b> of cargo. Jardine engaged in this trade with exceptional dexterity, even leasing the apportioned cargo space of other crew members who did not have interest in using the space, and was able to save quite an amount of money.|$|E
