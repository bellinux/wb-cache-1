500|$|The {{episode is}} {{presented}} in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar (Buffy). Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move {{through the house and}} calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, [...] "We're not supposed to move the body!" [...] Both Gellar and Trachtenberg (Dawn) were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, [...] "you try to separate it <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can {{and at the same time}} it adds that extra layer". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar [...] "at a fever pitch", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure.|$|E

5000|$|The 1928 book So Disdained by Nevil Shute — a novel {{based on}} this author's deep {{interest}} in and thorough knowledge of aviation — includes a monologue by a veteran pilot, preserving the atmosphere of these pioneering times: [...] "We used to fly on the Paris route, from Hounslow to Le Bourget and get through <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> could. Later we moved on to Croydon. (...) We carried the much advertised Air Mails. That meant the machines had to fly whether there were passengers to be carried or not. It was left to {{the discretion of the}} pilot whether or not the flight should be cancelled in bad weather; the pilots were dead keen on flying in the most impossible conditions. Sanderson got killed this way at Douinville. And all he had in the machine was a couple of picture postcards from trippers in Paris, sent to their families as a curiosity. That was the Air Mail. No passengers or anything — just the mail".|$|R
