5|$|Graham {{was born}} in Ulmarra, New South Wales, on 23 October 1920, and was educated at Grafton High School. Highly intelligent, he did well at school and {{achieved}} a high position in the Leaving Certificate. After joining the Australian Army in January 1938, {{at the age of}} 19 he graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon (RMC) in August 1940, following the outbreak of the Second World War. He was subsequently allocated to the <b>Armoured</b> <b>Corps</b> as a regular officer in the Permanent Military Force (PMF) with the rank of lieutenant. At Duntroon Graham had excelled academically and was known for his unorthodox and innovative tactical solutions to military problems. Top of his graduating class, he received the Kings Medal for his achievements. Shortly after his commissioning he married Joyce Lawrence of Canberra on 20 August 1940, and the couple later had two sons—Stuart born in 1941, and Ray born in 1944.|$|E
5|$|On 6 February 1956, {{the then}} Governor General, Field Marshal Sir William Slim, {{presented}} the regiment with its Guidon at a Regimental Parade held in Puckapunyal. Also in 1956 the regiment {{was equipped with}} the Centurion armoured recovery vehicle, allowing the retirement of the Churchill recovery vehicle. Following {{the expansion of the}} Royal Australian <b>Armoured</b> <b>Corps</b> (RAAC) in 1960, A Squadron was disbanded, reducing the regiment to two squadrons, and the majority of its personnel formed regular squadrons in the 4th/19th Prince of Wales' Light Horse and the 2nd/14th Light Horse (Queensland Mounted Infantry), which were predominantly CMF formations. These squadrons subsequently became part of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, which was later redesignated the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and in turn provided the nucleus for the newly raised 3rd Cavalry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army's pre-war {{doctrine}} {{was focused}} on conventional warfare in a European environment. This doctrine and the supporting training manuals were common to those of all Commonwealth countries. Following the outbreak of war the Army continued to focus on preparing its units to fight in Europe and North Africa. By far the single greatest difficulty in training in the early war years was the shortage of equipment. However, there were also critical shortages of instructors. The decision to form the 1st Armoured Division created a requirement for large numbers of highly skilled personnel, but there were few officers and men with the required skills in the small pre-war Army {{and many of them}} were already serving in the AIF's divisional mechanised cavalry regiments. An Armoured Fighting Vehicles School was created at Puckapunyal, Victoria, in 1941, and in March 1943, the <b>Armoured</b> <b>Corps</b> Training Centre was moved there.|$|E
50|$|After {{the victory}} at Alam Halfa, Montgomery {{prepared}} {{to go on the}} offensive. He brought more troops, including the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and experienced 4th Indian Infantry Division, to reinforce XXX Corps and also assigned the 2nd New Zealand Division from XIII Corps along with its 9th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade. XXX <b>Corps</b> was then involved in extensive retraining, as it was to make a major push and create a corridor for the tanks of X Corps to break through.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, the Iraqi Army placed {{an emphasis on}} the use of light wheeled vehicles for reconnaissance, particularly Soviet-manufactured BRDM-2 and French-designed Panhard AML <b>armoured</b> cars. Each <b>corps</b> had an attached BRDM or AML battalion. These were allocated by division; every brigade headquarters and regular infantry battalion received a platoon of six. The Iraqis did not make competent use of these assets during the Gulf War, opting to depend on signals intelligence against the comparatively sophisticated Coalition.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s, the {{decision}} was taken to expand the Royal Tank Corps ("Royal" [...] had {{been added to the}} regimental title in 1923). Two Royal Tank <b>Corps</b> <b>armoured</b> car companies in Egypt, the 3rd and 5th, were brought together and reformed as 6th Battalion, Royal Tank Corps. However, this unit was understrength - it only consisted of two companies - and was not brought up to full strength with a third company until early 1939, by which time it had been renamed the 6th Royal Tank Regiment.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time {{each of the four}} {{divisions}} in the 2nd AIF was authorised a cavalry reconnaissance regiment equipped with light tanks and scout carriers. While all four divisions were authorised a divisional cavalry regiment, only three regiments were eventually formed as it was believed that the 8th Division did not need armoured support in Malaya due to concerns about operating tanks in the jungle. The cavalry regiments of the 2nd AIF divisions operating in Mediterranean theatre against Italian and German forces were initially equipped with the Universal Carrier and unarmoured trucks before being progressively mechanised using British Army equipment, while carriers were also operated by the infantry battalions. A light armoured tracked vehicle they were armed with Bren light machine guns and Boys anti-tank rifles and were widely used by British Commonwealth forces during the World War II. Meanwhile, the Australian Tank Corps was superseded following the formation of the Australian <b>Armoured</b> <b>Corps</b> in July 1941. In October 1941 two independent light tank squadrons had been formed for service in Malaya; however, neither was deployed {{due to a lack of}} vehicles to equip them.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{entry into}} the war in late 1941 stopped plans for the {{deployment}} of Australian armour to the Middle East. By the beginning of 1943 the Australian <b>Armoured</b> <b>Corps</b> was at its peak with 1,460 tanks on strength, {{the majority of them}} Matildas and light and medium M3s. Meanwhile, 65 production AC1 vehicles and one AC3 had been completed by June 1943. That year, the 3rd Army Tank Battalion was equipped with a squadron of AC1 tanks, which were modified to resemble German tanks and used in the filming of the movie, The Rats of Tobruk. This appears to have been the only time a squadron of Sentinels was used for any purpose. Nevertheless, the completed Sentinel tanks were used for evaluation purposes only and were not issued to operational armoured units, as the Australian Cruiser tank program was terminated in July 1943. By this time the Japanese threat had lessened, and US and British-made M3 Grant and Matilda tanks were being supplied to Australia from the Middle East, and it was felt that Australia's manufacturing resources would be better spent on railway locomotive production.|$|E
5|$|Major General Stuart Clarence Graham AO, DSO, OBE, MC (23 October 1920 – 20 July 1996) was {{a senior}} officer in the Australian Army, seeing service during the Second World War, the Occupation of Japan and the Vietnam War. Born in 1920, he {{graduated}} from the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1940. Graham subsequently held a series of regimental and staff appointments, serving in a number of infantry and armoured units during the Second World War. In the post-war period he served in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, and held a number of staff and command positions in the <b>Armoured</b> <b>Corps.</b> In the late 1950s he was posted to Army Headquarters, and later served as Director of Military Intelligence. Commanding the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) during fighting in South Vietnam during 1967, he was responsible for establishing the controversial barrier minefield from Dat Do to the coast. Later, Graham filled a range of senior command, staff and diplomatic roles in Australia and overseas, including the position of Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS), before retiring in 1977. He died in 1996.|$|E
5|$|An early {{problem was}} whether {{to adopt the}} British or Australian {{organisation}}. In 1939 the British Army {{was in the process}} of re-equipping with new weapons, and a new organisation was required. This new equipment was not available in Australia, so it was decided to organise the first unit to be raised—the 6th Division—with some elements of the old organisation and some of the new. Consequently, the 6th Division was raised as an infantry division of around 18,000 personnel, and initially comprised twelve 900-man infantry battalions each consisting of four rifle companies, a battalion headquarters, regimental aid post and a headquarters company with various support platoons and sections including signals, mortars, carriers, pioneers, anti-aircraft and administration. Artillery support was provided by three field regiments, each attached at brigade-level, as well an anti-tank regiment attached at divisional level and a divisional cavalry regiment which was equipped with <b>armoured</b> vehicles. <b>Corps</b> troops included a machine-gun battalion, and various engineer, logistics and communication units.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the costly}} failure of Operation Battleaxe, General Archibald Wavell was {{relieved}} as Commander-in-Chief Middle East Command {{and replaced by}} General Claude Auchinleck. The Western Desert Force was reorganised and renamed the Eighth Army {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham and at this stage, the division comprised only two brigades. The plan for Operation Crusader (See Map 2) was to engage the Afrika Korps with the 7th Armoured Division while the 1st SA Division and the 22 Guards Brigade covered their left flank. Meanwhile, on their right, XIII Corps, supported by 4th Armoured Brigade (detached from 7th Armoured Division), would make a clockwise flanking advance west of Sidi Omar and hold position threatening the rear of the line of Axis defensive strongpoints which ran east from Sidi Omar to the coast at Halfaya. Central to the plan was the destruction of the Axis armour by 7th Armoured Division to allow the relatively lightly <b>armoured</b> XIII <b>Corps</b> to advance north to Bardia along the coast while XXX Corps continued northwest to Tobruk and link up with a planned break-out by the 70th Division.|$|R
25|$|The Royal Australian Engineers (RAE) is a {{corps of}} the Australian Army (although the word corps {{does not appear}} in their name or on their badge). The RAE is ranked fourth in {{seniority}} of the corps of the Australian Army, behind the Staff Cadets, <b>Armoured</b> and Artillery <b>Corps.</b> The corps was formed by the amalgamation of the various colonial engineer corps of the states and territories of Australia in 1902 and since then has served in various conflicts including World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War. The corps has also served on numerous peacekeeping operations and was heavily involved in the Australian contribution to the war in Afghanistan.|$|R
