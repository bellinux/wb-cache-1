In view of the importance of advertising in the modern economy, it is desirable that such a body of theorems be worked out. The objective of this study is the formulation of a theory of consumer demand with variable preferences; the governing criterion is that the theory be applicable in econometric demand analysis;The assumption that the individual consumer has only one ordinal utility function is replaced by the assumption that he has a whole family of ordinal utility functions; advertising expenditures by sellers of commodities are assumed to determine which one of these ordinal utility functions is maximized. From these assumptions are derived a number of a priori restraints on measurements defining <b>advertising</b> <b>elasticities</b> of demand. It is shown that <b>advertising</b> <b>elasticities</b> are weighted averages of elasticities of substitution between goods in consumption, the weights being measurements defining <b>advertising</b> <b>elasticities</b> of marginal utilities;Estimates of empirical <b>advertising</b> <b>elasticities</b> of demand for tobacco are presented along with estimates of the elasticity of marginal utility of tobacco with respect to advertising expenditure.

5000|$|The Dorfman-Steiner theorem (or Dorfman-Steiner condition) is a neoclassical {{economics}} theorem {{which looks}} for the optimal level of advertising that a firm should undertake. The theorem is named after Robert Dorfman and Peter O. Steiner who developed the approach in their widely cited 1954 article in the American Economic Review. Firms can increase their sales by either decreasing {{the price of the}} good or persuading consumers to buy more by increasing advertising expenditure. The optimal level of advertising for a firm is found where the ratio of advertising to sales equals the price-cost margin times the <b>advertising</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand. The obvious result is that the greater the degree of sensitivity of quantity demanded to advertising and the greater the margin on the extra output then the higher the level of advertising.|$|E

Additional contributions include examining the effects of the Master Settlement Agreement, and studying the dynamic effects of advertising and smoking. Findings show that U.

Methods: We conducted an internet survey {{of a national}} sample of 1031 youth, ages 13 – 20, who had consumed alcohol in the past 30 days. We ascertained all of the alcohol brands respondents con-sumed in the past 30 days, as well as which of 20 popular television shows they had viewed during that time period. Using a negative binomial regression model, we examined the relationship be-tween aggregated brand-specific exposure to alcohol advertising on the 20 television shows [ad stock, measured in gross rating points (GRPs) ] and youth brand-consumption prevalence, while controlling for the average price and overall market share of each brand.

The analysis is based on estimated fluid milk and cheese demand equations and on an analysis of optimal reallocations between generic and brand advertising expenditures.
