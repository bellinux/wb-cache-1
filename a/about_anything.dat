5|$|The two {{go ahead}} with their plans to meet Alex, who brings along his friend, Junior (Chaddha) to the hotel. The group discuss their lives over supper, which is cut short by an {{argument}} between Alex and Sahil over the former's irresponsible behaviour. The four {{head back to the}} hotel room to collect Sahil's belongings, as Jai plans to leave later that night. Alex notices the guitar and later forces Sahil to play for him, to which Sahil obliges with an original song. Alex dances with Jai, who looks even more impressed with Sahil's artistry. Alex offers to take back Sahil's belongings and give the two some more time together. When he leaves, Sahil and Jai embrace, but do not talk <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> that had happened.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> motives, and I don't care <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> motives. Do {{you mean}} to tell me that you have come here to {{threaten}} me with deserting me?" ...|$|R
60|$|The MOONSTONE is frightfully interesting: isn't {{the detective}} prime? Don't say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the plot; for I have only read {{on to the}} end of Betteredge's narrative, so don't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it yet.|$|R
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> except the truth right here.|$|E

25|$|George Findlay (series creator Ken Finkleman), the {{executive}} producer of City Hour, is a venal, petty man who cares only about his sex life, his lunch orders and his personal image within the network's bureaucracy. Although exceptionally intelligent, he is highly self-absorbed and utterly unconcerned <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> besides himself.|$|E
25|$|The {{holdfast}} {{can also}} be used for clamping work {{to the side of the}} bench for jointing. If the legs on your base are not too far under the top, simply bore a hole in the side of the leg and use the holdfast horizontally. A woodworker can do just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> he needs on a bench with only a planing stop and a holdfast or two.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Bridgwater celebrations {{consisted of}} a large bonfire at the Cornhill. Built out of a large wooden boat, around one hundred tar barrels were added, together with just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else available which could be burned. This tradition was stopped {{due to lack of}} old wooden boats to burn, and because a number of good boats were thrown onto the fire and burnt by over-enthusiastic revellers.|$|E
25|$|He {{then went}} on to {{characterize}} pragmatism as promoting not only a method of clarifying ideas but also as endorsing a particular theory of truth. Peirce rejected this latter move by James, preferring to describe the pragmatic maxim only as a maxim of logic and pragmatism as a methodological stance, explicitly denying that it was a substantive doctrine or theory <b>about</b> <b>anything,</b> truth or otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Opossum (Didelphis virginiana) — {{common in}} wooded areas, farmland, drier areas of wetlands, {{rural areas and}} in some other {{habitats}} in the state; came to Connecticut from {{the south in the}} early twentieth century, a movement likely helped by its attraction to human-created food sources such as crops and trash, although it eats just <b>about</b> <b>anything,</b> including carrion. Many are run over on Connecticut roads.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't know a word. I'm very stupid <b>about</b> {{studying}} <b>anything,</b> can't bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language," [...] was the brusque reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect I shall {{know them}} better when I get to taste them," [...] Bob had urged, in excuse. [...] "When you don't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the wines, {{it is very}} {{difficult}} to take an interest in them. It is like learning that a town in India is on the Ganges. You don't care <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the town, and you don't care <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the Ganges; and you are sure to mix it up, next time, with some other town on some other river." ...|$|R

25|$|In 2008, Baywords was {{launched}} {{as a free}} blogging service that lets users of the site blog <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> {{as long as it}} does not break any Swedish laws. In December, The Pirate Bay resurrected ShareReactor as a combined eD2k and BitTorrent site. The same month, the Vio mobile video converter was released, designed to convert video files for playback on mobile devices such as iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, many Nokia and Windows Mobile devices.|$|E
25|$|Reformed theologians {{believe that}} God {{communicates}} knowledge of himself to {{people through the}} Word of God. People {{are not able to}} know anything about God except through this self-revelation. Speculation <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> which God has not revealed through his Word is not warranted. The knowledge people have of God is different from that which they have of anything else because God is infinite, and finite people are incapable of comprehending an infinite being. While the knowledge revealed by God to people is never incorrect, it is also never comprehensive.|$|E
25|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{the notion}} of an inertial frame. For example, an observer confined in a free-falling lift will assert that he himself is a valid inertial frame, even if he is accelerating under gravity, so long as he has no knowledge <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> outside the lift. So, strictly speaking, inertial frame is a relative concept. With this in mind, we can define inertial frames collectively as a set of frames which are stationary or moving at constant velocity with respect to each other, so that a single inertial frame is defined as an element of this set.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{had better}} ask {{yourself}} what it means," [...] Arnold replied. [...] "For Ruth's sake, Isaac, don't {{have anything to}} do with that man. I don't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> him--I don't want to know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> him. I simply beg you, for Ruth's sake, to keep out of trouble." ...|$|R

25|$|As a 13-year-old {{high school}} student, Bowers's {{interests}} included reptiles, scouting, short-wave radio, Strombecker kit models of World War II airplanes, and rocks and minerals. During this time Bowers {{became interested in}} the written word. He received Raymond L. Ditmars' Reptiles of North America from his mother as a Christmas gift in 1952. According to Bowers, Ditmars, who was curator of reptiles at the New York Zoological Garden (Bronx Zoo), had a way of making just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> sound fascinating. From such experiences, Bowers learned the power of the written word and how it can spur one to a great enthusiasm for acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Such was {{the extent}} and {{efficacy}} of his preparation of the script that almost no line of dialogue was eliminated in the final edit of the film. Except for some exterior night shots, Huston shot the entire film in sequence, which greatly helped his actors. The shooting went so smoothly that there was actually extra time for the cast to enjoy themselves; Huston brought Bogart, Astor, Bond, Lorre and others to the Lakeside Golf Club near the Warner lot to relax in the pool, dine, drink and talk until midnight <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> other than the film they were working on.|$|E
25|$|Operation Banquet was a British plan to {{use every}} {{available}} aircraft to repel a threatened German invasion in 1940 or 1941. During the Second World War, in May 1940, the Air Ministry realised that beyond the normal reserves of the Royal Air Force (RAF), {{it may be necessary}} to throw everything into a last-ditch battle for British liberty. To this end, the Air Ministry planned to use just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> that could fly. On 17 May 1940, an Air Ministry meeting outlined a series of ambitious plans to make use of various aircraft in the event of an invasion.|$|E
