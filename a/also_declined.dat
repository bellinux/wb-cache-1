5|$|In the meantime, Brauer {{was working}} on {{recruiting}} a cast but with little success. The actors being considered for the lead role of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer included Gustaf Gründgens, Rene Deltgen, Rudolf Fernau, Richard Häusler, Siegfried Bräuer, Paul Dahlke and Ferdinand Marian. Gründgens declined, citing his responsibilities {{as director of the}} Prussian State Theatre. Marian <b>also</b> <b>declined.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mugabe's initial {{calls for}} racial {{reconciliation}} failed to stem deteriorating race relations and growing white flight. Relations with Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) <b>also</b> <b>declined,</b> with Mugabe crushing ZAPU-linked opposition in Matabeleland during the Gukurahundi between 1982 and 1985; at least 10,000 people, mostly Ndebele civilians, {{were killed by}} Mugabe's Fifth Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Sunday's {{popularity}} waned after World War I, {{when many}} people in his revival audiences were attracted to radio broadcasts and moving pictures instead. The Sundays' health <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> even as they continued to drive themselves through rounds of revivals—smaller but also with fewer staff members to assist them.|$|E
50|$|Adyghe <b>also</b> <b>declines</b> nouns {{into four}} {{different}} cases, each with corresponding suffixes: absolutive, ergative, instrumental, and Adverbial.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{adjectival}} pronouns <b>also</b> <b>decline</b> like der: all-, dies-, jed-, jen-, manch-, solch-, welch-. These {{are sometimes}} referred to as der-words.|$|R
50|$|Pangolins are {{the most}} heavily trafficked CITES-protected mammal. The two other Asian species of {{pangolins}} (Manis javanica and Manis pentadactyla) are <b>also</b> <b>declining</b> due to the market in Chinese traditional medicine.|$|R
5|$|A later La Brea pits study {{compared}} tooth breakage of dire {{wolves in}} two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP. The {{results showed that}} the 15,000YBP dire wolves had three times more tooth breakage than the 13,000YBP dire wolves, whose breakage matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had <b>also</b> <b>declined.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the New Waddell Dam was constructed, {{two phases}} of a {{three-phase}} study {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of the dam on fisheries. Completed in 2005, the third phase of the study determined that the larger reservoir has less nutrient concentrations due to CAP water introduction and that water fluctuations have reduced fish cover, likely affecting food and spawning. Large mouth bass populations have <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> but striped bass have entered the lake, likely by eggs transferred through CAP water. Around the lake, Reclamation has taken steps to protect wildlife habitats, including those for bald eagles and Gila topminnows.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{the then}} Governor of Madras offered to make Sastri the Acting Chief Minister of Madras Presidency but Sastri {{declined}} the offer. He <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> {{an offer of}} membership in the council of the Secretary of State for India. In 1921, the Freedom of the City of London was conferred on Srinivasa Sastri. This {{was followed by the}} Freedom of the City of Edinburgh on 9 January 1931.|$|E
5000|$|In a deleted {{scene from}} [...] "New Leads", Creed asks Andy for $10,000, but Andy declines, and offers {{something}} else. Creed asks for Andy's hairpiece and $500, which Andy <b>also</b> <b>declines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Korean {{version is}} <b>also</b> <b>declining</b> {{due to the}} {{decrease}} in the number of players and lack of progression in the gameplay story and may face a shut down in the near future.|$|R
5000|$|... 2.b3 {{leads to}} the Réti Gambit after 2...d5 3.Bb2 dxe4, but Black can <b>also</b> <b>decline</b> it with 3...Nf6 4.e5 Nd7 with White going for f4 and Qg4 before putting the knight on f3.|$|R
5|$|Overall, {{the war had}} a {{significantly}} {{negative impact on the}} Australia economy. Real aggregate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined by 9.5 per cent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 per cent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> sharply, falling by 16 per cent.|$|E
5|$|The oribi {{has been}} {{classified}} as Least Concern by the IUCN. The total population (as of 2008) {{is estimated at}} 750,000. However, the subspecies O. o. haggardi is listed as Vulnerable because, as of 2008, the total population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals, and is feared to be declining. Hunting is a relatively minor threat, since the oribi shows some tolerance to hunting. Nevertheless, the steep fall of 92% in oribi populations in Comoé National Park (Côte d'Ivoire) {{has been attributed to}} poaching. Numbers have <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> due to agricultural expansion and competition from livestock.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{contract with}} ESRO lasted until 1 July 1974, when their low-Earth orbit program terminated. NTNF proposed closing Tromsø Telemetry Station as the remaining customers {{did not provide}} sufficient revenue to keep operations viable. Norway <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> to join the European Space Agency (ESA), which resulted in little hope in ESA choosing to cooperate with a Norwegian earth station. NTNF also looked into outright selling the station to ESA, but the offer was turned down. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station was closed in 1974.|$|E
50|$|Black can <b>also</b> <b>decline</b> the pawn with 3...Nc6, {{transposing}} {{into the}} Two Knights Defense. He must, however, {{be willing to}} offer a gambit himself after 4.Ng5. White may invite {{an offshoot of the}} Boden-Kieseritzky Gambit with 4.0-0 Nxe4 5.Nc3.|$|R
50|$|Geneva College has {{appeared}} in seven post season bowl games. The Golden Tornadoes have had good success, going 6-1 all-time in bowl games. The Golden Tornadoes have <b>also</b> <b>decline</b> two bowl invitations. (2000 Victory Bowl and 2007 ECAC Bowl).|$|R
50|$|Apart from emigration, the Iraqi Christians are <b>also</b> <b>declining</b> due {{to lower}} rates of birth and higher death rates than their Muslim compatriots. Also since the {{invasion}} of Iraq, Assyrians and Armenians have been targeted by Islamist extremist organisations.|$|R
5|$|A {{group of}} Cuban revolutionaries led by Venezuelan adventurer Narciso López {{intended}} to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule by the sword. Searching {{for a military}} leader for a filibuster expedition, they first offered command of the Cuban forces to General William J. Worth, but he died before making his decision. In the summer of 1849, López visited Davis {{and asked him to}} lead the expedition. He offered an immediate payment of $100,000 (worth more than $2,000,000 in 2013), plus the same amount when Cuba was liberated. Davis turned down the offer, stating that it was inconsistent with his duty as a senator. When asked to recommend someone else, Davis suggested Robert E. Lee, then an army major in Baltimore; López approached Lee, who <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> on the grounds of his duty.|$|E
5|$|After Victory Road, Samoa Joe and Booker T {{continued}} their rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the July17 episode of Impact, Management Director Jim Cornette demanded that Booker T give the championship back to Joe, who {{was recognized as}} the official champion by TNA. Booker T refused this demand, while Joe <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> the offer as he felt he did not deserve to hold the title due to being pinned at the event. Due to these feelings, Cornette instead scheduled a rematch between the two for the championship at TNA's next PPV event Hard Justice on August10. On the July24 episode of Impact!, Joe challenged Booker T to contest their rematch in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match, which Booker T accepted after adding that weapons would be allowed in the match. Joe defeated Booker T at the event to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|Elijah Hise, Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, was {{the leading}} {{candidate}} for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but after the Whig nomination of Crittenden, Hise withdrew from consideration. The Democratic state convention then nominated Congressman Linn Boyd, but Boyd <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> the nomination. The Democrats were finally able to nominate Henderson lawyer Lazarus W. Powell. As Crittenden canvassed the state, his opponents charged him with disloyalty to Clay because he refused to support him in the 1848 election. Crittenden maintained that he supported Clay for the presidency over anyone else, but he had believed that Clay {{did not intend to}} seek the Whig nomination in 1848. After Clay announced his candidacy, Crittenden said, he remained neutral in the Whigs' choice. In the gubernatorial election, Crittenden defeated Powell by a vote of 65,860 to 57,397. He resigned his Senate seat to assume the governorship.|$|E
50|$|Aromobates alboguttatus is {{threatened}} by habitat loss caused by agriculture, involving both crops and livestock, {{as well as by}} logging. Introduced trout are also a threat. It is <b>also</b> <b>declining</b> in undisturbed habitats, suggesting additional threats such as disease (e.g., chytridiomycosis).|$|R
30|$|Additionally, milk {{production}} and therefore butter and cheese production <b>also</b> <b>decline</b> in quantity by autumn. Similarly, by spring the milk gets spoilt faster, and many flies not only bother {{the animals and}} herders alike but also get into the food.|$|R
50|$|The {{number and}} rate of youth {{appearing}} in court is <b>also</b> <b>declining,</b> with only the most serious cases reaching court. Nearly 80% of child and youth cases are dealt with by FGCs or police alternative actions, including diversions, before reaching court.|$|R
5|$|Traditional Protestant historiography {{tended to}} stress the {{corruption}} and unpopularity of the late Medieval Scottish church, but more recent research has indicated {{the ways in which}} it met the spiritual needs of different social groups. Historians have discerned a decline of monastic life in this period, with many religious houses keeping smaller numbers of monks, and those remaining often abandoning communal living for a more individual and secular lifestyle. The rate of new monastic endowments from the nobility <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> in the fifteenth century. In contrast, the burghs saw the flourishing of mendicant orders of friars in the later fifteenth century, who, unlike the older monastic orders, placed an emphasis on preaching and ministering to the population. The order of Observant Friars were organised as a Scottish province from 1467 and the older Franciscans and the Dominicans were recognised as separate provinces in the 1480s.|$|E
5|$|Uma {{decides to}} go on a fast and relents to none of the family member's request to quit. Hari, left with no other option, {{explains}} his behaviour. Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time, he took a vow that he would not let any other man touch Uma. Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> Tara's request of their marriage. When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him, he stopped talking to her, in spite of his love towards Uma.|$|E
5|$|Both Virginia Tech and Clemson endured {{questions}} about their coaching staffs {{in the weeks and}} months prior to the Gator Bowl. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was interviewed by North Carolina prior to the end of the regular season, and he debated whether or not to accept that school's head football coaching job. On November 27, one week before Tech's selection by the Gator Bowl, Beamer announced that he would not be departing for North Carolina or any other school. Beamer also was considered for the vacant head-coaching position with the NFL's Washington Redskins, but he <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> that position. Other Virginia Tech football coaches were targeted by teams to fill vacant head-coaching positions. Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle was interviewed for a job at Toledo, but he declined the position. Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster was interviewed for the head-coaching job at Virginia, but he likewise declined the job.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 January it was {{announced}} that TRT had reached a preliminary agreement with maNga to enter Eurovision, with Aydin <b>also</b> <b>declining</b> Eurovision participation in 2010. [...] On 12 January TRT confirmed that maNga would enter Eurovision for Turkey in May.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{abandoned}} mercury mine in Sızma with the ore grade of 0.6 to 1% {{that was once}} a major economic activity of the town. Likewise carpet weaving is <b>also</b> <b>declining.</b> Presently, the main economic activity is agriculture (cereals) and animal husbandry.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, he {{returned}} to the Calgary Stampeders as head coach. He held this position for three years, making the playoffs in each, but with the team's record <b>also</b> <b>declining</b> each season. He was fired after a first round loss during the 2007 playoffs.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, on other occasions, the problem would simply be ignored. The royal eyres, courts which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. The power of royal sheriffs <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> during Henry's reign. They were now often lesser men appointed by the exchequer, rather than coming from important local families, and they focused on generating revenue for the King. Their robust attempts to enforce fines and collect debts generated much unpopularity among the lower classes. Unlike his father, Henry did not exploit the large debts that the barons frequently owed to the Crown, and was slow to collect any sums of money due to him.|$|E
5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s and 1860s, {{the quality}} of the ponies was noted to be declining, a result of poor choice of {{breeding}} stallions, and the introduction of Arab to improve the breed was recommended. The census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing the Forest, and by 1884 the number had dropped to 2,250. Profits from the sale of young ponies affected the number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years. The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s, resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies, or to the increase in the profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies. The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies' natural landrace hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter. Numbers of ponies on the Forest <b>also</b> <b>declined</b> as a result of demand for more refined-looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to the introduction of motor vehicles. Later, the Second World War drove up the demand for, and thus, the market value of, young animals for horse meat.|$|E
30|$|We also {{calculate}} {{the standard deviation}} of the regional minimum wages. Because this measure depends {{on the level of}} minimum wages, it increases. Once we use the nature of minimum wages, the standard deviation <b>also</b> <b>declines,</b> which is consistent with the results we report in the paper.|$|R
30|$|The {{permitted}} {{amount of}} new calls increases when σ is fixed and ψ increases. The remaining capacity of cell 1 <b>also</b> <b>declines.</b> The adaptive coding probability of handover connection requests with a type 2 service gradually increases while the remaining capacity of cell 1 gradually decreases.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, White {{can offer}} a second pawn with 5.Qxf3. Gary Lane argued in 2000 that White has serious {{problems}} proving enough compensation for the sacrificed pawns after 5... Qxd4 6. Be3 Qg4 7.Qf2 e5. Black can <b>also</b> <b>decline</b> the pawn with 5...c6 or 5...e6, holding the position.|$|R
