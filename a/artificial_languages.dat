25|$|As such, {{artificial}} language experiments are typically conducted to explore what the relevant linguistic variables are, what {{sources of information}} infants are able to use and when, and how researchers can go about modeling the learning and acquisition process. Aslin and Newport, for example, have used <b>artificial</b> <b>languages</b> to explore what features of linguistic input make certain patterns salient and easily detectable by infants, allowing them to easily contrast the detection of syllable repetition with that of word-final syllables and make conclusions about {{the conditions under which}} either feature is recognized as important.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the early}} work using {{statistical}} learning paradigms focused on the ability for children or adults to learn a single language, consistent {{with the process of}} language acquisition for monolingual speakers or learners. However, it is estimated that approximately 60-75% of people in the world are bilingual. More recently, researchers have begun looking at the role of statistical learning for those who speak more than one language. Although there are no reviews on this topic yet, Weiss, Gerfen, and Mitchel examined how hearing input from multiple <b>artificial</b> <b>languages</b> simultaneously can affect the ability to learn either or both languages. Over four experiments, Weiss et al. found that, after exposure to two <b>artificial</b> <b>languages,</b> adult learners are capable of determining word boundaries in both languages when each language is spoken by a different speaker. However, when the two languages were spoken by the same speaker, participants were able learn both languages only when they were “congruent”—when the word boundaries of one language matched the word boundaries of the other. When the languages were incongruent—a syllable that appeared {{in the middle of a}} word in one language appeared at the end of the word in the other language—and spoken by a single speaker, participants were able to learn, at best, one of the two languages. A final experiment showed that the inability to learn incongruent languages spoken in the same voice was not due to syllable overlap between the languages but due to differing word boundaries.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century {{it had become}} clear that the divergation of the Slavic {{languages}} was irreversible {{and the concept of}} a Pan-Slavic literary language was no longer realistic. The Pan-Slavic dream had lost most of its power, and Pan-Slavists had to satisfy themselves with the formation of two multinational Slavic states, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. However, the need for a common language of communication for Slavs was still felt, and due to the influence of <b>artificial</b> <b>languages</b> like Esperanto, efforts were made to create a language that was no longer supposed to replace the individual Slavic languages, but to serve as an additional second language for Interslavic communication.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of this conclusion {{is that it allows}} Davidson to draw on the work of Alfred Tarski in giving the nature of a theory of meaning. Tarski showed how we can give a compositional theory of truth for <b>artificial</b> <b>languages.</b> Thus, Davidson takes three questions to be central to radical interpretation. Firstly, can a theory of truth be given for a natural language? Secondly, given the evidence plausibly available for the radical interpreter, can they construct and verify a theory of truth for the language they wish to interpret? Thirdly, will having a theory of truth suffice for allowing the radical interpreter to understand the language? Davidson has shown, using the work of Tarski, that the first question can be answered affirmatively.|$|E
40|$|Language {{acquisition}} in {{both natural}} and <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> learning settings crucially depends on extracting information from ordered sequences. A shared sequence learning mechanism is thus assumed to underlie {{both natural and}} <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> learning. A growing body of empirical evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. By means of <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> learning experiments, we may therefore gain more insight in this shared mechanism. In this paper, we review empirical evidence from <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> learning and computational modeling studies, as well as natural language data, and {{suggest that there are}} two key factors that help determine processing complexity in sequence learning, and thus in natural language processing. We propose that the specific ordering of non-adjacent dependencies (i. e. nested or crossed), as well as the number of non-adjacent dependencies to be resolved simultaneously (i. e. two or three) are important factors in gaining more insight into the boundaries of human sequence learning; and thus, also in natural language processing. The implications for theories of linguistic competence are discussed. Keywords: <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> learning; non-adjacent dependencies; processing complexity; recursion 1...|$|R

2500|$|It {{was a time}} {{of great}} {{interest}} in constructed languages and several people published <b>artificial</b> <b>languages</b> of their own creation. It was obviously desirable that one from among the constructed languages should be chosen as the international language. In 1900 Louis Couturat, a French mathematician, after initial correspondence with Dr L. L. Zamenhof created the Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language. [...] The Delegation approached the International Association of Academies, based in Vienna, in 1907, requesting it to choose between the many <b>artificial</b> <b>languages.</b> This request was denied. The Delegation's response was to meet later that year (1907) in Paris as a committee under the chairmanship of Louis Couturat with the intention of deciding the issue themselves.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>languages,</b> that is, {{small-scale}} languages {{that typically}} have an extremely limited vocabulary and simplified grammar rules, are a commonly used paradigm for psycholinguistic researchers. <b>Artificial</b> <b>languages</b> allow researchers to isolate {{variables of interest}} and wield {{a greater degree of}} control over the input the subject will receive. Unfortunately, the overly simplified nature of these languages and the absence of a number of phenomena common to all human natural languages such as rhythm, pitch changes, and sequential regularities raise questions of external validity for any findings obtained using this paradigm, even after {{attempts have been made to}} increase the complexity and richness of the languages used. The artificial language's lack of complexity or decreased complexity fails to account for a child's need to recognize a given syllable in natural language regardless of the sound variability inherent to natural language, though [...] "it is possible that the complexity of natural language actually facilitates learning." ...|$|E
2500|$|According {{to recent}} research, {{there is no}} neural {{evidence}} of statistical language learning in children with autism spectrum disorders. When exposed to a continuous stream of artificial speech, neurotypical children displayed less cortical activity in the dorsolateral frontal cortices (specifically the middle frontal gyrus) as cues for word boundaries increased. However activity in these networks remained unchanged in autistic children, regardless of the verbal cues provided. This evidence, highlighting the importance of proper Frontal Lobe brain function is {{in support of the}} [...] "Executive Functions" [...] Theory, used to explain some of the biologically related causes of Autistic language deficits. [...] With impaired working memory, decision making, planning, and goal setting, which are vital functions of the Frontal Lobe, Autistic children are at loss when it comes to socializing and communication (Ozonoff, et al., 2004). Additionally, researchers have found that the level of communicative impairment in autistic children was inversely correlated with signal increases in these same regions during exposure to <b>artificial</b> <b>languages.</b> Based on this evidence, researchers have concluded that children with autism spectrum disorders don't have the neural architecture to identify word boundaries in continuous speech. Early word segmentation skills have been shown to predict later language development, which could explain why language delay is a hallmark feature of autism spectrum disorders.|$|E

40|$|Antagonists in {{the ancient}} {{controversy}} over world multilingualism agree that a successful <b>artificial</b> <b>language</b> must overcome a coordination problem: to motivate learners when few speak the language. It is believed a take-off point must be reached, after which the spread of such a language would be selfsustaining. This problem may also frustrate other linguistic and nonlinguistic innovations. The dynamics of recruitment and defection, however, render a take-off point analysis dubious. A simple model of artificial-language evolution supports this doubt. Despite low learning cost, universal competence in an <b>artificial</b> <b>language,</b> if achieved, might be unstable. More generally, any degree of penetration by an <b>artificial</b> <b>language,</b> from 0 % to 100 % of the world population, might be stable.
