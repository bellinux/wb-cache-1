Methods: A quasiexperimental study involving multiple interventions to reduce the incidence of CLABSI was conducted in a medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) and in 2 step-down units (SDUs). From March 2005 to March 2007 (<b>phase</b> <b>1</b> [P 1]), some Centers for Disease Control and Prevention evidence-based practices were implemented. From April 2007 to April 2009 (P 2), we intervened in these processes at the same time that performance monitoring was occurring at the bedside, and we implemented the Institute for Healthcare Improvement central line bundle for all ICU and SDU patients requiring central venous lines. Results: the mean incidence density of CLABSI per 1000 catheter-days in the ICU was 6. <b>4</b> in <b>phase</b> <b>1</b> and 3. 2 in phase 2, P <. 001. the mean incidence density of CLABSI per 1000 catheter-days in the SDUs was <b>4.</b> <b>1</b> in <b>phase</b> <b>1</b> and <b>1.</b> 6 in <b>phase</b> 2, P = 5. 005.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 235 barrows and gilts (PIC, 337 × 1050, {{initially}} 77. 35 lb) {{were used in}} a 103 -d study {{to determine the effects}} of regrinding dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) on finishing pig growth performance. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments with 23 replications per treatment. Treatments included: (1) a corn-soybean meal diet with “normal” DDGS (DDGS average particle size of 780 μ), and (2) the same corn-soybean meal diet with reground DDGS (DDGS average particle size of 691 μ). Diets were fed in <b>4</b> <b>phases</b> (77 to 117, 117 to 163, 163 to 196, and 196 to 270 lb for <b>Phases</b> <b>1,</b> 2, 3, and <b>4,</b> respectively). <b>Phase</b> <b>1</b> and 2 diets contained 40 % DDGS, and <b>Phase</b> 3 and <b>4</b> diets contained 20 % DDGS. To achieve uniform lots of DDGS among treatments, semi-loads were split in half and left either as-received or reground. The DDGS was reground using a RMS 9 X 36 dual roller mill with corrugations set at 6 - 6 on top and 13 - 13 on the bottom. Within each of the individual phases, there were no differences (P > 0. 18) in ADG, ADFI, or F/G. Similarly for the overall experiment, no differences (P < 0. 24) in growth performance were found. These data indicate that regrinding DDGS (95 μ reduction in particle size) was not a large enough difference to affect growth performance; however, more research is needed to evaluate a greater reduction in particle size than achieved in the present study...|$|R
40|$|This open-label, multicenter, <b>phase</b> <b>1</b> B/ 2 trial {{assessed}} AUY 922 plus trastuzumab {{in patients}} with locally advanced or metastatic HER 2 -positive breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy and anti-HER 2 therapy. This study was composed of a dose-escalation part with AUY 922 administered weekly at escalating doses with trastuzumab 2 mg/kg/week (<b>phase</b> <b>1</b> B), followed by a phase 2 part using the same regimen at recommended phase 2 dose (RP 2 D). The primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP 2 D (<b>phase</b> <b>1</b> B), and to evaluate preliminary antitumor activity (phase 2) of AUY 922 plus trastuzumab at MTD/RP 2 D. Forty-five patients were treated with AUY 922 plus trastuzumab (<b>4</b> in <b>phase</b> <b>1</b> B with AUY 922 at 55 mg/m 2 and 41 in <b>phase</b> <b>1</b> B/ 2 with AUY 922 at 70 mg/m 2 [7 in <b>phase</b> <b>1</b> B and 34 in phase 2]). One patient in <b>phase</b> <b>1</b> B (70 mg/m 2) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 diarrhea); the RP 2 D was weekly AUY 922 70 mg/m 2 plus trastuzumab. Of the 41 patients in the 70 mg/m 2 cohort, the overall response rate (complete or partial responses) was 22. 0 % and 48. 8 % patients had stable disease. Study treatment-related adverse events occurred in 97. 8 % of patients; of these, 31. 1 % were grade 3 or 4. Forty-one patients (91. 1 %) reported ocular events (82. 3 % had grade 1 or 2 events). Two patients (4. 4 %) had ocular events leading to the permanent discontinuation of study treatment. AUY 922 at 70 mg/m 2 plus trastuzumab standard therapy is well tolerated and active {{in patients with}} HER 2 -positive metastatic breast cancer who progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy.

40|$|OBJECTIVEdTo {{assess the}} effect of two hypoglycemic drugs on ischemic {{preconditioning}} (IPC) patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD). RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODSdWe performed a prospective study of 96 con-secutive patients allocated into two groups: 42 to group repaglinide (R) and 54 to group vildagliptin (V). All patients underwent two consecutive exercise tests (ET 1 and ET 2) in <b>phase</b> <b>1</b> without drugs. In <b>phase</b> 2, <b>1</b> day after ET 1 and- 2, 2 mg repaglinide three times daily or 50 mg vildagliptin twice daily was given orally to patients in the respective group for 6 days. On the seventh day, 60 min after 6 mg repaglinide or 100 mg vildagliptin, all patients underwent two consecutive exercise tests (ET 3 and ET <b>4).</b> RESULTSdIn <b>phase</b> <b>1,</b> IPC was demonstrated by improvement in the time to 1. 0 mm ST-segment depression and rate pressure product (RPP). All patients developed ischemia in ET 3; however, 83. 3 % of patients in group R experienced ischemia earlier in ET 4, without significant improvement in RPP, indicating the cessation of IPC (P, 0. 0001). In group V, only 28 % of patients demonstrated IPC cessation, with 72 % still having the protective effect (P, 0. 0069).

40|$|In this study, an {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the process of adapting and standardising the Luria-Christense neuropsychological set of tests for use by Brazilian children, teenagers and adults. The process is characterised by research motivated by the need to develop diagnostic assessment instruments standardised to Brazilian social and cultural reality. The set of tests is comprised of ten sets of tests, each one of which assesses part of the dynamic functioning of the brain, thus providing a qualitative mapping of the brain areas and their interlinking, by means of testing perceptual, cognitive and movement abilities. The task of adaptation and standardization is divided into <b>4</b> <b>phases.</b> <b>Phase</b> <b>1</b> is dedicated to the process of the translation of, changes to and adaptation of signs, pictures and other stimuli, as well as the elaboration of instructions regarding their application and answer form, and also the layout and desktop printing thereof. In Phase 2, the test is taken to the field for the first time, and applied to control and experimental groups, passing, after analysis and alterations, to Phase 3. In Phase 3 the test is taken to the field for the second time, once more undergoing analysis and final alterations. In this way, only those tests that, after qualitative analysis and statistical treatment, still require further revision and use in the field, are subject to <b>Phase</b> <b>4.</b> The results obtained indicate when the pilot phase of the study can be finished, as follows: no tests in <b>Phase</b> <b>1</b> (pre-adaptation), 03 tests in Phase 2, 07 tests in Phase 3 and no tests in <b>Phase</b> <b>4.</b> Once this research has been fully implemented {{it will be possible to}} obtain a more accurate assessment that is more appropriate to Brazilian reality.   Keywords: Neuropsychological Assessment; Test Adaptation and Standardisation; Brain Function Mapping...|$|R
