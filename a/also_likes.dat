5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to Sonic is useful to Cream and Blaze the Cat in Sonic Rush, since they are also looking for him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, who has not returned. In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists on helping him. When Silver attacks Sonic, Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who <b>also</b> <b>likes</b> Sonic, although Amy does not know this at the time) from confinement. In Sonic Lost World, Amy and Knuckles care for forest animals while Sonic and Tails rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; Amy and Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when Sonic and Tails replenish it.|$|E

25|$|Chibiusa's {{dream is}} to one day become a real lady, to have her own prince, and {{to be friends with}} {{everyone}} she knows. Meanwhile, she is a fairly ordinary little girl; she likes the colour pink and red, pudding, pancakes, and rabbits. Her favorite school subject is drawing, while her least favorites are language classes. Her least favorite food is listed in the manga as carrots, just like Usagi, but they both eat them in the anime. Chibiusa hates taking care of the house and is afraid of such things as thunder and lightning, ghosts, vampires, dentists, and needles. She <b>also</b> <b>likes</b> to collect things with rabbits on them, and belongs to the Gardening Committee at school. She is very short when she first appears, but grows slightly taller as she gets older.|$|E

25|$|Argus Filch is the {{caretaker}} of Hogwarts. While {{he is not}} an evil character, he is ill-tempered, which makes him unpopular with the student body, and occasionally with other staff. His knowledge of the secrets and short-cuts of the castle is almost unparalleled, except perhaps by the Weasley twins, Voldemort himself, Harry, Ron and Hermione, and other users of the Marauder's Map. He tends to favour almost sadistically harsh punishments, leading to his alliance with Umbridge. He has an obsessive dislike of mud, animate toys, and all other things that might interfere with his creation of an immaculately clean and orderly Hogwarts. He is also portrayed as having a constant antagonism towards Peeves the poltergeist and often tells Dumbledore that Peeves should be thrown out of Hogwarts. He <b>also</b> <b>likes</b> to wander Hogwarts corridors at night, presumably in the hope of catching a student out of bed.|$|E

500|$|Benson {{describes}} the [...] "Fleming Sweep" [...] as taking the reader from one chapter to another using [...] "hooks" [...] {{at the end}} of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next. He feels that the [...] "Fleming Sweep briskly propels the plot" [...] of Dr. No through chapters that are longer than in previous Bond novels; the cultural historian Jeremy Black <b>also</b> <b>likes</b> Dr. Nos pacing, despite considering it inconsistent in places.

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} role his {{education}} had in shaping his humor, Blumenfeld said: [...] "I went to Jewish schools growing up and that's where my sense of humor was cultivated.

He has cited Larry David as an influence, and <b>also</b> <b>likes</b> Louie and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Blumenfeld has compared the NBC series The Office and Parks and Recreation to Jake and Amir, saying they [...] "have these office workplace dynamics and the situations are funny and the characters are very funny".|$|E
