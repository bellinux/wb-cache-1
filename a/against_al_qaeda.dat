40|$|This paper {{identifies}} and analyzes two legal {{questions raised}} by the war <b>against</b> the <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> terrorist organization. First, did the September 11, 2001 attacks initiate a war, or "international armed conflict," or was it only an act punishable under criminal law? Second, what legal rules govern the status and treatment of members of <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and the Taliban militia that harbored and supported them in Afghanistan? We argue that the United States is currently engaged {{in a state of}} armed conflict with <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda,</b> a multinational terrorist organization whose leadership declared war on the United States as early as 1996, and the Taliban militia, which harbors and supports that organization. This state of armed conflict justifies {{the use of military force}} by the United States to subdue and defeat the enemy, separate and apart from any ordinary law enforcement objectives that may also justify coercive government action <b>against</b> members of <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and the Taliban militia. To give legal recognition to the current armed conflict is not to confer upon members of <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> or the Taliban militia the privileged status of lawful combatants. Neither group complies with the four traditional conditions of lawful combat long established under the laws of war and recognized by the Geneva Conventions. Members of <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and the Taliban militia have chosen to fight in blatant disregard for the laws of armed conflict and are, accordingly, unlawful combatants not entitled to the legal status of prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions...|$|R

International concern and controversy arose over civilian casualties in additional airstrikes around Ras Kamboni and in Afmadow province, and whether these were the result of U.S. actions or Ethiopian aircraft operating in the area.

2500|$|On July 14, 2009, several {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} DCIA Leon Panetta was briefed on a CIA program {{that had not}} been briefed to the oversight committees in Congress.

The program consisted of teams of SAD paramilitary officers organized to execute targeted killing operations <b>against</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> operatives around the world in any country. According to the Los Angeles Times, DCIA Panetta [...] "has not ruled out reviving the program". There is some question as to whether former Vice President Dick Cheney instructed the CIA not to inform Congress. Per senior intelligence officers, this program was an attempt to avoid the civilian casualties that can occur during predator drone strikes using Hellfire missiles.|$|E
2500|$|United States {{military}} leaders reacted with surprise, expressing concern {{based on the}} fact that [...] "U.S. military rules specifically prohibit the proselytizing of any religion in Iraq or Afghanistan and were drawn up in order to prevent criticism that the U.S. was embarked on a religious 'Crusade' in its war <b>against</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and Iraqi insurgents." [...] Defense Department photos revealed that the rifles that included the verses were being used by Iraqi forces that included Muslims who had no knowledge of the Christian Bible verses on the sights. The Al Jezeera news service reported that the fact that weapons with [...] "Christian references" [...] had been distributed to Afghan soldiers would provide the Taliban with a [...] "propaganda coup."

2500|$|The {{text of the}} BSA was {{approved}} by the delegates at the Loya Jirga on 24 November 2013 and must now be signed by the Afghanistan president, who rejected the final recommendation of the Loya Jirga promptly to sign the BSA with the United States, and sent to the parliament for final ratification. If approved, the agreement would allow the U.S. to deploy military advisors to train and equip Afghan security forces, along with U.S. special-operations troops for anti-terrorism missions <b>against</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and other terrorist groups. Obama will determine the size of the force. The jirga set a few conditions before expressing approval for the agreement among them a 10-year time limit on the post-2014 troop presence and reparations for damages caused by U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan. It also voted attach a letter by Obama; pledging that U.S. troops would enter Afghan homes only in [...] "extraordinary" [...] circumstances and only if American lives were at direct risk, to the BSA. The elder assembly also demanded the release of 19 Afghans from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay and a stronger U.S. pledge to defend Afghanistan from any incursion from it neighbors, particularly Pakistan. The loya jirga also voted to request that the U.S. military add a base to the nine bases that would be occupied by U.S. troops under the proposed security pact after combat forces depart Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The base is in Bamian Province in central Afghanistan, where the NATO-led military coalition has maintained a presence. Bamian is a population center for Hazaras, a Shiite minority whose members were massacred by the Taliban prior to the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the militant group. Afghan analysts said Hazara delegates proposed the additional base. At least five of the 50 jirga committees raised objections to the article addressing [...] "status of personnel" [...] which [...] "authorises the United States to hold [...] trial ... or take other disciplinary action, as appropriate, in the territory of Afghanistan" [...] when a US soldier is accused of criminal activity. Spokespeople from at least two committees directly stated that Afghanistan should have jurisdiction over any US soldiers accused of crimes on Afghan soil. Several committees also stated that if trials are held in the United States, families of victims should have access to and presence in US-held trials at the expense of Washington.|$|E
