The article examines the impact of the Good Friday Agreement on cross-border administrative and economic co-operation and concludes that it has had a large impact on <b>administrative</b> <b>co-operation,</b> but that it has not provided large-scale incentives for business co-operation.

40|$|Theories of tax {{competition}} predict that small countries competing with large countries benefit, as {{they find it}} relatively easy to substitute revenue lost in a tax cut with revenue gained from incoming foreign tax base. If small countries can only lose from tax co-operation, why are Luxembourg and Austria bound {{to agree to a}} revised EU Savings Tax Directive that will oblige them to automatically provide information on foreign account holders’ interest income to residence countries? Putting emphasis on the neglected issue of power, I show that Luxembourg and Austria were first coerced into bilateral agreements on automatic exchange of information by the United States, which then activated a most-favored nation clause contained in the EU Directive on <b>Administrative</b> <b>Co-operation</b> in Tax Matters. As a result, the two countries were under a legal obligation to also extend greater co-operation to EU partners...|$|E
40|$|Analyses of the European {{administrative}} space {{have until}} now focused on its territorial and functional dimensions. The territorial dimension has been addressed, in particular, with reference to, first, degrees of spatial – and here most notably- cross-country variation in domestic administrative arrangements (convergence versus non-convergence); and, second, <b>administrative</b> <b>co-operation</b> across space. The functional dimension relates primarily {{the evolution of}} different types of administrative authority within this space and patterns of interaction and co-ordination across levels (notably between the supranational and the national) and jurisdictions. By contrast, the temporal dimension of the European administrative space has scarcely been explored. This paper is intended to show that temporality is central to the analysis of the evolving European administrative order and to European governance more generally. The paper starts by introducing two broad perspectives on temporality: (i) the ‘time of governing ’ perspective, which is concerned with understanding the development of temporal rules – such as time, sequence, speed, duration- that structur...|$|E

40|$|BrabantStad, {{a network}} of cities and Provincial {{government}} in Brabant This Master’s thesis focuses on the coexistence of network and territory as principles of spatial structuration in an “urban network”. In the Dutch context, an “urban network” {{is a form of}} <b>administrative</b> <b>co-operation</b> at the regional scale in-between urban municipalities and a Provincial government. To gain insight into how such a network operates, a study is conducted on histories and spatialities of Dutch regional co-operation in general and BrabantStad in particular. The BrabantStad case is primarily studied through interviewing nine informants familiar with the phenomenon, each having varying degrees of involvement in the network. As a result, views from both insiders as well as outsiders of BrabantStad are obtained. Using a qualitative approach, partly based on principles of “grounded theory”, an outline of a conceptual model on the “urban network” is constructed at first. This model is developed further only after the case study was carried out. Four aspects appear to be crucial towards an understanding of an “urban network”: space (I), organization (II), time (III) and values (IV). With regard to the spatial aspect, the dynamic character of different ways to organize space is underscored, along with the relations between cities in BrabantStad and their surrounding regions...|$|E
40|$|In this report, {{the results}} of a {{research}} project that examines municipal relations around the Gotha Canal are presented together with a discussion of the factors influencing political and <b>administrative</b> <b>co-operation</b> in general. The report begins with an analysis of the structural factors influencing regional co-operation in Europe and Sweden, and continues with an examination of the ways that actors in the Canal municipalities perceive these structural hinders. In order to achieve this the project has examined inter-municipal co-operation in parts of the Swedish counties of Västergötland and Östergötland. Two central aspects have been examined. The first is the political co-operation between the municipalities, and the second is the <b>administrative</b> <b>co-operation.</b> It {{should be noted that the}} municipalities’ co-operation around the Gotha Canal cannot be seen as an isolated phenomenon, and that it must be seen in a wider context – that of a relatively recent and general trend towards regional co-operation in the area. In a report of this size it is not possible to describe all details of the different types of co-operation that now exist between the municipalities. Neither has it been the aim of this project to provide a detailed documentation of the various stages in the development of the cooperation around the Gotha Canal up to today. The ambition has been instead to attempt to uncover the factors that are conductive or detrimental to regional development and inter-municipal co-operation both in the specific case of the Canal, and in general. It should also be remembered that regional development in Sweden is an area that is in a process of rapid transition and that in some ways it has only just begun. New developments are taking place all the time, and it is impossible to predict how and where these developments will lead. The study was based primarily on semi-structured interviews with fifteen senior council politicians and civil servants in the municipalities of Mariestad, Töreboda, Karlsborg, Motala, Linköping, Norrköping and Söderköping, as well as with officials in the county of Östergötland. These were analysed together with municipal and county documents. Each interview lasted approximately 40 to 50 minutes. Five of the interviewees were woman and 10 were men and they are referred to in this report only as interviewees. The interviews were recorded and then transcribed into computer files. The transcribed interviews were qualitatively analysed and key concepts and issues identified. These concepts and issues, and the discourses around them, form the central empirical material on which this paper is based. The analysis of the 15 interviews conducted in the course of this project was supplemented by analyses of 41 other interviews with municipal politicians and administrators conducted in previous research projects. It is hoped that this report will be of use to two main groups; first, municipal politicians and civil servants; secondly, members of the business community. The isolation of these two groups from each other has become less marked during the last decade, and attitudes of the groups to each other have changed considerably. There is now a significant need for them to gain a better understanding of the conditions that determine each others spheres of activity, and it is hoped that this report will be able to contribute something to that understanding...|$|E
40|$|Today’s global {{economic}} environment {{is characterized by}} the high mobility of capital and labour across national borders. Against the backdrop of a legal framework governing taxation of cross-border income, this may lead to double taxation on the one hand, as well as provide opportunities for tax evasion and tax avoidance on the other. It is well-established that a prerequisite for effective taxation of foreign-sourced income earned by “domestic taxpayers” (i. e. tax residents) is the system of <b>administrative</b> <b>co-operation</b> across national boundaries, mainly in the form of exchange of tax-relevant information between tax authorities. Since the lack of information-exchange mechanisms is linked with tax havens and the proliferation of “harmful tax practices”, the OECD put the issue high on the global political agenda as early as 1998. Further developments strengthened the importance of the exchange of information, leading to the so-called “big bang” of 2009, i. e. to {{a significant increase in the}} number of concluded tax information exchange agreements, caused by the growing concern about international tax evasion and avoidance in the post-crisis period. Nowadays the so-called automatic exchange of information (AEOI) between tax authorities has emerged as a new global standard. This is mostly due to the development of specific national and international models, aimed at enhancing intergovernmental cooperation in fighting offshore tax evasion. In this regard special attention should be drawn to the 2014 release of the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which is based on the idea that banks and other financial institutions should play a crucial role in providing information on taxpayer’s income and assets to tax authorities around the globe. The aim of this paper is to explore some of the most important implications of the adoption of the CRS as a global AEOI model. While there are marked advantages of the new standard - mainly related to its potential in curbing large-scale offshore tax evasion - some important concerns arise as to its implementation on a global level. Particular attention will be paid to the issue of coordination of the CRS with the other information exchange models (e. g. FATCA) and to the problem of protecting taxpayers’ rights and information...|$|E
