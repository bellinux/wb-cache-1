5|$|<b>Aversive</b> {{conditioning}} deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise {{makers and}} rubber bullets are used {{each time the}} bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will {{be less likely to}} continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).|$|E
5|$|Political {{events and}} {{progress}} attained during December 1915 allowed {{the mission to}} celebrate at Kabul on Christmas Day with wine and cognac {{left behind by the}} Durand mission forty years previously, which Habibullah lay at their disposal. These events included the foundation of the Provisional Government of India that month and a shift from the Emir's usual <b>aversive</b> stance to an offer of discussions on a German-Afghan treaty of friendship.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very <b>aversive</b> by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
5|$|Supportive {{therapy and}} diaphragmatic {{breathing}} has shown to cause improvement in 56% of cases, and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30% {{in one study}} of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments. Patients who successfully use the technique often notice an immediate change in health for the better. Individuals who have had bulimia or who intentionally induced vomiting {{in the past have}} a reduced chance for improvement due to the reinforced behavior. The technique is not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required for it to be successful. Most infants grow out of the disorder within a year or with <b>aversive</b> training.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior to escape <b>aversive</b> socially mediated attention. Put another way, social situations that are <b>aversive</b> to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring. For example, a child hits the teacher to avoid talking {{in front of the}} class. Common forms of <b>aversive</b> social situations include, but are not limited to, smiles, hugs, frowns, corrections, group settings, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior because it produces a decrease in <b>aversive</b> stimulation. Put another way, something <b>aversive</b> is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging {{in the behavior}} decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs {{his head against the}} wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of <b>aversive</b> stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aversive</b> {{racism is}} a form of {{implicit}} racism in which a person's unconscious negative evaluations of racial or ethnic minorities are realized by a persistent avoidance of interaction with other racial and ethnic groups. As opposed to traditional, overt racism, which is characterized by overt hatred for and explicit discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, <b>aversive</b> racism is characterized by more complex, ambivalent expressions and attitudes. <b>Aversive</b> racism is similar in implications to the concept of symbolic or modern racism (described below), which is also a form of implicit, unconscious, or covert attitude which results in unconscious forms of discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{reinforcement}} (escape): This {{occurs when}} a behavior (response) {{is followed by the}} removal of an <b>aversive</b> stimulus, thereby increasing that behavior's frequency. In the Skinner box experiment, the <b>aversive</b> stimulus might be a loud noise continuously sounding inside the box; negative reinforcement would happen when the rat presses a lever, turning off the noise.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior to escape <b>aversive</b> tasks or demands. For example, {{when a child is}} told to take a bath he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a series of math problems, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principals office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the <b>aversive</b> activity of completing math problems. Common forms of <b>aversive</b> demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, novel tasks, etc.|$|E
25|$|Russian doctor Evgeny Krupitsky {{has claimed}} to have {{encouraging}} results by using ketamine {{as part of a}} treatment for alcohol addiction which combines psychedelic and <b>aversive</b> techniques. Krupitsky and Kolp summarized their work to date in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The right {{superior}} temporal gyrus was {{the most}} significantly activated area during the processing happiness. The right superior temporal gyrus increasingly responds to an increasingly happy stimuli, while the left pulvinar increasingly responds to increasingly fearful stimuli. The right pulvinar is activated during <b>aversive</b> conditioning.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} coined by Joel Kovel to {{describe}} the subtle racial behaviors of any ethnic or racial group who rationalize their aversion to a particular group by appeal to rules or stereotypes. People who behave in an aversively racial way may profess egalitarian beliefs, and will often deny their racially motivated behavior; nevertheless they change their behavior when dealing {{with a member of}} another race or ethnic group than the one they belong to. The motivation for the change is thought to be implicit or subconscious. Experiments have provided empirical support for the existence of <b>aversive</b> racism. <b>Aversive</b> racism has been shown to have potentially serious implications for decision making in employment, in legal decisions and in helping behavior.|$|E
25|$|As taste senses both harmful and {{beneficial}} things, all basic tastes {{are classified as}} either <b>aversive</b> or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies. Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{learning}} and memory functions are impaired by centrally administered oxytocin. Also, systemic oxytocin administration can impair memory retrieval in certain <b>aversive</b> memory tasks. However, oxytocin {{does seem to}} facilitate {{learning and}} memory specifically for social information. Healthy males administered intranasal oxytocin show improved memory for human faces, in particular happy faces.|$|E
25|$|Other {{alternatives}} include regular nail trimming; directing scratching {{behavior to}} inexpensive cardboard scratchers or scratching posts, or emery scratching pads that dull the claws; rotary sanding devices (Dremel, Pedi-Paws); covering furniture or using double-sided sticky tape or sheets such as Sticky Paws; remote <b>aversive</b> {{devices such as}} Scat Mats; or acceptance of cats' scratching behavior.|$|E
25|$|The nerve impulses of the {{nociception}} response may {{be conducted}} to the brain thereby registering the location, intensity, quality and unpleasantness of the stimulus. This subjective component of pain involves conscious awareness of both the sensation and the unpleasantness (the <b>aversive,</b> negative affect). The brain processes underlying conscious awareness of the unpleasantness (suffering), are not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of the primary-secondary psychopathy {{distinction}} and triarchic model {{argue that}} there are neurological differences between these subgroups of psychopathy which support their views. For instance, the boldness factor in the triarchic model is argued {{to be associated with}} reduced activity in the amygdala during fearful or <b>aversive</b> stimuli and reduced startle response, while the disinhibition factor is argued to be associated with impairment of frontal lobe tasks. There is evidence that boldness and disinhibition are genetically distinguishable.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scientific}} studies identifying neurons that responded {{in ways that}} suggested they encode for conditioned stimuli came from work by Mahlon deLong and by R.T. Richardson. They showed that nucleus basalis neurons, which release acetylcholine broadly throughout the cerebral cortex, are activated shortly after a conditioned stimulus, or after a primary reward if no conditioned stimulus exists. These neurons are equally active for positive and negative reinforcers, and {{have been shown to}} be related to neuroplasticity in many cortical regions. Evidence also exists that dopamine is activated at similar times. There is considerable evidence that dopamine participates in both reinforcement and <b>aversive</b> learning. Dopamine pathways project much more densely onto frontal cortex regions. Cholinergic projections, in contrast, are dense even in the posterior cortical regions like the primary visual cortex. A study of patients with Parkinson's disease, a condition attributed to the insufficient action of dopamine, further illustrates the role of dopamine in positive reinforcement. It showed that while off their medication, patients learned more readily with <b>aversive</b> consequences than with positive reinforcement. Patients who were on their medication showed the opposite to be the case, positive reinforcement proving to be the more effective form of learning when dopamine activity is high.|$|E
25|$|Nasally {{administered}} oxytocin {{has been}} reported to reduce fear, possibly by inhibiting the amygdala (which is thought to be responsible for fear responses). Indeed, studies in rodents have shown oxytocin can efficiently inhibit fear responses by activating an inhibitory circuit within the amygdala. Some researchers have argued oxytocin has a general enhancing effect on all social emotions, since intranasal administration of oxytocin also increases envy and Schadenfreude. Individuals who receive an intranasal dose of oxytocin identify facial expressions of disgust faster than individuals who do not receive oxytocin. Facial expressions of disgust are evolutionarily linked to the idea of contagion. Thus, oxytocin increases the salience of cues that imply contamination, which leads to a faster response because these cues are especially relevant for survival. In another study, after administration of oxytocin, individuals displayed an enhanced ability to recognize expressions of fear compared to the individuals who received the placebo. Oxytocin modulates fear responses by enhancing the maintenance of social memories. Rats that are genetically modified to have a surplus of oxytocin receptors display a greater fear response to a previously conditioned stressor. Oxytocin enhances the <b>aversive</b> social memory, leading the rat to display a greater fear response when the <b>aversive</b> stimulus is encountered again.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} <b>aversive</b> consequences, rather than {{inconsistency}}. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when {{they feel they have}} not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E
25|$|Huddling: Prolonged {{physical}} contact or huddling also serves social integration. Huddling promotes heat exchange, {{together with the}} transfer of olfactory or tactile information. Some organisms live in constant contact in a colony, for example colonial corals. When individuals are linked tightly in this way an entire colony can react on the <b>aversive</b> or alarm movements made by only a few individuals. In several herbivorous insect nymphs and larvae, aggregations where there is prolonged contact {{play a major role}} in group coordination. These aggregations may take the form of a procession or a rosette.|$|E
25|$|Both {{types of}} {{reinforcement}} strengthen behavior, or increase {{the probability of}} a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied (positive reinforcement) or something removed or avoided (negative reinforcement). Punishment is the application of an <b>aversive</b> stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus (negative punishment or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression is temporary and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences. Extinction is the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which weakens behavior.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the seminal}} article on {{functional}} analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology {{available to them}} at the time. Instead of treating {{the function of the}} disruptive behavior, behavioral psychologists would instead pre-assume consequences to alter disruptive behaviors. For example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an <b>aversive</b> stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a reinforcer without identifying the reinforcer that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over <b>aversive</b> contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, B.F. Skinner) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time.|$|E
25|$|In free-operant {{avoidance}} {{a subject}} periodically receives an <b>aversive</b> stimulus (often an electric shock) unless an operant response is made; the response delays {{the onset of}} the shock. In this situation, unlike discriminated avoidance, no prior stimulus signals the shock. Two crucial time intervals determine the rate of avoidance learning. This first is the S-S (shock-shock) interval. This is time between successive shocks {{in the absence of a}} response. The second interval is the R-S (response-shock) interval. This specifies the time by which an operant response delays {{the onset of the}} next shock. Note that each time the subject performs the operant response, the R-S interval without shock begins anew.|$|E
25|$|Emotional target cues {{have been}} shown to {{eliminate}} age differences in prospective memory. For older participants, emotional prospective memory cues were better remembered than neutral cues. Whether the cues are positive or negative, strong emotional attachment makes the cue more self-relevant and easier to remember. For example, an <b>aversive</b> picture of a snake biting a person or a positive picture of a dog licking its owner are easier to remember because they evoke emotional responses, as opposed to a neutral picture of an animal that does not evoke an emotional response. It is speculated that the amygdala and hippocampus {{may play a role in}} this emotionally enhanced memory effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{threshold}} for stimulation of bitter taste by quinine averages {{a concentration of}} 8 μM (8 micromolar). The taste thresholds of other bitter substances are rated relative to quinine, which is thus given a reference index of 1. For example, Brucine has an index of 11, is thus perceived as intensely more bitter than quinine, and is detected {{at a much lower}} solution threshold. The most bitter substance known is the synthetic chemical denatonium, which has an index of 1,000. It is used as an <b>aversive</b> agent (a bitterant) that is added to toxic substances to prevent accidental ingestion. This was discovered in 1958 during research on lignocaine, a local anesthetic, by MacFarlan Smith of Gorgie, Edinburgh, Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Punishment is {{a process}} by which a {{consequence}} immediately follows a behavior which decreases the future frequency of that behavior. As with reinforcement, a stimulus can be added (positive punishment) or removed (negative punishment). Broadly, there are three types of punishment: presentation of <b>aversive</b> stimuli (e.g., pain), response cost (removal of desirable stimuli as in monetary fines), and restriction of freedom (as in a 'time out'). Punishment in practice can often result in unwanted side effects. Some other potential unwanted effects include resentment over being punished, attempts to escape the punishment, expression of pain and negative emotions associated with it, and recognition by the punished individual between the punishment and the person delivering it.|$|E
25|$|DSM-IV-TR defines trauma {{as direct}} {{personal}} experience {{of an event}} that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury; threat to one's physical integrity, witnessing an event that involves the above experience, learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death, injury experienced by {{a family member or}} close associate, or a state of awareness of something that you usually don't think about, but occurs and leaves you distressed and concerned. Memories associated with trauma are implicit, pre-verbal and cannot be recalled, but can be triggered by stimuli from the in vivo environment. The person's response to <b>aversive</b> details of traumatic event involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. In children it is manifested as disorganized or agitative behaviors.|$|E
25|$|There {{are only}} two {{chemical}} bird repellents registered {{for use in the}} United States. They are methyl anthranilate and anthraquinone. Methyl anthranilate is a primary repellent that produces an immediate unpleasant sensation that is reflexive and {{does not have to be}} learned. As such it is most effective for transient populations of birds (DeVault et al. 2013). Methyl anthranilate has been used with great success at rapidly dispersing birds from flightlines at Homestead Air Reserve Station (Engeman et al. 2002). Anthraquinone is a secondary repellent that has a laxative effect that is not instantaneous. Because of this it is most effective on resident populations of wildlife that will have time to learn an <b>aversive</b> response (Izhaki 2002, DeVault et al. 2013).|$|E
25|$|Due to male {{paternity}} insecurity, {{sex differences}} {{have been found}} in such domains as sexual jealousy. Females generally react more adversely to emotional infidelity and males will react more to sexual infidelity. This particular pattern is predicted because the costs involved in mating for each sex are distinct. Women, on average, should prefer a mate who can offer resources (e.g., financial, commitment), thus, a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelity. Men, on the other hand, are never certain of the genetic paternity of their children because they do not bear the offspring themselves ("paternity insecurity"). This suggests that for men sexual infidelity would generally be more <b>aversive</b> than emotional infidelity because investing resources in another man's offspring does not lead to propagation of their own genes.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{demonstrate}} that the changes to the olfactory bulb and main olfactory system following birth are extremely important and influential for maternal behavior. Pregnancy and childbirth result in a high state of plasticity of the olfactory system that may facilitate olfactory learning within the mother. Neurogenesis likely facilitates the formation of olfactory memory in the mother, {{as well as the}} infant. A significant change takes place in the regulation of olfaction just after birth so that odors related with the offspring are no longer <b>aversive,</b> allowing the female to positively respond to her babies. Research with a variety of animals suggest the role of norepinephrine in olfactory learning, in which norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus send projections to neurons in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. This is significant in the formation of olfactory memory and learning.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Edward Carr {{published}} {{a paper on}} potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant behaviors. In the paper, Carr described five potential causes for self-injurious behaviors that included (1) positive social reinforcement contingent on the response, (2) negative reinforcement {{in the form of}} removal of an <b>aversive</b> stimulus contingent on the response, (3) the response produced stimuli possessed reinforcing qualities (automatic reinforcement), (4) the behavior was a byproduct of an underlying psychological condition, and (5) psychodynamic hypothesis in which the behavior was an attempt to reduce guilt. Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior.|$|E
25|$|As such, {{it seems}} {{unlikely}} that sertraline would produce much inhibition of dopamine reuptake even at clinically used dosages well in excess of the recommended maximum clinical dosage. This is in accordance with its 86-fold selectivity for the SERT over the DAT according to Tatsumi et al. and hence the fact that nearly 100-fold higher levels of sertraline would be necessary to also inhibit dopamine reuptake. In accordance, while sertraline has very low abuse potential and may even be <b>aversive</b> at clinical dosages, a case report of sertraline abuse described dopaminergic-like effects such as euphoria, mental overactivity, and hallucinations only at a dosage 56times the normal maximum and 224times the normal minimum. For these reasons, significant inhibition of dopamine reuptake by sertraline at clinical dosages is controversial, and occupation by sertraline of the DAT is thought by many experts to not be clinically relevant.|$|E
25|$|There has {{previously}} been no effective method of treatment for the neurobehavioral aspects of the disease. Even children treated from birth with allopurinol develop behavioral and neurologic problems, despite never having had high serum concentrations of uric acid. Self-injurious and other behaviors are best managed {{by a combination of}} medical, physical, and behavioral interventions. The self-mutilation is often reduced by using restraints. Sixty percent of individuals have their teeth extracted in order to avoid self-injury, which families have found to be an effective management technique. Because stress increases self-injury, behavioral management through <b>aversive</b> techniques (which would normally reduce self-injury) actually increases self-injury in individuals with LNS. Nearly all affected individuals need restraints to prevent self-injury, and are restrained more than 75% of the time. This is often at their own request, and occasionally involves restraints that would appear to be ineffective, as they do not physically prevent biting. Families report that affected individuals are more at ease when restrained.|$|E
25|$|Some {{laboratory}} research demonstrate correlations between psychopathy and atypical responses to <b>aversive</b> stimuli, including weak conditioning to painful stimuli and poor learning of avoiding responses that cause punishment, {{as well as}} low reactivity in the autonomic nervous system as measured with skin conductance while waiting for a painful stimulus but not when the stimulus occurs. While {{it has been argued}} that the reward system functions normally, some studies have also found reduced reactivity to pleasurable stimuli. According to the response modulation hypothesis, psychopathic individuals have also had difficulty switching from an ongoing action despite environmental cues signaling a need to do so. This may explain the difficulty responding to punishment, although it is unclear if it can explain findings such as deficient conditioning. There may be methodological issues regarding the research. While establishing a range of idiosyncrasies on average in linguistic and affective processing under certain conditions, this research program has not confirmed a common pathology of psychopathy.|$|E
