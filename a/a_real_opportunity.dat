While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses, due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up, a significant proportion of businesses have to close, due to [...] "lack of funding, bad business decisions, an economic crisis, lack of market demand – or a combination of all of these".

However, the actual development has been quite disappointing: despite some initial success, almost all of these services and software tools have been discontinued (see section 1).
