5|$|Michael was heir {{presumptive}} until 12 August 1904, when {{the birth of}} Tsarevich Alexei to Nicholas and Alexandra provided <b>an</b> <b>heir</b> apparent. Michael again became second-in-line to the throne, but was named as co-regent for the boy, along with Alexandra, {{in the event of}} Nicholas's death.|$|E
5|$|Wallis {{was plagued}} by rumours of other lovers. The gay American playboy Jimmy Donahue, <b>an</b> <b>heir</b> to the Woolworth fortune, claimed {{to have had a}} liaison with the Duchess in the 1950s, but Donahue was notorious for his inventive pranks and rumour-mongering.|$|E
5|$|His {{failure to}} produce <b>an</b> <b>heir</b> caused a {{succession}} crisis. Anjou, Brittany, Maine and Touraine chose Richard's nephew Arthur as heir, while John succeeded in England and Normandy. Philip II of France again destabilised the Plantagenet territories on the European mainland, supporting his vassal Arthur's {{claim to the}} English crown. Eleanor supported her son John, who was victorious at the Battle of Mirebeau and captured the rebel leadership.|$|E

5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed <b>an</b> <b>heir.</b> On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide <b>an</b> <b>heir.</b> But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she might have expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E
5|$|Melvin's {{estate was}} valued at $30,000. His heirs {{included}} his sister, Mrs. S.T. Moore of Fairview, his nephews James and Paul Melvin of Fairview, his nephew John Melvin of New Cumberland, and his niece Mrs. John Bendene of Steubenville. While not <b>an</b> <b>heir,</b> Melvin was also {{survived by his}} brother, J.A.B. Melvin, who {{was president of the}} Altoona Trust Company.|$|E
5|$|Nerva's brief reign was {{marred by}} {{financial}} difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army. A revolt by the Praetorian Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt <b>an</b> <b>heir.</b> After some deliberation Nerva adopted Trajan, a young and popular general, as his successor. After barely fifteen months in office, Nerva {{died of natural causes}} on 27 January 98. Upon his death he was succeeded and deified by Trajan.|$|E

5|$|Palmyra {{was used}} as a refuge by Shirkuh II's grandson, al-Ashraf Musa, who allied himself with the Mongol king Hulagu Khan and fled after the Mongol defeat in the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut against the Mamluks.

Al-Ashraf Musa died in 1263 without <b>an</b> <b>heir,</b> bringing the Homs district under direct Mamluk rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} <b>an</b> <b>heir</b> {{produced}} changes in PedroII's character. Previously isolated and shy, {{he became more}} outgoing and confident as monarch. His strained relationship with his wife, {{the product of a}} disappointing arranged marriage, also improved, and with children came shared domestic interests that developed into an affectionate friendship.|$|E
5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate <b>an</b> <b>heir</b> to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
25|$|In Roman Dutch law, <b>a</b> {{fiduciary}} <b>heir</b> {{may receive}} property subject to passing {{it to another}} on fulfilment of certain conditions; the gift is called a fideicommissum.

5|$|The trial {{opened on}} 1 June 1891 and {{entry to the}} court was by ticket only. The Prince of Wales was present, and sat on a red leather chair on a raised {{platform}} between the judge and the witness box; his appearance {{was the first time}} since 1411 that <b>an</b> <b>heir</b> to the throne had appeared involuntarily in court.|$|E
5|$|A series frontiersmen {{assemblies}} {{were held}} {{over several years}} across the Willamette Valley, with many on the French Prairie at Champoeg. The death of prominent settler Ewing Young on 9 February 1841, who left neither a will or had <b>an</b> <b>heir</b> in Oregon Country, left the future of his property uncertain. Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised {{to discuss the matter}} on the 17th. He proposed the creation of an authority over the pioneers centered on a governor. French-Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge and a few other positions were appointed.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, <b>an</b> <b>heir</b> who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E

5|$|At age 37, Mary {{turned her}} {{attention}} to finding a husband and producing <b>an</b> <b>heir,</b> which would prevent the Protestant Elizabeth (still next-in-line under the terms of Henry VIII's will and the Act of Succession of 1544) from succeeding to the throne. Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry his only son, Prince Philip of Spain. Philip had a son from a previous marriage and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World. As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip, by Titian, was sent to her in September 1553.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, Yeats was 51 {{years old}} and {{determined}} to marry and produce <b>an</b> <b>heir.</b> His rival John MacBride had been executed {{for his role in}} the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry. His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne's history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her life—including chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife and biographer R.F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.|$|E
5|$|Constantine XI died without {{producing}} <b>an</b> <b>heir,</b> and had Constantinople not fallen {{he might}} have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed II after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, re-christened as Has Murad, became a personal favorite of Mehmed and served as Beylerbey (Governor-General) of the Balkans. The younger son, renamed Mesih Pasha, became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, Bayezid II.|$|E

5|$|During 1836–37, Otto visited Germany, {{marrying a}} {{beautiful}} and talented 17-year-old, Duchess Amalia (Amelie) of Oldenburg (21 December 1818 to 20 May 1875). The wedding took place not in Greece, but in Oldenburg, on 22 November 1836; the marriage did not produce <b>an</b> <b>heir,</b> and the new queen made herself unpopular by interfering in the government and maintaining her Lutheran faith. Otto was unfaithful to his wife, and had a liaison with Jane Digby, a notorious woman his father had previously taken as a lover.|$|E

He worked to bring one of the king's relatives, Edward the Exile, back to England from Hungary to secure <b>an</b> <b>heir</b> for the childless king.|$|E
5|$|Erbil was conquered by the Muslims in the 7th century. It {{remained}} an important Christian centre until the 9th century, when {{the bishop of}} Erbil moved his seat to Mosul. From {{the first half of}} the 12th century until 1233, Erbil was the seat of the Begteginids, a Turcoman dynasty that rose to prominence under the reign of Zengi, the atabeg of Mosul. Muzaffar al-Din Gökböri, the second dynast of the Begtegenid dynasty and a staunch supporter of Saladin, created a lower town around the city on the citadel mound and founded hospitals and madrasahs. Gökburi died in 1233 without <b>an</b> <b>heir</b> and control of Erbil shifted to the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir after he had besieged the city.|$|E
