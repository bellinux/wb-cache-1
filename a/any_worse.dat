5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing a voice that he thinks is God telling him to murder people, Ned Flanders becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer {{is the one who}} has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything that has happened, but God tells her that Satan is the one who is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get <b>any</b> <b>worse,</b> it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E
25|$|To {{coincide}} with the band's success, Bad Religion released a compilation album, 80–85, in 1991. It is a repackaging of their debut album, How Could Hell Be <b>Any</b> <b>Worse?,</b> their two EPs, Bad Religion and Back to the Known and the band's three track contributions to the Public Service EP. This compilation did not include Into the Unknown. 80–85 is now out of print and {{has been replaced by}} the 2004 re-issued version of How Could Hell Be <b>Any</b> <b>Worse?</b> with the same track listings.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{the band}} {{released}} their initial eponymous album on {{the newly formed}} label, Epitaph Records, which was {{and continues to be}} managed and owned by Gurewitz. Also in 1981, the band began recording their first full-length album, How Could Hell Be <b>Any</b> <b>Worse?.</b> During the recording of this album, drummer Jay Ziskrout quit the band, and was replaced by Peter Finestone. Released in 1982, How Could Hell Be <b>Any</b> <b>Worse?</b> was also distributed by the band under the Epitaph label, and sold roughly 12,000 copies.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Keres {{participated in}} several tournaments in European regions under German occupation, {{including}} those Nazi-organized (1942 Tallinn, Salzburg, Munich, 1943 Prague, Posen, Salzburg, Reval), {{and when the}} Soviets occupied Estonia in 1944, he unsuccessfully attempted to escape to western Europe. His 1942 Nazi newspaper interview was used for anti-Soviet propaganda. As a consequence, he was suspected of collaboration with the Nazis and questioned by the Soviet authorities. Keres managed to avoid deportation or <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> fate (e.g., that of Vladimirs Petrovs); however, {{he may have been}} held in detention; precise details are difficult to ascertain.|$|E
25|$|Just {{when things}} couldn't {{seem to get}} <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> coming off a last place overall finish, they did for the 1983–84 season, as the Cents {{finished}} with an abysmal record of 8–51–1. The team also set a dubious BCJHL record for the most goals allowed in a season with 543, an average of 9.05 against per game. This {{despite the fact that}} forward Brent Demerais set a single season team record that still stands today with 66 goals. His total represents 26.7% of the total goals the team scored that season. In fact, Demerais' point total of 124 was good enough for third overall in the BCJHL, but it was the lone bright spot in a season with very few.|$|E

25|$|Bad Religion slowly {{reformed}} in 1986 {{out of the}} Back to the Known line-up when Graffin called Bentley {{and asked}} him to return. Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from How Could Hell Be <b>Any</b> <b>Worse?,</b> he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he had so much fun. A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back. This lineup recorded the band's third album, Suffer, which was released in 1988. Although the album did not chart on the Billboard 200, it received some positive reviews, and was voted Best Album of the Year by publications such as Trust, Maximum Rocknroll and Flipside.|$|E
25|$|Only 36 overs of {{play was}} {{possible}} {{on the first}} day at the St Lawrence Ground, in which Middlesex made 92 runs for the loss of one wicket, that of Ben Hutton. The following day, Kent bowler Amjad Khan added two wickets to his overnight tally of one, as Middlesex crumbled to 136 for 4 on the second morning. However, centuries from Owais Shah and Paul Weekes swung it Middlesex' way, as they declared on 400 for 8. Kent's openers did not wish to be <b>any</b> <b>worse,</b> with David Fulton making 110 and Robert Key 142, and Darren Stevens supplied with the fifth century of the match, making 106 before being bowled by Nantie Hayward. They declared on 549 for 6, leaving themselves roughly three hours in which to bowl Middlesex out for 149 or less, and four wickets from Min Patel gave them hope as Middlesex crashed to 77 for 6 with more than an hour to play. However, Peter Trego kept out 98 balls for a stolid, unbeaten 3, Paul Weekes got a fifty, and Middlesex saved the draw.|$|E

In the season 13 (2009) episode [...] "Fishsticks", Cartman subconsciously believes that he helped in creating a joke that quickly becomes a nationwide sensation, {{despite the fact that the}} character Jimmy Valmer writes the joke without any assistance. Carlos Delgado of If Magazine noted this as [...] "Cartman being so egotistical that he manipulates the past to serve his own purposes".|$|E

500|$|The {{committee}} voted 29–17 {{in favor}} of electing Hoar as temporary chairman of the convention. At midnight, the committee was adjourned, and the members agreed to continue the meeting the following morning. News of Cameron's behavior had spread throughout town overnight. His hardliner strategy had failed, and Conkling and other Grant managers sought to control the situation before it became <b>any</b> <b>worse.</b> The next morning, Conkling asked his trusted colleague, Chester A. Arthur, to solve the problem. Arthur assessed the situation and drew up a compromise. He met Chandler {{and the rest of}} the anti-Grant cabal at the entrance of the committee's suite. Arthur acknowledged that the Grant men had rejected Senator Hoar as the temporary convention chairman the day before, but said that the Grant men might perhaps reconsider. He proposed that the delegates decide on the unit rule in a free vote, and in return, Don Cameron would be restored as the chairman of the national committee. After discussing for a number of minutes, the two men came to an agreement. Arthur was confident that since Chandler, the leader of Blaine's campaign, had accepted the deal, then [...] "it would be agreed by the Grant men." [...] Chandler then discussed the compromise deal with the thirty anti-Grant committee members, and also James Garfield, who had previously expressed his opposition to the unit rule. 23 out of 30 anti-Grant men agreed to the terms, and Garfield commented that the proposition [...] "must be accepted" [...] in [...] "spirit of reconciliation." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1945, McGovern used R time to {{see every}} sight that he could in Rome, and to {{participate}} in an audience with the Pope. Bad weather prevented many missions from being carried out during the winter, and during such downtime McGovern spent much time reading and discussing how the war had come about. He resolved that if he survived it, he would become a history professor. In February, McGovern was promoted to First Lieutenant. On March 14, McGovern had an incident over Austria in which he accidentally bombed a family farmhouse when a jammed bomb inadvertently released above the structure and destroyed it, an event which haunted McGovern. (Four decades later, after a McGovern public appearance in that country, the owner of the farm approached the media to let the Senator know that he was the victim of that incident but that no one had been hurt and the farmer felt that it had been worth the price if that event helped achieve the defeat of Nazi Germany in some small way. McGovern was greatly relieved.) On returning to base from the flight, McGovern was told his first child Ann had been born four days earlier. April 25 saw McGovern's 35thmission, which marked fulfillment of the Fifteenth Air Force's requirement for a combat tour, against heavily defended Linz. The sky turned black and red with flak – McGovern later said [...] "Hell can't be <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> than that" [...] – and the Dakota Queen was hit multiple times, resulting in 110holes in its fuselage and wings and an inoperative hydraulic system. McGovern's waist gunner was injured, and his flight engineer was so unnerved by his experience that he would subsequently be hospitalized with battle fatigue, but McGovern managed to bring back the plane safely with the assistance of an improvised landing technique.|$|E
500|$|Goebbels became {{preoccupied with}} morale {{and the efforts}} {{of the people on the}} home front. He {{believed}} that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be. For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front. At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more [...] "entertaining material" [...] in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment. As Gauleiter of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them <b>any</b> <b>worse.</b> Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim. The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period – the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (February 1943) – were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and skeptical that it could be won. On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defenses and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings. In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local Gauleiters, and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2004, {{the band}} also re-released digitally-remastered {{versions}} {{of all of}} their first six studio albums on Epitaph Records (except Into the Unknown). The How Could Hell Be <b>Any</b> <b>Worse?</b> re-issue, though reclaiming the original title of the band's debut LP, contained all of the same material as the previously issued 80–85 compilation, including their first EP, the Public Service EP (with {{different versions of the}} songs Bad Religion, Slaves, and Drastic Actions than the self-titled EP) and the [...] "Back To The Known" [...] EP. To coincide with the re-issues, they also released their long out-of-print live VHS Along the Way on DVD for the first time. Though Recipe for Hate was released on Epitaph, the album could not be re-issued; {{due to the fact that}} it was re-issued on Atlantic, problems with the rights ownership made a re-issue unlikely.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{described}} Zionism as [...] "an ethno-nationalist quasi-religious ideology" [...] but {{argued that}} Zionism [...] "...nonetheless has founded {{a sort of}} democratic state which isn't <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> in its practice than many others with equally dubious origins." [...] He stated that settlement {{in order to achieve}} security for Israel is [...] "doomed to fail in the worst possible way", and the cessation of this [...] "appallingly racist and messianic delusion" [...] would [...] "confront the internal clerical and chauvinist forces which want to instate a theocracy for Jews". Hitchens contended that the [...] "solution of withdrawal would not satisfy the jihadists" [...] and wondered [...] "What did they imagine would be the response of the followers of the Prophet ?" [...] Hitchens bemoaned the transference of Arab secularism into religious terrorism as a means of democratisation: [...] "the most depressing and wretched spectacle of the past decade, for all those who care about democracy and secularism, has been the degeneration of Palestinian Arab nationalism into the theocratic and thanatocratic hell of Hamas and Islamic Jihad". He maintained that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a [...] "trivial squabble" [...] that has become [...] "so dangerous to all of us" [...] because of [...] "the faith-based element." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1998 in the UK, a {{parliamentary}} working group chaired by MP Roger Gale studied living conditions {{and treatment of}} animals in UK circuses. All {{members of this group}} agreed that a change in the law was needed to protect circus animals. Gale told the BBC, [...] "It's undignified and the conditions under which they are kept are woefully inadequate—the cages are too small, the environments they live in are not suitable and many of us believe {{the time has come for}} that practice to end." [...] The group reported concerns about boredom and stress, and noted that an independent study by a member of the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University [...] "found no evidence that circuses contribute to education or conservation." [...] However, in 2007, a different working group under the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, having reviewed information from experts representing both the circus industry and animal welfare, found an absence of [...] "scientific evidence sufficient to demonstrate that travelling circuses are not compatible with meeting the welfare needs of any type of non-domesticated animal presently being used in the United Kingdom." [...] According to that group's report, published in October 2007, [...] "there appears to be little evidence to demonstrate that the welfare of animals kept in travelling circuses is any better or <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> than that of animals kept in other captive environments." ...|$|E
