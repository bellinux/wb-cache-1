5|$|A crucial goal against Espanyol and a brace against Sevilla {{helped him}} reach 16 goals that season <b>and</b> <b>would</b> see him come sixth in La Liga's top scorer list that season (scoring {{the same amount}} of goals as fellow {{international}} Raúl Tamudo) while he created more assists than anyone.|$|E
5000|$|Oh, that's easy, the optimists. Oh, {{they were}} the ones who said, 'We're going to be out by Christmas.' <b>And</b> Christmas <b>would</b> come, <b>and</b> Christmas <b>would</b> go. Then they'd say, 'We're going to be out by Easter.' <b>And</b> Easter <b>would</b> come, <b>and</b> Easter <b>would</b> go. <b>And</b> then Thanksgiving, <b>and</b> then it <b>would</b> be Christmas again. And they died of a broken heart.|$|R
50|$|The King's subjects, family <b>and</b> courtiers <b>would</b> salute him <b>and</b> there <b>would</b> be a parade. The King, {{royal family}} and other guests <b>and</b> courtiers <b>would</b> {{ride through the}} streets of Kathmandu on elephants.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> so she <b>would,</b> <b>and</b> no one <b>would</b> have {{wondered}} in those days.|$|R
5|$|A {{direct grant}} grammar school would provide 25% of its places {{free of charge}} to {{children}} who had spent at least 2 years in maintained primary schools, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> reserve at least a further 25% of places {{to be paid for}} by the LEA if required.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{commissioned}} by MarriagEquality in February 2009 indicated that 62% of Irish people supported same-sex marriage <b>and</b> <b>would</b> {{vote in favour}} of it if a referendum were held.|$|E

50|$|The bridge {{will reduce}} the {{distances}} between deltaic regions of Krishna and Guntur districts. The distance between Avanigadda <b>and</b> Repalle <b>would</b> be reduced by 156 km, while the distance between Avanigadda <b>and</b> Tenali <b>would</b> come down by 114 km. Similarly, Narsapur of West Godavari <b>and</b> Repalli <b>would</b> come closer by 112 km and the Machilipatnam <b>and</b> Repalli <b>would</b> be closer by 101 km.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> she <b>would</b> never know. If Comus possessed one useless gift to {{perfection}} {{it was the}} gift of laughing at Fate even when it had struck him hardest. One day, perhaps, the laughter <b>and</b> mockery <b>would</b> be silent on his lips, <b>and</b> Fate <b>would</b> {{have the advantage of}} laughing last.|$|R
5|$|After briefly {{serving as}} Assistant Private Secretary, Gilliat {{was chosen to}} replace Oliver Dawnay as Private Secretary to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1956, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> hold the post until his death, 37 years later.

5|$|After {{the victory}} at Smolensk, the Commonwealth army moved towards the {{fortress}} Belaya but the siege became a fiasco. The negotiations begun on 30 April, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> {{end with the}} Treaty of Polyanovka in May.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{also worked}} in Bacton, Norfolk, further up the coast, where night-flying was {{conducted}} {{and was later}} involved in supporting anti-submarine patrols.

60|$|And at {{the sting}} of the thought her courage <b>and</b> {{strength}} <b>would</b> revive, <b>and</b> she <b>would</b> rise again <b>and</b> move about her business.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, {{disputes}} between Westinghouse, GE, RCA, <b>and</b> AT&T <b>would</b> {{lead to a}} significant shift in power in the broadcasting industry.

5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> have been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E
5|$|As a {{byproduct}} of his presence in Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct, Iwata became {{the public face of}} Nintendo.

6000|$|How {{different}} it {{all would}} have been, I could not but reflect, if this {{girl had been}} the sort of girl one chirrups cheerily to over the telephone and takes for spins in the old two-seater. In that case, I would simply have said, [...] "Listen," [...] <b>and</b> she <b>would</b> have said, [...] "What?" [...] <b>and</b> I <b>would</b> have said, [...] "You know Gussie Fink-Nottle," [...] <b>and</b> she <b>would</b> have said, [...] "Yes," [...] <b>and</b> I <b>would</b> have said, [...] "He loves you," [...] <b>and</b> she <b>would</b> have said either, [...] "What, that mutt?

5|$|Besides {{dissolving}} in the water, {{oxygen and}} other gases {{are trapped in}} a type of structure called a clathrate. In clathrate structures, gases are enclosed in an icy cage and look like packed snow.

50|$|On episode 109 of Systm, an {{announcement}} stated that Systm <b>and</b> Tekzilla <b>would</b> be merging, <b>and</b> Systm <b>would</b> become a mini-series {{inside of the}} regular Tekzilla episodes.|$|R

50|$|Example 2B: The {{per capita}} and per stirpes results would differ if D also pre-deceased with one child, D1 (figure 2). Under per stirpes, B1 <b>and</b> B2 <b>would</b> each receive one-sixth (half of Bs one-third share), <b>and</b> D1 <b>would</b> receive one-third (all of Ds one-third share). Under per capita, the two-thirds {{remaining}} after C 's one-third share was taken would be divided equally among all three children of B <b>and</b> D.

5|$|Betances {{accompanied}} {{the couple in}} Prévost's return to his country, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> be under their indirect tutelage while boarding at the school. He showed interest in natural and exact sciences early on, and also became a good fencer.|$|E

50|$|Jack, Ryu, Robo No Hana, Gofire, <b>and</b> Bokuchin <b>would</b> go on {{to cross}} over in the Hiryu No Ken series, in which Robo No Hana <b>and</b> Bokuchin <b>would</b> appear in Flying Dragon (SD Hiryu No Ken Twin) for the Nintendo 64 while Jack, Ryu, <b>and</b> Gofire <b>would</b> later appear with the two in the game's Japan-only sequel SD Hiryu No Ken Densetsu.|$|R
5000|$|Of this timeframe, Grammer said: [...] "...We {{even had}} a whole plan for the unveiling. He was going to release one more ...
