40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{different}} <b>anthropic</b> <b>activities</b> (vineyard: phytosanitary protection; winery: pressing and sulfiting) on the fungal populations of grape berries were studied. The global diversity of fungal populations (moulds and yeasts) {{was performed by}} pyrosequencing. The <b>anthropic</b> <b>activities</b> studied modified fungal diversity. Thus, a decrease in biodiversity was measured for three successive vintages for the grapes of the plot cultivated with Organic protection compared to plots treated with Conventional and Ecophyto protections. The fungal populations were then considerably modified by the pressing-clarification step. The addition of sulfur dioxide also modified population dynamics and favoured the domination of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae during fermentation. The non-targeted chemical analysis of musts and wines by FT-ICR-MS showed that the wines could be discriminated {{at the end of}} alcoholic fermentation as a function of adding SO 2 or not, but also and above all as a function of phytosanitary protection, regardless of whether these fermentations took place in the presence of SO 2 or not.

40|$|Anthrosols {{known as}} Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) have borne {{witness to the}} {{intensification}} of sedentary patterns and the demographic increase in Central Amazon. As a result, a recurring pattern has been observed of mounds with ADE arising from domestic activities and the disposal of waste. The objective {{of this research was}} to demonstrate the relationship of these <b>anthropic</b> <b>activities</b> with pedogenetic formation processes of ADE in the municipality of Iranduba, Brazil. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken from two areas of ADE (pretic horizon) and from a non-anthropic pedon. Physical, chemical, micromorphological and SEM-EDS analyses were performed. The coarse material of the pretic horizons consisted predominantly of quartz, iron nodules, ceramics and charcoal fragments, and the fine material is organo-mineral. There was a direct relationship between the color of pretic horizons and the number of charcoal fragments. The thickness of the ADE results from the redistribution of charcoal at depth through bioturbation, transforming subsurface horizons into anthropic horizons. ADE presents granular microaggregates of geochemical and zoogenetic origin. Degradation of iron nodules is intensified in pretic horizons, promoting a reverse pedogenic process contributing to the xanthization process. Surprisingly the <b>anthropic</b> <b>activities</b> also favor clay dispersion and argilluviation; clay coatings on the ceramic fragments and in the pores demonstrate that this is a current process. Processes identified as contributing to ADE genesis included: i) addition of organic residues and ceramic artifacts (cumulization) with the use of fire; ii) mechanical action of humans, roots and macrofauna (bioturbation); iii) melanization of deeper horizons as a result of bioturbation; iv) argilluviation and degradation of iron nodules. This study offers new support to archaeological research in respect to ADE formation processes in Central Amazon and confirmed the hypothesis that ancient <b>anthropic</b> <b>activities</b> may trigger and/or accelerate pedogenetic processes previously credited only to natural causes. 201...|$|R

This study assesses the halophytic grasslands loss over a period of 30 years in the distribution area of the Bolson tortoise and the effects of climate change on the habitat suitability of these grasslands and its possible impact on this tortoise. Grassland loss was assessed by an analysis of symmetric differences and the habitat suitability model was carried out by the method of overlapping layers raster. Our results showed a grassland loss of 63. 7 %; however, our current habitat suitability model points out that much of the grassland loss has occurred where the environmental conditions are suitable.

It {{is also a}} zone with a {{considerable}} population of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), one of the Mediterranean cetaceans listed as “vulnerable” in IUCN Red List, which is an important fraction of the north-Western Mediterranean population. The MPA is also a zone {{with a high level}} of <b>anthropic</b> <b>activities</b> that point out as the areas where effective conservation actions are needed. Most of the threats (collisions, entanglement in fishnets, and disturbance of feeding or breeding activity) were related to the lack of knowledge of the presence and movement of individuals in the area where the <b>anthropic</b> <b>activities</b> are carried on. Since 2013 concrete conservation actions took place in Portofino MPA with ARION project; the main objective of the project is the improvement of the conservation status of the bottlenose dolphin in the area by the implementation of an interference avoidance system capable to track the dolphins, to identify threats and to prevent collisions by diffusing real time warning messages to all categories involved. Two detection units were placed one kilometer off the coast of Portofino headland. Each unit is a particular type of marine buoy (elastic beacon) equipped with four hydrophones and an acquisition system which can record the typical “social communication whistles” emitted by the dolphins and the sounds emitted by boat engines. Signals are then sent on shore, via wi-fi, and elaborated to get the real time position of dolphins and boats. Upon reception of the warnings the boats present in the area will be invited to follow a protocol of conduct supervised by the Coast Guard.
