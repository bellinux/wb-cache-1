5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find a truth <b>assignment</b> to these {{variables}} that makes the whole formula true. Such an <b>assignment</b> chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so that at least one literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying <b>assignment</b> is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this <b>assignment</b> satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E

This paper explores problems {{with the use of}} group <b>assignments</b> and offers a new strategy designed to keep the good features of group <b>assignments</b> while removing the negative. Many students in Information Technology believe they should have group <b>assignments</b> because they will be working in groups in industry. Staff sometimes justify the use of group <b>assignments</b> as preparing students for team work in industry. However, we suggest that many problems with group <b>assignments</b> can be overcome by making group <b>assignments</b> more closely replicate cond itions in industry.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{extends the}} {{increasing}} {{debates about the}} role of international experience through mechanisms other than standard expatriation packages, in particular through the use of short-term <b>assignments.</b> It explores the different forms of short-term <b>assignments</b> (project work, commuter <b>assignments,</b> virtual international working and development <b>assignments)</b> and the different sets of positive and negative implications these can have for the company and the individuals concerned. The integration-differentiation debate is reflected here as elsewhere in IHRM, with the company moving towards greater centralization and control of its use of these <b>assignments.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Since the research is exploratory, we adopted a qualitative approach to get a more in-depth understanding on the realities the corporations and the assignees are facing. The study was implemented through a single case study setting in which the data were collected by interviewing (n= 20) line managers, human resource management (HRM) staff and assignees themselves. In addition corporate documentation and other materials were reviewed. Findings – The present case study provides evidence about the characteristics of short-term <b>assignments</b> as well as the on the management of such <b>assignments.</b> The paper identifies various benefits and challenges involved in the use of short-term <b>assignments</b> both from the perspectives of the company and assignees. Furthermore, the findings support the view that a recent increase in the popularity of short-term <b>assignments</b> has not been matched by the development of HRM policies for such <b>assignments.</b> Research limitations/implications – As a single case study, limitations in the generalizability of the findings should be kept in mind. More large-scale research evidence is needed around different forms of international <b>assignments</b> beyond standard expatriation in order to fully capture the realities faced by international HRM specialists Practical implications – The paper identifies many challenges but also benefits of using short-term <b>assignments.</b> The paper reports in-depth findings on HR development needs that organizations face when expanding the use of such <b>assignments.</b> Social implications – The paper identifies many challenges but also benefits of using short-term <b>assignments.</b> The paper reports in-depth findings on HR development needs that organizations face when expanding the use of such <b>assignments.</b> Originality/value – Empirical research on short-term <b>assignments</b> is still very limited. In that way the paper provides much needed in-depth evidence on why such <b>assignments</b> are used, what challenges are involved in the use of such <b>assignments</b> and what kinds of HR-development needs are involved...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and compare specific writing <b>assignments</b> provided in the four basal mathematics textbook series, grades six through eight, accepted by the state of Texas in 1990. The student and teachers' editions by each publisher were analyzed (1) for the total number and types of writing <b>assignments</b> provided, (2) to compare how the writing <b>assignments</b> compared with the four purposes of writing mandated in the English Language Arts Framework, Kindergarten through Grade 12 for the state of Texas, (3) to compare how the writing <b>assignments</b> compared with the recommendations for communication opportunities stated in the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics for grades five through eight, and (4) to compare the number and types of writing <b>assignments</b> among the four publishers. The total number of writing <b>assignments</b> varied among publishers ranging from 151 to 316 in the student editions and from 147 to 523 in the teacher's editions. The findings of this study indicate that from 80 to 98 percent of the writing <b>assignments</b> in the student editions and from 72 to 96 percent of the writing <b>assignments</b> in the teacher's editions corresponded to the Informative purpose of writing. Very few writing <b>assignments</b> were provided corresponding to the Literary, Expressive, and Persuasive purposes of writing. The writing <b>assignments</b> corresponding to the NCTM recommendations varied among publishers.
