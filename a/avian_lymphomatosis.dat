40|$|Myeloblastosis-associated virus (MAV) - 2 (0), a virus {{which was}} derived from avian {{myeloblastosis}} virus and induced {{a high incidence of}} osteopetrosis, was compared with <b>avian</b> <b>lymphomatosis</b> virus 5938, a recent field isolate which induced a high incidence of lymphomatosis. The following information was obtained. (i) MAV- 2 (0) induced osteopetrosis, nephroblastoma, and a very low incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. No difference was seen in the oncogenic spectrum of end point and plaque-purified MAV- 2 (0). (ii) 125 I-labeled RNA sequences from MAV- 2 (0) formed hybrids with DNA extracted from osteopetrotic bone at a rate suggesting five proviral copies per haploid cell genome. The extent of hybridization of MAV- 2 (0) RNA with DNA from osteopetrotic tissue was more extensive (87 %) than was observed in reactions with DNA from uninfected chicken embryos (52 %). (iii) Competition of unlabeled viral RNA in hybridization reactions between the radioactive RNA from the two viruses and their respective proviral sequences present in tumor tissues showed that 15 to 20 % of the viral sequences detected in these reactions were unshared. In contrast, no differences were detected in competition analyses of RNA sequences from the two viruses detected in DNA of normal chicken cells. (iv) MAV- 2 (0) 35 S RNA was indistinguishable in size from <b>avian</b> <b>lymphomatosis</b> virus 5938 35 S RNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{tracking}} scientific manuscripts {{to see if}} they were cited in the reference lists of subsequent journal articles was first proposed by Eugene Garfield in 1955. His formula to establish which journals had the highest relative citation rates quickly became known as the impact factor (IF), a number that has now risen to prominence in the academic world of veterinary science,as elsewhere. Although the IF focuses only on those citations obtained during the previous 2 -year period, the idea of counting the total number of citations received by a particular article also attracted the attention of Garfield, who first began undertaking such investigations in the 1970 s. The term ‘citation classics’ was later coined by him to describe specific journal articles that had received an unusually large number of citations. Relatively few studies of citation classics appear to have been conducted in veterinary science, although those that do exist have previously identified <b>avian</b> <b>lymphomatosis,</b> feline leukaemia and neonatal calf diarrhea as topics with potentially high citation rates...|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} nondividing neuroretina cells from chicken embryos can be induced to proliferate {{following}} infection with Rous-associated virus type 1 (RAV- 1), an <b>avian</b> <b>lymphomatosis</b> retrovirus lacking transforming genes. Multiplication of RAV- 1 -infected neuroretina cells is observed {{after a long}} latency period and takes place initially in {{a small number of}} cells. We also show that serial virus passaging onto fresh neuroretina cultures leads to the generation of novel mitogenic viruses containing the mil oncogene. DNA analysis indicated that RAV- 1 is the only provirus detected in cells infected at virus passage 1, whereas neuroretina cells infected at subsequent virus passages harbor mil-containing proviruses. Three viruses, designated IC 1, IC 2, and IC 3, were molecularly cloned. Restriction mapping indicated that in each virus, truncated c-mil sequences were inserted within different portions of the RAV- 1 genome. In addition, IC 1 and IC 2 viruses have transduced novel sequences that belong to the 3 ' noncoding portion of the c-mil locus. All three viruses induce neuroretina cell multiplication and direct the synthesis of mil-specific proteins. Proliferation of neuroretina cells infected at passage 1 of RAV- 1 was not associated with any detectable rearrangement of c-mil, when a v-mil probe was used. However, these cells expressed high levels of an aberrant 2. 8 -kilobase mRNA hybridizing to mil but not to a long terminal repeat probe. Therefore, transcriptional activation of a portion of c-mil could represent the initial events induced by RAV- 1 infection and lead to retroviral transduction of activated c-mil sequences...|$|E
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that all of the cases just described, from the findings, are {{suffered}} from <b>avian</b> visceral <b>lymphomatosis.</b> The microscopical findings which were observed in all the present cases may be summarized as follows : Hyperplasia of the lymphatic tissue a. "Abnormal hyperplasia" of the lymphatic tissue b. "Immaturation" c. "Maturation"[d. Lymphatic tissue outside the question] In the first place, the authors will explain the terms used. "Abnormal hyperplasia" of the lymphatic tissue This is hyperplasia of the lymphatic tissues in which the principal cellular element was composed of large-pale-nuclear cells repeatedly called in the preceding descriptions. The cells was not identical with lymphoblasts, and the authors consider that the cells may be appropriately called germ cells in the lymphatic tissues. The cells of this kind have frequently been called lymphoid cells in the literature (v. discussion). "Immaturation" and "Maturation" Both terms indicate such histological features as the abnormally hyperplastic lymphatic tissues were composed of large-pale-nuclear cells and had a neoplastic character. In "maturation", it is characteristic that the hyperplastic tissues show histological features suggestive of the lymph follicles (v. discussion). Next, the authors illustrate the findings in the three groups. In group 1 (Chart 1) which includes 123 cases, 6 were cases of "abnormal hyperplasia" of the lymphatic tissues, which were only in the chicken stage. Two cases of "immaturation" and one of "maturation" were detected only in the adult stage. In the final experimental phase, no abnormal cases were detected. In general, the same tendency could be also observed in groups 2 and 3 (Charts 2 and 3). From all of the cases illustrated, also, one case of neural lymphomatosis from the December cases of group 1,one case of erythroblastosis from the June cases in the terminal phase of the experiment in group 2,and two cases of neural lymphomatosis from the October cases of group 3 were also detected. Other than these, there were no remarkable infectious diseases in cases which died or were killed by reason of accidents...|$|R
40|$|When {{injected}} into chickens, a transformation-defective mutant of the Prague C strain of Rous sarcoma virus induced tumors at low incidence {{and after a}} long latency. One such tumor released a replication-defective virus designated PR 2257. We molecularly cloned and sequenced the proviral DNA from quail fibroblasts transformed by PR 2257. Comparison of PR 2257 sequence with that of Prague C, cellular src, and 3 ' adjacent cellular DNA showed that the spliced version of the c-src gene and about 950 base pairs (bp) of 3 '-flanking cellular DNA were transduced into PR 2257. This transduction eliminated nearly all replicative genes, since the gag gene splice donor site {{was linked to the}} splice acceptor site of the src gene and, on the 3 ' side, recombination occurred in the end of env gene. Insertion of two extra cytosines 23 bp before and 19 bp after the c-src stop codon resulted in an extension of the coding portion up to 587 amino acids, divergence of sequences after Pro- 525 and replacement of Tyr- 527 by a valine residue. In addition, it appears that the 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated regions of PR 2257 result from multiple recombinations between exogenous and endogenous virus genomes. Limited digestion of p 66 src encoded by PR 2257 with Staphylococcus aureus V 8 protease yielded a V 2 peptide (C-terminal moiety) with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kilodaltons, consistent with the 5. 7 -kilodalton increase expected from the DNA sequence. The structure of PR 2257 suggests that {{the first step in the}} capture of c-src gene by <b>avian</b> <b>lymphomatosis</b> viruses is the trans splicing of the viral leader mRNA to exon 1 of c-src...|$|E
