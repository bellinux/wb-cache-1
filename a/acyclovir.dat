5|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{the use of}} <b>acyclovir</b> and valacyclovir {{in the treatment of}} herpes labialis as well as herpes infections in people with cancer. The evidence to support the use of <b>acyclovir</b> in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is weaker.|$|E
5|$|Several {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective for treating herpes, including <b>acyclovir,</b> valaciclovir (valacyclovir), famciclovir, and penciclovir. <b>Acyclovir</b> {{was the first}} discovered and is now available in generic. Valacyclovir is also available as a generic and is slightly more effective than aciclovir for reducing lesion healing time.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} topical antivirals are {{effective}} for herpes labialis, including <b>acyclovir,</b> penciclovir, and docosanol.|$|E
5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA <b>acyclovir,</b> in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. <b>acyclovir</b> trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to <b>acyclovir</b> becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, <b>acyclovir</b> seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on <b>acyclovir</b> antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E
25|$|An April 2013 Cochrane Collaboration {{meta-analysis}} of 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating oral antiviral medications given within 72 {{hours after the}} onset of herpes zoster rash in immunocompetent people for preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) found {{no significant difference between}} placebo and <b>acyclovir.</b> Combining four RCTs, 44.1% of the <b>acyclovir</b> treatment group developed herpetic neuralgia whereas 53.3% of the placebo group developed herpetic neuralgia. Heterogeneity between the four RCTs was moderate: Chi2 =3.36, df = 2 (P=0.19); I2 = 40%.|$|E
25|$|Most newborn {{infants with}} CAP are hospitalized, {{receiving}} IV ampicillin and gentamicin {{for at least}} ten days to treat the common causative agents streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli. To treat the herpes simplex virus, IV <b>acyclovir</b> is administered for 21 days.|$|E
25|$|Experimental data {{indicate}} that ribavirin may have useful activity against canine distemper. Ribavirin has also {{been used as a}} treatment for herpes simplex virus. One small study found that ribavirin treatment reduced the severity of herpes outbreaks and promoted recovery, as compared with placebo treatment. Another study found that ribavirin potentiated the antiviral effect of <b>acyclovir.</b>|$|E
25|$|Adenoviruses is {{the most}} common cause of viral {{conjunctivitis}} (adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis). Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis (caused by herpes simplex viruses) can be serious and requires treatment with <b>acyclovir.</b> Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses, Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.|$|E
25|$|If {{aciclovir}} by {{mouth is}} started within 24 hours of rash onset, it decreases symptoms by one day {{but has no}} effect on complication rates. Use of <b>acyclovir</b> therefore is not currently recommended for individuals with normal immune function. Children younger than 12 years old and older than one month are not meant to receive antiviral drugs unless they have another medical condition which puts them at risk of developing complications.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acyclovir</b> {{is poorly}} {{water-soluble}} and has poor oral bioavailability (15–30%), hence intravenous administration is necessary if high concentrations are required. When orally administered, peak plasma concentration occurs after 1–2 hours. Aciclovir {{has a high}} distribution rate; protein binding is reported to range from 9 to 33%. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of aciclovir depends according to age group; neonates have a t1/2 of 4 hours, children 1–12 years have a t1/2 of 2–3 hours whereas adults have a t1/2 of 3 hours.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is not {{necessary}} since the lesion is benign, however the person may have esthetic concerns about the appearance. The condition often resolves rapidly with high dose <b>acyclovir</b> or desiclovir but recurs once this therapy is stopped, or as the underlying immunocompromise worsens. Topical use of podophyllum resin or retinoids has also been reported to produce temporary remission. Antiretroviral drugs such as zidovudine may be effective in producing a significant regression of OHL. Recurrence of the lesion may also signify that {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) is becoming ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} {{usually requires}} that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (myeloablation). Prior to the administration of new cells (engraftment) patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient {{at high risk of}} infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics. However, antiviral medications, such as <b>acyclovir</b> and valacyclovir, are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of herpetic infection in seropositive patients. The immunosuppressive agents employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off immunosuppressive medications.|$|E
25|$|Some {{antiviral}} drugs, such as <b>acyclovir</b> (ATC: J05AB01) and ganciclovir (ATC: J05AB06) as well {{as other}} nucleoside analogs make use of the substrate specificity of viral thymidine kinase, as opposed to human thymidine kinases. These drugs act as prodrugs, which in themselves are not toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase. Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic triphosphates that lead to cell death. Human thymidine kinase, in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific thymidine kinase. In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of antiviral drug resistance is frequently observed. Sequencing the thymidine kinase gene in Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of antiviral drug resistance.|$|E
25|$|Infection in {{otherwise}} healthy adults {{tends to be}} more severe. Treatment with antiviral drugs (e.g. <b>acyclovir</b> or valacyclovir) is generally advised, {{as long as it is}} started within 24–48 hours from rash onset. Remedies to ease the symptoms of chickenpox in adults are basically the same as those used for children. Adults are more often prescribed antiviral medication, as it is effective in reducing the severity of the condition and the likelihood of developing complications. Antiviral medicines do not kill the virus but stop it from multiplying. Adults are advised to increase water intake to reduce dehydration and to relieve headaches. Painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) are recommended, as they are effective in relieving itching and other symptoms such as fever or pains. Antihistamines relieve itching and may be used in cases where the itching prevents sleep, because they also act as a sedative. As with children, antiviral medication is considered more useful for those adults who are more prone to develop complications. These include pregnant women or people who have a weakened immune system.|$|E
25|$|Small {{peptides}} can specifically {{inhibit the}} RNR2 subunits from binding with RNR1 when {{they share a}} significant similarity with the normal RNR2 C-terminus. This inhibition RNR2 binding to RNR1 has been tested successfully in herpes simplex virus (HSV) RNR. When a 7 amino acid oligomer (GAVVNDL) truncated from the C-terminus of the RNR2 subunit was used in competition assays, it prevented the normal RNR2 from forming an enzymatically active complex with RNR1. Other small peptide inhibitors similar to the RNR2 C-terminus have also been used successfully to inhibit HSV RNR enzymatic activity and thus HSV replication. In mice models of stromal keratitis and corneal neovascularization (HSV ocular disease), a small RNR2 C-terminal analog BILD 1263 {{has been reported to}} inhibit RNR and is effective in preventing these diseases. In some cases, although treatment with small C-terminal analogs may not stop disease spreading, they can still help in healing. In the acyclovir-resistant HSV (PAAr5), a small peptide inhibitor BILD 1633 has been reported to be 5 to 10 times more potent than BILD 1263 against cutaneous PAAr5 infection. A combination therapy approach (BILD 1633 and <b>acyclovir)</b> is more effective to heal topical lesions in mice. These data suggest that small peptide inhibitors that compete with RNR2 for binding to RNR1 are useful in preventing the spread of HSV.|$|E

500|$|Pedro Cuatrecasas states, [...] "during the R of <b>acyclovir</b> (Zovirax), {{marketing}} [...] {{insisted that}} there were 'no markets' for this compound. Most had hardly heard of genital herpes..." [...] Thus, marketing the medical condition – separating the 'normal cold sore' from the 'stigmatized genital infection' was to become the key to marketing the drug, a process now known as 'disease mongering'.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{irreversible}} inhibitors form covalent adducts {{with their}} enzyme targets. Some reversible inhibitors bind so tightly to their target enzyme {{that they are}} essentially irreversible. These tight-binding inhibitors may show kinetics similar to covalent irreversible inhibitors. In these cases, some of these inhibitors rapidly bind to the enzyme in a low-affinity EI complex and this then undergoes a slower rearrangement to a very tightly bound EI* complex (see figure above). This kinetic behaviour is called slow-binding. This slow rearrangement after binding often involves a conformational change as the enzyme [...] "clamps down" [...] around the inhibitor molecule. Examples of slow-binding inhibitors include some important drugs, such methotrexate, allopurinol, and the activated form of <b>acyclovir.</b>|$|E
500|$|The risk of {{transmission}} from mother to baby is highest {{if the mother}} becomes infected {{around the time of}} delivery (30% to 60%), since insufficient time will have occurred for the generation and transfer of protective maternal antibodies before the birth of the child. In contrast, the risk falls to 3% if the [...] infection is recurrent, and is 1–3% if the woman is seropositive for both HSV-1 and HSV-2, and is less than 1% if no lesions are visible. Women seropositive for only one type of HSV are only half as likely to transmit HSV as infected seronegative mothers. To prevent neonatal infections, seronegative women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1-seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy. Mothers infected with HSV are advised to avoid procedures that would cause trauma to the infant during birth (e.g. fetal scalp electrodes, forceps, and vacuum extractors) and, should lesions be present, to elect caesarean section to reduce exposure of the child to infected secretions in the birth canal. The use of antiviral treatments, such as <b>acyclovir,</b> given from the 36th week of pregnancy, limits HSV recurrence and shedding during childbirth, thereby reducing the need for caesarean section.|$|E

2500|$|Aciclovir (ACV), {{also known}} as <b>acyclovir,</b> is an {{antiviral}} medication. It is primarily used {{for the treatment of}} herpes simplex virus infections, chickenpox, and shingles.

It can be taken by mouth, applied as a cream, or injected.|$|E
2500|$|Bortezomib is {{associated}} with peripheral neuropathy in 30% of patients; occasionally, it can be painful. [...] This can be worse in patients with pre-existing neuropathy. In addition, myelosuppression causing neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can also occur and be dose-limiting. However, these side effects are usually mild relative to bone marrow transplantation and other treatment options for patients with advanced disease. Bortezomib {{is associated}} with a high rate of shingles, although prophylactic <b>acyclovir</b> can reduce the risk of this.|$|E
2500|$|In some {{research}} the {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV-1) has been identified in a majority of cases diagnosed as Bell's palsy. [...] This has given hope for anti-inflammatory and anti-viral drug therapy (prednisone and <b>acyclovir).</b> [...] Other research, however, identifies HSV-1 in only 31 cases (18 percent), [...] herpes zoster (zoster sine herpete) in 45 cases (26 percent) {{in a total of}} 176 cases clinically diagnosed as Bell's Palsy. [...] That infection with herpes simplex virus should {{play a major role in}} cases diagnosed as Bell's palsy therefore remains a hypothesis that requires further research.|$|E

50|$|Herpetic stromal {{keratitis}} {{is treated}} initially with prednisolone drops every 2 hoursaccompanied by a prophylactic antiviral drug: either topical antiviral or an oral agent such as <b>acyclovir</b> or valacyclovir. The prednisolone drops are tapered every 1-2 weeks {{depending on the}} degree of clinical improvement. Topical antiviral medications are not absorbed by the cornea through an intact epithelium, but orally administered <b>acyclovir</b> penetrates an intact cornea and anterior chamber.

50|$|Although it is a self-limited illness, oral or {{intravenous}} antiviral treatments, particularly <b>acyclovir,</b> {{have been}} used in the management of immunocompromised or severely infected patients.
