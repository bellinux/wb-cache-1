5|$|In {{the next}} match, Men on <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> {{challenged}} The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Although The Quebecers attacked Men on <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> before the bell, Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers. The Quebecers used several double-team moves against their opponents, but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb. Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche, allowing The Quebecers to suplex him. The Quebecers performed an assisted senton on Mabel {{but did not}} get a pinfall. Men on <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> regained the advantage, prompting The Quebecers' manager, Johnny Polo, to pull his wrestlers out of the ring. Men on <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> won the match by countout, but they did not win the belts.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to CAP's own corporate fleet, many member-owned aircraft are {{made available for}} official tasking by CAP's volunteers should the need arise. Aircraft on search missions are generally crewed by at least three qualified aircrew members: <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> Pilot, responsible for the safe flying of the aircraft; <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> Observer, responsible for navigation, communications and coordination of the mission as well as ground observation; and <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> Scanner {{who is responsible for}} looking for crash sites and damage clues. Additionally, the mission scanner may double as a satellite digital imaging system (SDIS) operator. Larger aircraft may have additional scanners aboard, providing greater visual coverage. Because of the additional ARCHER equipment, the crew of a Civil Air Patrol GA8 Airvan may also include an operator of the ARCHER system, depending upon the requirements of the mission and the capabilities of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Men on <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> {{continued}} to challenge The Quebecers for the tag team belts. Men on <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> won the title on March 29, 1994. This {{is said to}} have been an unplanned title change, as Mabel accidentally fell on Pierre to get the pinfall. This title reign lasted only two days, however, as The Quebecers won the titles back in a rematch.|$|E

5|$|From November 2009 until November 2010, the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{once again}} {{returned}} to Afghanistan, {{this time to}} the provinces of Logar and Wardak. With combat experience already earned in other similar mountain regions in 2007 and 2008, the Brigade distinguished itself in combat regularly against the Taliban and fought tenaciously against them, while still promoting and attempting to legitimize the Afghan government. The 1st and 2nd Battalions saw extensive action in eastern Logar and Wardak. The 1/91st Cavalry was given <b>a</b> <b>mission</b> to transform western Logar province into a secure environment; <b>a</b> <b>mission</b> that was not greeted as an easy task. Given the province and its three major districts saw a massive influx of both foreign and domestic fighters due to the relatively calm winter prior to the brigade's arrival, its company-sized and platoon-sized elements found themselves in combat against anti-Coalition forces almost daily {{from the start of}} March 2010 until its relief. The brigade returned to its home station in Europe in November 2010. Seven soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment.|$|E

He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945, and Durham was dissolved. He reacted with shock that London had {{decided that it was}} too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim. He was uneasy about being set on the sideline, and headed <b>a</b> <b>mission</b> of four men from Stockholm to Namsvatnet {{at the end of the}} month to receive British sabotage supplies.
