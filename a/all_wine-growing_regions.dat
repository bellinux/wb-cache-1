The goal of the project is to develop an interactive application where winegrowers and other ac-tors involved in wine-cultivation can input and share data (both spatial and non-spatial) and information related to wine-cultivation. For wine-cultivation {{it is essential to}} have knowledge about the soils and the microclimate, but also about growing-techniques and other factors. A first step was therefore to collect the information of <b>all</b> <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions</b> of the canton in a spatial database. A second step was to develop a prototype of an interactive system, accessible through the internet in order to evaluate manners to present the collected infor-mation and to enable winegrowers to share and administrate their own data. The third and ongoing step is the development of the final application where all groups, involved in wine-cultivation will have access to the system. This paper focuses {{on the development of the}} prototype and gives an outlook of how the future system will work. It also deals with the question on how data (both spa-tial and non-spatial) from different actors can be collected and validated in one collaborative system...|$|E
40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{the issues of}} grape plants resistance to low temperatures; it is an urgent problem for <b>all</b> <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions</b> of the world, located in the zone of risky agriculture. Losses caused by frost, indicate long-standing necessity of perfection of assortment in terms of enhancing its hardiness by enriching more resistant genotypes obtained both through the introduction or naturalization, {{as well as from}} the crossing of indigenous with interspecies hybrids. Methodology for evaluating frost resistance properties of the material served as a preparation for the originality of his research and experimental evaluation of the unique divisibility properties of the aim. Thus, we initially conducted hardening of matured cuttings at positive temperature plus 8 plus 4 ° C for 14 days (I quenching phase) and a negative temperature minus 5 ° C-minus 7 ° C for 9 days and minus 10 ° C- 1 day (II hardening phase). Then the cuttings we frozen in the temperature range from minus 16 ° C to the next steps of consistent freezing (minus 16 ° C - 2 days; minus 18 ° C - 2 days; minus 20 ° C - 2 days; minus 22 ° C – 1 day, minus 24 ° C - 1 day, minus 26 ° C - 1 day, minus 28 ° C - 1 day and minus 30 ° C - 8 hours). After freezing of cuttings of each variety, the sample was placed on the 3 days in the refrigerator at the temperature of + 2 ° C to their gradual thawing. Cuttings were grown at room temperature on water. As a result, obtained by the accounting: the lowest frost-resistance among the studied forms of parental Crimean origins was found in grades of Shabash, Soldayya and Solnechnodolinsky; the varieties of Dzevat kara, Kokur bely, Kokur cherny, Misket, Misgyuli kara, Sari Pandas were set as a weak level (- 20 °C); Aybatly, Kefesiya, Kok pandas and Ekim kara have average level up to - 22 °C; the highest frost-resistance - 24 °C – was shown by Khersonessky and Kapselsky. Also, we have identified synthetic frost-resistant F 1 -population and plus-transgressive selection for...|$|E
40|$|Black Rot of grapevine {{is caused}} by the Ascomycet _Guignardia bidwellii_. The {{pathogen}} was introduced from North America to Europe in the 19 th century. Since 2002, increased effects of the disease have been noticed, causing significant yield losses in the region of Mosel and infections in <b>all</b> German <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions.</b> For that reason, it is important to breed Black Rot-resistant grapevine cultivars. A method has been developed to characterize lots of vines in a fast and reliable way concerning their susceptibility. Initial data has been collected and can be used for genetic analysis (here QTL). The aim of the project is to develop a molecular marker correlating with Black Rot resistance which can be used to select juvenile plants and therefore support the breeding of resistant cultivars...|$|R

50|$|Today Slovenia {{has more}} than 28,000 wineries making between 80 and 90 million litres {{annually}} from the country's 22,300 ha of vineyards. About 75% of the country's production is white wine. Almost all of the wine is consumed domestically with only 6.1 million l a year being exported - mostly to the United States, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and lately the Czech Republic. Most of the country's wine production falls under the classification of premium (vrhunsko) wine with less than 30% classified as basic table wine (namizno vino). Slovenia has three principal wine regions: the Drava <b>Wine-growing</b> <b>Region,</b> the Lower Sava <b>Wine-growing</b> <b>Region,</b> and the Littoral <b>Wine-growing</b> <b>Region.</b>|$|R
