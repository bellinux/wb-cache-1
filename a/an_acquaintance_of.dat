He hoped to be appointed to the Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert, <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> Poe's friend Frederick Thomas. Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk. Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.|$|E
5|$|Lord {{signed up}} as bassist his friend Simper, whose fame {{at the time}} came from his {{membership}} in {{the rock and roll}} group Johnny Kidd & The Pirates and for having survived the car crash in 1966 that killed Kidd. The line-up of Roundabout was completed by drummer Bobby Woodman, recruited by Blackmore. Dave Curtiss, <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> Woodman, was at first considered as singer, but he left to fulfill previous commitments. According to Simper, Ian Gillan, the singer of the band Episode Six, was also contacted for an audition, but declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{began to}} {{circulate}} among the Hopleys' servants, suggesting that Hopley's wife {{had spent the}} night prior to the body's discovery cleaning up evidence of her husband's murder of the boy. Reginald's older brother, Reverend John Henry Cancellor, Jr. (1834–1900), arrived in Eastbourne from Send, Surrey, on 25April. He noticed discrepancies in the reports of his brother's death and requested an autopsy. Hopley asked prominent physician Sir Charles Locock, <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> the Cancellor family and an obstetrician to the Queen, to examine the body and verify death by natural causes; Locock believed that Hopley was responsible for the death.|$|E

Bell later moved to Dublin and joined an Irish showband named The Dreams, but left in 1969 {{with a view to}} forming a rock band. <b>An</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> Bell's, Belfast organist Eric Wrixon (29 June 1947 – 13 July 2015), also a former member of Them, had also moved to Dublin and joined the showband circuit, but had similar plans to progress towards rock music.|$|E
5|$|His {{library and}} {{collections}} {{were left to}} his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried {{to sell it to}} Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books.

5|$|In 1708, Leszczyński {{appointed}} Poniatowski {{his personal}} representative to Charles XII. He {{participated in the}} Battle of Holowczyn that year, and served as an aide to Charles XII during his exile in the Ottoman Empire after the Battle of Poltava in 1709. Here, he worked to establish an alliance between the Ottomans and the Swedes, aiming to bring the Ottomans into the war against Russia. Due to diplomatic efforts {{on the part of}} the French, aligned with Sweden, the Ottomans began to campaign against the Russians in 1710. With this change in Ottoman foreign policy came the dismissal of Çorlulu Ali Pasha, Grand Vizier of Ahmed III. His successor, Köprülü Numan Pasha, was <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> Poniatowski and had been a supporter of an anti-Russian shift in Ottoman politics.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few people}} visited the cave during the next decade. Among them was Thomas Condon, {{professor}} of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson's brother, in 1884 he {{and a group of}} students hiked from Williams to the cavern, which they inspected by candlelight. Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business. Burch and his partners opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.|$|E
5|$|Soemanang {{had been}} working at the Tjaja Timoer newspaper, while Sipahoetar was an {{employee}} for a Dutch advertisement agency.

Soemanang named the agency Antara based on Perantaraan, a weekly magazine he had previously established in Bogor. He became its editor-in-chief, while Sipahoetar became a senior editor. Antara's first news bulletin reporting its own establishment, was reprinted in the newspapers Perasaan Kita on 14 December 1937 and Kebangoenan the following day. Sanusi Pane, Armijn Pane's older brother and Kebangoenans editor-in-chief, and Perasaan Kita editor-in-chief Prawoto Soemodilogo were appointed to the agency's board of directors.|$|E

5|$|This episode {{originated}} as {{a script}} from freelance writer Scott Kaufer, who was <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> Chris Carter and former employee of California magazine and Warner Bros comedy development department. Chris Carter rewrote the script, {{which included the}} addition of Barnett's salamander hand. Fox's standards and practices department fought with the producers over the scene where Barnett strangles Reggie Purdue, {{and as a result}} the producers were forced to reduce the length of the scene. The footage of the young girl with progeria was filmed after the production crew contacted the Progeria Society and were put in touch with the family of Courtney Arciaga, who was a young girl with the disease. She and her family were fans of the series, and were flown from their San Diego home to Vancouver to shoot the scene.|$|E
5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic {{look back at the}} early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his point is that the human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E

5|$|After 18 to 24 {{months of}} development, Maniac Mansion debuted at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was {{released}} for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in October 1987. While previous Lucasfilm Games products {{had been published}} by outside companies, Maniac Mansion was self-published. This became a trend at Lucasfilm. The company hired Ken Macklin, <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> Winnick's, to design the game's packaging artwork. Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design the back cover. The two also created an insert that includes hints, a backstory, and jokes. An MS-DOS port was released in early 1988, developed in part by Lucasfilm employees Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) followed, with the Amiga and Atari ST ports in 1989 and the NES port in 1990. The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a copy protection system requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a code book include with the game. This was not present in the Commodore 64 and Apple versions {{due to lack of}} disk space, so those instead used an on-disk copy protection.|$|E
5|$|During {{his life}} Etty had {{acquired}} followers such as Irish painters William Mulready and Daniel Maclise, but both rejected Etty's preoccupation with nudes. Mulready painted nudes but became {{best known for}} domestic genre paintings, while Maclise chose to specialise in more traditional history paintings and exhibited only one nude work in his career. One of the few painters who consciously attempted to continue Etty's style after his death was William Edward Frost, who had been <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> Etty's since 1825. In the early 1830s Frost painted on commission for Thomas Potts (whose 1833 commission of Etty to paint his daughter Elizabeth's portrait had been Etty's first significant portrait commission), and later was commissioned on Etty's recommendation to paint a portrait of Etty's cousin Thomas Bodley. Frost successfully imitated Etty throughout his career, {{to the extent that}} his figure studies and Etty's are often misattributed to each other. Although Frost eventually became a Royal Academician in 1870, by this time Etty's style of painting had badly fallen out of fashion.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had long}} been <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> John Fitch, the first to build a {{steamboat}} in the United States, and the two had worked together on steam projects. The Oruktor Amphibolos was Evans's lone attempt at building his own steamboat powered by a high-pressure engine and Evans himself was often vague in appraising its capabilities. Yet Robert Fulton had found success with the North River Steamboat on the Hudson River in 1807, and thereafter steamboats became a reality. Although he used low-pressure engines, Fulton had in 1812 contacted Evans {{about the possibility of}} using Evans's engines, though that correspondence did not lead to the implementation of any of Evans's designs for Fulton's steamships. The Mississippi and tributaries experienced far stronger currents than eastern counterparts, and low-pressure steamboats lacked the power to counteract these. The Enterprise was the first viable steamboat to run on these rivers, and its designer Daniel French employed an adapted Evans' engine for the purpose. High-pressure engines became the standard on the Mississippi, though relatively few of those were actually built by the Pittsburgh works as Evans' patent on high-pressure engines was not widely enforced, and many other engine shops opened on the Mississippi that freely adapted Evans' designs for their own purposes.|$|E

5|$|In Act I, the Shard-bearer's story resumes {{after the}} defeat of the King of Shadows. The player awakens alone in an {{underground}} barrow in Rashemen, where he meets Safiya, a Red Wizard of Thay. The player follows Safiya to the Veil Theater in the nearby town of Mulsantir, hoping to find Lienna, <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> Safiya’s mother, who is supposed to provide the player with some much-needed answers. Unfortunately, the player finds that the theater has been attacked by Red Wizards, and Lienna has been killed. At the back of the theater, the player finds a portal to the Plane of Shadow, a dark reflection of the Prime Material Plane, where he defeats the Red Wizards who murdered Lienna. Upon returning to the Prime Material Plane, the player finds that the spirit-god Okku has besieged Mulsantir, demanding the player’s blood. The player confronts Okku and defeats his spirit army. At the end of the battle, the player learns that he has become a spirit-eater, an accursed being who must feed upon feys and elementals (and sometimes mortal souls) in order to survive.|$|E
5|$|In February 1924, Lethbridge married Sylvia Robertson in a {{ceremony}} held at Salisbury Cathedral. Together they moved into a house known as The Lodge in Waterbeach. There, their first two sons were born: Christopher John in March 1925 and Hugh Periam in July 1926. In 1927, they moved to Mount Blow, a house in Shelford designed by architect Edwin Lutyens. It was there that Sylvia {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Belinda Mary, in April 1930. Sylvia suffered from mental illness however, resulting in repeated hospitalisation. Lethbridge meanwhile devoted much of his time to yachting around the British Isles, sometimes taking family members with him. Over the course of the 1930s he self-published a series of books featuring his own sketches and engravings of maritime scenes. He also deepened his interest in the paranormal during this period, coming to believe that <b>an</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>of</b> his was a genuine psychic and observing an unidentified flying object in Bracknell.|$|E
