5|$|The 1976 All Blacks tour of <b>apartheid</b> South Africa {{generated}} {{much controversy}} {{and led to}} the boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal by 33 African nations after the IOC refused to ban the team. New Zealand again failed to win the test series in South Africa: they did not do so until 1996, after the fall of <b>apartheid.</b> The 1976 tour contributed to the Gleneagles Agreement being adopted by the Commonwealth Heads of State in 1977.|$|E

5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under <b>apartheid,</b> white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the <b>apartheid</b> system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} <b>apartheid,</b> when <b>apartheid</b> {{legislation}} {{had been}} repealed, Springbok colours started to be issued to non-whites again. In 1994, following the election of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress, the National Colours Board {{was set up to}} control the distribution of Springbok colours. Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding Springbok colours following the replacement of the Springbok by the Protea following a government demand. The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain Springbok colours was the South African Rugby Union as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} that European {{settlers}} first arrived in South Africa in 1652, the country was divided on racial lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided. Following its general election victory in 1948, the National Party, led by Daniel Malan, formalised this racism under a government policy called <b>apartheid.</b> Under <b>apartheid,</b> different races were kept apart {{in all aspects of}} life. This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down and laws, supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral traditions in general and poetry in particular was well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to <b>apartheid.</b> Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by <b>apartheid).</b> Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these traditions. In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Sophiatown , {{also known}} as Sof'town or Kofifi, is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. Sophiatown was a legendary black {{cultural}} hub that was destroyed under <b>apartheid,</b> rebuilt {{under the name of}} Triomf, and in 2006 officially returned to its original name. Sophiatown was one of the oldest black areas in Johannesburg and its destruction represents some of the excesses of South Africa under <b>apartheid.</b> Despite the violence and poverty, it was the epicentre of politics, jazz and blues during the 1940s and 1950s. It produced some of South Africa's most famous writers, musicians, politicians and artists.|$|E

He was excommunicated by the Dutch Reformed Church for his views, but subsequently re-accepted after <b>apartheid’s</b> abolition.|$|R
5|$|Approximately 27,000 Boer {{women and}} {{children}} died in British concentration camps, resulting in a long-lasting legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners.

He had been brought up in an anti-apartheid atmosphere; although his parents were not activists, they were opposed to racial discrimination and this was to have a profound influence on his later career. Like many other South African Jews, he chose to become conspicuously active in public life in an effort to oppose or alleviate the worst aspects of <b>apartheid.</b> While he was chairman of {{the university}}'s Students' Representative Council, he campaigned against the exclusion of black students. He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, including the African National Congress, which was a banned organisation at the time. On one occasion he secretly tape-recorded a spy sent by the police to infiltrate the anti-apartheid student movement at the university. The recording was later used as evidence in the firing of the national police commissioner.|$|E
