50|$|Mammals in {{the reserve}} include South Andean deer, guanacos, pumas and canines {{of the genus}} Lycalopex. Notable birds that inhabit {{in the area are}} the <b>austral</b> <b>parakeet</b> and the Andean condor.Lenga is the most common tree species in the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna {{includes}} {{three types of}} cauquenes (sheldgeese) namely, cauquen comun (upland goose or Magellan goose), cauquen real (ashy-headed goose) and caranca (kelp goose), found in open places and beaches. Other birds include Patagonian woodpeckers, notably the spectacular Magellanic woodpecker, maca común, common maca, heron, pato creston (crested duck), duck overo, corn duck, eagle, southern carancho, chimango. Condors are seen flying on the peaks and valleys of Tierra del Fuego. It is also home the <b>austral</b> <b>parakeet,</b> Enicognathus ferrugineus, a species of parrot.|$|E

40|$|Most {{ecosystems}} of {{the world}} are being increasingly invaded by a variety of alien species. However, {{little is known about the}} combined ecological impacts of multiple co-occurring invaders. We assessed the impact of a community of exotic mammals (five domestic and four wild) on forests of monkey puzzle (Araucaria araucana), a globally endangered tree restricted to ca 400 km 2 on the slopes of the Andes in Chile and Argentina. Seeds of monkey puzzles provide food during winter to a small community of native mice and <b>Austral</b> <b>parakeets</b> (Enicognathus ferrugineus). We recorded the number of uneaten seeds and the number of young seedlings at the end of winter under 516 female monkey puzzle trees located across the species’ distribution, and identified the signals of native and exotic species that visited the under-canopy of each tree. Moreover, we studied the diet and foraging behavior of <b>Austral</b> <b>parakeets</b> to explore the potential indirect effects of exotic mammals through the disruption of a key ecosystem service (seed dispersal) supposedly provided by parakeets. All but one tree were visited by at least one seed predator species. <b>Austral</b> <b>parakeets</b> and mice predated seeds from 85 % and at least 45 % of the trees, respectively, and both the number of remaining seeds and seedlings were significantly larger when only parakeets or mice predated seeds than when exotic mammals also visited the trees. At least 90 % of trees were visited by one or more exotic species, and the number of seeds and seedlings dropped drastically when at least two and four exotic species visited the tree, respectively. <b>Austral</b> <b>parakeets</b> mostly foraged on monkey puzzle trees during the winter period and dispersed their seeds in most feeding instances once seeds fell to the ground. The proliferation of exotic mammals may reduce the populations of native seed-predators in the long-term as well as the regeneration of monkey puzzle forests, directly through a reduction of seed availability and seedling survival, and indirectly through the disruption of dispersal processes. Our results show how strategies based on protecting areas may assure the survival of individuals of this long-lived (up to 1300 yr) tree species. However, forest regeneration and the community of native seed-predators and related ecological processes further depend on the proper management of exotic mammal invasions...|$|R
50|$|The <b>austral</b> <b>parakeet,</b> austral conure, or emerald parakeet (Enicognathus ferrugineus) is {{a parrot}} found from the {{southern}} tip of South America - further south than any other parrot - to as far north as Temuco. It is a fairly large conure, 35 cm (2 cm more than a monk or quaker parakeet). It is primarily green, lightly barred, with some dull red on the forehead and lores, belly, and upper tail, with {{the northern part of the}} range displaying less red.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} {{dramatic}} scenery, with waterfalls, forests, mountains and glaciers. Its 630 km2 include {{parts of the}} Fagnano and Roca lakes. The Senda Costera (Coastal Path), connecting Ensenada Bay to Lapataia Bay on Lago Roca, is a popular hiking trail within the park. Forests of Antarctic beech, lenga beech and coihue in the lower elevations of the park are home to many animal species. There are 20 species of terrestrial mammals, including the guanaco, Andean fox, North American beaver, European rabbit and muskrat. Among the 90 species of birds are the kelp goose, torrent duck, <b>austral</b> <b>parakeet,</b> Andean condor, blackish oystercatcher, and Magellanic oystercatcher.|$|E
50|$|Animals include river otters (Lontra longicaudis), {{southern}} Andean huemuls (Hippocamelus bisulcus), pudus (small deer), foxes, cougars, guanacos and maras. Huillin (Lontra provocax), {{an endangered}} native otter, {{has been reported}} in the park. Birds reported include Magellanic woodpeckers, green <b>austral</b> <b>parakeets,</b> geese, ducks, swans, blue-eyed cormorants, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) and green-backed firecrowns (Saphonoides sephaniodes). Amphibian fauna reported are Hylorina sylvatica and Bufo spinolosus. Five genera and 32 species of Simuliidae (black fly) have been recorded. These genera are Cnesia, Cnesiamima, Gigantodax, Paraustrasimulium, and Simulium (Pternaspatha), a subgenus of Simulium with 19 species; these account for 57% of the Simuliidae fauna found in Argentina.|$|R
2500|$|Bird life {{is often}} abundant. The {{southern}} caracara (Caracara plancus) {{is one of}} the characteristic objects of a Patagonian landscape; the presence of <b>austral</b> <b>parakeets</b> (Enicognathus ferrugineus) as far south as the shores of the strait attracted the attention of the earlier navigators; and green-backed firecrowns (Sephanoides sephaniodes), a species of hummingbird, may be seen flying amidst the falling snow. One of the largest birds in the world, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) can be seen in Patagonia. [...] Of the many kinds of waterfowl it is enough to mention the Chilean flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), the upland goose (Chloephaga picta), and in the strait the remarkable steamer ducks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Parasite {{species are}} {{important}} components of biodiversity, as they provide valuable information about host health, evolutionary relationships, population structures, trophic interactions, {{the existence of}} environmental stresses, and climatic conditions. With the aim of describing the parasites associated with parrots of the genus Enicognathus Gray 1840 from central Chile, thirteen <b>austral</b> <b>parakeets,</b> Enicognathus ferrugineus, and five slender-billed parakeets, E. leptorhynchus, were examined between September 2007 and March 2014. The prevalence of ectoparasites and endoparasites was 88. 9 % and 22. 2 %, respectively. On eleven of the E. ferrugineus (84. 6 %) analyzed, and {{on all of the}} E. leptorhynchus analyzed (100 %), five feather mite species (Pararalichus hastifolia, Genoprotolichus major, Protonyssus sp., Fainalges sp., and Eurydiscalges sp.) were collected. On ten E. ferrugineus (76. 9 %) and two E. leptorhynchus (40 %), the chewing lice Heteromenopon macrurum, Psittacobrossus patagoni, and Paragoniocotes enicognathidis were collected. The nematode Capillaria plagiaticia was collected from three E. ferrugineus (23. 1 %), and the nematode Ascaridia hermaphrodita was found in one E. leptorhynchus (20 %). The presence of C. plagiaticia, Protonyssus sp., Fainalges sp., and Eurydiscalges sp. from the two Enicognathus spp. are new records for Chile and represent new parasite-host associations...|$|R
