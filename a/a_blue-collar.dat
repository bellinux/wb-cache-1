Other {{members of the family}} include Peter's {{responsible}} but rebellious wife Lois Griffin, voiced by Alex Borstein; their self-loathing goody two-shoes teenage daughter Meg, voiced by Lacey Chabert; and their socially-awkward teenage son Chris, voiced by Seth Green.|$|E
5|$|The {{major league}} {{game in the}} United States was {{originally}} targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> audience. A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, {{working with}} {{agents in the}} FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a {{psychological}} profile of the unidentified bomber which described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence with connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 {{in favor of an}} alternative theory developed by FBI analysts concentrating on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the bomber suspect was characterized as <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> airplane mechanic. A 1-800 hotline was set up by the UNABOM Task Force to take any calls related to the Unabomber investigation, with a $1million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.|$|E

25|$|Many critics {{considered}} the show notable {{as one of}} the first sitcoms to realistically portray <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> American family with two parents working outside the home, as well as lead characters who were noticeably overweight without their weight being the target of jokes.|$|E
25|$|Weldon {{grew up in}} <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> {{family in}} Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. He was the {{youngest}} of nine children. He attended West Chester University of Pennsylvania and earned a B.A. in Russian Studies in 1969, making him the first in his family to graduate from college. At West Chester University, Weldon became a brother of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{smokestack}} {{industries and}} <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> work ethic defined Lima. Nothing played a bigger part in shaping the city's self-image than its connection to railroads and railroading – as a Midwestern rail hub and even more as home to the Lima Locomotive Works, whose products for more than 70 years carried the city's name globally.|$|E

25|$|The ornate riverfront balustrades {{that line}} the Des Moines and Raccoon River were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local {{employment}} and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a post-industrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> industrial city to a white-collar professional city.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Elba {{signed on}} as the lead role of the film Daddy's Little Girls, playing Monty, <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> {{mechanic}} {{who falls in love}} with an attorney helping him gain custody of his kids, and finds the relationship and his custody hopes threatened by the return of his former wife. He appeared in 28 Weeks Later (2007) and This Christmas (2007), which brought in nearly $50 million at the box office in 2007. In 2008, he starred in the horror film Prom Night and the criminal comedy RocknRolla. In 2009, he starred in the horror film The Unborn and in Obsessed, a thriller that had him cast opposite Beyoncé. The latter was a box office success, taking $29 million in its opening weekend.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{comments}} on these speculations appeared early on. But as psychiatric historian Jan Armbruster (University of Greifswald) judged, {{they were not}} sufficiently convincing, {{such as in the}} case of journalist Ottmar Katz, author of a biography of Hitler's personal physician, Theodor Morell (1982). Katz suggested that Karl Kroner might have had personal reasons to report some untruths: living as a Jewish refugee in Reykjavik and forced to earn his life as <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> worker, Kroner possibly hoped that the U.S. authorities would not only acknowledge him as a key witness but also help him to reestablish his medical practice. A comprehensive plausibility test was finally performed by the Berlin psychiatrist and psychotherapist Peter Theiss-Abendroth in 2008. In 2009, Armbruster carried this analysis forward, dismantled the hypotheses of Hitler’s hysteria diagnosis and hypnotherapy completely, and showed in detail how the story of Hitler’s alleged treatment by Forster became progressively elaborate and detailed between 1943 and 2006, not due to the evaluation of historical documents, but to continuous addition of narrative embellishments. Furthermore, Armbruster’s work offers the to date most comprehensive critique of the methodological weaknesses of many Hitler pathographies.|$|E

500|$|Tonelli {{was born}} Mark Lyndon Leembruggen into a working-class family in Ipswich, a city [...] {{southwest}} of Brisbane, {{the capital of}} Queensland. His father Lyndon was <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> worker of Dutch origin and his Irish mother Muriel worked in the Queensland Department of Industrial Relations. Muriel was pregnant with twins, but miscarried one of the babies and gave birth only to Mark. The family moved to the northern outback mining town of Mount Isa, where Lyndon worked as a miner. There, Muriel left her husband and married Renato [...] "Ray" [...] Tonelli, an Italian immigrant labourer. Still a toddler, Tonelli and his stepfather left the town and returned to Brisbane. He adopted his stepfather's surname, but did not officially change his name until he was 18.|$|E
500|$|Selman {{was pleased}} with the {{finished}} result of the episode. He noted in the interview with Grub Street that Marge starting to blog about food [...] "does not sound inherently exciting, but the episode itself is actually very exciting, and I'm super thrilled with the way it's turned out." [...] Selman thinks a strong thing about the episode is the fact that, despite Homer's love for food, Homer is not the one that becomes a foodie as one might expect. He explained that this is because although Homer loves eating, [...] "he's kind of <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> kind of guy who doesn't like foreign food, weird food, savoring food, intellectualizing food, blogging about it, photographing it – he just wants to be stuffed all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|The Naval Academy and the University of Maryland are {{separated}} by about 30 miles {{in the state of}} Maryland. The schools by their nature, a Federal service academy and a public university, differ radically in terms of culture and lifestyle. For many years, the University of Maryland possessed the reputation of <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar,</b> working-class school. Some students viewed the Naval Academy, with its strictly regimented culture, as elitist. A former Terrapins linebacker, Jerry Fishman, believed that many Midshipmen [...] "thought they were far superior to the Maryland redneck coal miners." [...] A former Navy fullback, Pat Donnelly, said that compared to a [...] "public institution, [...] was night and day. I think there was a feeling of mutual dislike, but it wasn’t personal, it was more institutional." ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{his time}} at Haverford, Coleman took a sabbatical in which he put his {{academic}} work to the test by working <b>a</b> variety of <b>blue-collar</b> jobs, including ditch-digger, garbageman, prison warden (and inmate), and [...] "salad-and-sandwich man" [...] at Union Oyster House. He wrote about these experiences for New York magazine and in <b>a</b> book, <b>Blue-Collar</b> Journal: <b>A</b> College President's Sabbatical, awarded the Athenaeum of Philadelphia Literary Award for 1974, among other honors. It was made into the television movie The Secret Life of John Chapman.|$|R

500|$|This {{image was}} praised for its focus, {{and the empty}} bench {{seat in front of}} the speaker is {{perceived}} as inviting to the viewer. [...] The solid dark background of the blackboard helps the subject to stand out but almost obscures Rockwell's signature. According to Deborah Solomon, the work [...] "imbues the speaker with looming tallness and requires his neighbors to literally look up to him." [...] The speaker represents <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> unattached and sexually available, likely ethnic, threat to social customs who nonetheless is accorded the full respect from the audience. Some question the authenticity of white-collar residents being so attentive to the comments of their blue-collar brethren. The lack of female figures in the picture gives this an Elks club meeting feel rather than an open town meeting.|$|E
500|$|When Cosby {{originally}} pitched The Cosby Show to NBC, it {{revolved around}} the life of <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> couple; Clair {{was intended to be}} a plumber while the character's husband Cliff, portrayed by Cosby himself, was a limousine driver. Eventually, the idea of Clair working as a plumber was discarded and the character briefly became a Dominican housewife instead. Inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, of whom Cosby was a fan, much of the show's humor would have been directly derived from Clair's tendency to revert back to her native language Spanish when upset or agitated. Describing this concept as [...] "the reverse of [...] Lucy," [...] Cosby explained that the husband [...] "would be the person that didn’t understand when she spoke Spanish" [...] as opposed to the wife.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a B rating, {{saying that the}} tale [...] "is {{surprisingly}} good and surprisingly gruesome fun. Eklund makes {{the most of the}} maniac role and Breslin is a sympathetic victim." [...] Reviewer Dwight Brown wrote, [...] "The script gives Berry <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> character she can make accessible, vulnerable and gutsy... Chestnut is not suitably gallant and stalwart as her caring lover and a cop on a mission... This film is a whole lot scarier than you think it's going to be." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "An effectively creepy thriller about a 911 operator and a young miss in peril, The Call is a model of low-budget filmmaking." [...] She praised its [...] "clean, clever premise" [...] and said that Berry's Jordan is [...] "an old-fashioned hero in many respects, so it's fitting that Mr. Anderson uses old-fashioned filmmaking techniques, like crosscutting, to build tension and old-school exploitation tricks like evil to justify taking the story dark and then dark and bonkers." ...|$|E

500|$|Armageddon, {{released}} in 1998, established Affleck {{as a viable}} leading man for Hollywood studio films. Good Will Hunting {{had not yet been}} released during the casting process and, after Affleck's screen test, director Michael Bay dismissed him as [...] "a geek". He was convinced by producer Jerry Bruckheimer that Affleck would be a star, but the actor was required to lose weight, become tanned, and get his teeth capped before filming began. The film, where he starred opposite Bruce Willis as <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar</b> driller tasked by NASA with stopping an asteroid from colliding with Earth, was a box office success. Daphne Merkin of The New Yorker remarked: [...] "Affleck demonstrates a sexy Paul Newmanish charm and is clearly bound for stardom." [...] Later in 1998, Affleck had a supporting role as an arrogant English actor in the period romantic comedy Shakespeare in Love, starring his then-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow. Lael Loewenstein of Variety remarked that Affleck [...] "does some of his very best work, suggesting that comedy may be his true calling," [...] while Janet Maslin of The New York Times found him [...] "very funny". Shakespeare in Love won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, while the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. Affleck then appeared as a small-town sheriff in the supernatural horror film Phantoms. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wondered why actors like Affleck and Peter O'Toole had agreed to appear in the [...] "junky" [...] film: [...] "Affleck's thudding performance suggests he is reading his dialogue for the first time, directly from cue cards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nashville Gab {{wrote that}} [...] "He is {{explosive}} {{on stage and}} completely unpredictable. I compare his live set to a wild horse, it's {{not meant to be}} tamed.

2500|$|Watchman. Emphasizes {{maintaining}} order, {{usually found}} in communities with a declining industrial base, and <b>a</b> <b>blue-collar,</b> mixed ethnic/racial population. This form of policing is implicitly less pro-active than other styles, and certain offenses may be [...] "overlooked" [...] {{on a variety}} of social, legal, and cultural grounds, as long as the public order is maintained. Smith and Cole comment the broad discretion exercised in this style of policing can result in charges of discrimination, when it appears police treatment of different groups results in the perception that some groups get better treatment than others; ...|$|E
5000|$|While the Autonomia in Italy {{have been}} called New Left, it is more {{appropriate}} {{to see them as}} the result of traditional, industrially oriented, communism re-theorising its ideas and methods.

500|$|Milk favored {{support for}} small {{businesses}} {{and the growth of}} neighborhoods. Since 1968, Mayor Alioto had been luring large corporations to the city despite what critics labeled [...] "the Manhattanization of San Francisco". <b>As</b> <b>blue-collar</b> jobs were replaced by the service industry, Alioto's weakened political base allowed for new leadership to be voted into office in the city. George Moscone was elected mayor. Moscone had been instrumental in repealing the sodomy law earlier that year in the California State Legislature. He acknowledged Milk's influence in his election by visiting Milk's election night headquarters, thanking Milk personally, and offering him a position as a city commissioner. Milk came in seventh place in the election, only one position away from earning a supervisor seat. Liberal politicians held the offices of the mayor, district attorney, and sheriff.|$|R
