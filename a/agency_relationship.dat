5|$|An <b>agency</b> <b>relationship</b> {{is between}} three parties - a principal, who authorises an agent {{to make a}} {{contract}} on his behalf with a third party. In agency situations an agent can make a contract with a third party that is binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of an agent to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its essence}} the word [...] "trust" [...] applies to any {{situation}} where one person holds property {{on behalf of}} another, and the law recognises obligations to use the property for the other's benefit. The primary situation in which a trust is formed is through the express intentions {{of a person who}} [...] "settles" [...] property. The [...] "settlor" [...] will give property to someone he trusts (a [...] "trustee") to use it for someone he cares about (a [...] "beneficiary"). The law's basic requirement is that a trust was truly [...] "intended", and that a gift, bailment or <b>agency</b> <b>relationship</b> was not. In addition to requiring certainty about the settlor's intention, the courts suggest the terms of the trust should be sufficiently certain particularly regarding the property and who is to benefit. The courts also have a rule that a trust must ultimately be for people, and not for a purpose, so that if all beneficiaries are in agreement and of full age they may decide how to use the property themselves. The historical trend of construction of trusts is {{to find a way to}} enforce them. If, however, the trust is construed as being for a charitable purpose, then public policy is to ensure it is always enforced. Charitable trusts are one of a number of specific trust types, which are regulated by the Charities Act 2006. Very detailed rules also exist for pension trusts, for instance under the Pensions Act 1995, particularly to set out the legal duties of pension trustees, and to require a minimum level of funding.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{financial}} instability of the 1980 s following financial deregulation in Australia can be partly traced {{to a lack of}} attention to agency problems in banking. Because the market for corporate control and corporate governance structures in banking were unsatisfactory, the benefits of increased competition in financial product markets were offset by inadequate monitoring and controls on bank management. It is also argued that the current emphasis of prudential supervision on capital adequacy requirements can provide only a partial solution to achieving efficiency and stability in the financial sector—because it focuses only upon the <b>agency</b> <b>relationships</b> between owners and government/depositors. Complementary developments in corporate governance and control are required to ad-dress <b>agency</b> <b>relationships</b> involving bank management.

The paper also investigates the unique <b>agency</b> <b>relationships</b> using a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries over the period 2006 - 2014. We find that the larger the Shari’ah Supervisory Board (SSB) the better the financial performance and this result reinforces the fundamental role of the SSB to certify permissible financial instruments and products. We also find evidence of the scope of operation hypothesis with respect to both the board of directors and the SSB as Islamic banks are characterised by a higher degree of complex operations. Interestingly, we find that a larger SSB size may result in lower agency costs and that the greater the size of the unrestricted contracts, the higher the agency costs. This implies that unrestricted profit-sharing contracts are one of the main sources of the unique <b>agency</b> <b>relationships</b> in Islamic banks. The paper has a number of policy implications for regulators including the design of governance mechanisms in Islamic banks and the dynamics of unrestricted contracts...|$|R
