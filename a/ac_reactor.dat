A simple anaerobic digester can be implemented for an enhanced primary treatment or, in some situations, as a main treatment. Two reactor configurations were extensively studied; accumulation system (AC) and UASB septic tank at 15, 20 and 25 °C. Due to long retention times in an <b>AC</b> <b>reactor,</b> far stabilisation of treated medium can be accomplished with methanisation up to 60 %. The AC systems are the most suitable to apply when the volume of waste to be treated is minimal and when a direct reuse of a treated medium in agriculture is possible.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al 2 nd World Congress on Targeting Microbiota celebrado en el Institut Pasteur de Paris del 16 al 17 de octubre de 2014. Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the potential probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum IFPL 935 strain is able to grow {{in the presence of a}} flavan- 3 -ol extract from grape seeds and also to initiate the metabolism of these polyphenols to other compounds. This study aims to investigate the role of L. plantarum IFPL 935 on the composition and/or activity of a human intestinal microbiota in a long-term feeding assay with a polyphenolic red wine extract. For that purpose, after a 3 -weeks stabilization period of the colonic microbiota of the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (Twin-SHIME), a 2 -weeks experiment was run by feeding both parallel systems daily with 200 mg of a red wine extract. In addition, one of the Twin-SHIME systems was simultaneously fed with L. plantarum IFPL 935 (1010 cfu, daily). Microbial community changes along with fermentative and proteolytic activities were monitored. The results showed that feeding the gut microbiota with the phenolic extract slightly decreased total bacterial counts in the ascendens (<b>AC)</b> <b>reactor</b> (1 log) after 24 h. All bacterial groups analyzed were affected. Among them, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and the butyrate producers Clostridium cocoides/Eubacterium rectale were the most affected groups. In most cases, bacterial numbers were readily recovered after the first week of treatment. Moreover, addition of L. plantarum IFPL 935 to one of the Twin-SHIME systems resulted in relative stable numbers of total bacteria, Lactobacillus and Enterobacteriaceae. Related to butyrate producers, BCoAT gene copy numbers showed significantly higher values in the transverse (TC) and descendens (DC) reactors than in the AC ones at the end of the treatment, and particularly, in the DC reactor corresponding to the SHIME unit supplemented with L. plantarum IFPL 935. Regarding fermentation and proteolysis markers, daily intake of the polyphenolic extract caused a sharp decrease during the first days of treatment in all the colon reactors. Addition of L. plantarum IFPL 935 led to an increase of lactic acid in the ascendens colon compartment (AC) at the starting of the period studied and of a butyric acid in the distal colon vessels at the end of the treatment (TC and DC). No differences in proteolysis markers between treatments were observed when L. plantarum IFPL 935 was added. The SHIME supplementation with L. plantarum IFPL 935 resulted in relatively stable numbers of total bacteria, lactobacilli and enterobacteria. Besides, addition of L. plantarum IFPL 935 may possibly influence SCFAs production, and in particular butyrate, which have numerous documented effects promoting bowel large function.

The digestion took place in two, non-mixed accumulation <b>reactors</b> (<b>AC</b> 1 and AC 2) inoculated with digested primary sludge from a WWTP at a temperature of 20 degreesC for a period of around 150 days. <b>Reactor</b> <b>AC</b> 1 was fed with a mixture of faeces, urine and kitchen refuse in the equivalent amount that one individual generates per day. The AC 2 was fed with a mixture of faeces and kitchen refuse in the equivalent amount that two individuals produce per day. Some contribution of urine to AC 2 was not to be avoided. Detailed characterisation of waste(water) was performed. The performance of the stratified reactor was followed by monitoring the reactor content for several reactors' heights as well as being based on the biogas production.

40|$|The STATCOM is {{a static}} {{reactive}} power compensator. It {{is connected to}} the grid through <b>ac</b> side <b>reactors</b> and has a capacitor on the DC-link side. This DC-link capacitor is maintained at a given voltage under closed-loop control while a set amount of reactive current is fed according to load requirements.

Diesel engine exhaust, at different loads, is used to approximately simulate the due gas composition.

Main emphasis is laid on the oxidation of NO to NO/sub 2 /, without reducing NOx concentration (i. e., minimum reaction byproducts), with least power consumption.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} enhancement {{research has}} long been concerned with keeping pace to the rapidly increasing cooling demands of high performance electronics. In addition to requiring the removal of higher heat fluxes as device miniaturization continues, the operating temperature limits remain essentially the same. The rapid removal of large quantities of low quality heat presents a formidable challenge to thermal systems engineers. In such applications, single-phase forced convection thermal management (TM) schemes are no longer adequate. High energy density thermophysical phase change materials, such as the boiling of water, have proven capable of handling high heat fluxes, but suffer the drawback of requiring temperatures that are outside the acceptable range for high-power electronics cooling. Recently, the use of high energy density endothermic chemical reactions {{as an alternative to}} thermophysical phase change materials has shown promise. One particularly attractive reaction for thermal management purposes is the endothermic decomposition of ammonium carbamate (AC), due to both its high energy density and comparatively low reaction temperatures that are amenable to electronics cooling. In this study, we propose to facilitate the development of thermal management systems based on AC (or similar reactions) by a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The objective is to elucidate the combined effect of heat transfer, mass transfer, momentum transfer, and chemical kinetics on the thermal management capabilities of a heat exchanger-chemical reactor (HEX reactor) utilizing an AC-heat transfer fluid slurry. A model to describe the reaction kinetics {{in the presence of a}} liquid iii solvent, which is presently lacking the literature, is critical to the design and understanding of thermochemical reaction-based TM systems. Further, this model must be rooted in a sound theoretical and empirical basis. Currently, there are no published experimental chemical kinetics data for the decomposition of AC in a heat transfer fluid. A systematic investigation of the reaction kinetics within the range of temperatures typical for electronics cooling was conducted to obtain real-time calorimetric and species concentration data. Fundamental insights gained from the experimental chemical kinetics study were used to develop a general reaction model framework for AC decomposition in the presence of a solvent. This model serves as the source term in the thermal energy conservation equation, which in turn is required to model and predict HEX reactor performance. The reaction model parameters were estimated from the experimental results using numerical optimization and validated at temperature between 55 ?C and 70 ?C, concentrations between 25 g/L an 50 g/L, and particle sizes between 800 ?m and 100 ?m. A 1 -dimensional, multi-phase HEX reactor model was developed, incorporating the parameterized reaction model and validated against data from the literature. In this report, we demonstrate the experimental findings and the subsequent model development, comparison to experimental trends, validation, and comparison to published data for HEX reactor thermal performance with AC decomposition. Critical factors of design interest are identified and explored to improve fundamental understanding of the complex thermal, hydrodynamic, and chemical phenomena governing <b>AC</b> HEX <b>reactor</b> performance...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the reduction of azo dyes discharged from dyeing, textile and other industries since some of them or their metabolites may cause toxicity. The efficient treatment of these effluents at industrual scale presents many difficulties, particularly at high dye concentrations and at low energy consumptions. Anaerobic biodecolourisation seems to be the most economic and environmentally friendly method for azo dye wastewater treatment. In a recent study of the authors 1, a novel-type bioreactor with activated carbon (AC) was developed providing high azo dye degradation rates at very short space times/hydraulic residence times. Additionally, a model was proposed involving both heterogeneous catalysis and biological decolourisation. In catalysis, activated carbons have been mainly used as support, but their use as catalysts on their own is growing quickly. One of the advantages of ACs is the possibility of tailoring their physical and/or chemical properties in order to optimise their performance for specific applications. 2 Therefore, it is important to analyse the effect of texture and surface chemistry of AC in azo dye degradation by using ACs with diverse average pore sizes and/or surface chemistries in the bioreactors. This work deals with texture-modified activated carbons for the decolourisation of azo dyes in upflow stirred packed-bed reactors (USPBRs) containing a biological activated carbon system. The preparation, modification and characterisation of pore size-modified activated carbons have been completed. The initial material selected was a commercial activated carbon (Norit Rox 0. 8). ACs with larger porosities were obtained by CO 2 gasification of the raw carbon previously impregnated with cobalt. The role of cobalt was to catalyse the gasification of carbon, thereby promoting the formation of mesopores. The gasification experiments were carried out in a tubular vertical <b>reactor.</b> <b>ACs</b> with different average pore sizes were produced by applying different gasification times.

40|$|Supplementary data {{related to}} this article {{can be found at}} [URL] dx. doi. org/ 10. 1016 /j. watres. 2016. 06. 004. The {{catalytic}} effect of commercial microporous activated carbon (AC) and macroporous carbon nanotubes (CNT) is investigated in reductive bioreactions in continuous high rate anaerobic reactors, using the azo dye Acid Orange 10 (AO 10) as model compound as electron acceptor and a mixture of VFA as electron donor. Size and concentration of carbon materials (CM) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) are assessed. CM increased the biological reduction rate of AO 10, resulting in significantly higher colour removal, as compared to the control reactors. The highest efficiency, 98 %, was achieved with a CNT diameter (d) lower than 0. 25 mm, at a CNT concentration of 0. 12 g per g of volatile solids (VS), a HRT of 10 h and resulted in a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 85 %. Reducing the HRT to 5 h, colour and COD removal in CM-mediated bioreactors were above 90 % and 80 %, respectively. In the control reactor, thought similar COD removal was achieved, AO 10 decolourisation was just approximately 20 %, demonstrating the ability of CM to significantly accelerate the reduction reactions in continuous bioreactors. AO 10 reduction to the correspondent aromatic amines was proved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Colour decrease in the reactor treating a real effluent with CNT was the double comparatively to the reactor operated without CNT. The presence of <b>AC</b> in the <b>reactor</b> did not affect the microbial diversity, as compared to the control reactor, evidencing that the efficient reduction of AO 10 was mainly due to AC rather than attributed to changes in the composition of the microbial communities.
