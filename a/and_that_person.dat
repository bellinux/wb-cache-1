5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's going to stop. It says that, at any point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E

25|$|Swedenborg {{spoke in}} {{virtually}} all his works against what he regarded as the incomprehensible Trinity of Persons concept. He said that people of other religions opposed Christianity because of its doctrine of a Trinity of Persons. He considered {{the separation of the}} Trinity into three separate Persons to have originated with the First Council of Nicaea and the Athanasian Creed. According to The Heavenly Doctrine the Athanasian Creed is true, however, if the Trinity is understood to mean a Trinity in one person <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> being the Lord God Jesus Christ.|$|E

Yet, dynamic human presence detection and identification is not {{widely used in}} these systems despite the enriching effect such information would have. We behave in unpredictable ways and are not easily identifiable by computers. This paper outlines a method for reliably and passively detecting presence of a <b>person</b> <b>and</b> identifying <b>that</b> <b>person</b> by exploiting existing ubiquitous infrastructure: Wi-Fi networks <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>persons</b> Wi-Fi enabled smartphone without installing any additional software. We further enumerate several applications ranging from home security to energy efficiencies. We explore the security and moral implications of automated person tracking as well as suggest reasonable mitigation measures...|$|R

2500|$|Until {{the late}} modern era, the {{standard}} Jewish belief was that after one dies, one's immortal soul joins God {{in the world}} to come while one's body decomposes.

2500|$|Before Perverted-Justice {{began working}} {{primarily}} with law enforcement, child safety advocate Julie Posey described Perverted-Justice's tactics as [...] "a gross invasion of privacy."

[...] "What it does is embarrass them for the moment... but then they'll go and get a different screen name and know to check things out a little more thoroughly next time." [...] Posey and Perverted-Justice founder Xavier Von Erck appeared on Fox News Channel shortly thereafter, where Posey remarked, [...] "It’s more of an entertainment site, actually. You go there, you click on a link of a picture that takes you to that person’s chat-log <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> has a scale—a sliminess scale as he calls it—and you can rate the pervert from, I think it’s, one to five.

[...] Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2.
