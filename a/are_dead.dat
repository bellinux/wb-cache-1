5|$|Saprotrophic wood-decay fungi are {{the primary}} cause of {{decomposition}} of wood, causing billions of dollars of economic damage each year. Fungal decay, while useful in composting, is destructive of timber exposed to the weather, {{and in the case of}} dry rot caused by Serpula lacrymans, also of timbers in largely dry houses. Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of Armillaria, are parasites of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they <b>are</b> <b>dead.</b> Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped rhizomorphs in the soil.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, many plant cells, {{particularly}} those of the parenchyma, do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent {{with the ability to}} give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which <b>are</b> <b>dead</b> at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.|$|E
5|$|A Newsboy Hero is an American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. A standard melodrama, it has the alcoholic John Bailey return home in a drunken state. He strikes his wife and by this act drives {{his wife and child}} from the house. They go out into the snow and fall asleep, but are saved by a newspaper boy and taken home.

At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.|$|E

After the battle, Tseng falsely claims that both Veld and Elfé <b>are</b> <b>dead,</b> so as {{to protect them from}} being hunted by Shinra. The Turks are then reorganized, with Tseng reinstated as their immediate leader, but they are now sworn to loyalty to Shinra as part of the bargain for their survival. The original Turks find new lives for themselves in hiding, and are later seen helping in the evacuation of Midgar during the events of VII.|$|E

5|$|The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, {{also known}} as The Destroying Angel and Daemons Inflicting Divine Vengeance on the Wicked and Intemperate and The Destruction of the Temple of Vice, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832. Etty had become famous for nude paintings, and acquired a reputation for tastelessness, indecency {{and a lack of}} creativity. With The Destroying Angel he hoped to disprove his critics with an openly moral piece. The painting is 127.8cm by 101.9cm (50in by 40in) and depicts a classical temple under attack from a destroying angel and a group of daemons. Some of the human occupants <b>are</b> <b>dead</b> or unconscious, others flee in terror or struggle helplessly against the daemons.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the viewer is left to interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, as the boy character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey through Hell to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his sister or both <b>are</b> <b>dead.</b> Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting as the boy travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or the similarities and differences between the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could be human remains stand in their places.|$|E

An unnamed protagonist drops into Myst and finds the island strangely deserted. As the player explores Myst, they discover Sirrus and Achenar trapped inside two books. Both swear that their parents <b>are</b> <b>dead</b> due to the machinations of the other brother, and instruct the player to repair their books so they can be freed. In truth, Atrus and Catherine are merely imprisoned, and both Sirrus and Achenar are guilty of growing power-hungry and destroying Atrus' books.
