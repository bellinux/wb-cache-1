2500|$|The Gemara {{reported}} {{a dispute over}} the meaning of [...] Rava taught that King Manasseh of Judah tried and executed Isaiah, charging Isaiah with false prophesy based, among other things, on a contradiction between [...] and Isaiah's teachings. Manasseh argued that when (as reported in [...] ) Moses quoted God saying, [...] "The number of your days I will fulfill," [...] God meant that God would allow people to live out their appointed lifespan, but not add to it. But Manasseh noted that Isaiah told Manasseh's father Hezekiah (as reported in [...] ) that God promised Hezekiah, [...] "I will add on to your days fifteen years." [...] According to Rava, Isaiah did not dispute Manasseh's charges, knowing that Manasseh would not accept Isaiah's argument, no matter how truthful, and Manasseh had Isaiah killed. The Gemara reported that the Tannaim disagreed about the interpretation of the words [...] "the number of your days I will fulfill" [...] in [...] A Baraita taught that [...] "the number of your days I will fulfill" [...] refers to the lifespan that God allots to every human being at birth. Rabbi Akiba taught that if one is worthy, God allows one to complete the full period; if unworthy, God reduces the number of years. The Sages, however, taught that if one is worthy, God adds years to one's life; if one is unworthy, God reduces the years. The Sages argued to Rabbi Akiba that Isaiah's prophesy to Hezekiah in [...] "And I will <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> days fifteen years," [...] supports the Sages' interpretation. Rabbi Akiba replied that God made the addition to Hezekiah's lifespan from years that God had originally intended for Hezekiah that Hezekiah had previously lost due to sin. Rabbi Akiba cited in support of his position the words of the prophet in the days of Jeroboam, before the birth of Hezekiah, who prophesied (as reported in [...] ), [...] "a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name." [...] Rabbi Akiba argued that since the prophet prophesied the birth of Manasseh's son Josiah before the birth of Manasseh's father Hezekiah, it must be that at Hezekiah's birth God had allotted to Hezekiah enough years to extend beyond the time of Hezekiah's illness (when Isaiah prophesied in [...] ) so as to include the year of Manasseh's birth. Consequently, Rabbi Akiba argued, at the time of Hezekiah's illness, God must have reduced the original number of years allotted to Hezekiah, and upon Hezekiah's recovery, God must have added back only that which God had previously reduced. The Rabbis, however, argued back that the prophet in the days of Jeroboam who prophesied in [...] did not prophesy that Josiah would necessarily descend from Hezekiah. The prophet prophesied in [...] that Josiah would be born [...] "to the house of David." [...] Thus Josiah might have descended either from Hezekiah or from some other person in the Davidic line.|$|E
