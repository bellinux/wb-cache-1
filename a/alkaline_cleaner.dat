Commercially available foaming disinfectants and cleaners applied via a compressed air foam system (CAFS) {{may be used to}} significantly reduce aerobic bacteria in a commercial caged layer complex. Using a variety of agricultural products against bacterial species may also provide information on which products are most efficacious against specific microorganisms on cage floors. In the first study, six field trials were conducted to evaluate current industry cleaning and disinfection protocols and the proposed CAFS application. A commercially available chlorinated <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaner</b> (CHL/ALK) in trials 1 & 2 was applied by CAFS to one half of the house, and {{the other half of the}} house was not treated. The entire house was then washed with a high pressure water rinse (HPWR). A commercially available peroxyacetic acid (PAA) in trials 3 & 4 or a 14 % glutaraldehyde (HI GLUT) / 2. 5 % quaternary ammonia (QAC) blended disinfectant in trials 5 & 6 was applied by CAFS to one half of a washed house. The remainder of each house was treated with 7 % (LO GLUT) / 26 % QAC, which was the spray application applied to cages by the integrator. Environmental swabs of drinker cups and cage floors were collected pre and post treatment to determine if aerobic bacteria levels were reduced. The HPWR and the CHL/ALK treatments did not consistently reduce aerobic bacteria on treated surfaces. Significant differences were observed with each of the CAFS applications of the PAA, HI GLUT/QAC, and LO GLUT/QAC product. The objective of the second study was to determine the efficacy of commonly used products on soiled layer cages. Trial one was conducted in a small layer barn at the Texas A&M University Poultry Science Research, Teaching, and Extension Center. Trial two was performed at a commercial pullet house. In each trial, treatments were applied by a garden sprayer and six samples per treatment were collected. All products were mixed according to the manufacturer?s recommendations. Treatments consisted of a negative control, a low pressure water rinse (LPWR, garden hose), a high pressure water rinse (HPWR, pressure washer), a soap, a chlorinated <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaner,</b> a QAC, a glutaraldehyde, a peroxyacetic acid, a phenolic, a potassium peroxymonosulfate, a hydrogen peroxide, and a QAC/glutaraldehyde blend product. Swabs of cage floors were collected post treatment to determine if bacterial loads were reduced as compared to the appropriate controls. Aerobic bacteria, coliforms, Staphylococcus spp., and Pseudomonas ssp. were enumerated to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments. Aerobic bacterial colonization was significantly reduced by the oxidizer, peroxyacetic acid, aldehyde, and QAC disinfectants in trial one and by all seven disinfectants in trial two against the HPWR control. No treatment, in the first trial, significantly decreased coliforms or Staphylococcus spp. when compared to controls of nothing and the HPWR. However, reduction (P < 0. 05) of coliforms and Staphylococcus spp. were observed with all disinfectants in trial two. The aldehyde and QAT disinfectant products in trial one, and all disinfectant products except the hydrogen peroxide and QAT/glutaraldehyde compound in trial two significantly reduced the levels of Pseudomonas spp. These data suggest that characteristics of cleaning and disinfection regimens can vary significantly...|$|E

In other words, bactericidal properties of various cleaning agents are compared within the scope of this study. My research question is: “Is there a statistically significant mean difference between the selected cleaning products, which are named as soft soap, multi-purpose cleaner 1 and 2, alkaline disinfectant and <b>alkaline</b> surface <b>cleaner,</b> in terms of their bactericidal effects on bacterial flora found in school environment?” It was hypothesized that; there would be a significant mean difference in terms of bactericidal effect in between the cleaning agents used. Alkaline disinfectant would be the most effective, followed by the other alkaline products (<b>alkaline</b> surface <b>cleaner</b> and soft soap), and then the neutral products (multi-purpose cleaners). In order to test the hypothesis, bacterial samples were collected from each student’s desk before and after wiping with each product.

Resultantly, <b>alkaline</b> surface <b>cleaner</b> reduced the largest number of colony forming units, followed by alkaline disinfectant, soft soap and multi-purpose cleaners respectively.

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is examining ultrafiltration as a cleaning approach that reclaims the cleaning solutions and minimizes wastes. The ultrafiltration membrane is made from sheets of polymerized organic film. The sheets are rolled onto a supporting frame and installed in a tube.

50|$|The {{immersion}} method {{is used for}} the processing of manganese phosphate coatings. The steps of immersion include degreasing/cleaning, water rinses, pickling in mineral acid, activation, manganese phosphating, an optional final drying, and lubrication using oils or emulsion. The first step of this method is to degrease and clean, typically with strong <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaners.</b> Pickling in mineral acid is a useful process described by the removal of oxide, resulting in a clean surface. The water pre-rinse activation allows the cleaning and pickling to take place while avoiding the formation of coarse-crystalline phosphate. Manganese phosphating is performed, typically in a bath of dilute phosphoric acid that is at approximately 95˚C for about 5-20 minutes (the time varies with the state of the surface being coated). The elements that were coated are then allowed to dry, possibly in an oven. The final step of manganese phosphate coating is to lubricate the materials with oil by immersing them in the oil bath and then letting them drain. This results in different thicknesses of oil when different concentrations and types of oil are used.|$|R

Chemical cleaning agents especially like <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaners</b> are most widely employed to restore the membrane performance. This research mainly investigated the potential use of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) as the chemical cleaning agents to restore the permeate flux of organically fouled nanofiltration (NF) membranes under varying applied pressure and flow condition. The performances of the cleaning protocols were quantified using flux recovery and resistance removal. The results demonstrated that NaOCl {{is more effective than}} NaOH. This observation is also in line with FTIR analysis in which the transmittance intensity showed by FTIR spectra of NaOCl is higher than that of NaOH. The results also reported that higher flux recovery and resistance removal were achieved when the fouled NF membranes were cleaned with higher concentration of chemical agents and applied pressure. However, the improvements of flux recovery and resistance removal by increasing the applied pressure were found insignificant at higher applied pressure range (16 to 18 bar) than the lower applied pressure range (i. e. 12 to 14 bar).

Recently, however, health and disposal related environmental concerns have increased regarding chlorinated solvents, including 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, methylene chloride, or Freon'. World leaders have instituted a production ban of certain ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) by 1996. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has instituted worker vapor exposure limitations for {{virtually all of}} the solvents used in solvent-based cleaners. In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined nearly all solvent-based cleaners as 'hazardous'. Cradle to grave waste responsibility is another reason manufacturers are trying to replace chlorinated solvents in their cleaning processes. Because of these factors, there now is a world wide effort to reduce and/or eliminate the use of chlorinated solvents for industrial cleaning.
