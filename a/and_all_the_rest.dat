The first four volumes were written by Jun Eishima <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> volumes written by Takashi Umemura. All {{of them have been}} supervised by Yuji Horii with artwork done by Kamui Fujiwara. Dragon Quest Retsuden: Roto no Monshō is meant to take place between Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest.|$|E
25|$|Just before daybreak at {{the depth}} of the dark and rain, the waiting women <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the wakefull town heard the great crash as the booms burst, and the cry of the whistle {{signaled}} the men's defeat. Logs from thousands of trees boiled over the broken dams, smashed together in a grinding roar and surged on down the current like giant toothpicks tossed by some elemental energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{representations of}} culture in Anatolia were Stone Age artifacts. The remnants of Bronze Age civilizations such as the Hattian, Akkadian, Assyrian, and Hittite peoples provide us with many examples of {{the daily lives of}} its citizens and their trade. After the fall of the Hittites, the new states of Phrygia and Lydia stood strong on the western coast as Greek civilization began to flourish. They, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Anatolia were relatively soon after incorporated into the Achaemenid Persian Empire.|$|E
50|$|In a {{separate}} interview with GA Voice, Jenn Alva stated {{that there had}} to be a different way to approach immigration. “Our country is taking steps in the wrong direction…There’s got to be another way. We need to work to help them and see what brilliant compromise that we can establish.” The song “Hope” on Exits <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rests</b> was written about Arizona’s anti-immigration law.|$|R

50|$|In 2000 he {{destroyed}} {{a vast number}} of his early art works, <b>and</b> withdrew <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> from <b>the</b> market. In 2004 Poleskie took up digital photography, and had his first show of these images in Ithaca in January 2006.|$|R
25|$|Nanotechnology {{will replace}} our entire {{manufacturing}} base with a new, radically more precise, radically less expensive, and radically more flexible {{way of making}} products. The aim is not simply to replace today's computer chip making plants, but also to replace the assembly lines for cars, televisions, telephones, books, surgical tools, missiles, bookcases, airplanes, tractors, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> The objective is a pervasive change in manufacturing, a change that will leave virtually no product untouched. Economic progress and military readiness in the 21st Century will depend fundamentally on maintaining a competitive position in nanotechnology.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Batiuk {{changed the}} strip's format. It was {{established}} that Funky, Les, Cindy <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> {{of the previous}} cast had graduated from Westview in 1988; their college years were skipped, and the story continued in their adulthood. Subsequently, the characters started to age in real time and undergo significant life changes. Funky married Cindy in 1998; they are now divorced. Les and Lisa married in a Halloween-themed 1996 story which saw them dressed as Batman and Robin. Funky now co-owned the local pizza parlor with Tony Montoni, Les taught English at Westview, Crazy Harry was the local mailman, Bull was the Scapegoats' coach, and Cindy was a national-level television newscaster. The strip followed their stories {{as well as those}} of a new generation at Westview, including Wally, Becky, Darin and Monroe. Overtly whimsical elements were now downplayed in favor of more grounded real-life incidents and stories, and some of the series' running gags from the 1972–92 years were recast in a more serious light. For instance, Bull's hectoring of Les became the focus of a storyline on domestic violence and child abuse when it was revealed that Bull abused Les to cope with being abused by his own father.|$|E
500|$|Two years earlier, Beiderbecke had {{influenced}} another Carmichael standard, [...] "Star Dust". A Beiderbecke riff {{caught in}} Carmichael's head {{and became the}} tune's chorus. Bing Crosby, who sang with Whiteman, also cited Beiderbecke as an important influence. [...] "Bix <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> would play and exchange ideas on the piano," [...] he said.|$|E
50|$|The cycloalkanes without {{side chains}} are {{classified}} as small (cyclopropane and cyclobutane), common (cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane), medium (cyclooctane through cyclotridecane), <b>and</b> large (<b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest).</b> Each is an isomer of itsalkene counterpart—for example, cyclopropane has the same chemical formula (C3H6) as propene.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{composition}} of the foreign-exchange reserves of China is a state secret. Foreign analysts agree that about two-thirds of Chinese foreign-exchange reserves are held in U.S. Dollars, approximately one-fifth in Euros, <b>and</b> almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> in Japanese Yen and British pounds.|$|R
50|$|In October 2007, Giné {{recorded}} a ten-track demo titled Bongo Botrako at his small home studio. He programmed <b>the</b> drums <b>and</b> performed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of instruments himself. After passing the demo around, Giné quickly recruited eight more musicians {{and they started}} performing live in March 2008.|$|R
500|$|Shooting on {{location}} in New York City also added to Mackendrick’s anxieties. Exteriors were shot in the busiest, noisiest areas with crowds of young Tony Curtis fans occasionally breaking through police barriers. Mackendrick remembered, [...] "We started shooting in Times Square at rush hour, and we had high-powered actors and a camera crane and police help <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of it, but we didn’t have any script. We knew {{where we were going}} vaguely, but that’s all".|$|E
500|$|Hill has raced both {{cars and}} {{motorcycles}} at the Goodwood Festival of Speed and in 2005 he tested the new GP2 Series car. Hill was {{back behind the}} wheel of a single-seater race car in the summer of 2006, when he took a [...] Grand Prix Masters machine for a test run around the Silverstone circuit. Hill said that he enjoyed the experience and [...] "I wouldn't rule [...] out, but I can't honestly say that right now I need to race. That is the bit that is missing. I love driving, I love pushing the limit <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of it but racing for me... I don't have an ambition to do it and I think that's an important part of the equation." ...|$|E
500|$|Lowe, who {{considered}} the original Softporn Adventure [...] "a primitive, early effort", borrowed its basic structure {{and added a}} graphic game engine (Adventure Game Interpreter), improvised humor, and an on-screen protagonist, Larry Laffer. Chuck Benton, creator of Softporn Adventure, {{is included in the}} Leisure Suit Larry's end credits, as the layout and puzzles of the game are identical to those found in the earlier title. However, Lowe said that in Softporn Adventure [...] "there were no characters in the game. There was no central character at all. There were almost no characters to the women. And so it was a real role-over. I think there's one line of dialogue that I kept of the original game <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> was fresh." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Rational or Sophistical School of {{philosophers}} [...] "snatches {{from experience}} {{a variety of}} common instances, neither duly ascertained nor diligently examined and weighed, <b>and</b> leaves <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> to meditation <b>and</b> agitation of wit." [...] The most conspicuous example of this type, says Bacon, was Aristotle.|$|R
25|$|Over 120 {{species of}} {{cuttlefish}} are currently recognised, grouped into five genera. Sepiadariidae contains seven species <b>and</b> two genera; <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> are in Sepiidae.|$|R
50|$|At {{this stage}} in the competition, teams play two games, at home <b>and</b> away. <b>All</b> of <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> clubs enter the competition.|$|R
500|$|Unlike many games, where {{different}} songs {{have different}} themes for each character or area, Wintory chose to base {{all of the}} pieces on one theme which stood for the player and their journey, with cello solos especially representing the player. Wintory describes the music as [...] "like a big cello concerto where you are the soloist <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the instruments represent the world around you", though he describes it as not necessarily orchestral due to the inclusion of electronic aspects. The cello begins the game as [...] "immersed {{in a sea of}} electronic sound", before first emerging on its own and then merging into a full orchestra, mirroring the player's journey to the mountain. While the game's art style is based on several different cultures, Wintory tried to remove any overt cultural influences from the music to make it [...] "as universal and culture-less as possible". Tina Guo features as the cellist for the soundtrack. She is a close friend of Wintory and has since performed [...] "Woven Variations" [...] with him, an eight-minute orchestral variation on the Journey soundtrack. All of the non-electronic instruments in the soundtrack were recorded with a live orchestra.|$|E
2500|$|Heminges and Condell {{emphasised}} {{that the}} Folio was replacing the earlier publications, which they characterised as [...] "stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors", asserting that Shakespeare's true words [...] "are now offer'd to your view cured, and perfect of their limbes; <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> absolute in their numbers as he conceived them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song, {{released}} {{as a single}} in March 1965, first received radio airplay on Santa Monica's KBLA. Sky Saxon recalled in a 2006 interview: [...] "they used to play 'Can't Seem to Make You Mine' as late as two in the morning. KRLA <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the stations jumped on it later, but KBLA broke it and people would stay up to hear it." ...|$|E

One is a translation of De remediis, two are biographies of Petrarch, <b>and</b> nearly <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> are codices of the Rime or comments upon them. Mode of access: Internet...|$|R
5000|$|Such {{projectors}} can {{be employed}} to search through [...] for [...] <b>and</b> exclude <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> Relativistic second order wave equations for any j are then straightforwardly obtained in first identifying the [...] sector in [...] in (...) {{by means of the}} Lorentz projector in (...) and then imposing on the result the mass shell condition.|$|R
50|$|Mr Albert Endacott {{wrote in}} his will that he would give his son some houses and a factory, <b>and</b> then <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> to <b>the</b> North Tawton Devon Parish Council ‘for the purpose of {{providing}} some useful memorial to myself’ unless his wife was still alive, {{in which case the}} interest should be paid to her.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Indians {{could have}} wiped out Reno’s <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the soldiers, {{just as they}} did Custer’s troops if they had been so disposed. But as Reno had dug in and was willing to quit, the red folks decided to leave them there. They went to look after their women, {{children}} and old people who had not been killed in the first assault when no one was with them to defend them and packed up their belongings and left the bloody scene." ...|$|E
2500|$|The esteem of {{his contemporaries}} for Hilliard is testified to by John Donne, who in a poem called The Storm (1597) praises the work of this artist. [...] He died on about 3 January 1619 and was buried on 7 January 1619 in the church of St Martins-in-the-Fields, Westminster, leaving in his will twenty shillings to the poor of the parish, thirty between his two sisters, some goods to his maidservant, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his effects to his son, Lawrence Hilliard, his sole executor.|$|E
2500|$|Maria Eleonora had {{plunged into}} a {{prolonged}} crisis of hysteria and indulged in orgies of grief. She found it more difficult than ever to conceal her dislike of Swedish [...] "rocks and mountains, the freezing air, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of it". During {{the rest of her}} life she pathetically preserved the memory of her hero husband. She used to weep for hours and even days on an end. When the regency council tried to separate Christina from her mother, Maria Eleonora wept and protested so bitterly that nothing was done.|$|E
50|$|The theme tune for Bitsa {{was written}} by Peter Charlton and the {{original}} musical arrangement was by Bill Le Sage, but after the first series the tune was reworked by Mark Reader from the rock band Strider. Reader also wrote the music for the 3-minute challenge <b>and</b> composed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> music for the show.|$|R

50|$|Kylie Minogue has {{the most}} songs covered with three: The Locomotion, I Should Be So Lucky and Especially for You (The latter two {{were not on the}} Australian CD release or any {{cassette}} release, but were on the Canadian release). The Beach Boys have two: Surfin' U.S.A. <b>and</b> Kokomo. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> original artists have only one song covered.|$|R
2500|$|... "I put Jean Ribault <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> {{of them to}} the knife," [...] Menéndez wrote Philip {{four days}} later,"judging it to be {{necessary}} to the service of the Lord Our God, and of Your Majesty. And I think it a very great fortune that this man be dead; for the King of France could accomplish more with him and fifty thousand ducats, than with other men and five hundred thousand ducats; and he could do more in one year, than another in ten; for he was the most experienced sailor and corsair known, very skillful in this navigation of the Indies and of the Florida Coast." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, Leguizamo's memoir, Pimps, Hos, Playa Hatas <b>and</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rest</b> of My Hollywood Friends: My Life, was released. During an {{interview}} on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, he stated that his memoir was very candid about experiences involving other celebrities he had worked with. He stated that working with Arnold Schwarzenegger on Collateral Damage (2002) {{was one of the}} most enjoyable experiences he'd had as an actor, that Schwarzenegger's accent let him say things that others would think were sexist or homophobic if said by someone else, that Steven Seagal was an egotist with diva tendencies, that Kurt Russell continuously called him a [...] "faggot", and that Leonardo DiCaprio was a [...] "patron of prostitutes".|$|E
2500|$|After the Classical Latin vowel length distinctions {{were lost}} in favor of vowel quality, {{a new system of}} allophonic vowel {{quantity}} appeared sometime between the 4th and 5th centuries. Around then, stressed vowels in open syllables came to be pronounced long (but still keeping height contrasts), <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> became short. For example, long venis , fori , cathedra but short vendo , formas [...] (This allophonic length distinction persists to this day in Italian.) However, in some regions of Iberia and Gaul, all stressed vowels came to be pronounced long: for example, porta , tempus [...] In many descendents, several of the long vowels underwent some form of diphthongization, most extensively in Old French where five of the seven long vowels were affected by breaking.|$|E
50|$|In the 2007 season, Rigzhung {{finished}} {{bottom of}} the A-Division, winning just a single game from their fourteen matches <b>and</b> losing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> they again entered the relegation playoffs, this time with RIHS against the top two teams from the B-Division: Veterans and Wolfland. They won 2 and lost one of their games (to Veterans), doing enough to secure another seasonin the A-Division.|$|R

On 7 October 2012, Stojković has injured against Javor <b>and</b> missed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> matches in 2012.
