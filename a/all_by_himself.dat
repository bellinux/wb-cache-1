Samuel Ireland's reputation did not recover before his death in 1800.|$|E
25|$|This book {{is about}} four {{children}} whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, {{who was in the}} Army, had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>himself</b> in the country.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the early}} scriptures, the Nirvana {{attained}} by Arahants is identical to that attained by the Buddha himself, as {{there is only one}} type of Nirvana. Theravadins believe the Buddha was superior to Arahants because the Buddha discovered the path <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>himself</b> and taught it to others (i.e., metaphorically turning the wheel of Dhamma). Arahants, on the other hand, attained Nirvana partly because of the Buddha's teachings. Theravadins revere the Buddha as a supremely gifted person but also recognize the existence of other such Buddhas in the distant past and future. Maitreya (Pali: Metteyya), for example, is mentioned very briefly in the Pali Canon as a Buddha who will come in the distant future.|$|E

25|$|An {{admirer of}} the {{freshness}} and clarity of Bertrand Russell’s History of Western Philosophy, whose foreword he composed, {{as well as}} a critic of some of its shortcomings, Mosterín has undertaken the ambitious plan of writing <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>himself</b> a universal history of thought, not only Western, but also Asian and even Archaic. His series of books on Historia del Pensamiento aims at covering all main intellectual traditions from an interdisciplinary approach dealing simultaneously with developments in philosophy, science and ideology. The analysis of the ideas is critical and uncompromising, combining rigor with clarity and straightforward language. Besides, he delves into the arguments and does not hesitate to dig out their eventual flaws.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the concerts}} {{at this time}} were shared with other artists, {{and as a result}} Liszt also often {{accompanied}} singers, participated in chamber music, or performed works with an orchestra in addition to his own solo part. Frequently played works include Weber's Konzertstück, Beethoven's Emperor Concerto and Choral Fantasy, and Liszt's reworking of the Hexameron for piano and orchestra. His chamber music repertoire included Johann Nepomuk Hummel's Septet, Beethoven's Archduke Trio and Kreutzer Sonata, and a large selection of songs by composers like Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti, Beethoven and especially Franz Schubert. At some concerts, Liszt could not find musicians to share the program with, and consequently {{was among the first to}} give solo piano recitals in the modern sense of the word. The term was coined by the publisher Frederick Beale, who suggested it for Liszt's concert at the Hanover Square Rooms in London on June 9, 1840, even though Liszt had given concerts <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>himself</b> already by March 1839.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, {{right after}} the {{recording}} of The Habit of Fire, founding member Jeff Arwadi moved to Canada {{while the rest of}} the members were in Indonesia, leaving the band unable to play shows and do touring. At the same time they left their longtime record label Fear Dark and status of the band was in question. After few months of uncertainty and rumors of break-up went around among their fans, they all decided to remain together and to keep the band only as a studio project. They quickly signed licensing deals with two record labels to release The Habit of Fire in 2007. The album was received very well and was named CD of the Month by UK's music technology magazine Sound on Sound, as well as being nominated as The Best Avantgarde Metal Album in 2007 by Metal Storm. In 2007, Jeff leaked another cover tune, [...] "Redemption", that originally was planned as part of a Johnny Cash tribute album by Open Grave Records, a project that was ultimately shelved. Later in 2007, Jeff announced on the band's Myspace blog that a new Kekal album was on the way, which he had been working on <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] It was revealed later on that the new album was entitled Audible Minority, and it was meant to be released officially on 25 December 2008 as two versions: a free download and a limited edition Digipak with total 11 songs including a cover of the A-ha song [...] "Locust". Unfortunately the Digipak version was never released, and the album ended up being offered only as a free download instead.|$|E

2500|$|The {{kingdom of}} Mataram was divided in 1755 under an {{agreement}} signed in Giyanti between the Dutch under the Governor General Nicolaas Hartingh and rebellious prince Mangkubumi.

2500|$|For the band's first {{extended}} play, Take Off (2013), Fumito Iwai {{worked on}} the songwriting and arrangement <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>himself,</b> with little input from other band members. One song from the release, [...] "River", was written and sung by his brother, Katsutoshi Iwai. Fumito Iwai {{wanted to create a}} community of creators, so encouraged all members of the band to learn how to produce songs. Not all members could write music when Folks first formed in 2013, but learnt to after months of sharing ideas. After seeing the reaction to live versions of the songs from Take Off performed live at concerts, and after the band's members became more confident in songwriting and music software, all the members of Folks began suggesting ideas. By their second release, Newtown (2014), the band members felt like the album was created by everybody, and was less of a solo project for Fumito Iwai.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] Nantucket {{series is}} a variant on a {{well-known}} theme in time travel literature, {{in which a}} modern person is hurled back into the past {{and is able to}} introduce modern technologies, inventions and institutions, and completely change the past society. The theme goes back to Mark Twain's [...] "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" [...] and continued in many later works such as L. Sprague de Camp's classic [...] "Lest Darkness Fall". Poul Anderson disputed the plausibility of such scenarios in his [...] "The Man Who Came Early", in which a man marooned in the past finds that - however capable and skilled in modern-day engineering - it is not possible for one person to introduce modern technologies <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>himself,</b> since he would not have [...] "the tools to make the tools to make the tools". The [...] Nantucket series gets around this difficulty by having not a single isolated person hurled into the past, but a whole island, with several thousand people of various backgrounds and skills, and in possession of a considerable amount of the physical and written resources of modern civilization - making their success much more plausible. Eric Flint used a similar literary device in his 1632 series.|$|E

Around 200, Cao Cao finally engaged Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. When Sun Ce heard that Cao Cao was locked in a stalemate with Yuan Shao at Guandu, he planned to lead an army across the Yangtze River and launch a surprise attack on the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), which was Cao Cao's base. When Cao Cao's men received news of the impending assault, they were all shocked and frightened, but Guo Jia said, [...] "Sun Ce had newly conquered the lands in Jiangdong and he killed many heroes whose followers were willing to die for them. Besides, Sun Ce is overly confident and is unprepared, so even though he has thousands of troops, the situation is not much different from him setting out to conquer the Central Plains <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>himself.</b> If he encounters assassins, he'll have to deal with them alone. From what I observe, he'll eventually die {{at the hands of a}} common man."
