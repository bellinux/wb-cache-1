500|$|Lee Larkins, {{who played}} for Purdue {{and was one of}} the top {{defensive}} backs in the Big Ten, said in 1976 that Bell was the best running back he ever played against. [...] As a senior, Larkins played against Gordon Bell, Archie Griffin, and Ricky Bell of USC. [...] Larkins said: [...] "Gordon Bell was the best of the three. [...] He was a super tough runner and a tough guy to make a solid tackle on. [...] Gordon has a lot more speed and more moves than Archie does, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a better all around player." ...|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out. If I run into him again, we can have a good laugh about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E

2500|$|A former {{nurse said}} she saw Savile molest a brain-damaged patient at Leeds hospital, saying, [...] "He kissed her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a visitor {{coming to see}} her, and he started rubbing his hands down her arms and then I don't know of {{a nice way to}} put it but he molested her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Branson has guest starred, usually playing himself, {{on several}} {{television}} shows, including Friends, Baywatch, Birds of a Feather, Only Fools and Horses, The Day Today, a special {{episode of the}} comedy Goodness Gracious Me and Tripping Over. Branson made several appearances during the nineties on the BBC Saturday morning show Live & Kicking, where he {{was referred to as}} 'the pickle man' by comedy act Trev and Simon (in reference to Branston Pickle). Branson also appears in a cameo early in XTC's [...] "Generals and Majors" [...] video. [...] He was also the star of a reality television show on Fox called [...] (2004), in which sixteen contestants were tested for their entrepreneurship and sense of adventure. It did not succeed as a rival show to Donald Trump's The Apprentice and only lasted one season. According to Trump, Branson's [...] "show was terrible. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> terribly miscast. He’s a lot of hot air, like his balloons".|$|E
2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E
60|$|As {{we walked}} away he asked my name <b>and</b> profession, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> smiled with {{peculiar}} satisfaction when I said I {{was a student}} of medicine.|$|R
60|$|By and by, {{his door}} opened and he came out. I could not bring myself to bear the sight of him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had a worse look by daylight.|$|R

2500|$|Taylor {{decided to}} try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea. After {{recording}} some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A head for the Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including [...] "Something In The Way She Moves," [...] to Asher, who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: [...] "I just heard his voice and his guitar <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> great [...] and he came and played live, {{so it was just}} like, 'Wow, he's great.'" [...] Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple, and he credits Asher for [...] "opening the door" [...] to his singing career. Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, [...] "I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career. He had this determination in his eye that I had never seen in anybody before." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Does he--really <b>and</b> truly? <b>I</b> saw {{him out of}} {{the little}} passage window, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> looked quite thin! And Lizzie Bruce said Mrs. Hartley asked who that {{handsome}} young man was who looked so delicate.' ...|$|R
60|$|His {{voice broke}} into the moan, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would cry. He had only seen me twice, but among his few {{visitors}} the faces of those he saw remained with him, and he recognised me partly.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I'm not mistaken, I {{saw that}} tramp {{down at the}} depot this morning," [...] said he, as we drew near to the main road. [...] "He was hanging around, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> looked like a {{suspicious}} character." ...|$|R
60|$|Stroeve stopped, gasping, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} faint. This {{was not at}} all the story I had {{expected}} him to tell me.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Nay,' {{said the}} servant, 'don't {{be hard on}} the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean. We made her stop: she'd fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be uneasy. Hareton offered to go with her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> should: it's a wild road over the hills.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shore! He saw my bare legs! And {{he brought}} me these {{presents}} he'd intended for his sister.... He was ashamed for me--sorry for me.... <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> looked at me bold-like, as I'm used {{to be looked at}} heah! Isbel or not, he's shore..." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{stopped him}} short. [...] "The {{mark of a}} caress from her husband." [...] Then I added: [...] "How close {{you must have been}} to her!" [...] He made no answer to this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> blushed, observing which I broke {{straight}} off. [...] "Well, goodbye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{coming right}} here. But perhaps {{he stopped to}} screw his courage up. He only knew how little it needed with us!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed he did. He {{said he did}} {{not believe}} she was half as much to blame as her father was, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right. Didn't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{the little}} rat's drunk!" [...] cried the Captain, joyfully; [...] "only drunk, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on! Go home, Tansey, and quit bothering grown persons on the street." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{more can}} I say? The other night {{you told me}} to bid him send you word. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> ought to do so.

6000|$|... "I didn't forget," [...] Tommy replied modestly. [...] "I {{missed it}} out, on purpose, I did, 'cos I was sure God knows on it without my telling him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{would be pleased}} if I didn't let on as I knowed it was good of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't accept; the Mother Superior did for me, because he's the Mayor of San Francisco visiting your uncle, and she's always {{anxious to}} placate {{the powers that}} be. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might have some {{information}} that I {{could get out of}} him. And it was better than being in the convent all day. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could stand HIM if you were here." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{laid his}} hand on my knee; his wan kind eyes {{considered}} me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to say “You’re very young!” But he only brought out: “You’ve got used to Europe anyway!” ...|$|E
60|$|At this instant, Corny went overboard! Rectus made a grab at her, {{but it was}} too late. He {{sprang to}} his feet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going over after her, but I seized him.|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I know he'd do that? I {{paid the}} captain a goodish lump o' tin {{to take him}} on a long voyage, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> so young that he'd forget the old place." ...|$|E
