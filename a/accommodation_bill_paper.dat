50|$|The total was R370,385.94. The amount {{obtained}} {{by way of}} overdraft facilities from Standard Bank was R612,309. Although the bank was paid the amounts owing to it, sureties who signed in respect of those facilities lost R18,000, while the furniture firms who issued the <b>accommodation</b> <b>bills</b> lost R25,631.29.|$|R
50|$|Zinn also {{obtained}} {{overdraft facilities}} {{for the company}} at Standard Bank by using the same false balance sheets. In 1965 and 1966, the bank assisted the company by discounting bills and promissory notes from two furnishing companies. Not only was the bank not informed that these bills and notes were in fact accommodation bills; Zinn also fraudulently entered false invoice numbers on these bills in order to present evidence of their being genuine trade bills and notes—the Bank being prohibited from discounting <b>accommodation</b> <b>bills.</b>|$|R
50|$|In August 2013, the Sunday Herald {{reported}} that Celia Fitzgerald, an office-bearer within the group, {{had been an}} SNP activist since leaving Labour over the Iraq War. She rejoined Labour in 2012 {{with the aim of}} changing the party's stance towards the referendum. LFI leader Allan Grogan said he knew of examples of SNP members handing out LFI leaflets. He admitted only 40% of his group's 80 or so members are actually in the Labour Party. Grogan also said LFI had received initial financial support from Yes Scotland, regarding the £245 <b>accommodation</b> <b>bill</b> for the LFI's first conference.|$|R
5000|$|His actions did {{not measure}} up to those words. He signed a weak bill to {{integrate}} access to public facilities, but he vetoed a more extensive one that would penalize owners of public places and vehicles who failed to provide equal service to blacks and whites. Historian Francis Byers Harris thought his veto of the public <b>accommodations</b> <b>bill</b> was crucial in eroding his political base. Harris wrote in 1947, [...] "Negroes had their hearts set on this law, and Warmoth sowed a seed of distrust which grew into enmity for the man they had helped elect." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{campaign}} was {{an alliance of}} the governing Scottish National Party, the Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Green Party. The Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie helped launch the campaign but following this had expressed some reservations. Harvie told the Green's conference in October 2012 that he felt the campaign had become fully inclusive, and the party members voted for [...] "full participation" [...] in the campaign. The organisation also collaborated with Labour for Independence, an organisation for pro-independence supporters of the Scottish Labour Party. In 2013, Yes Scotland covered the £245 <b>accommodation</b> <b>bill</b> for LFI's first conference.|$|R
6000|$|... [14] Did Constable ruin Scott, as {{has been}} {{generally}} supposed? It is {{right to say that}} such a charge was not made during the lifetime of either. Immediately after Scott's death Miss Edgeworth wrote to Sir James Gibson-Craig and asked him for authentic information as to Sir Walter's connection with Constable. Sir James in reply stated that to his personal knowledge Mr. Constable had, in his anxiety to save Scott, about 1814 [1813], commenced a system of <b>accommodation</b> <b>bills</b> which could not fail to produce, and actually did produce, the ruin of both parties. To another correspondent, some years later, he wrote still more strongly (Memoirs, vol. iii. p. 457).|$|R

5000|$|The {{civil rights}} {{legislation}} which Kennedy was unable to see pass during his lifetime received the needed momentum from his death and the legislative skill of President Johnson. In 1964 the public <b>accommodations</b> <b>bill</b> passed as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The obvious constitutional attack on the legislation was its constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment because it sought to regulate conduct which was not [...] "state action." [...] Cox and Assistant Attorney General and Head of the Civil Rights Division Burke Marshall, however founded the legislation on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. Although both John and Robert Kennedy questioned the optics of using the Commerce Clause, they did not object. Cox had no difficulty having the Court uphold the statute on that basis when he argued the cases in October.|$|R

If his name were dragged before the courts,--if he should be shown up in the public papers as having been engaged in <b>accommodation</b> <b>bills,</b> that would {{certainly}} be ruinous to him.

On that evening they were both wretched enough at the parsonage. Hitherto Mark had hoped that perhaps, after all, no absolutely hostile steps would be taken against him with reference to these bills.

The proposed energy management system is used to develop a 2 ̆ 7 novel deal 2 ̆ 7 method in short stay accommodation based on integration of the room level energy costs into the billing system. This system {{has the potential to}} increase energy efficiency in the short stay accommodation industry by actively engaging the residents in the energy saving process. The system is economically and environmentally sustainable and can achieve a high level of energy efficiency with low expenses. The proposed model is also effective for carbon mitigation, and offers a value proposition for all the parties in the short stay accommodation industry, including owners and residents.
