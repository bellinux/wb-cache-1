5|$|The {{roots of}} Columbia's three {{economic}} foundations—education, medicine, and insurance—can {{be traced back}} to incorporation in 1821. Original plans for the town set aside land for a state university. In 1833, Columbia Baptist Female College opened, which later became Stephens College. Columbia College, distinct from today's and later to become the University of Missouri, was founded in 1839. When the state legislature decided to establish a state university, Columbia raised three times as much money as any other competing city and James S. Rollins donated the land that is today the Francis Quadrangle. Soon other educational institutions were founded in Columbia such as Christian Female College, the first college for women west of the Mississippi, which later became the current Columbia College. The city benefited from being a stagecoach stop of the Santa Fe and Oregon trails, and later from the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. In 1822, the first hospital was set up by William Jewell. In 1830, the first newspaper began; in 1832, the first theater in the state was opened; and in 1835, the state's first <b>agricultural</b> <b>fair</b> was held. By 1839, the population of 13,000 and wealth of Boone County was exceeded in Missouri only by that of St. Louis County, which, at that time, included the City of St. Louis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>fairs</b> are {{associated}} with bidirectional, interspecies transmission of influenza virus A between humans and pigs. We examined pigs exhibited at <b>agricultural</b> <b>fairs</b> in Ohio during 2009 - 2011 for signs of influenza-like illness and collected nasal swab specimens from a representative subset of these animals. Influenza virus A was recovered from pigs at 12 / 53 (22. 6 %) fairs during the 3 -year sampling period. Pigs at 10 / 12 (83. 3 %) fairs from which influenza virus A was recovered did not show signs of influenza-like illness. Hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix gene combinations of the isolates were consistent with influenza virus A concurrently circulating among swine herds in the United States. Subclinical influenza virus A infections in pigs at <b>agricultural</b> <b>fairs</b> may pose a risk to human health and create challenges for passive surveillance programs for influenza virus A in swine herds...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella enterica is {{a common}} {{zoonotic}} pathogen in humans. Transmission typically occurs through consumption of contaminated food products or contact with infected animals, including poultry or their environment. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the frequency of Salmonella contamination in the environment in poultry exhibits at <b>agricultural</b> <b>fairs.</b> Samples were collected from cages, feed, floors and tables in the exhibit and cultured for Salmonella. At least one environmental sample was positive for Salmonella in 10 of 11 fairs (91 %), and Salmonella was isolated from 28 of 55 environmental samples (50. 9 %). Eleven different serotypes were detected. Results of this study demonstrate that environmental surfaces at <b>agricultural</b> <b>fairs</b> can be contaminated with Salmonella and could potentially serve as a route of transmission to bird owners and the general public. Poultry owners and the general public should be educated about the risks of Salmonella infection from the poultry exhibit environment. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>fairs</b> should consider instituting policies and practices to improve hygiene and mitigate the risk of zoonotic salmonellosis...|$|R
