5|$|Unusually, {{the score}} omits oboes, English horns, bass clarinets, and trumpets. The bassoons, contrabassoons, and trombones play {{only in the}} first movement, and only for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bars</b> (bassoons and contrabassoons: 339–342 and 362–369; trombones: 343–348 and 367–369).|$|E
5|$|At age six, Rainilaiarivony began {{two years}} of study {{at one of the}} new schools opened by the London Missionary Society (LMS) for the {{children}} of the noble class at the royal palace in Antananarivo. Ranavalona shut down the mission schools in 1836, but the boy continued to study privately with an older missionary student. When Rainilaiarivony reached age 11 or 12, the relatives who had raised him decided he was old enough to make his own way in the world. Beginning with the purchase and resale of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bars</b> of soap, the boy gradually grew his business and expanded into the more profitable resale of fabric. The young Rainilaiarivony's reputation for tenacity and industriousness, as he fought against his predestined misfortunes, eventually reached the palace, where at the age of 14 the boy was invited to meet Queen Ranavalona I. She was favorably impressed, awarding him the official ranking of Sixth Honor title of Officer of the Palace. At 16 he was promoted to Seventh Honor, then promoted twice again to Eighth and Ninth Honor at age 19, an unprecedented ascent through the ranks.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{discovery}} of a boxy/peanut shaped bulge in the highly inclined barred Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7582. The peanut shape is clearly evident in near infrared JHK images but obscured by extinction from dust in visible BVR images. This suggests that near infrared imaging surveys will discover a larger number of boxy/peanut morphologies than visible surveys, particularly in galaxies with heavy extinction such as NGC 7582. The bulge in NGC 7582 exhibits strong boxiness compared to other boxy/peanut shaped bulges. If the starburst was mediated by the bar, then {{it is likely that the}} bar formed in less than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bar</b> rotation periods or <b>a</b> <b>few</b> × 10 ^ 8 years ago. If the bar also caused the peanut, then the peanut would have formed quickly; on a timescale of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bar</b> rotation periods.

25|$|Under the {{captaincy}} of Lynagh {{and with}} David Campese in vintage form, Australia beat New Zealand 13-12 {{in the final}} of the 1988 Hong Kong Sevens. When Lynagh received the silver symbol of sevens supremacy from Hong Long bank taipan Williams Purves, the Royal Hong Kong Police bank struck up ‘Waltzing Matilda’, but they might have stopped the drums and trumpets after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bars.</b> No one heard them anyway as all but the most rabid anti-Australians in the twenty-thousand-strong throng took up the singing.

25|$|Koizumi {{is also a}} noted fan of Elvis Presley, {{with whom}} he shares a {{birthday}} (January 8). In 2001 he released a collection of his favorite Presley songs on CD, with his comments about each song. His brother is Senior Advisor of the Tokyo Elvis Presley Fan Club. Koizumi and his brother helped finance a statue of Presley in Tokyo's Harajuku district. On June 30, 2006, Koizumi visited Presley's estate, Graceland, accompanied by U.S. President George W. Bush, and First Lady Laura Bush. After arriving in Memphis aboard Air Force One, they headed to Graceland. While there, Koizumi briefly sang <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bars</b> of his favourite Presley tunes, whilst warmly impersonating Presley, and wearing Presley's trademark oversized golden sunglasses.|$|E

25|$|Although most of {{them are}} brief, the {{subjects}} are extremely varied (see Example 1). Frequently some form of note repetition is used to emphasize a rhythmic (rather than melodic) contour. Many feature a dramatic leap (up to an octave), {{which may or may not}} be mirrored in one of the voices sometime during an episode– a characteristic Pachelbel technique, although it was also employed by earlier composers, albeit less pronounced. Minor alterations to the subject between the entries are observed in some of the fugues, and simple countersubjects occur several times. An interesting technique employed in many of the pieces is an occasional resort to style brisé for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bars,</b> both during episodes and in codas. The double fugues exhibit a typical three-section structure: fugue on subject 1, fugue on subject 2, and the counterpoint with simultaneous use of both subjects.|$|E
500|$|The version {{included}} on 1986 compilation Standing on a Beach (...) is neither the album version (which {{was also on}} the 12" [...] single), nor is it the 7" [...] single edit (which removes <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bars</b> between verses and fades out part way through the guitar solo ending).|$|E
500|$|The symphony is {{constructed}} around simple harmonies, {{set in a}} neo-modal style which makes use of the medieval musical modes, but does not adhere strictly to medieval rules of composition. A performance typically lasts about 54 minutes. Ronald Blum describes the piece as [...] "mournful, like Mahler, but without the bombast of percussion, horns and choir, just the sorrow of strings and the lone soprano". The work consists of three elegiac movements, each marked Lento to indicate their slow tempi. Strings dominate the musical textures and the music is rarely loud—the dynamics reach fortissimo in only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|E

40|$|Flowing thermal plasmas are {{frequently}} used e. g. in welding, cutting, plasma deposition and testing materials at high temperatures. In {{most of the}} applications the geometry is complex. In the cascade arc the argon plasma flows through a straight circular channel with a constant area. The study of the flow and of the plasma properties are facilitated thereby. Velocities {{in the order of}} 1000 m/s and mass flows of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> grams per second can be reached by applying a pressure difference of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bar</b> over the arc. The ohmic heating of the plasma also increases the flow speed. In this work a model is presented that shows the influence of the pressure, the ohmic heating and the thermodynamic properties of argon on the flow. Results of measurements will be given...|$|R
500|$|At {{the end of}} September, with Leopold's recovery, {{the family}} moved back to central London, to lodgings in Thrift Street (later 20 Frith Street), Soho. These lodgings were located {{conveniently}} close to several concert rooms, and to the residences of both J.C Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. Bach, a son of Johann Sebastian Bach, soon became a family friend; Nannerl later recalled Bach and the eight-year-old Wolfgang playing a sonata together, taking turns to play <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bars</b> individually, and that [...] "anyone not watching {{would have thought it}} was played by one person alone". There is no record that the Mozarts met Abel, but Wolfgang knew his symphonies, perhaps through the medium of the annual Bach-Abel concert series, and was much influenced by them.|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} begins with Moon's {{simultaneous}} drum break and scream and launches in different, hard rock direction. [...] "It {{was my idea}} to cut off in the middle, Yardbirds-style", Beck commented, [...] "Keith upped the tempo and gave it an extra kick. [...] It's like {{a bit of the}} Who, a bit of the Yardbirds and a bit of me". The amply-distorted guitar provides [...] "a thick-toned, descending riff", according to Power. [...] He also describes the break, inspired by the Yardbirds' rave-up technique, as [...] "eerily presag the coming era of hard rock and heavy metal". [...] The third part returns to the main motif with added guitar fills. [...] The melody line is abandoned in the second section and replaced with multiple interwoven takes of guitar effects, including phasing, echo, and controlled feedback. [...] It concludes with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bars</b> of hard blues rock-style lead guitar and an abrupt ending.|$|E
500|$|Although Mercury's {{speaking}} voice naturally {{fell in the}} baritone range, {{he delivered}} most songs in the tenor range. His known vocal range extended from bass low F (F2) to soprano high F (F6). He could belt up to tenor high F (F5). Biographer David Bret described his voice as [...] "escalating within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bars</b> from a deep, throaty rock-growl to tender, vibrant tenor, then on to a high-pitched, perfect coloratura, pure and crystalline in the upper reaches." [...] Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé, with whom Mercury recorded an album, expressed her opinion that [...] "the difference between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars {{was that he was}} selling the voice". She adds, His technique was astonishing. No problem of tempo, he sang with an incisive sense of rhythm, his vocal placement was very good {{and he was able to}} glide effortlessly from a register to another. He also had a great musicality. His phrasing was subtle, delicate and sweet or energetic and slamming. He was able to find the right colouring or expressive nuance for each word.|$|E
