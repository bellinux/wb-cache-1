40|$|Background: Alin (born in 1993, Timisoara, Rumania) is {{the elder}} {{son of a}} Roma family settled for ten years in France, having heavy {{psychomotor}} and cognitive deficiencies. Method: Case study of Alin’s psychotherapeutic trajectory. Findings. Socio-cultural representations of mental handicaps, intrafamilial relationships and personal history are interactive determinants of psychological accompaniment and healthcare provision. Mental healthcare team in charge of Alin misconceived in the relations of care: the central {{role played by the}} particular status family network attributes to the person with mental handicap and the articulation between diversity, difference and inequality in the family’s experience of mental handicap and its care. Discussion: In socio-culturally diverse contexts, the quality of relations of care depends on professionals’ capability to develop socio-culturally sensitive and responsive to beneficiaries’ needs psychotherapeutics. Transcultural approach is not effective unless it is integrated to conventional psychological practice, and a collaborative work is settled with the concerned professionals of social work and <b>associative</b> <b>sectors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Based on {{extensive}} fieldwork {{conducted with}} actors from public, private and <b>associative</b> <b>sectors,</b> we explore {{the expansion of}} genetically modified soy in Argentina and we aim {{to figure out how}} the neoliberal “globalized privatization regime” unfolded in a peripheral location. Our case points at two inherent contradictions with such a regime’s main tenets, namely that it needs a weak antitrust policy (thus leading to a market situation dominated by a monopoly of transnational companies) and a hyper-restrictive system of intellectual property. We highlight the participation of two groups of local actors in the regime. The first group is aligned with the globalized privatization regime agendas, while the second is involved in protest and regulatory actions focusing on the health, environment and safety issues related to the GM soy complex. To a different extent, both groups share a local agenda of resistance and an anti-imperialist imaginary. Both have national development objectives of Argentina in their ideological roots, although their conceptions of “development” are different (industrial development vs. protection of peasants’ life and the environment). We conclude that {{it is not enough to}} postulate that the neoliberal globalized privatization regime will just expand to the South as it did in Northern countries. Rather, combined with the commercialization of science, peripherality creates protest, activism and local regulation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the authoritarian {{presence}} of the state under Bachar Al-Assad, new associations have emerged {{in recent years and}} benefited from a reformist Zeitgeist centered on the theme of "good government". Promoted to the rank of partner, "civil society" saw the emergence of non-governmental organizations (NGO) on a national scale, supporting the renewal of the non-profit, <b>associative</b> <b>sector</b> whose very existence implies a skirting of legal provisions and government controls. A new field thus appears where room for maneuver is conditional upon incessant negotiations between civil society and the regime. The latter continues to impose its methods insofar as it determines the relations these associations have between them, thus condemning the sector to obvious atomization and marginality...|$|E
40|$|An {{interpretation}} is proposed {{of the way}} in which the plan for building the constitution of post-communist civil society in Romania is developing. The first months of the transition gave rise to a number of "civil" associations but waves of humanitarian activity in 1990 and 1991 rapidly changed the plan's direction. The Author shows how the new <b>associative</b> <b>sector</b> quickly polarized around the figurehead of the non-governmental organization active in running post-communist social affairs and supported, strongly for some, by a variety of Western partner organizations (NGOs and international financial institutions or charities). He then examines the factors thta favoured this polarization (local dynamics and international contraints), the consequences of this trend and the threats currently hanging over the project which is highly dependent on its Western partners.

40|$|Recently, {{civil society}} has been celebrated as a {{solution}} to political apathy and cynicism towards representative democracy. This book, however, argues that the role of associations in and for democracy is only properly understood if we take the context into account. |The authors collected in this volume critically examine the crucial link between the <b>associative</b> <b>sector</b> and the health of democracy. Focusing on the role of context and using diverse approaches and empirical material, they explore whether these associations in differing socio-political contexts can sometimes undermine rather than reinvigorate democracy. |The book features empirical and comparative studies on the effects of associative democracy focusing on Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Northern Ireland, European Union institutions and South America. It will interest students and researchers of social capital, civil society and associative democracy...|$|E
40|$|Increasingly, {{science and}} {{technology}} (S&T) are used as key strategic resources to address {{the social and economic}} challenges of our time (Tyfield 2012). This paper is part of my broader research program, which takes S&T as sites of struggle, where (geo) political and socio-economic issues interact, and studies them in three new political economies: bioeconomy, new manufacturing economy and smart security economy. It identifies two global dynamics that are at stake in the strategic construction and use of S&T: (1) proliferating varieties of neoliberalism (Harvey 2005, Mirowski and Plehwe 2009) and (2) shifting asymmetric dependency relations (Vernengo 2006, Metcalfe and Ramlogan 2008). My main goal is to analyze and understand developments in S&T domains as co-evolving with these two key global dynamics. For this paper, I will focus on one S&T site of struggles, biotechnologies/bioeconomy in Argentina, which will allow me to look at the reconfiguring of center-periphery relations and neoliberal enactments. Based on extensive fieldwork conducted with actors from public, private and <b>associative</b> <b>sectors,</b> I explore the expansion of genetically modified soy in Argentina and I aim to figure out how the neoliberal “globalized privatization regime” (Mirowski and Sent 2008) unfolded in a peripheral location. My case points at two inherent contradictions with such a regime’s main tenets, namely that it needs a weak antitrust policy and a hyper-restrictive system of intellectual property. I conclude that {{it is not enough to}} postulate that the neoliberal globalized privatization regime will just expand to the South as it did in Northern countries. Rather, combined with the commercialization of science, peripherality creates protest, activism and local regulation. Lastly, further implications for the theorization and circulation of bioeconomy (Birch and Tyfield 2013) beyond the “charmed circle” of OECD countries (Delvenne and Thoreau 2012) will be drawn.

40|$|This text {{looks at}} how {{presidents of the}} 40 {{entities}} that represent entrepreneurs evaluate the functioning of democratic institutions and perspectives of political reform between the years of 2004 and 2005. Data is aggregated in two ways: on the one hand, for the whole set of entities and on the other, according {{to the nature of}} each entity (syndicate or <b>associative),</b> by <b>sector</b> (industry, commerce, agriculture, finance, etc.) and by location and scope (state entities, distinguished by regions, and nationwide ones). Our objectives include, on the one hand, defending the importance of mobilizing this type of variable in analyzing the characteristics of entrepreneurs and their political action and, on the other, verifying the degree of homogeneity of opinions and positions with regard to the following aspects: degree of adhesion to and stance taken regarding democracy as a political regime; the evaluation of working democratic institutions; the political importance that is attributed to social groups and political institutions; views taken on entrepreneurs' political activity regarding the powers that be and, lastly, their position regarding to political reform. In this way we attempt to establish elements for future analysis of patterns of entrepreneurial political action regarding issues of political institutions and the future of democracy in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Framed by the {{theoretical}} context concerning cooperation between tourism agents, {{the present paper}} aims to contribute for better understanding South Alentejo tourism agents’ perceptions on {{the areas in which}} they can cooperate for promoting development and competitiveness in the region. Furthermore, the paper also looks at the tourist agents’ perception on role that the dynamics of cultural resources play in promotion of development and competitiveness in the region. This paper reports results from a case study conducted in the frame of the thesis developed as requirement to get the PhD in Tourism. Data was gathered by a questionnaire developed for the study from a sample of tourism agents working in the public, private business and <b>associative</b> (non lucrative) <b>sectors.</b> The study results has indicated that valuation of the existing culture, integrated development of tourism resources and products and organization of promotional activities are the areas considered more relevant for the tourism agents to cooperate among them. In particular, leaders of different sectors agree with the need to cooperate focusing on the valorisation of local and regional cultural resources. This is important because the South Alentejo region has excellent cultural resources that, if strategically used, can provide a major differentiating factor...|$|R

As far as we know, there is no individual survey that gathers information on retirement intentions, technical changes in the work environment and training participation. So, we choose to merge the TWR individual data on retirement intentions with aggregate data on ICT adoption and participation to firm-sponsored training session coming from a matched employer-employee survey on organizational change and computerization (COI) conducted in 2006 by the Ministry of Labour and the Centre d’Etudes de l’Emploi.

40|$|Based on a {{fieldwork}} {{conducted in}} Sicily, this paper analyses how, {{when faced with}} the emergence of immigration, Christian organisations in Palermo become involved with the migration issue, notably thanks to the pioneering commitment of certain clerics. It draws attention to the heterogeneous nature of the Christian sphere, the internal secularisation of the religious organisations working with migrants, and the transformations of the church-related <b>associative</b> <b>sector</b> from a volunteering to professional expertise model. In sum, the capacity for organisational and ideological adaptation of religious organisations has enabled them to retain social control of the territory by becoming inescapable stakeholders in the migration issue. This study also identifies the practices and the know-how of the actors involved in these organisations, and singles out the motives that lead them to engage with these organisations and the meaning they attach to their implicatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the evolution of}} the modern agrarian associations and cooperatives in Romania. Right now, our country is far behind the west-european countries regarding the development of the <b>associative</b> <b>sector</b> in the agricultural domain, from the diversity point of view and also from the presence on the market. One of the biggest problems of the small farmers from Romania represents selling the production, the traditional markets are being suffocated many times by agents. The agrarian sector is confrunting with problems marked mainly by the poor organization of the farmers regarding the production marketing and a slow structuring of their commercial behavior. The biggest problem of the agrarian cooperatives in Romania is the access to funding. This is due to the business related problems and their specific legal form. In Romania a law for crediting cooperatives doesn't exist, they are not found in the bank nomenclature and they are treated like any LLC. Also, there is an accute need for founding a high level training program intended for the agrarian cooperatives and associations leaders. The purpose is to present a current state synthesis {{in order to have a}} real image of their situation. The main object of this study is to make an assessment of the agrarian cooperatives's situation in Romania with the purpose of offering solutions and recommendations, by setting the development directions in order to become compatible with the European systems of agrarian cooperatives...|$|E
40|$|This article aims {{to discuss}} on the {{cooperation}} and associative organization, its benefits {{and its main}} hindrances for a bigger consolidation {{of this type of}} organization. It also discusses the sudden and consequent development in the beekeeping sector. Therefore, it is set out as objective, to analyze whether the associative beekeeping is relevant regarding to the articulation and development capacity of the sector. In order to reach this objective, the research has used information obtained trough a seminary, in which debates about beekeeping occurred; non structured interviews, with representatives of Confederação Brasileira de Apicultura - CBA, Federação ApÃ­cola do Rio Grande do Sul – FARGS, beekeeping associations, and with specialists of the area. It was intended to approach to the beekeeping activity relevance, its history, and its contributions to the agribusiness development, concerning not only to the external market problem in face of the embargos, but also, internal problems related to the consumption and commercialization of the bee products. It was possible to note that, even the associativism present problems which demands to advance and to be overcome, such as the lack of commitment and the opportunism of some associates in face of the associative organization, the group realizes the collective strength they have, being capable to articulate the sector aiming its development, as well as the potential market development. <b>associative</b> organization, beekeeping <b>sector,</b> development, market.,...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been an {{increase}} of energy and environmental certifications in the Swedish building sector which has {{led to the development of}} more energy-efficient building operation systems. Contradictory to this the greenhouse gas emissions for construction, maintenance, disposal and the other <b>associative</b> building <b>sector</b> stages have increased. The methodology of Life Cycle Assessment with its cradle-to-grave approach can be used to holistically evaluate the environmental load impacts of the entire building process. The building’s frame structure represents the largest part of material mass and is therefore crucial in the climate impact of the construction sector. Within the last ten years there have been several LCA comparisons between concrete and massive wood frames. These analyses more or less lack a life span perspective of each structural material. Life spans of buildings vary considerably due to climate conditions, lack of construction quality and maintenance continuity. In most cases the building life span is not depending on the structure, and additionally no consensus in variation of life span between the frame materials can be found. An LCA of two newly-raised multi-residential houses in the neighbourhood of Strandparken in Sundbyberg is performed comparing a CLT (Cross Laminated Timber) structure with a semi-prefabricated concrete system, using same construction requirements for fire, acoustics and insulation. The assessment results with limited system boundaries shows including variation of life expectancies that the carbon emission impact by wood and concrete is approximately the same. By extending the system boundaries to include reforestation the most outstanding reason for building with long-lasting wooden structures is the great potential of biogenic storage of carbon dioxide. In a complementary sensitivity analysis it is shown that through balanced harvesting and replanting methods it is possible to make the life cycle of wooden buildings close to climate neutral and act as a carbon sink for global warming. It is also concluded that the end usage phase is crucial for both materials where combusted wood could substitute fossil fuels or continue as carbon storage. Concrete on the other hand has a potential through carbonatation of rebinding up to half of its released fossil carbon dioxide at production, but wood as construction material is still a preferable choice for a future decreased climate impact by the building sector...|$|R
40|$|Corticostriatal {{circuits}} mediate {{various aspects}} of goal-directed behavior and are critically important for basal ganglia-related disorders. Activity in these circuits is regulated by the endocannabinoid system via stimulation of CB 1 cannabinoid receptors. CB 1 receptors are highly expressed in projection neurons and select interneurons of the striatum, but expression levels vary considerably between different striatal regions (functional domains). We investigated CB 1 receptor expression within specific corticostriatal circuits by mapping CB 1 mRNA levels in striatal sectors defined by their cortical inputs in rats. We also assessed changes in CB 1 expression in the striatum during development. Our results show that CB 1 expression is highest in juveniles (P 25) and then progressively decreases toward adolescent (P 40) and adult (P 70) levels. At every age, CB 1 receptors are predominantly expressed in sensorimotor striatal sectors, with considerably lower expression in <b>associative</b> and limbic <b>sectors.</b> Moreover, for most corticostriatal circuits there is an inverse relationship between cortical and striatal expression levels. Thus, striatal sectors with high CB 1 expression (sensorimotor sectors) tend to receive inputs from cortical areas with low expression, while striatal sectors with low expression (associative/limbic sectors) receive inputs from cortical regions with higher expression (medial prefrontal cortex). In so far as CB 1 mRNA levels reflect receptor function, our findings suggest differential CB 1 signaling between different developmental stages and between sensorimotor and associative/limbic circuits. The regional distribution of CB 1 receptor expression in the striatum further suggests that, in sensorimotor sectors, CB 1 receptors mostly regulate GABA inputs from local axon collaterals of projection neurons, whereas in associative/limbic sectors, CB 1 regulation of GABA inputs from interneurons and glutamate inputs may be more important...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the significance}} of Algeria's associative sphere {{in the context of}} the state's attempts to retain legitimacy. Starting from a critique of portrayals of Algerian 'civil society' as a force conducive to democratization, and by framing the period under study in a broader historical perspective, the thesis examines the changing relationship of the state to voluntary associations in both the colonial and post-colonial eras. It considers the place of associational life in the political economy of economic reform, investigating the role it played in facilitating the state's retreat from service provision. Consideration of the notion that civic associations shape people's propensity towards cooperation and collective action, facilitating democratic politics through the injection of trust and social capital, provides the starting point for analyzing their internal dynamics and the incentives driving their functioning. A further examination of the social bases of the associative sphere then leads to questioning its independence from the state, and highlights the role of the <b>associative</b> <b>sector</b> in tempering the fracture between the state and those social groups that most suffered from the collapse of Algeria's post colonial political framework. A critical examination of the proposition that civil society organisations legitimate and strengthen representative political institutions such as parties and parliament provides the opportunity to show how the associative sphere contributed to preserving the dominance of the executive in the political system despite the introduction of multi-partism. Finally, the study analyses donors' use of advocacy and service-delivery associations in democracy-promotion programmes, arguing that their focus on the country's 'civil society' contributed to the state's efforts to preserve its international legitimacy. In this light, rather than a driver of democratic change, the associative sphere appears as one of the elements of conservation used by a weakened state to reacquire legitimacy and reinforce its capacity to secure voluntary acquiescence in its rule...|$|E
40|$|The {{variety of}} changes in the modes of {{producing}} have led us to re-discover the active and structuring part played by territories in the present economic dynamics, particularly the new reticular organizations - including within the public service, and especially in the health sector. The latter has recently developed some changes that have allowed to go beyond the existing territorial divisions. The main change may be seen in the substitution of a more clinical medicine for an offer of more and more technical medical cares, {{in the context of a}} necessary health cost control, and also a development of an equitable access to the care services. Consequently, new innovative organizations have been set up which have raised more and more various forms of partnership between the care providers, between these providers and other actors such as the territorial communities and the <b>associative</b> <b>sector.</b> These forms of partnerships initiate territorial links which coincide less and less with the institutional boundaries - notably urban boundaries - so as to play a significant part in the dynamics of recombining in urban spaces. This is particularly the case of cancer treatments in the Rh 4 ne-Alpes region, which have been partly organized according to this new reticular mode, built on a pivot-institution : the Lyons L 9 on B 9 rard Centre. Especially through the cancer network in Rh 4 ne-Alpes (ONCORA), this centre sets relationships between various actors of health in the ambulatory and hospital sectors - either with a public or private status - located in about twenty towns of the Rh 4 ne-Alpes region and its periphery. In this specific case, the urban network is structuring cancerology in the framework of medical disciplines, situating it at the crossing of the organ specialities (vertical specialities) and, while giving it its disciplinary legibility, contributes to contributes to re-combining the territories through the urban centres concerned, from the Lyons city to the medium-sized towns. In this paper, we propose to analyse the changing of medical and territorial trajectories, while considering a sample of patients set up at two different dates, one before the foundation of the network, the other afterwards; then, we will study and evaluate, in terms of economic efficiency and social justice, the effects of this innovative network - ONCORA - in the regional offer of care...|$|E
