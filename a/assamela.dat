40|$|Abstract: Production {{of plants}} Pericopsis elata (<b>Assamela)</b> has been {{optimized}} by mineral and organic amendments. NPK fertilizers (20 - 10 - 10) and dry chicken manure {{were used for}} this purpose. To carry out this study, three batches of 30 seedlings were established. Seedlings of lot 1 were the witness, those of lot 2 received NPK (20 - 10 - 10) and finally those of lot 3 were chicken droppings. After eight weeks, the growth parameters such as height and average diameter of the seedlings were measured. In the laboratory analyses were performed to determine the levels of chlorophyll a, b and a + b, and the protein, fat and total carbohydrates. The application of NPK (20 - 10 - 10) and chicken manure positively influence protein levels in seedlings <b>Assamela,</b> being 29. 0, 27. 7 and 19. 1 g/gms respectively seedlings lots 3, 2 and 1. The amendments made have reduced the residence time of the seedlings in the nursery from September to June months have robust plants...|$|E
40|$|To develop {{silvicultural}} {{guidelines for}} high-value timber species of Central African moist forests, we assessed {{the performance of}} the pioneer Milicia excelsa (iroko, Moraceae), and of the non-pioneer light demander Pericopsis elata (<b>assamela,</b> Fabaceae) in logging gaps and in plantations in highly degraded areas in south-eastern Cameroon. The survival and size of each seedling was regularly monitored in the silvicultural experiments. Differences in performance and allometry were tested between species in logging gaps and in plantations. The two species performance in logging gaps was significantly different from plantations and concurred with the expectations of the performance trade-off hypothesis but not with the expectations of species light requirements. The pioneer M.  excelsa survived significantly better in logging gaps while the non-pioneer P. elata grew significantly faster in plantations. The high mortality and slow growth of M. excelsa in plantations is surprising for a pioneer species but could be explained by herbivory (attacks from a gall-making psyllid). Identifying high-value native timber species (i) with good performance in plantations such as P. elata is of importance to restore degraded areas; and (ii) with good performance in logging gaps such as M. excelsa is of importance to maintain timber resources and biodiversity in production forests...|$|E
40|$|Pericopsis elata (Fabaceae – <b>assamela,</b> afrormosia, kokrodua) is a {{high valued}} timber species of the moist semi {{deciduous}} African forests. Because of logging which started more than 50 years ago, it is considered as threatened and included on both IUCN Red List and CITES Appendix II. Nevertheless, there is still little information available on the species ecology: essential biological parameters controlling its population dynamics remain unknown. Our study first aims at improving the knowledge of its main ecological parameters, then at assessing the impact of selective logging on its populations in a forest management unit in Cameroon (ca 120, 000 ha). After inventorying the species (sampling rate of 1. 2 %), mortality and growth were assessed over continuous 5 and 2 -year periods in unlogged and logged areas, respectively. Phenology was monitored in the unlogged forest during 5 years (leaf shedding and flushing, flowering, ripe and unripe fruiting). The population structure followed a bell-shaped curve. Mean annual diameter increments in both environments {{did not differ significantly}} between unlogged and logged areas (0. 29 ± 0. 06 0. 31 ± 0. 04 cm for unlogged and logged areas, respectively). P. elata is a deciduous species that flowers {{at the end of the}} main dry season (Marsh-April). The minimum reproduction and effective flowering diameters were, respectively, 32 and 37 cm. Fruit maturation took place during 7 months (the seed rain occurs in December-January), but all unripe fruits abort 3 years out of 5. With a minimum logging diameter of 90 cm, the recovery rate computed over a 30 -year period was greater than 100 %. Selective logging harvested only 12. 1 % of the total number of seed trees and had little influence on the species biological parameters. Securing sufficient regeneration as a post-logging action is probably the most important consideration for achieving long-term sustainability. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|According {{to recent}} data (GLC 2000 map), African dense forests cover c. 236 million ha, that is 7. 9 % {{of the total}} {{continent}} area. The Central African forest is the last contiguous block of tropical forest in Africa; it covers an area of c. 203 million ha, whereas the forest cover of West Africa (c. 10 million ha) is highly fragmented. At {{the fringes of the}} Congo Basin, forests are replaced by woodlands and shrublands, mixed in some places with croplands. Woodlands and shrublands together cover 27 % of the continent, while grasslands represent 15 % of the land. The largest desert in the world is the Sahara desert that covers an area of c. 900 million ha or 33 % of the African continent. Agricultural activities extend over 12 % of the continent. The area of cropland is more important in West Africa than in Central Africa, respectively 16 % and 7 %. Closely related to agriculture, the deforestation rate is higher in West Africa (1. 7 % versus 0. 4 %). The other causes of deforestation are logging, mining activities, infrastructure development and fires. The most forested countries of the continent are: Central African Republic (c. 8 million ha), Gabon (c. 21 million ha), Cameroon (c. 21 million ha), Congo (c. 26 million ha) and D. R. Congo (c. 125 million ha). These five countries account for 85 % of the African dense forest. In Central Africa, 45 % of the total forest area is under a logging concession status. As a consequence, logging activities {{play a major role in}} the Central African rainforest’s future. According to the ITTO (International Tropical Timber Organization) figures, in 2003 the estimated productions of the five previously mentioned countries were: c. 7. 4 million m 3 of logs; c. 1. 1 million m 3 of sawn wood; c. 380, 000 m 3 of plywood and veneer, that is less than 1 % of the world production. Logging in Central Africa is characterized by its high selectivity. For economic reasons, only a few species are commercialized. Usually only one to two trees are felled per hectare and the cover disturbance is about 10 %. The most felled species can be grouped in two categories: hygrophilous evergreen rain forest species and moist semi-evergreen rain forest species. The first category is mainly composed of azobe Lophira alata, beli Julbernardia pellegriniana, douka Tieghemella africana, kevazingo Guibourtia spp., okoume Aucoumea klaineana, pachyloba Afzelia pachyloba, tali Erythrophleum ivorense. The second category is made up of afromosia Pericopsis elata, agba Prioria balsamifera, ayous Triplochyton scleroxylon, dibetou Lovoa trichiloides, frake Terminalia superba, iroko Milicia excelsa, kossipo Entandrophragma candollei, moabi Baillonella toxisperma, movingui Distemonanthus benthamianus, padouk Pterocarpus soyauxii, sapelli Entandrophragma cylindricum, sipo Entandrophragma utile. The major forest companies in the region are mostly subsidiaries of larger European firms (French, German, etc.) although Asian business is becoming more and more important. Obliged by the recent evolution of the Central African forestry laws, some of these logging companies are conceiving forest management plans. The management methods currently implemented were developed as normative regulations issued under the forest laws in the region. The basis of these methods is a statistical inventory of the resources which allows the determination of the population structures, i. e. the number of stems per diameter class. Considering increment and mortality, rotation and/or minimum felling diameters are adapted to reach a satisfactory reconstitution rate. Unfortunately, undamental knowledge about the species population dynamic parameters is still lacking and finally the precision on the rate of reconstitution after a cutting cycle is jeopardized. Moreover, these methods do not pay any attention to long-term preservation of the logged species, since species could have a satisfactory level of reconstitution after one rotation, but could disappear after a second cycle. For such species specific interventions are needed to improve their natural regeneration capacities. In this paper, examples are given for a 176, 000 ha management unit in Cameroon for flagship species: <b>assamela</b> Pericopsis elata, ayous Triplochyton scleroxylon, iroko Milicia excelsa, moabi Baillonella toxisperma, sapelli Entandrophragma cylindricum and tali Erythrophleum ivorense. The obtained results attest the need to implement sylvicultural techniques in order to maintain the production capacity of the African rain forests, this production capacity being the best guarantee for the preservation of their integrity.
