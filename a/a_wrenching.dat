5|$|In 1992, Naimski, {{as a head}} of the State Protection Office, {{started the}} process of {{screening}} people suspected of being Communist collaborators in Poland. In June that year he helped Antoni Macierewicz prepare a list of 64 members {{of the government and}} parliament who were named as spies in the police records; these included Wałęsa, then the Polish president. Wałęsa's name was included on the list after <b>a</b> <b>wrenching</b> internal debate about the virtues of honesty versus political discretion. In response to the publication of this list, President Wałęsa immediately engineered the fall of prime minister Jan Olszewski and the dismissal of Interior Minister Macierewicz. A parliamentary committee later concluded Wałęsa had not signed an agreement with the secret police.|$|E
25|$|Charles Hennebois {{touches on}} <b>a</b> <b>wrenching</b> aspect {{concerning}} the wounded. Some of them, {{instead of being}} transported to the hospital, were finished off {{on the field of}} battle: “Men wounded the day before were calling them from afar and asking to drink. The Germans finished them off by butting them with their rifles or bayoneting them, then despoiling them. I saw this from several metres away. A group of seven or eight men, felled by machine-gun crossfire, found itself at that point. Several were still alive, as they were begging the soldiers. They were finished off like I just said, shaken down and heaped up in a pile”. This claim is refuted in a German propaganda book about what happened in the camps published in 1918.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1970s, the United States {{underwent}} <b>a</b> <b>wrenching</b> {{period of}} low economic growth, high inflation and interest rates, and intermittent energy crises. By October 1978, Iran—a major oil supplier to the United States at the time—was experiencing a major uprising that severely damaged its oil infrastructure and greatly weakened its capability to produce oil. In January 1979, shortly after Iran's leader Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled the country, Iranian opposition figure Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ended his 14-year exile in France {{and returned to}} Iran to establish an Islamic Republic, largely hostile to American interests and influence in the country. In {{the spring and summer}} of 1979 inflation was on the rise and various parts of the United States were experiencing energy shortages.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the lyrics}} discuss love, forgiveness, and regret with, {{according}} to Larson, [...] "a sense that beyond tectonic heartbreak there is an anaemic acceptance that is kind of beautiful if you don't get too sad about it." [...] Several critics felt the lyrics were coloured by Yorke's recent separation from his partner of almost 25 years, Rachel Owen, noting that the backmasked vocals of [...] "Daydreaming", when reversed, resemble the words [...] "half of my life". Spencer Kornhaber of the Atlantic was hesitant to describe A Moon Shaped Pool as Yorke's [...] "breakup album", but wrote that it [...] "makes the most sense when heard as a document of <b>a</b> <b>wrenching</b> chapter for one human being." [...] Other themes include climate change on [...] "The Numbers" [...] and the dangers of authority and groupthink on [...] "Burn the Witch".|$|E
500|$|Peters {{starred in}} the Sondheim and Wynton Marsalis staged concert revue titled A Bed and a Chair: A New York Love Affair at New York City Center in November 2013. This {{collaboration}} between Encores! and Jazz at Lincoln Center was directed by John Doyle, with jazzy arrangements of Sondheim's songs. [...] It also featured Norm Lewis, Jeremy Jordan and Cyrille Aimée. Peters sang [...] "Broadway Baby", [...] "The Ladies Who Lunch", [...] "Isn't He Something?", [...] "I Remember" [...] and [...] "With So Little to Be Sure Of", among others. Jesse Green, in his review in New York Magazines Vulture site, commented: [...] "hat <b>a</b> <b>wrenching</b> (and funny) actress Peters remains, not {{on top of her}} voice but through it." [...] Brantley, in his New York Times review wrote: [...] "As a singer and actress, she just can't help being ardent, full-throated and sincere. She also reminds us here of her considerable and original comic gifts." ...|$|E
500|$|The largest {{fault is}} the Vermilion fault {{separating}} the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces. It has a N40°E trend and {{was caused by}} the introduction of masses of magma. The Vermilion fault can be traced westward to North Dakota. It has had a [...] horizontal movement with the northern block moving eastward and upward relative to the southern block. [...] The junction between the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces has a zone of biotite-rich migmatite, a rock that has characteristics of both igneous and metamorphic processes; this indicates a zone of partial melting which is possible only under high temperature and pressure conditions. It is visible as a [...] wide belt. Most of the flattened large crystals in the fault indicate a simple compression rather than <b>a</b> <b>wrenching,</b> shearing or rotational event as the two subprovinces docked. This provides evidence that the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces were joined by the collision of two continental plates, about [...] Structures in the migmatite include folds and foliations; the foliations cut across both limbs of earlier-phase folds. These cross-cutting foliations indicate that the migmatite has undergone at least two periods of ductile deformation.|$|E

500|$|Like {{many other}} U2 songs, [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] can be {{interpreted}} in a religious manner. Hot Press editor Niall Stokes called it [...] "a spiritual tour de force", saying [...] "it is a hymn of praise and celebration which described the traditional Māori burial of their friend on One Tree Hill and links it poetically with themes of renewal and redemption." [...] Beth Maynard, a Church rector from Fairhaven, Massachusetts, felt the song [...] "vows faith {{in the face of}} loss, combining elegiac lines about a friend ... and the martyred Chilean activist and folk singer Victor Jara, with a subtle evocation of end-time redemption and <b>a</b> <b>wrenching</b> wail to God to send the pentecostal Latter Rain." [...] Matt Soper, Senior Minister of the West Houston Church of Christ, believed the lyrics were an attempt by Bono to understand God's place in the world. Steve Stockman, a chaplain at Queen's University Belfast, felt that the song alluded to [...] "transcendent places beyond the space and time of earth". Music journalist Bill Graham noted [...] "the lyrics, with their reference to traditional Māori burial ceremonies on One Tree Hill, indicated that the band's faith didn't exclude an empathy with others' beliefs and rituals. Their Christianity wouldn't plaster over the universal archetypes of mourning." ...|$|E

Several minutes were passed by them in this attitude, the pair rocking and writhing like trees in a gale, both preserving an absolute silence. By this time their breathing could be heard. Then Farfrae tried to get hold of the other side of Henchard's collar, which was resisted by the larger man exerting all his force in <b>a</b> <b>wrenching</b> movement, and this part of the struggle ended by his forcing Farfrae down on his knees by sheer pressure of one of his muscular arms.

60|$|And in {{the morning}} it was quick breakfast, feed the dogs, load the sled, and hit the trail. We said good-bye as we pulled out, and the woman {{stood in the doorway}} and watched us off. I carried the vision of her unearthly beauty away with me, just under my eyelids, and all I had to do, any time, was to close them and see her again. The way was unbroken, Surprise Lake being far off the {{travelled}} trails, and Lon and I took turn about at beating down the feathery snow with our big, webbed shoes so that the dogs could travel. “But you said you expected to meet Dave Walsh at the cabin,” trembled on the tip of my tongue a score of times. I did not utter it. I could wait until we knocked off {{in the middle of the}} day. And when the middle of the day came, we went right on, for, as Lon explained, there was a camp of moose hunters at the forks of the Teelee, and we could make there by dark. But we didn’t make there by dark, for Bright, the lead-dog, broke his shoulder-blade, and we lost an hour over him before we shot him. Then, crossing a timber jam on the frozen bed of the Teelee, the sled suffered <b>a</b> <b>wrenching</b> capsize, and it was a case of make camp and repair the runner. I cooked supper and fed the dogs while Lon made the repairs, and together we got in the night’s supply of ice and firewood. Then we sat on our blankets, our moccasins steaming on upended sticks before the fire, and had our evening smoke.|$|E
