As the rush dies down, they all begin to sweat profusely, become highly irritable and argumentative, frantically tear up the office carpet to reveal the hardwood underneath, and try to relocate the copy machine. <b>At</b> <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> everybody leaves the office in total disarray.

Colonel Foster enlisted the services of Harold Winch of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, who had acted as a liaison between the unemployed and the police during the 1935 relief camp strike. His task this time was to ensure that the treasures of the gallery went unscathed during the eviction. Along with police tear gas canisters, Winch successfully negotiated the withdrawal of the unemployed.|$|E

25|$|Eliot {{arranged}} for a formal separation in February 1933, and thereafter shunned her entirely, hiding from her and instructing his friends– including members of the Bloomsbury Group and the publisher Faber & Faber, {{where he was a}} director– not to tell her where he was. Her brother had her committed to an asylum in 1938, after she was found wandering the streets of London <b>at</b> <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, apparently asking whether Eliot had been beheaded. Apart from one escape attempt, she remained there until she died nine years later at the age of 58; she was said to have suffered a heart attack, although there is a suspicion that she took an overdose. Eliot won the Nobel Prize for Literature the following year.|$|E
25|$|Years later, Jamal, now a Chaiwala in an Indian call centre, {{searches}} the centre's database for Salim and Latika. He fails in finding Latika, while succeeding in finding Salim, now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's crime organisation. Jamal reproaches Salim, who then pleads for forgiveness, and offers {{him to stay}} in his luxurious apartment. Jamal later bluffs his way into Javed's residence to reunite with Latika but as he professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her. Jamal nevertheless promises to wait for her every day <b>at</b> <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> at the VT station. Latika attempts to meet him there, but is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim, and once Javed moves to another house, outside Mumbai, the two again lose contact. Jamal becomes a contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, knowing that she watches the show regularly. Much to the consternation of Prem Kumar, the show's host, Jamal becomes a wonder across India. He uses the 50/50 lifeline on the penultimate question and during the following break, whilst in the men's room, Kumar tries to fool Jamal, feeding him with a wrong answer, yet Jamal chooses the other one, which {{turns out to be the}} correct answer.|$|E
500|$|Von Neumann entered {{government}} service primarily {{because he felt}} that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, {{it would have to}} be because the United States would triumph over totalitarianism from Nazism, Fascism and Soviet Communism. During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as [...] "violently anti-communist, and much more militaristic than the norm".

500|$|Lazenby said he {{experienced}} difficulties during shooting, not receiving any coaching despite {{his lack of}} acting experience, and with director Hunt never addressing him directly, only through his assistant. Lazenby also declared that Hunt also asked {{the rest of the}} crew to keep a distance from him, as [...] "Peter thought the more I was alone, the better I would be as James Bond." [...] Allegedly, there also were personality conflicts with Rigg, who was already an established star. However, according to director Hunt, these rumours are untrue and there were no such difficulties—or else they were minor—and may have started with Rigg joking to Lazenby before filming a love scene [...] "Hey George, I'm having garlic for lunch. I hope you are!" [...] Hunt also declared that he usually had long talks with Lazenby before and during shooting. For instance, to shoot Tracy's death scene, Hunt brought Lazenby to the set at 8 o'clock in the morning and made him rehearse all day long, [...] "and I broke him down until he was absolutely exhausted, and by the time we shot it <b>at</b> <b>five</b> <b>o'clock,</b> he was exhausted, and that's how I got the performance." [...] Hunt said that if Lazenby had remained in the role, he would also have directed the successor film, Diamonds Are Forever, and that his original intentions were concluding the film with Bond and Tracy driving off following their wedding, saving Tracy's murder for the pre-credit sequence of Diamonds Are Forever. The idea was discarded after Lazenby quit the role.|$|E

2500|$|The day of upper-class Parisians {{before the}} Revolution was {{described}} in the early 1780s by Sebastien Mercier in his Tableau de Paris. Deliveries of fresh produce by some three thousand farmers to the central market of Les Halles began at one in the morning, followed by the deliveries of fish and meat. At nine o'clock, the limonadiers served coffee and pastries to the first clients. At ten o'clock, the clerks and officials of the courts and administration arrived at work. At noon, the financiers, brokers and bankers took their places at the Bourse and in the financial district of the Saint-Honoré quarter. At two o'clock, work stopped {{in the financial markets}} and offices, and the Parisians departed for lunch, either at home or in restaurants. <b>At</b> <b>five</b> <b>o'clock,</b> the streets were again filled with people, as the wealthier Parisians went to the theater, or for promenades, or to cafés. The city was quiet until nine clock, when the streets filled again, as the Parisians made visits to friends. Dinner, or [...] "souper" [...] began between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock. It was also the hour when the prostitutes came out at the Palais-Royal and other heavily frequented streets. When the souper was finished, between eleven and midnight, most Parisians headed home, with others remained to gamble in the salons of the Palais-Royal. The work day for artisans and laborers was usually twelve hours, from about seven in the morning until seven in the evening, usually with a two-hour break at midday for rest and food.|$|E

We shouted back, 'Be strong! We are with you, and thousands of Jewish youth are with you in spirit.' They replied, 'Thanks,' and went on singing. At two a Sephardi rabbi whom we could not recognize from afar [...] was brought and stayed in the cell 15 minutes.
