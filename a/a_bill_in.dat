It passed and was disseminated to chancelleries across Europe. Austria refused to sanction it, fearing that Tuscany would fall into the Bourbons' hands. However, France and England did.|$|E

Until that time local residents travelled to Queanbeyan, just across the New South Wales border, to drink on Saturday. In 1938 the Territory was formally renamed the Australian Capital Territory.|$|E
5|$|The Office of the Special Prosecutor {{was founded}} {{with the passage}} of <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> the Icelandic {{parliament}} 10 December 2008.

5|$|Bills can be {{introduced}} to Parliament {{in a number of}} ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer. Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become Acts of the Scottish Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the {{government}} was required to coin under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Burnham {{was living}} in California and was active in counterespionage for Britain. Much of it {{involved}} a famous Boer spy, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne, who became a German spy in both World Wars and claimed to have killed Field Marshal Kitchener while en route {{to meet with the}} Russians. During the Second Boer War, Burnham and Duquesne were each under orders to assassinate the other, {{but it was not until}} 1910 that the two men first met while both were in Washington, D.C., separately lobbying Congress to pass <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> favor of the importation of African game animals into the United States (H.R. 23621). Duquesne was twice arrested by the FBI and in 1942 he and 32 other Nazi agents (the Duquesne Spy Ring) were jailed for espionage in the largest spy ring conviction in U.S. history.|$|E
5|$|During the Reconstruction Era, Confederate {{veterans}} {{were initially}} prohibited from holding public office or from practicing law in West Virginia {{without taking a}} test oath. The West Virginia House of Delegates passed <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> 1868 that allowed Monroe to practice law without having to swear an oath. Following the passage of this bill, he resumed {{the practice of law}} in Romney. In 1872, he represented Hampshire County at the West Virginia Constitutional Convention in Charleston. In 1875, Monroe returned to politics when he was elected as a Democrat to represent Hampshire County in the West Virginia House of Delegates for one two-year term. It was during this legislative session that Monroe served as Speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates. He was the first delegate to represent Hampshire County in both the Virginia General Assembly and the West Virginia Legislature.|$|E

5|$|Garrow {{also became}} {{involved}} in the repeal of the Corn Laws, voting for the measure, and sponsored legislation to control surgical practice in the United Kingdom; the bill did not, however, pass into law. In the early 19th century animal cruelty was widespread; Garrow {{was one of those who}} found it appalling, and sponsored <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> 1816 to increase the penalties for riding horses until their severe injury or death. While defeated, his actions were vindicated by a bill of 1820 introduced by Thomas Erskine, which was given the Royal Assent and came into law. Garrow eventually resigned as Attorney General and as a member of parliament in 1817, when he was appointed one of the Barons of the Exchequer.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, {{the section}} of highway south of Kalamazoo was named part of the Colgrove Highway. This {{designation}} included several other roads in the Lower Peninsula, all {{named in honor of}} Philip Colgrove, the first president of the Michigan Good Roads Association. Colgrove was also the Barry County prosecutor and a state senator in the late 19th century. No maps documents the name, although the original law remains in records. The Michigan Legislature proposed <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> 2000 that would have repealed the 1921 statute naming the Colgrove Highway, but the bill ultimately faded, sparing the name.|$|E

The United States Congress considered <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> 2004 which would require the Medal of Honor to be made with 90% gold, the same composition as the lesser-known Congressional Gold Medal, but the measure was dropped.|$|E
5|$|This {{prompted}} Planché {{to begin}} campaigning for copyright {{to be extended}} to dramatic works. He gathered a group of dramatists (including John Poole, James Kenney, Joseph Lunn and Richard Brinsley Peak) who prevailed upon writer and MP George Lamb to introduce <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> Parliament; but the bill did not pass its third reading. In 1832 Edward Bulwer-Lytton, a novelist and MP, was successful in getting a select committee set up to consider dramatic copyright, as well as theatrical censorship and the monopoly of the patent theatres on drama. Planché gave evidence before the select committee; the following year the Dramatic Copyright Act 1833 (3 Will IV c. 15) was passed.|$|E
