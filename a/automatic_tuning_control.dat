30|$|Proportional {{effect has}} an impact on {{controller}} output as errors multiply with a specific gain value. Proportional effect increases the accuracy of static and dynamic response of a system. That is, it {{has an impact}} on a system in the way of fast reaction time and a reduction of errors. While the proportional gain factor K increases, the steady-state error of the system decreases. However, despite the reduction, P control can never manage to eliminate the steady-state error of the system. In this study, gain value is found using various <b>automatic</b> <b>tuning</b> methods or by trial and error. In this study, an <b>automatic</b> <b>tuning</b> code is embedded in the microcontroller thanks to feedback obtained from the system. The integral effect {{has an impact on}} controller output proportionally to the sum of the errors from the effective operation of the system. While the integral effect increases static accuracy and eliminates error, its dynamic response time reduces.
