40|$|Using autoethnographic and {{narrative}} inquiry, this dissertation investigates the identity and literacy development of <b>an</b> international <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> in the US. The research questions explored {{in this study}} are 1) What kind of identity work does becoming <b>an</b> international <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> entail? 2) What are the academic literacy practices of <b>an</b> international <b>graduate</b> <b>student?</b> and 3) How do the identities and literacy practices of <b>an</b> international <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> change contextually and over time? The findings illustrated that the identities and literacy practices in graduate school were multiple, heterogeneous, dialogic, situated, and dynamic. The findings indicated that the development of both identities and literacy practices in <b>graduate</b> school requires <b>a</b> considerable amount of interaction with others—people and texts—and that these interactions are the primary factor underlying disciplinary socialization. The findings showed that subjective evaluations about these interactions could fundamentally shape academic socialization. The study also points out the significance and necessity of studying academic socialization from particular emic perspectives of individuals. ...|$|R
