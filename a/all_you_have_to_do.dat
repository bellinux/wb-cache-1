25|$|Einstein {{acknowledged}} {{the controversy over}} his derivation in his 1907 survey paper on special relativity. There he notes that it is problematic to rely on Maxwell's equations for the heuristic mass–energy argument. The argument in his 1905 paper {{can be carried out}} with the emission of any massless particles, but the Maxwell equations are implicitly used to make it obvious that the emission of light in particular can be achieved only by doing work. To emit electromagnetic waves, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is shake a charged particle, and this is clearly doing work, so that the emission is of energy.|$|E

This service will be available sometime early year 2014. Volunteer doctors of Global Clinic have tried to help these people, for whom only acute care has been available. This means that the Finnish system is open for people coming outside of the European Union. The service covers special child healthcare, maternity clinics and specialist medical care etc. practically for free. It is still unclear if this will increase so called health tourism, because <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is come to Helsinki as a tourist and let the visa expire.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Dylan is a superbly eloquent {{writer of}} pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images." [...] The editor of Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams, reviewed Blonde on Blonde in July 1966: [...] "It is {{a cache of}} emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready {{to become part of}} your reality. Here is a man who will speak to you, a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Webber's orchestral accompaniment added a {{different}} level to the track, with its composition consisting of pizzicato strings, and its flowing tempo introducing Covington's opening vocals. The song jumps from being light to heavy and extravagant, with one section of it being hummed by choral voices. As the final lyrics goes, [...] "But <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is look at me to know / That every word is true" [...] is sung, the London Philharmonic Orchestra comes into play with a huge climax and ends. According to the sheet music published by Music Sales Group, the song starts with a sequence of G/D–A7/D–D–Bm/D, changes to E–E/D–A/C–E7–A–D, with the chorus featuring a chord progression of A–Bm–Dmaj7–Gmaj7–G–Fm7. The song is composed in the key of C major with Covington's vocals spanning from the nodes of E3 to G5.|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and I can give them to you and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is give me your soul".|$|E

2500|$|What we're {{presenting}} isn't {{much different}} from what [...] is subjected to in everyday life. For example, a commercial is a very plastic view of existence and reality. When you watch a TV show and see a world with picture-perfect endings, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is switch the station and watch the news.|$|E
2500|$|When {{one wants}} to find a gesture, {{when you want to}} find how to act onstage, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is [...] to the music.

If you take the trouble to really listen with your Soul and with your Ears—and I say 'Soul' and 'Ears' because the Mind must work, but not [...] much also—you will find every gesture there.|$|E
2500|$|Hermann Göring described, {{during an}} {{interview}} at the Nuremberg Trials, how denouncing and outlawing pacifism was {{an important part of}} the Nazis' seizure of power: [...] "The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the March 2010 {{print edition}} of British enthusiast {{magazine}} EVO (p.120), editor Richard Meaden {{was the first}} to review the all-new right-hand-drive version of the Roadster. He said the car had [...] "serious, instantaneous muscle". [...] "With so much torque from literally no revs the acceleration punch is wholly alien. Away from traffic lights you'd murder anything, be it a 911 Turbo, GT-R or 599, simply because while they have to mess about with balancing revs and clutch, or fiddle with launch controls and invalid warranties, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is floor the throttle and wave goodbye".|$|E
2500|$|The gentry {{feared that}} the kind of revolutionary turmoil that had been seen in France and Ireland could take place in Britain, and there was a great {{recruiting}} of volunteer regiments through the Scottish lowlands and Scottish Borders. Walter Scott urged his Borders neighbours to [...] "appeal at this crisis to the good sense and loyalty of the lower orders... <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is sound the men, and mark down those who seem zealous. They will perhaps have to fight with the pitmen and colliers of Northumbria for defence of their firesides, for those literal blackguards are got beyond the management of their own people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Falling coconut {{injuries}} were {{featured in the}} American television series Gilligan's Island. [...] A June 1965 episode revolved around an injury sustained by Gilligan after a falling coconut {{hit him in the}} nose. [...] Actor Bob Denver explained the success of the series as follows: [...] "Little kids seem to love it. [...] It doesn't take a great intellect or reasoning power to be able to laugh at a monkey running off with Gilligan's dinner or a guy getting conked on the head by a coconut." [...] When Denver died, the show's creator Sherwood Schwartz said that Denver didn't get enough credit for his talent as a slapstick actor: [...] "A lot of people don't think it's hard to be an actor where <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is react to a falling coconut." [...] In the film Cast Away, the stranded character played by Tom Hanks is alarmed several times by loud thuds, which he cannot identify. He finally sees a coconut fall, making the sound.|$|E

2500|$|Influenced heavily by DIY culture, most bands' {{presentation}} subverted traditional or classically trained 'musicianship' {{in favor}} of raw, primitive, avant-lo-fi passion and fiercely deliberate amateurism: [...] an idea growing rapidly in popularity, especially in the Olympia music scene, with bands like Beat Happening coining the slogans: [...] "Learn how to NOT play your instrument" [...] and [...] "hey, you don't have to sound like {{the flavor of the}} month, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is sound like yourselves", arguing that traditional musical skill doesn't ultimately matter and should always be subservient to the passion, the fun and ideas in their music. [...] This argument is similar to the ideological origins of punk rock itself, which started partially as an attempt to dissolve the growing division between audience and performer. [...] These indie-punk bands (and riot grrrl bands in particular) were often ridiculed for [...] "not being able to play their instruments", but fans are quick to counter that identical criticisms were often faced by the first-wave of punk rock bands in the 1970s, and that this DIY garage amateurism [...] "play just 'cause you wanna, no matter what" [...] attitude {{was one of the most}} appealing and liberating aspects of both movements.|$|E
2500|$|However, some reviews viewed that {{similarity}} as positive, {{and perceived}} it more as progression and evolution than repetition. Stylus Magazine repeated similar sentiments {{as those of}} the previous reviews, but did not feel that re-using a successful formula was a burden, Cosmo Lee saying [...] "it's not Isis' fault that they sound unoriginal these days. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is pick up a copy of Decibel, open it to any page, and you’ll find someone counting the group as an influence [...] The songs are still long, the rhythms are still organic, and in general Isis still sounds like Isis". Despite having said this, the review is still very positive. PopMatters repeated the views of Lee, stating Isis are [...] "a band knowing how to execute the formula to near-perfection", and Thom Jurek of Allmusic expanded upon that point further, stating [...] "this set is not a brave leap [...] but a further look up the holy mountain to a new plateau, a hike to sacred ground". Drowned in Sound reviewer Mike Diver, however, viewed the album differently; that Isis have [...] "pushed themselves on this album, striving to achieve something honestly different to what was released before it". An IGN review described it as [...] "unique and free from boundaries", and it has been labeled as [...] "Isis' masterpiece", as well as their [...] "most compelling work to date". Writing for Alternative Press, Aaron Burgess states that [...] "save for the brief distorted squalls of [...] "Garden of Light" [...] and the pummeling metallic grooves of [...] "Not In Rivers, But In Drops," [...] there's barely anything keeping Isis tethered to the rigid [...] "post-metal" [...] genre they helped inspire".|$|E
