40|$|In {{search of}} <b>alpha-galactosidases</b> with {{improved}} kinetic properties for {{removal of the}} immunodominant alpha 1, 3 -linked galactose residues of blood group B antigens, we recently identified a novel prokaryotic family of <b>alpha-galactosidases</b> (CAZy GH 110) with highly restricted substrate specificity and neutral pH optimum (Liu, Q. P., Sulzenbacher, G., Yuan, H., Bennett, E. P., Pietz, G., Saunders, K., Spence, J., Nudelman, E., Levery, S. B., White, T., Neveu, J. M., Lane, W. S., Bourne, Y., Olsson, M. L., Henrissat, B., and Clausen, H. (2007) Nat. Biotechnol. 25, 454 - 464). One member of this family from Bacteroides fragilis had exquisite substrate specificity for the branched blood group B structure Gal alpha 1 - 3 (Fuc alpha 1 - 2) Gal, whereas linear oligosaccharides terminated by alpha 1, 3 -linked galactose such as the immunodominant xenotransplantation epitope Gal alpha 1 - 3 Gal beta 1 - 4 GlcNAc did not serve as substrates. Here we demonstrate the existence of two distinct subfamilies of GH 110 in B. fragilis and thetaiotaomicron strains. Members of one subfamily have exclusive specificity for the branched blood group B structures, whereas members of a newly identified subfamily represent linkage specific alpha 1, 3 -galactosidases that act equally well on both branched blood group B and linear alpha 1, 3 Gal structures. We determined by one-dimensional H- 1 NMR spectroscopy that GH 110 enzymes function with an inverting mechanism, which is in striking contrast to all other known <b>alpha-galactosidases</b> that use a retaining mechanism.

40|$|Background: The genus Thermus, {{which has}} been {{considered}} {{for a long time}} as a fruitful source of biotechnological relevant enzymes, has emerged more recently as suitable host to overproduce thermozymes. Among these, <b>alpha-galactosidases</b> are widely used in several industrial bioprocesses that require high working temperatures and for which thermostable variants offer considerable advantages over their thermolabile counterparts. Results: Thermus thermophilus HB 27 strain was used for the homologous expression of the TTP 0072 gene encoding for an a-galactosidase (TtGalA). Interestingly, a soluble and active histidine-tagged enzyme was produced in larger amounts (5 mg/L) in this thermophilic host than in Escherichia coli (0. 5 mg/L). The purified recombinant enzyme showed an optimal activity at 90 degrees C and retained more than 40 % of activity over a broad range of pH (from 5 to 8). Conclusions: TtGalA is among the most thermoactive and thermostable a-galactosidases discovered so far, thus pointing to T. thermophilus as cell factory for the recombinant production of biocatalysts active at temperature values over 90 degrees C...|$|R

40|$|The ecophysiological variabilities in the ectohydrolytic enzyme {{profiles}} of the three species of Pseudoalteromonas, P. citrea, P. issachenkonii, and P. nigrifaciens, have been investigated. Forty-one bacteria isolated from several invertebrates, macroalgae, sea grass, and the surrounding water exhibited different patterns of hydrolytic enzyme activities measured as the hydrolysis of either native biopolymers or fluorogenic substrates. The activities of the following enzymes were assayed: proteinase, tyrosinase, lipase, amylase, chitinase, agarase, fucoidan hydrolase, laminaranase, alginase, pustulanase, cellulase, beta-glucosidase, alpha- and beta-galactosidases, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-glucosaminidase, beta-xylosidase, and alpha-mannosidase. The occurrence and cell-specific activities of all enzymes varied over a broad range (from 0 to 44 micromol EU per hour) and depended not only on taxonomic affiliation of the strain, {{but also on the}} source/place of its isolation. This suggests 'specialization' of different species for different types of polymeric substrates as, for example, all strains of P. citrea and P. issachenkonii hydrolyzed alginate and laminaran, while strains of P. nigrifaciens were lacking the ability to hydrolyze most of the algal polysaccharides.

40|$|Iminosugars are polyhydroxylated alkaloids, {{and can be}} {{generally}} defined as sugar mimetics in which the endocyclic oxygen atom has been replaced with a basic nitrogen. A common affect of this atomic substitution is to bestow these compounds {{with the ability to}} inhibit various sugarprocessing enzymes; most significantly the glycosidases (glycoside hydrolases) which areintimately involved in a huge array of biological functions. Compounds which inhibit these enzymes concordantly possess much potential as medicinal agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Several iminosugars have already achieved market approval as drugs, and many more are promising candidates in the late stages of clinical development. As such there remains considerable interest in this class of compound, both in terms of the exploration of novel iminosugar structures, as well as the continual development of more efficient general methodology for their synthesis. The densely-packed functionality and stereochemical information present in iminosugars makes them challenging targets for asymmetric chemical synthesis, whereas carbohydrates are clearly very attractive as chiral-pool starting materials for this purpose. Indeed, the majority of the most successful syntheses of iminosugars use the latter approach, and such is the focus of this thesis. Chapter 1 presents a relatively brief introduction to iminosugars, including their types of structure, natural occurrence and biological mode of action. The rationale behind their use as therapeutic agents for the treatment of some significant disease targets is also discussed. Chapter 2 is concerned with the preparation of a number of novel polyhydroxylated azetidines, and their evaluation as glycosidase inhibitors. Such compounds represent an almost entirely neglected class of iminosugars within the literature. An overview of natural and synthetic products incorporating an azetidine motif is given, as well as a brief review of preparative methods and known azetidine iminosugars. A highly efficient and flexible method for the key azetidine ring formation is demonstrated by the cyclisations of 3, 5 -di-O-triflates of pentoses and hexoses, and of a 2, 4 -di-O-triflate of glucose, with various primary amines. In this manner, many azetidine triols and tetrols were prepared in good yield. Furthermore, this process is readily adaptable to the installation of added functionality to the azetidine scaffold, as demonstrated by the preparation of 1 -acetamido analogues. The initial biological screening of these compounds showed a promising array of glycosidase inhibition, including that of selective inhibition of fungal enzymes. Chapter 3 describes a strategy with which to prepare all sixteen stereoisomers of a known piperidine iminosugar, alpha-homonojirimycin (alpha-HNJ), in a highly divergent manner from just four of the possible thirty-two 6 -azidoheptitols using traditional chemical synthesis in tandem with biotechnological transformations. One half of the execution of this strategy is described in this thesis. Two 6 -azidoheptitols were prepared from D-mannose, thereby providing access to four 6 -azidoketoheptoses through a combination of microbial oxidation and enzymatic epimerisation. Catalytic hydrogenation of these 6 -azidoketoheptoses furnished four diastereomeric mixtures of 2, 6 -iminoheptitols, with varying degrees of stereoselectivity. Purification of these mixtures allowed six 2, 6 -iminoheptitols to be isolated, two of which have never previously been tested for glycosidase inhibition. Significantly, one of them was found to be a potent and highly selectiveinhibitor of <b>alpha-galactosidases,</b> and may therefore be of interest in the treatment of Fabry disease. </p...|$|R
