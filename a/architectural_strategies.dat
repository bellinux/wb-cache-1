40|$|Architectural {{designs for}} DNA {{nanostructures}} typically fall within {{one of two}} broad categories: tile-based designs (assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides) and origami designs (woven structures employing a biological scaffold strand and synthetic staple strands). Both previous designs typically contain many Holliday-type multi-arm junctions. Here we describe the design, implementation, and testing of a unique <b>architectural</b> <b>strategy</b> incorporating some aspects {{of each of the}} two previous design categories but without multi-arm junction motifs. Goals for the new design were to use only chemically synthesized DNA, to minimize the number of component strands, and to mimic the back-and-forth, woven strand routing of the origami architectures. The resulting <b>architectural</b> <b>strategy</b> employs "weave tiles" formed from only two oligonucleotides as basic building blocks, thus decreasing the burden of matching multiple strand stoichiometries compared to previous tile-based architectures and resulting in a structurally flexible tile.

40|$|To {{achieve their}} {{business}} objectives, software developing companies employ different technical and managerial strategies concerning architecture and reuse. These strategies include component-based development, software platforms, product lines and highly configurable code bases. Frameworks for describing these strategies have recently emerged, presenting them in orders of increasing maturity, with researchers declaring specific <b>architectural</b> <b>strategies</b> {{to be more}} mature than others.

40|$|System {{designers}} and technology strategists have long recognized {{the concept of}} an architectural control point as a way to identify parts of a system that have particular strategic importance. Despite the vast body of work on system architecture in the engineering design literature, however, few authors have attempted to define architectural control points or study them systematically. Moreover, some industry participants have questioned whether architectural control is still a valuable or achievable goal in an era of increasingly open standards. This paper offers tentative definitions of architectural control, architectural control points, and <b>architectural</b> <b>strategy.</b> In a longer version of the paper, the utility of these concepts is demonstrated through examples drawn from the history of the personal computer industry. These examples reveal both simple and subtle interactions between system design and market competition, and suggest that <b>architectural</b> <b>strategy</b> continues {{to play an important role}} in the competitive dynamics of system-oriented industries. ∗ The concept of architectural control advanced in this paper owes much to discussions with Ralph Pollock and others at IBM from 1997 – 99, and with Carliss Baldwin, Barbara Feinberg and Marco Iansiti at Harvard Business School from 2000 – 05.

40|$|Plants {{can resist}} {{herbivore}} pressure through structural or chemical defence or both. The {{ultimate goal of}} defence against herbivory {{is to reduce the}} amount of damage to biomass, but more specifically to protect against damage to meristematic tissue. The defences employed depend on the type of herbivory experienced, which is contingent on the herbivore and its mouthparts. This investigation was concerned with structural defence presented by spines. This type of defence protects against mammalian herbivores such as browsers. Spiny species do not dominate in low-light deep forest environments. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the constraints on spines as a defence strategy under shaded conditions by assessing the effect of reduced light on spine efficiency. Spine efficiency was defined as the amount of defence afforded the plant given the resources available. Spines require carbon to be built and need to be arranged properly in order to present an adequate defence. Thus two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses were proposed: Light limitation reduces the ability of spines to present an adequate defence against browsers due to the <b>architectural</b> <b>strategy</b> employed and/or its influence on carbon gain. The spinescent plant chosen for study was Carissa macrocarpa (Ecklon) A. DC. Light condition of plants was determined using hemispherical photography. Spine efficiency of sun and shade plants was determined using a bite test and was evaluated using architectural and physiological analyses. Architectural analysis involved identifying levels of organisation within the plant across ontogeny and indentifying sun and shade growth strategies. Physiological analysis involved determining carbon gain of sun and shade individuals using gas-exchange measurements, as well as the measurement of biomass allocation by harvesting and oven drying different plant parts. Results showed that biomass allocation patterns of C. macrocarpa did not change in sun and shade but total biomass increased from shade to sunlit conditions. Architectural analysis revealed that in the sun the plant adopted a stout dense structure with high spine efficiency, while in the shade it was more elongated with lower spine efficiency. Therefore C. macrocarpa adapts to the light environment by adopting either the shade or the sun <b>architectural</b> <b>strategy.</b> The way in which this works is that light affects carbon gain, which either increases or decreases biomass and in turn leads the plant to adopt the sun or shade <b>architectural</b> <b>strategy.</b> The <b>architectural</b> <b>strategy</b> affects spine efficiency such that plants in the sun have higher spine efficiency than plants in the shade. Thus, spinescent plants do not do well in light limited environments because they are architecturally constrained to elongate in such conditions. This constraint would put them at higher risk of browser damage than plants in light-sufficient conditions, ultimately decreasing their fitness. If the patterns observed in C. macrocarpa prove to be general, then it helps to explain why spiny plants are more commonly found in open, sunlit environments than in deep shade...|$|R
