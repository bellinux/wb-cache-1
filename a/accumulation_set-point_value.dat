40|$|Abstract—This work {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of a mul-tivariable model predictive controller that regulates thin film surface roughness and mean slope to a two-dimensional kinetic Monte-Carlo thin film growth model using both substrate temperature and deposition rate as manipulated inputs. The description of the thin film growth involving both adsorption and surface migration is first given. Surface roughness and surface slope are defined as the root-mean-squares of the surface height profile and the surface slope profile, respectively. The dynamics of the evolution of the thin film surface height profile are assumed to be described by an Edwards–Wilkinson-type equation (a second-order stochastic partial differential equation) in two spatial dimensions. Analytical solutions of the expected surface roughness and surface slope are obtained {{on the basis of the}} Edwards–Wilkinson equation and are used in the controller design. The model parameters of the Edwards– Wilkinson equation depend on the substrate temperature and deposition rate. This dependence is used in the formulation of the predictive controller to predict the influence of the control action on the surface roughness and slope at the end of the growth process. The model predictive controller involves constraints on the magnitude and rate of change of the control action and optimizes a cost that involves penalty on both surface roughness and mean slope from the <b>set-point</b> <b>values.</b> The controller is applied to the two-dimensional kinetic Monte-Carlo thin film growth model and is shown to successfully regulate surface roughness and mean slope to <b>set-point</b> <b>values</b> at the end of the deposition.

This full-scale unit has been in stable operation for more than 10 years.

The input and output variables of the process were the reboiler duty of the column and the mole fraction of biodiesel obtained from the bottom section of the column, respectively while the disturbance variable was the reflux ratio. Both the open loop and the closed loop simulations of the system were achieved from the Simulink model of the system developed and run via written m-file codes. The results obtained from the open loop dynamic simulation of the process revealed that the disturbance variable had effects on the output (biodiesel mole fraction obtained from the bottom section) of the process because the steps applied to it made the output not to be at the desired set point.

40|$|International audienceThe {{level of}} excitability of {{cortical}} neurons {{depends on the}} balance between their excitatory and inhibitory inputs (excitation/inhibition [E/I] balance). In the cortex, the E/I balance received by a neuron is dynamically maintained through a coordinated regulation {{of the strength of}} these inputs, described in term of homeostatic plasticity. Using a method allowing the determination of the E/I balance in rat cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L 5 -PNs, the main output stage of the cortex), while keeping the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory networks functional, we examined the effects of high or low frequency of stimulation (HFS or LFS) protocols in layer 4 (in order to mimic thalamo-cortical entries) on the E-I level of the neuronal network. We previously showed that the E/I balance of L 5 -PNs remains stable due to a dual potentiation or dual depression of E and I after HFS or LFS protocols. Here, using a specific neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, we show that the related potentiation or depression of E and I (underlying homeostatic plasticity processes) required nNOS activation. We also show that application of an unspecific blocker of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) or a nitric oxide (NO) scavenger induces an increase of the E/I balance suggesting a role for a tonic NO synthesis in the regulation of the network activity. It is concluded that, in the cortex, a phasic NO effect (due to activation of nNOS) is required for the induction of homeostatic plasticity processes whereas a tonic NO signal is involved in the regulation of a <b>set-point</b> <b>value</b> for the E/I balance...|$|R
40|$|Nine {{different}} protein homeostatic regulatory mechanisms were {{analysed for}} their ability to maintain a generic protein P within a specified range of a set-point steady-state concentration while perturbed by external processes that altered the rates at which P was produced and/or consumed. Steady state regulatory effectiveness was defined by the area within a rectangular region of ‘‘perturbation space’’, where axes correspond to rates of positive and negative perturbations. The size of this region differed in accordance with the regulatory elements composing the homeostatic mechanism. Such elements included basic negative feedback control of transcription (in which P, at some high concentration relative to its <b>set-point</b> <b>value,</b> binds to the gene G that encodes it, thereby inhibiting transcription), multiple sequential binding of a feedback effector (two P’s bind sequentially to G), and dimerization of a feedback effector (a P 2 dimer binds to G). Two homeostatic mechanisms included a cascade structure, one with and one without translational feedback control. Another mechanism included feedback control of P degradation. Finally, two mechanisms illustrated the limits of regulatory systems. One lacked all regulatory elements (and included only an invariant rate of P synthesis and degradation) while the other assumed perfect (Boolean) regulation, in which transcription is completely inhibited at P 4 P sp and is fully active at P oP sp: All of the systems evaluated are known, but the analytical expressions developed here allow quantitative comparisons between them.

The modeling domain represented the major features of the process room including the principal release or leakage source of gas storage system. The model was benchmarked against the literature results for key phenomena such as natural convection, turbulent behavior, gas mixing due to jet entrainment, and radiation cooling because these phenomena are closely related to the gas driving mechanisms within a large air space of the process room. The modeling results showed that {{at the corner of the}} process room, the gas concentrations migrated by the Case 2 and Case 3 scenarios reached the <b>set-point</b> <b>value</b> of high activity alarm in about 13 seconds, while the Case 1 scenario takes about 90 seconds to reach the concentration. The modeling results were used to estimate transient radioactive gas migrations in an enclosed process room installed with high activity alarm monitor when the postulated leakage scenarios are initiated without room ventilation...|$|R
30|$|The single SiNW {{devices were}} {{electrically}} characterized at various temperature ranging from 100 to 300  K; the measurements were {{performed in a}} thermally controlled environment (Janis ST- 100 H cryostat) consisting of a cold finger column inserted in a vacuum chamber. The samples were mounted on the holder {{at the end of}} the cold finger, and a thin Kapton film (12.5  μm) was placed between the samples and the holder to ensure electrical insulation of the circuit while providing a good thermal contact. The vacuum chamber was connected to a scroll pump (Varian SH- 100) and to a turbo-molecular pump (Alcatel ATP 80), leading to a residual pressure around 10 − 5 mbar. The value of temperature was acquired with a platinum Pt- 100 resistor embedded into the cold finger, while a controller (Lake-Shore 331), coupled with a heater and a liquid nitrogen transfer-line, tuned the temperature to the <b>set-point</b> <b>value.</b> Kapton-covered cables inside the chamber provided electrical wiring of the samples to external coaxial plugs. We used a Keithley 6430 Sub-Femtoamp SourceMeter with remote preamplifier for electrical measurement; external noises were minimized using a short triaxial cable connected to the coaxial plugs of the cryostat through a specific adapter. The SourceMeter system provides three signal terminals, namely Hi and Low terminals for the electrical measurement and the Guard terminal for the guard ring circuit. The two main signals were connected to the probe pads of the single SiNW devices, while the guard terminal was bonded to the backside of the samples to avoid any current leakage in the substrate.|$|R
