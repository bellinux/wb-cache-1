40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. Background: Dengue fever {{is the most common}} mosquito borne viral disease in the world. Its symptoms can be fairly nonspecific and most commonly include fever, rash, headache, and eye pain. Passive surveillance is currently the most prevalent method used to detect dengue cases in the United States. Identification of positive cases can be limited by the public’s awareness of the disease’s symptoms, barriers to healthcare seeking behavior, and by physician <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>laboratory</b> testing. Objective: This study sought to evaluate barriers to dengue reporting, as well as the patient‐ level factors that may limit the efficacy of passive surveillance of dengue in Key West, Florida. Methods: Cross‐sectional surveys were administered across Key West, FL. Subjects were asked if they had a recent fever, additional dengue symptoms, and whether they sought medical care for these symptoms. Also the hypothetical question was posed: would you seek medical care for a fever greater than 102 F? Responses were stratified according to patient characteristics and demographics. Results: In Key West, patient‐level factors that influenced the decision to seek medical care for a high fever were: having a specific doctor call when sick (p< 0. 006), health insurance status (p< 0. 037), and ethnicity (p< 0. 005). Additionally, barriers to dengue reporting were identified. The most impactful were the decision to seek medical care for symptoms consistent with dengue fever, and the doctor’s decision to administer confirmatory dengue laboratory tests. Only one person with a recent fever plus one additional classic dengue symptom received laboratory testing, and this was done outside of the United States. There were four individuals who met the current WHO clinical case definition for dengue, yet none were offered laboratory testing or were diagnosed with the disease. Conclusion: This study shows that both patients and doctors in Key West, Florida underestimate the potential for dengue when there are symptoms consistent with the disease. As such, it is certainly possible that there have been unreported cases in the country...|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{the present}} {{guidelines}} the assessment, by the Marine Institute {{on behalf of the}} Department of Communication, Marine and Natural Resources, of the suitability of dredged materials for disposal at sea had employed provisional action levels as an aid to evaluation. These provisional action levels were based entirely on sediment chemistry. The responsible agencies have decided that these levels now need to be updated and formalised. The approach proposed in this document aims to provide an improved, and more integrated, assessment of the ecological risks associated with individual sediment dredging and disposal activities. It offers flexibility to deal with issues on a case-by-case basis and improves transparency of the decision-making process. The list of parameters to be assessed has been revised and methods for setting numerical guidance values in other countries have been reviewed. Ideally, guidance levels should comprise chemical and ecotoxicological data specifically relating to Irish sediments. In the absence of a comprehensive dataset for Irish sediments, proposed threshold guidance levels have been based on ecotoxicological data from other sources. Wherever possible, lower threshold guidance values have been based on existing Irish background levels of contaminants. Where background data do not exist for a particular parameter, ecotoxicologically-derived values, corresponding to expected no-effect levels, have been taken from reputable sources. Similarly, upper threshold guidance levels (i. e. levels at which effects may be expected) have been based on ecotoxicological data from reputable sources. The assessment strategy has been designed so that decisions concerning the acceptability of sediments for sea disposal will take into account a range of intrinsic and environmental factors i. e. the strategy adopts a Weight of Evidence approach. The guidance will be reviewed and revised as necessary, as more information becomes available. Sampling and storage methodology is presented as well as quality assurance and reporting requirements.

40|$|Prostate cancer (CaP) {{metastasis}} to bone {{results in}} mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions {{associated with high}} morbidity and there is mounting evidence that the urokinase-type plasminogen (uPA) system is causatively involved in the progression of CaP. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising tools for cell-mediated gene therapy with the advantage of osteogenic potential, a critical issue {{in the case of}} osteolytic metastases. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic use of engineered murine MSCs for in vivo delivery of the uPA antagonist amino-terminal fragment (hATF) in order to impair osteolytic CaP cells progression in bone and to repair bone lesions. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) revealed that both primary MSCs (pMSCs) and MSC line C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 (C 3) expressing hATF (MSC-hATF) inhibited significantly intra-tibial PC- 3 -Luc growth following co-injection in SCID mice. Furthermore, micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging of vascular network clearly demonstrated a significant decrease of tumor-associated angiogenesis and a protection from tumor-induced osteolysis in MSC-hATF treated mice. Importantly, the osteogenic potential of MSC-hATF cells was unaffected and area of new bone formation was evidenced in 60 % of animals. Altogether, these data support the concept of MSC-based therapy of tumor osteolysis disease, indicating that MSCs may combine properties of vehicle for angiostatic agent with osteogenic potential. ______________________________________________________________________________ Author contributions: V.
