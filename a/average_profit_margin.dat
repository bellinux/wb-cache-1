40|$|I use a putty-clay {{technology}} to explain several asset market facts.

This model can help explain the empirical findings of Fama and French (1992), and more generally the sources of differences in market betas across firms. I obtain supporting evidence for the mechanism using firm- and industry-level data. The aggregate effect follows from trend growth: low-productivity plants outnumber high-productivity plants, making the aggregate stock market procyclical.

In view of the non-linearity and complexity of the problem, we used a genetic algorithm as optimization technique. For grain maize, our results showed that climate change will foster the use of irrigation, not only at sites prone to water limitation already under current climatic conditions, but more in general for climate change scenarios projecting a substantial decrease in summer precipitation. For winterwheat, irrigation was never identified as an optimal management option. For both crops and sites, climate change reduced the optimum nitrogen fertilization amount and decreased for winterwheat the number of fertilization applications. In all cases, the farmer’s certainty equivalent decreased between 7 % and 25 % under climate change, implying negative impacts on winterwheat and grain maize production even under the assumption of an adjustment of the optimum management practice...|$|R

We discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} various indicators of competition that are commonly used in the literature and explain why we use the aforementioned proxy 2 variables for the intensity of competition. The paper then provides a cross-country and cross-sector overview of the differences in these competition indicators for the period from 1999 to 2007 before empirically identifying the main determinants of these differences. We find large differences between individual sectors, while differences between countries are considerably smaller. <b>Profit</b> <b>margins</b> and concentration ratios are notably high in communications, finance, housing, and miscellaneous goods and services.

30|$|In {{our basic}} scenario, the {{decision}} model suggests aligning process variant 4 against the master process (Table  4). The submission of end customer information for those brokers who personally execute contract changes is then only possible in electronic form. The standardization of process variant 4 increases the risk-adjusted expected NPV {{of the process}} cash flows, because the positive effects on customer satisfaction and on the cost advantages of the electronic submission exceed the negative effects on the process demand. Relatively to the second best process variant profile of complete individuality, representing the broker pool’s status quo prior to BPS, the objective function increases by about 21, 018 EUR. Serving the fourth process context by the master process instead of the respective process variant reduces the context-specific demand by 5  % (Table  3, line 2), whereas the demand trend increases only marginally. As a result, the cumulative demand is larger for the status quo than for the standardization of process variant 4. However, the standardization directly increases the <b>average</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margin</b> of this context by 25  % (Table  3, lines 1 and 5). The cost advantages even accelerate over time due to experience curve effects. The net effect of the reduced process demand and the increased profit margin is positive and justifies the elimination of paper-based submission for brokers who personally execute contract changes.|$|E

A Cost-Benefit Analysis is {{claimed to be the}} most feasible approach to calculate the cost incurred in any employed usability technique, and the estimated return on investment (ROI) and benefits gained in the long run. This paper highlights two usability evaluation methods, namely Usability Testing and Heuristic Evaluation, which were employed to determine the most cost-effective approach based on a study for an online shopping website. The Usability Testing approach was conducted in context of the Common Industry Format for Reporting Usability Evaluation whilst the Heuristic Evaluation was conducted referring to Nielsen’s (1994) Discount Usability Engineering approach. As a result, the analysis parameter of Cost-Benefit Analysis for both usability evaluation studies were based on the elements employed in each method.

In 2009, a training and certification program was initiated to improve milk handling among milk traders who are the main conduits of milk being marketed in Assam. The impact of the program on milk value chain actors was assessed through a prospective matched cohort study using a double difference design.

Rapid diagnostic tests on milk samples were conducted to assess levels of hazards from presence of pathogens in milk traded in informal milk markets.

This paper seeks to fill this gap by empirically investigating business and financial characteristics, stakeholder pressures and public policies to distinguish companies that have implemented the European Eco-Management and Audit System (EMAS) from a unique firm-level dataset of European publicly quoted companies. We find that the EMAS participation decision is positively influenced by the solvency ratio, the share of non-current liabilities, the average labour cost and the absolute company size as well as the relative size of a company compared to its sector <b>average.</b> The <b>profit</b> <b>margin</b> exerts a negative influence. We further find that companies whose headquarters is located in a country that actively encourages EMAS have a higher probability of participation.
