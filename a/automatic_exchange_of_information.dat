The central argument presented is that the inequality problem {{is at the heart}} of rational asymmetric development between rich and poor countries. Piketty has shown that inequality increases when the return of capital is higher than the growth rate, because the poor cannot catch-up with the rich. We argue that, when the return of political economy (or capitalism-fuelled illicit capital flight) is higher than the growth rate in African countries, inequality in development increases and African may not catch-up with the developed world. As an ideal solution, Piketty has proposed progressive income taxation based on <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>information.</b> The ideal analogy proposed in tackling the spirit of African poverty is a holistic commitment to fighting illicit capital flight based on <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>information.</b> Hence, contrary to theoretical underpinnings of exogenous growth models, catch-up may not be so apparent.

40|$|Abstract. To date, the <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> product <b>information</b> be-tween {{business}} {{partners in a}} value chain is typically done using Business-to-Business (B 2 B) catalog standards such as EDIFACT, cXML, or BMEcat.

The advantage of the publication of rich product descriptions can be manifold, including better integration and <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> between Web applications, high-quality data along the various stages of the value chain, or the opportunity to support more precise and more effective searches.

This information is applied to the existing hardware and the integration possibilities of the various parts of the AIS transponder is investigated. The focus will be on two main transponder parts that are possible to replace with highly integrated circuits. The first of these parts is the so-called digital part where system-on-chip platforms for different technologies have been investigated with a special interest in a highly integrated FPGA implementation. The second part is the radio frequency receivers where alternatives to the existing superheterodyne receiver are discussed. The conclusion drawn is that there exist technologies for developing a highly integrated AIS transponder. An attractive highly integrated transponder could consist of a FPGA system-on-chip platform with subsampling digital receivers and additional components that are unsuitable for integration...|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} of tax harmonisation touched on a vital {{interest of the}} Grand Duchy. Wealth management remained the principal activity of the financial centre, even though other sectors such as management of investment funds were developing. However, considerations of confidentiality constituted the life of private banking. In negotiations on the European level, the Luxembourgish government demanded the maintenance of banking secrecy as long as its principal financial-service competitors maintained it as well. But this confidentiality {{should not be used}} for criminal activities. This was why the previous government had put through anti-money laundering legislation. The Juncker-Polfer government extended these measures to improve the effectiveness of the fight against fraud and economic and financial crime. In terms of tax harmonisation, the European summit of Feira in June 2000 was a way towards a compromise. An action plan with a deadline of 2010 was agreed. In January 2003 in Brussels. in an [...] "Economic and Financial affairs" [...] council meeting, the European Ministers for Finances and the Economy finally reached an agreement on the taxation of revenue from savings. The agreement stipulated that EU member states could choose between two models: information exchanges between tax administrations, or the introduction of a withholding tax with a progressive increase in the rate of revenue which, after a transition period, would reach 35% from 1 January 2011. The move to the generalised <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> was coupled to a similar action by third-party countries, including Switzerland.|$|E

The declaration was followed by a November 2014 statement by G20 leaders setting the principles on media ownership transparency.

40|$|Traditional {{tax control}} {{has proven to}} be an insufficiently {{effective}} means of verifying the overall real economic power of large taxpayers (multinational corporations and wealthy individuals). As compared to the increasing mobility of taxpayers, tax administration activities are limited by the territorial jurisdiction of the fiscal sovereignty. The crisis of public finances has forced many countries to focus on the prevention of tax evasion and aggressive tax planning, particularly in international tax matters. In this sense, the traditional forms of tax control are supplemented by some additional strategies which are to provide tax authorities with more data on tax payers' business operations, profit, income, expenses and property. In practice, some developed tax administrations already apply a number of specific measures: the disclosure <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about aggressive tax planning schemes, advance pricing agreement, advance tax rulings, the use of financial intermediaries in data exchange processes, improved taxation relations, <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>information,</b> etc. These specific measures are intended to help tax administrations to overcome the discrepancy between the information at their disposal and the information held by the taxpayers, which facilitates a more realistic assessment of tax liabilities.

The trend of intensive {{communication between the}} national tax administrations has been a political priority in economically developed countries. This area of international tax law has been subject to {{significant changes in the}} past few years. Countries are prompted to pursue the <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>information</b> by entering into multilateral treaties on the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>information</b> rather than engage in international <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>information</b> upon request by entering into bilateral agreements.

These developments are basically aimed at preventing different forms of international tax fraud which generate significant financial losses in the circumstances of current economic crisis. Such efforts may be justifiable regarding the interests of the countries of residence; but, what about the legal status of ordinary taxpayers who are now subject to a comprehensive and far-reaching control? The new concept may be appropriate for tracking tax fraud or embezzlement but what are its implications for law-abiding taxpayers? The national legislatures are obliged to provide for the protection <b>of</b> confidentiality <b>of</b> <b>exchanged</b> tax <b>information</b> but many states have not fully recognized the importance of providing adequate legal protection of sensitive personal and financial data. There are only a few countries whose legislations explicitly prescribe the taxpayers' right to be informed, the right to consult tax administration and the right to seek tax administration intervention as a form of legal protection in international <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>information.</b> The Serbian tax legislation does not envisage the obligation of tax authorities to notify the taxpayers about the request submitted by foreign tax authorities to provide some tax information.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new data acquisition standard for synthetic biology. This comprises the creation of a methodology that is designed to capture all the data, metadata, and protocol information associated with biopart characterization experiments. The new standard, called DICOM-SB, is based on the highly successful Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard in medicine. A data model is described which has been specifically developed for synthetic biology. The model is a modular, extensible data model for the experimental process, which can optimize data storage for large amounts of data. DICOM-SB also includes services orientated toward the <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> data and <b>information</b> between modalities and repositories. DICOM-SB has been developed in the context of systematic design in synthetic biology, which is based on the engineering principles of modularity, standardization, and characterization. The systematic design approach utilizes the design, build, test, and learn design cycle paradigm. DICOM-SB has been designed to be compatible with and complementary to other standards in synthetic biology, including SBOL. In this regard, the software provides effective interoperability. The new standard has been tested by experiments and data exchange between Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and Imperial College London...|$|R
