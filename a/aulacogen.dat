5|$|Oklahoma is the 20th-largest {{state in}} the United States, {{covering}} an area of 69,898 square miles (181,035km2), with 68,667 square miles (177,847km2) of land and 1,281 square miles (3,188km2) of water. It is one of six states on the Frontier Strip and lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas. Much of its border with Texas lies along the Southern Oklahoma <b>Aulacogen,</b> a failed continental rift. The geologic figure defines {{the placement of the}} Red River.|$|E
5|$|A mass {{of granite}} {{now in the}} Panamint Mountains intruded this complex 1400 mya. Pegmatic dikes and other widely spaced plutons of granite {{are also in the}} complex (a pluton is a large blob of magma deep {{underground}} and dikes are projections of that). Outcrops can be seen along the front of the Black Mountains in Death Valley and in the Talc and Ibex Hills. When the granite was being intruded, the west coast of North America ran through Eastern California and through an embayment that spread toward the Las Vegas Valley. This embayment, called the Amargosa <b>aulacogen,</b> had highlands north and south of it and {{was the result of a}} failed rift. Many thousands of feet of sediment filled the slowly subsiding basin.|$|E
25|$|A common {{explanation}} of the trough's formation {{is that it is}} an <b>aulacogen,</b> an abandoned arm of a three-armed radial rift system. The other two arms continued to spread during the break-up of Gondwana, as South America separated from Africa.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aulacogens</b> {{occur at}} failed rifts, where {{continental}} crust does not completely split. Similar to the lithospheric heating that occurs during {{the formation of}} passive margins, subsidence occurs due to heated lithosphere sagging as spreading occurs.

25|$|The faults {{responsible}} for the New Madrid Seismic Zone are embedded in a subsurface geological feature known as the Reelfoot Rift that formed during {{the breakup of the}} supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic Era (about 750 million years ago). The resulting rift system failed to split the continent, but has remained as an <b>aulacogen</b> (a scar or zone of weakness) deep underground, and its ancient faults appear to have made the Earth's crust in the New Madrid area mechanically weaker than {{much of the rest of}} North America.|$|E
25|$|The Bay of Fundy {{lies in a}} {{rift valley}} called the Fundy Basin; as the rift began to {{separate}} from mainland North America, volcanic activity occurred, forming volcanoes and flood basalts. These flood basalts poured out over the landscape, covering much of southern Nova Scotia. Sections of the flood basalts have been eroded away, but still form a basaltic mountain range known as North Mountain. As a result, much of the basin floor is made of tholeiitic basalts giving its brown color. The rift valley eventually failed (see <b>aulacogen)</b> as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge continued to separate North America, Europe, and Africa.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Mackenzie magmatic event, the Mackenzie hotspot collided with lithosphere that was already in an extensional regime that allowed rifting to occur. Passive rifting has been interpreted as the mechanism that produced the opening of the former Poseidon Ocean, the geometry of which would have been partly controlled by dike swarm geometry. Fahrig (1987) proposed that the Mackenzie plume impact resulted in the emplacement of a triple junction that had a large mafic dike swarm on every rift arm. Two of the first arms formed the Poseidon Ocean basin and the third arm failed thus forming an <b>aulacogen.</b> This tectonic setting suggestion can be comparable with the early volcano-tectonic evolution of the Yellowstone hotspot, which developed two arms instead of three, followed by failure of both arms. At the Mackenzie hotspot, rifting is considered to have been passive and to have taken place in the crust above the hotspot that should have been weakened by the Mackenzie plume. Crustal uplift may have also provided stresses contributing to rifting.|$|E
50|$|The ridge {{sits atop}} a {{geologic}} feature {{known as the}} Mid-Atlantic Rise, which is a progressive bulge that runs {{the length of the}} Atlantic Ocean, with the ridge resting on the highest point of this linear bulge. This bulge is thought to be caused by upward convective forces in the asthenosphere pushing the oceanic crust and lithosphere. This divergent boundary first formed in the Triassic period, when a series of three-armed grabens coalesced on the supercontinent Pangaea to form the ridge. Usually, only two arms of any given three-armed graben become part of a divergent plate boundary. The failed arms are called <b>aulacogens,</b> and the <b>aulacogens</b> of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge eventually became many of the large river valleys seen along the Americas and Africa (including the Mississippi River, Amazon River and Niger River). The Fundy Basin on the Atlantic coast of North America between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in Canada is evidence of the ancestral Mid-Atlantic Ridge.|$|R

500|$|Another {{round of}} uplift exposed the Beck Spring rocks and the {{underlying}} Crystal Spring to erosion; subsequent faster subsidence of the Amargosa <b>aulacogen</b> broke these formations into islands in later Proterozoic time.

This formation is prominent near Wildrose, Harrisburg Flats, and Butte Valley and is [...] thick.|$|E
50|$|Tectonic {{subsidence}} is {{the sinking}} of the Earth's crust on a large scale, relative to crustal-scale features or the geoid. The movement of crustal plates and accommodation spaces created by faulting create subsidence on a large scale in a variety of environments, including passive margins, <b>aulacogens,</b> fore-arc basins, foreland basins, intercontinental basins and pull-apart basins. Three mechanisms are common in the tectonic environments in which subsidence occurs: extension, cooling and loading.|$|R
30|$|Contrary to the {{evolution}} of the eastern North China Craton including thickening, thinning and destruction, the Ordos Basin has evolved from three Mesoproterozoic <b>aulacogens</b> to a Paleozoic–Mesozoic cratonic basin since the Middle Proterozoic (Menzies et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014 b). The interior part of the basin is characterized by horizontal or gently dipping strata (< 3 °), especially for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata, whereas the strata along the margins have been subjected to significant folding and faulting since the Late Triassic.|$|R

In a wide sense the Brasiliano orogeny includes also the Pampean orogeny. Almeida et al. coined the term Brasiliano Orogenic Cycle in 1973. The orogeny led to the closure of several oceans and <b>aulacogens</b> including the Adamastor Ocean, the Goianides Ocean, the Puncoviscana Ocean and the Peri-Franciscano Ocean.|$|R
500|$|Uplift {{eventually}} {{exposed the}} crystalline complex to erosion. Arkose conglomerate and mudstone {{of the lower}} Crystal Spring Formation were created from muddy debris derived from stream erosion of these uplands. A warm shallow sea spread over the area as the Amargosa <b>aulacogen</b> slowly subsided; thick sequences of lime-rich ooze with abundant colonies of algae called stromatolites were then laid down. Dolomite and limestone resulted, forming the middle part of the Crystal Spring Formation. The upper part was formed after silt and sand destroyed the algal mat, forming siltstone and sandstone. Laterally extensive diabase sills of molten rock later intruded {{above and below the}} carbonate rock layers; commercial grade talc was formed from thermal decay of carbonate rock at its contact with the lowest sill, which covers hundreds of square miles (many hundreds of km²). Today the formation is [...] thick.|$|E
50|$|The Southern Oklahoma <b>Aulacogen</b> extends roughly 500 {{miles long}} (805 km) by ~80-90 miles wide (129-145 km). The two {{remaining}} continental plate boundary {{arms of the}} triple junction from which the Southern Oklahoma <b>aulacogen</b> formed became spreading zones for the spreading of the Iapetus Ocean during {{the breakup of the}} supercontinent, Rodinia, estimated to have occurred in the Cryogenian Period, approximately 750 million years ago. These arms closed in the Pennsylvanian Period (~323.2 - 298.9 Ma) and formed part of the Ouachita orogenic belt. The Southern Oklahoma <b>Aulacogen</b> is estimated to contain over 250,000 km3 of igneous rock. The <b>aulacogen</b> is inverted: rather than extending across the surface it penetrates into the North American craton, and is aligned with the northern edge of a deeply buried Proterozoic basin of uncertain origin which may have formed through igneous layering or deposition. The <b>aulacogen</b> terminates on contact with the Ouachita orogenic belt. The Southern Oklahoma <b>Aulacogen</b> is associated with a widespread anomalous area in which seismic waves travel more slowly. A common comparison is drawn from this <b>aulacogen</b> to the Dniepr-Donets <b>Aulacogen</b> in Baltica because both are significant intracratonic rifts.|$|E

The Southern Oklahoma <b>Aulacogen</b> is primarily composed of basaltic dikes, gabbros, and units of granitic rock.|$|E
40|$|Comparison of MAGSAT scalar {{magnetic}} anomaly {{data to the}} main tectonic provinces and boundaries of South America reveals a number of geologic correlations. South America is divisible into a broad platform of Precambrian shields and cratons separated by Phanerozoic basins, grabens and <b>aulacogens</b> to the east, the Phanerozoic Patagonian Platform to the south, and the Mesozoic to Cenozoic Andean Fold Belt and Caribbean Mountain System {{to the west and}} north. The continental shields are mainly more magnetic then continental basins and orogenic belts. Cratons, mainly covered by younger sedimentary rocks, are generally associated with magnetic gradients. Most of the anomalies associated with the Patagonian Platform are positive and have higher amplitudes eastward away from the Andean Fold Belt. The northern Andes are coincident with positive magnetic anomalies, whereas the central and southern Andes are associated mainly with negative anomalies...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{anomalies}} of the South American continent {{are generally}} more positive and variable than the oceanic anomalies. There is better correlation between the magnetic anomalies and the major tectonic elements of the continents than between the anomalies and the main tectonic elements of the adjacent oceanic areas. Oceanic areas generally show no direct correlation to the magnetic anomalies. Precambrian continental shields are mainly more magnetic than continental basins and orogenic belts. Shields differ markedly from major <b>aulacogens</b> which are generally characterized by negative magnetic anomalies and positive gravity anomalies. The Andean orogenic belt shows rather poor correlation with the magnetic anomalies. The magnetic data exhibit instead prominent east-west trends, which although consistent with some tectonic features, {{may be related to}} processing noise derived from data reduction procedures to correct for external magnetic field effects. The pattern over the Andes is sufficiently distinct from the generally north trending magnetic anomalies occurring in the adjacent Pacific Ocean to separate effectively {{the leading edge of the}} South American Plate from the Nazea Plate. Eastern South America is characterized by magnetic anomalies which commonly extend across the continental margin into the Atlantic Ocean...|$|R
40|$|From a {{geological}} perspective, hydrogen {{has been}} neglected. It {{is not as}} common as biogenic or thermogenic methane, which are ubiquitous in hydrocarbon basins, or carbon dioxide, which is common in geologically active areas of the world. Nevertheless, small flows of hydrogen naturally reach the Earth’s surface, occur in some metal mines and emerge beneath the oceans {{in a number of}} places worldwide. These occurrences of hydrogen are associated with abiogenic and biogenic methane, nitrogen and helium. Five geological environments are theoretically promising for exploration based on field, palaeofluid and theoretical evidence: ophiolites (Alpine, Variscan and Caledonian in order of decreasing prospectivity), thinned-crust basins (failed-arm rifts, <b>aulacogens),</b> potash-bearing basins, basement in cratonic areas and the Mid-Atlantic ridge and its fracture zones. The subsurface areas of these environments are relatively poorly known, compared to hydrocarbon basins. Hydrogen shows may indicate larger reserves in the subsurface, in a similar way to the beginnings of hydrocarbon exploration in the 19 th century. The main source of hydrogen is ultramafic rocks, which have experienced serpentinization, although other generation processes have been identified, including biogenic production of hydrogen during very early stages of maturation and radiolysis. There are two main tectonic settings where serpentinization has operated. The main accessible onshore areas are where ophiolites are found tectonically emplaced within fold belts. Potentially much larger investigation areas lie in the subsurface of some ophiolites. These areas generally lie outside hydrocarbon provinces. However, where thrusting has emplaced ophiolites over a hydrocarbon-bearing foreland basin, tests involving sub-thrust conventional hydrocarbon exploration plays could also be employed to search for hydrogen. The other main tectonic setting is in highly extended basins, for example failed rifts or <b>aulacogens,</b> where thick sediments overlie thinned or absent crust above probably serpentinized mantle. These structures occur offshore on continental margins and extend onshore into long-lived rifts which have been reactivated and rejuvenated repeatedly. Conventional seismic reflection data are already available in these areas, but deep subsurface resolution is poor where there are extensive volcanic rocks. Analogues of these occurrences are also found in the deep oceans, along the mid-ocean ridges and offsetting transform faults. Here, thin crust and faulting may facilitate serpentinization of the mantle rocks by seawater ingress. Further research should aim to identify the extent of the hydrogen flux and its probable dominant role in the abiogenic production of hydrocarbons in Precambrian times, a natural process now largely replaced by biogenic participation. A similar industrial process replicates serpentinization, producing hydrogen and ultimately liquid hydrocarbons on a commercial scale in some countries. It remains to be proved whether a contribution from exploration can be made to any future hydrogen economy...|$|R
50|$|The Southern Oklahoma <b>Aulacogen</b> {{is located}} in southwestern Oklahoma and extends into northeastern Texas. The Southern Oklahoma <b>Aulacogen</b> is a failed rift zone that was active during the Early Cambrian during {{the breakup of the}} supercontinent Rodinia and the opening of the Iapetus Ocean.

40|$|AbstractRecent ICDP {{drilling}} and deep basin volcanic exploration of 3000 m {{below the surface}} in the Songliao Basin (SB) have highlighted the 3 -D delineation of the basin. The integrated new data led us to reevaluate the basin tectonics, for which the basin type, basin evolution {{and a number of}} geodynamic aspects have been controversial topics. We outline the position of a main lithospheric scale detachment fault beneath the SB, based on apparent crustal scale displacements, Moho breaks, the thinning of the Moho transition zone beneath the SB and the changing mantle thickness. This fault interpretation is consistent with simple shear as the rift mechanism. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the tectonic setting, underlying crust, structural style, sequence stratigraphy, subsidence history and volcanism, we propose an active continental margin model for the SB which shows some similarities to <b>aulacogens</b> but also notable differences. Situated between two Late Mesozoic active continental margins, the northern/northwestern Mongol–Okhotsk and the eastern Sikhote-Alin orogenic belts, the Cretaceous basin evolved on a pre-Triassic structurally weak basement mosaic. Its development began with regional mega-rifting from 150 to 105 Ma, followed by significant sagging between 105 and 79. 1 Ma and ended with regional uplift and basin inversion from 79. 1 to 64 Ma. Three regional angular unconformities separate the basin fill into three respective tectono-stratigraphic sequences. (1) The syn-rift stage is characterized by widespread fault-bounded grabens and volcanogenic successions, corresponding upward to the Huoshiling, Shahezi and Yingcheng Formations. (2) The post-rift stage includes the Denglouku, Quantou, Qignshankou, Yaojia and Nenjiang Formations. It is a special feature that the subsidence rate is abnormally high (mean of 103 m/Ma), and that flood basalt erupted along an axial wrench fault zone, associated with several marine intervals from the mid-Turonian to early Campanian (K 2 qn to K 2 n), possibly (not certainly) indicating incipient sea floor spreading characterized by Moho breaks along the basin axis in the SB around 88 Ma. Stretching stopped abruptly at approximately 79. 1 Ma and was followed by uplift and rapid erosion (− 145 m/Ma). (3) Recorded by the Sifangtai and Mingshui Formations the structural inversion stage included a continuous depocenter migration to the northwest. The basin was shrinking to demise as a result of changing subduction parameters of the Pacific subduction zone. In addition to the three tectonic basin cycles, a cyclic basin fill pattern exists with three volcanic basin fill intervals of Huoshiling, Yingcheng, and upper Qingshankou Formations that alternate with sedimentary basin fill intervals of Shahezi, Dengloukou-Quantou, and Yaojia-Nenjiang Formations. When determining the subsidence rates, we observed not only anomalously fast subsidence but also found an intricate link between the subsidence rate and type of basin fill. After each volcanic interval, the subsidence rates increased in a cyclic fashion during the sedimentary intervals. Thus, there is a system of three different types of important, basin-wide geological cycles that controlled the evolution of the SB. The subsidence rate was especially high (up to 199 m/Ma) after the last volcanic episode at 88 Ma. In addition to thermal subsidence and loading by the basin fill as causative processes, we also consider magmatic processes related to asthenospheric upwelling beneath the SB. They involve the roof collapse of shallow, depleted magma chambers, the igneous accretion of initially hot, dense, basic rocks, and lithospheric delamination beneath the SB. The difference in the subsidence rates during the volcanic and sedimentary intervals may in part also have been due to heating-related uplift during the volcanic intervals. The particularly high subsidence during the Late Cretaceous sedimentary cycles was partly increased by transtension. We put forward a general model for active continental margin basins. They are generally similar to <b>aulacogens</b> but display the following differences. In active continental margin basins, rifting depends on the subduction parameters that may cause strong to mild extension in the giant marginal region. The geochemical composition of the volcanic rocks is more calc-alkaline in nature because they are suprasubduction-related. These basins will eventually enter a post-rift sag stage that involves thermal subsidence. However, the basin will still be near an active continental margin, and, thus, some dip- and/or strike-slip faulting may occur coevally, depending on the subduction parameters. Sag cycles in active continental margin basins will likely include volcanism. Basin inversion will after all affect active continental margin basins. Such basins strike parallel to the respective continental margin. Thus, basin inversion by subduction/collision may be more intense than in the case of <b>aulacogens,</b> which do not tend to strike parallel to the continental margin. Basin inversion may also precede a collision due to changing subduction parameters. Subsidence behavior may also differ because many aspects of subsidence may be at work. Subsidence curves in active continental margin basins may be fairly individual. The application of our model only requires settings with the presence of one Pacific margin type...|$|R
40|$|Earthquake-induced {{liquefaction}} features, including large sand blows, occur near Marianna, Arkansas, about 75 km {{southwest of}} Memphis, Tennessee, and 80 km {{south of the}} southwest-ern end of the New Madrid seismic zone. The Marianna sand blows formed between 5, 000 and 7, 000 years ago and predate paleoearthquakes attributed to the New Madrid seismic zone. The Marianna sand blows are similar in size to New Madrid sand blows, suggesting that they too formed {{as a result of}} very large earthquakes but were centered near Marianna and outside the New Madrid seismic zone. A large sand blow that formed about 3500 B. C. (5, 500 years B. P.) may correlate with smaller sand blows to the northeast and southwest up to 175 km away. A compound sand blow that formed about 4800 B. C. (6, 800 years B. P.) may have formed as the result of several very large, closely timed earthquakes. A fault zone associated with the east-ern Reelfoot Rift margin seems the most likely source of large Middle Holocene earthquakes because of its great length (~ 300 km), history of seismic activity, Late Wisconsin–Early Holocene fault movement in western Tennessee, and structural relation-ship to the New Madrid fault system. Additional study is needed to verify our initial findings, to identify the earthquake source, and to further define the earthquake potential of the Marianna area. If the eastern Reelfoot Rift margin were confirmed to be the source of Middle Holocene earthquakes near Marianna, seismicity would appear to vary in space and time within the Reelfoot Rift system. This would have important hazard impli-cations for currently aseismic faults of the rift system and pos-sibly of other <b>aulacogens</b> embedded in intraplate regions...|$|R
40|$|Hicks Dome is a mineralized {{intrusive}} {{center of}} alkaline ultramafic dikes, plugs and diatreme breccias that produced 1200 m of structural doming of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in southeastern Illinois.

The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of biotite and hornblende from igneous rocks throughout the region has consistently produced crystallization ages of 270 +/- 2 Ma (Early-Middle Permian). Hicks Dome lies near the intersection of two <b>aulacogens,</b> the Reelfoot Rift and the Rough Creek Graben. The igneous rocks in the Hicks Dome area range from dark-green, porphyritic dikes, through dikes with pelletal lapilli, to carbonate cemented breccias with country rock fragments and, locally, phenocrysts or xenocrysts and pelletal lapilli. Magmatic minerals include diopside, pargasite, phlogopite-biotite, titanomagnetite, ilmenite, and apatite, as well as carbonate (ferroan-dolomite - ankerite and calcite) of possible magmatic origin. This mineral assemblage only partly corresponds with other occurrences in the middle Mississippi Valley region igneous province as melilite, garnet, olivine, and perovskite were not identified in the Hicks Dome samples. The Hicks Dome igneous lithotype is defined here as a minette, a type of calc-alkaline lamprophyre. Evidence for this classification includes abundant Al-rich phlogopite-biotite, diopside, and pargasite, and the absence of melilite, garnet, and perovskite. Additionally, plotted Al 2 O 3 vs. TiO 2 compositions of biotite-phlogopite form a trend subparallel to that of minettes and alnöites, and Al vs. Ti values for most clinopyroxenes fall in the minette field.

40|$|Geological and paleomagnetic {{data support}} the {{hypothesis}} that a Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent, referred to as Columbia, existed before the formation of Rodinia. This pre-Rodinia supercontinent was assembled along global-scale 2. 1 - 1. 8 Ga collisional orogens and contained almost all of Earth's continental blocks. Following its final assembly at ∼ 1. 8 Ga, the supercontinent Columbia underwent long-lived (1. 8 - 1. 3 Ga), subduction-related growth via accretion at key continental margins, forming a 1. 8 - 1. 3 Ga large magmatic accretionary belt along the present-day southern margin of North America, Greenland and Baltica. It includes the 1. 8 - 1. 7 Ga Yavapai, Central Plains and Makkovikian Belts, 1. 7 - 1. 6 Ga Mazatzal and Labradorian Belts, 1. 5 - 1. 3 Ga St. Francois and Spavinaw Belts and 1. 3 - 1. 2 Ga Elzevirian Belt in North America; the 1. 8 - 1. 7 Ga Ketilidian Belt in Greenland; and the 1. 8 - 1. 7 -Transscandinavian Igneous Belt, 1. 7 - 1. 6 Ga Kongsberggian-Gothian Belt, and 1. 5 - 1. 3 Ga Southwest Sweden Granitoid Belt in Baltica. Other cratonic blocks also underwent marginal outgrowth at about the same time. In South America, a 1. 8 - 1. 3 Ga accretionary zone occurs along the western margin of the Amazonia Craton, represented by the Rio Negro, Juruena and Rondonian Belts. In Australia, 1. 8 - 1. 5 Ga accretionary magmatic belts, including the Arunta, Mt. Isa, Georgetown, Coen and Broken Hill Belts, occur surrounding the southern and eastern margins of the North Australia Craton and the eastern margin of the Gawler Craton. In China, a 1. 8 - 1. 4 Ga accretionary magmatic zone, called the Xiong'er belt (Group), extends along the southern margin of the North China Craton. Fragmentation of this supercontinent began about 1. 6 Ga ago, associated with continental rifting along the western margin of Laurentia (Belt-Purcell Supergroup), southern margin of Baltica (Telemark Supergroup), southeastern margin of Siberia (Riphean <b>aulacogens),</b> northwestern margin of South Africa (Kalahari Copper Belt), and northern margin of North China (Zhaertai-Bayan Obo Belt). The fragmentation corresponded with widespread anorogenic magmatic activity, forming anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite-granite (AMCG) suites in North America, Baltica, Amazonia and North China, and continued until the final breakup of the supercontinent at about 1. 3 - 1. 2 Ga, marked by the emplacement of the 1. 27 Ga MacKenzie and 1. 24 Ga Sudbury mafic dike swarms in North America. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Crustal rupture {{structures}} reactivated in {{the course}} of the tectonic history of northern Mexico are the surface expressions of planes of weakness, in the form of simple or composite rectilinear features or slightly curved, defined as lineaments. Unless otherwise defined as strike-slip faults, lineaments are part of parallel and sub-parallel oblique convergent or oblique divergent tectonic zones cross cutting the Sierra Madre Occidental and northern Mexico, in a NW trend. These shear zones are the response to the oblique subduction of the Farallon plate beneath North America. ^ Kinematic analysis of five selected sites in northern Mexico, three basins and two compressional shear zones, proved possible a combination of shear mechanism diagram and models from analogue materials, with satellite imagery and geographic information systems, as an aid to define strike-slip fault motion. This was done using a reverse engineering process by comparing geometries. One of the sites assessed, involving the Parras Basin, Coahuila Block (CB), San Marcos fault, a postulated PBF- 1 fault, allowed for palinpastic reconstruction of the CB that corroborated the results of the vector motion defined, in addition to an extension of ∼ 25 % in a northwest southeast direction. ^ A GIS-based compilation and georeferenced regional structural studies by several researchers were used as ground control areas (GCA); their interpolation and interpretation, resulted in a tectonic framework map of northern Mexico. In addition, shaded relief models overlaid by the lineaments / fault layer allowed structural analyses of basins related to these major structures. Two important results were obtained from this study: the Tepehuanes-San Luis-fault (TSL) and the Guadalupe fault, named herein, displaces the Villa de Reyes graben, and the Aguascalientes graben, respectively, to the SE, confirming their left lateral vector motion; afterwards TSL was displaced south by the right lateral strike slip Taxco-San Miguel de Allende fault. The second result refers to the hypothesis that the Mesa Central was brought to its present location by a subduction zone located to the north. This subduction zone coincides with several researchers who postulated the idea. The compressional zones refer to segments of the Sinforosa and a postulated Aquinquari fault located in the stratotectonic Guerrero Terrane regarded as a highly mineralized zone. ^ Negative anomalies near - 200 milligals are strongly suggestive of a cratonic block identified in western Chihuahua, it being named the Western Chihuahua Cratonic Block (WCCB). In the southwestern portion of the North American craton the age provinces are well documented, but the block versus mobile belt idea has not been put forth or emphasized. The present study combines data of several types, sedimentological, structural, igneous geochemistry, and geochronologic data to evaluate this behavior in SW NA, and the proposed block is tested against these data. The presence of the WCCB is supported by a wide variety of data. ^ Basins, troughs, <b>aulacogens,</b> bimodal volcanism, and other rift and rift shoulder features, characterize the spatially constrained mobile belts. Mobile belts surrounding the WCCB contain geologic records of the events going back to 1. 4 Ga, with different aspects being dominant over geologic time. Mobile belts will participate in compression,(subduction), extension (rifting), and transform (lateral) faulting. The WCCB may have been derived from closely, adjacent, North American craton by mobile belt action. ^ This study has shown that integration of data is essential, because allows detection of differences in hypotheses for the same event in the same area. This integration capability is what makes integrated geographic information systems a powerful tool, not only for their synergy, but because they can be combined with specific techniques that provide data before going to conduct fieldwork. ^ Whether the issue of defining the tectonic framework of northern Mexico can be resolved or not, depends on the viability of integrating volumes of data from research, hypotheses, or maps, and put together under the same geographic frame. ...|$|R

The main purpose of this investigation is to define the main stages of the structural and tectonic development of the study area. Sedimentary basin {{analysis is}} a geologic method by which {{the history of a}} sedimentary basin is revealed, by analyzing the sediment fill itself. The results show the formation of sedimentation depocenters, the formation of barrier reefs and other features of a sedimentary basin. According to this analysis several sedimentatary complexes were distinguished: Middle Ordovician-Lower Devonian, Middle Devonian-Sargaevskiy, Domanic-Tournaisian, Middle Visean-Lower Permian, Lower Permian, Upper Permian. Middle Ordovician-Lower Devonian. Paleostructural surface of this oil and gas complex (OGC) have a complicated structure. In {{the central part of the}} study area is situated a large paleo-high bounded from the west, north and east by several deep depressions. Northern and eastern depressions in Ordovician time perhaps originated as <b>aulacogens</b> formed by deep faults. Analysis of the thickness map allowed identifying three depocenters. It should be noted that in the Middle Ordovician-Early Devonian time there are two types of sedimentation. During the Early Ordovician and the first half of the Middle Ordovician terrigenous sedimentation prevailed (Severo-Zapadnaya- 202 and B Ugrinskaya wells). During the Late Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian terrigenous sedimentation type changes to carbonate. Middle Devonian-Sargaevskiy. Paleostructural surface of this complex contrasts with the previous one. In the Early and Middle Devonian tectonic structural alteration of the surface happened. West depression in all probability was filled with deposits of Ordovician-Devonian and the end of time is formed by a large high, the central part of which is land. The eastern depression was significantly reduced in size. Two depressions in the Varandey-Azdvinskaya and Severo-Preduralskaya areas were separated by large arched high, the southern part of which was perhaps located outside of sedimentation area. The rest of the territory is a monocline, gradually deepening in the north-east. Analysis of the thickness map allowed identifying three depoeenters. It should be noted that the formation of is OGC was in two stages: regressive and transgressive. Domanic-Tournasian. Paleostructural surface varies slightly. Western part of the study area is still a monocline complicated by two small uplifts. The eastern part has undergone tectonic reconstruction. The result is a large, complex depression, divided in the northern part by the small uplift. Analysis of the thickness map allows identification of only one sedimentation depoeenter, located in the land area of the Timan-Pechora Basin Province. Only the northern end of Domanic depression shows marine sedimentaion. D 3 fr-D 3 fm time is characterized by the accumulation of carbonate-terrigenous sediments, which by the end of early Famennian fill the Domanic depression. In the shallow-water part of the shelf, the carbonate phase of sedimentation begins. In the land area of the Timan-Pechora Basin Province reef rock and biostromes were formed. Lower-Middle Visean. Tectonic reorganization divided the study area into two parts: a large uplift was elevated in the west and south-west part while in the east and north-east part shallow depression with marine type of sedimentation was formed. Middle Visean-Lower Permian. Paleostructural surface is characterized by the development of major depression in the central part of the study area. Depression is complicated by two cavities. In the south-west and south-east of the study area two major uplifts were formed. Late Visean is characterized by transgressive stage of development. Marine type of sedimentation covers the whole territory. Two depoeenter of sedimentation were formed; one in the central part of the territory, the other - outside the study area. In both depoeenters accumulation of terrigenous or carbonate-terrigenous sediments is possible. Early Permian period is characterized by calm tectonic conditions and, therefore, carbonate type of sedimentation. Lower Permian. Paleostructural surface changes. Artinskian-Kungurian time is characterized by a sharp shallowing marine basin, evidenced by small power complex. Relatively deep sea is preserved only in the east area. Accumulation of terrigenous (clay) material represent the type of sedimentation Upper Permian. Paleostructural surface is characterized by fragmentation of the tectonic area, affected by several major fault zones, which formed depressions and uplifts. Based on this, we can assume that this proess represent a fundamental tectonic reorganization, which controlled the sedimentation in the basin. The tectonics caused change in the type of sedimentation. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.
