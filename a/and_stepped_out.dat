5|$|Smith {{was known}} for his direct {{approach}} to game journalism and scathing criticism of the video game industry. During his time at 1UP the site developed a greater profile <b>and</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> of its sister publication's shadow, but Smith grew frustrated with the contemporary state of gaming news and what he considered manipulation of journalists and readers into accepting promotional material as news. In April 2007 he left 1UP to become a Bungie writer and co-host of the developer's podcast.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} {{minutes of the}} game, {{it seemed that the}} game would live up to the hype. On the opening kickoff, 49ers rookie kick {{returner}} Derrick Harmon caught the ball too close to the sidelines <b>and</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> of bounds at the San Francisco 6-yard line. The 49ers managed to advance to the 41-yard line but were forced to punt, and Dolphins defensive back Fulton Walker returned the punt 9 yards to the Miami 36-yard line. Then on their first play of the drive, Marino completed a 25-yard pass to Tony Nathan. Five plays later, Miami reached the San Francisco 23-yard line. But on third down, 49ers cornerback Eric Wright tackled wide receiver Mark Clayton 2 yards shy of the first down. Miami had to settle for a 37-yard field goal from Uwe von Schamann.|$|E
25|$|At 9:30 pm, Donohoe and Ryan {{entered the}} car park of the Lordship Credit Union {{premises}} and they parked, as did another {{car that was}} accompanying them from another credit union branch. They both parked beside the car belonging to officials from Lordship. At this point a navy-blue coloured Volkswagen Passat - that had been waiting stationary on the hard shoulder of the road - drove across the road and blocked the entrance. Four members of the gang were hiding behind a wall surrounding the car park, all wearing balaclavas, while a fifth was driving the car. Two gang members approached the detectives' car from the rear, and as Donohoe opened his door <b>and</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> to investigate why the car had blocked the entrance, he was instantly shot at close range {{in the back of}} the head with a long barrelled shotgun by a masked raider. A single shot was fired. It was dark, and before Ryan could realise what was taking place he was held at gunpoint and ordered out of his car and onto the ground by a number of gang members possessing a shotgun, handgun and a hammer. Neither officer had time to draw their weapons. The raiders then broke into a car belonging to credit union staff from Lordship, threatening them, which was carrying cash and cheques to the value of about €40,000, but only took a bag with €4,000, mistakenly leaving behind more than €30,000. Ryan and the credit union staff were left physically uninjured as the gang of five fled the scene, but Ryan was dispossessed of his car keys in an attempt to hinder his reaction. It was only after the perpetrators had escaped that the alarm could be raised.|$|E

Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, <b>and</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
