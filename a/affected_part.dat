25|$|Raynaud syndrome, {{also known}} as Raynaud's phenomenon, is a medical {{condition}} in which spasm of arteries cause episodes of reduced blood flow. Typically the fingers, and less commonly the toes, are involved. Rarely, the nose, ears, or lips are affected. The episodes result in the <b>affected</b> <b>part</b> turning white and then blue. Often, there is numbness or pain. As blood flow returns, the area turns red and burns. The episodes typically last minutes, but can last up to several hours.|$|E

25|$|Thrombosis {{may occur}} in veins (venous {{thrombosis}}) or in arteries. Venous thrombosis leads to congestion of the <b>affected</b> <b>part</b> of the body, while arterial thrombosis (and rarely severe venous thrombosis) affects {{the blood supply}} and leads to damage of the tissue supplied by that artery (ischemia and necrosis). A piece of either an arterial or a venous thrombus can break off as an embolus which can travel through the circulation and lodge somewhere else as an embolism. This type of embolism {{is known as a}} thromboembolism. Complications can arise when a venous thromboembolism (commonly called a VTE) lodges in the lung as a pulmonary embolism. An arterial embolus may travel further down the affected blood vessel where it can lodge as an embolism.|$|E
25|$|The Seal of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine {{is based}} on a coin of Selinus struck in 466 BC which was {{designed}} by the sculptor and medallist Allan Gairdner Wyon FRBS RMS (1882-1962). It shows two Greek gods associated with health - Apollo, the god of prophecy, music and medicine, and his sister Artemis, goddess of hunting and chastity, and comforter of women in childbirth - in a horse-drawn chariot. Artemis is driving while her brother the great archer is shooting arrows. The fruitful date palm was added to indicate the tropical activities of the School but also has a close connection with Apollo and Artemis: when their mother Leto gave birth to them on the island of Delos, miraculously a palm sprang up to give her shade in childbirth. Asclepius, Apollo's son, was the god of ancient Greek medicine, and was frequently shown holding a staff entwined with a snake. Snakes were used in this healing cult to lick the <b>affected</b> <b>part</b> of the patient. Significantly Asclepius' daughters were Hygeia (the goddess of health) and Panacea (the healer of all ailments). Asclepius' staff with a snake coiled round it (known {{as a symbol of the}} medical professions) was placed at the base of the seal to emphasise the medical interests of the School. The Seal was redesigned in 1990 by Russell Sewell Design Associates, and is retained today within the current School logo.|$|E

500|$|The 2004 Indian Ocean {{earthquake}} was an undersea megathrust {{earthquake that}} on 26 December 2004, with an epicentre off {{the west coast}} of Sumatra, Indonesia, which triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean. Nagapattinam district was the most <b>affected</b> <b>part</b> in Tamil Nadu, accounting for 6,064 off the 8,009 casualties in the state.

500|$|Vascular malformations in {{the lungs}} may cause a number of problems. The lungs {{normally}} [...] "filter out" [...] bacteria and blood clots from the bloodstream; AVMs bypass the capillary network of the lungs and allow these to migrate to the brain, where bacteria may cause a brain abscess and blood clots may lead to stroke. HHT {{is the most common}} cause of lung AVMs: out of all people found to have lung AVMs, 70–80% are due to HHT. Bleeding from lung AVMs is relatively unusual, but may cause hemoptysis (coughing up blood) or hemothorax (blood accumulating in the chest cavity). Large vascular malformations in the lung allow oxygen-depleted blood from the right ventricle to bypass the alveoli, meaning that this blood does not have an opportunity to absorb fresh oxygen. This may lead to breathlessness. Large AVMs may lead to platypnea, difficulty in breathing that is more marked when sitting up compared to lying down; this probably reflects changes in blood flow associated with positioning. Very large AVMs cause a marked inability to absorb oxygen, which may be noted by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the lips and skin), clubbing of the fingernails (often encountered in chronically low oxygen levels), and a humming noise over the <b>affected</b> <b>part</b> of the lung detectable by stethoscope.|$|E

2500|$|Synchiria {{is a form}} of dyschiria {{in which}} a {{stimulus}} applied {{to one side of the}} body is felt on both sides. [...] Synchiria has sensory, motor, and introspective signs. [...] The sensory component refers to a stimulus applied to the <b>affected</b> <b>part</b> evokes two simultaneous sensations which are referred to the corresponding points on both sides of the body. [...] The motor symptom is when a patient is asked to carry out movement on affected side he does so on both sides though in doing so he gets only the feeling of sidedness of the <b>affected</b> <b>part.</b> [...] The introspective component shows that a patient is unable to appreciate the affected feeling of sidedness alone apart from the simultaneously appreciated feeling of the corresponding opposite side though he can appreciate it when he moves both limbs together under the impression that he is moving only the affected one.|$|E
2500|$|First, {{nociception}} is required.

2500|$|Achiria is {{referred}} to as simple allochiria and is the term proposed to show the failure to regard feelings of sidedness or handedness. [...] Achiria has sensory, motor, and introspective components. [...] For the sensory achiria, a stimulus applied to the <b>affected</b> <b>part</b> arouses no feeling of sidedness. [...] The stimulus is presented {{to the side of the}} body that the person with the disorder has no notion. [...] For the motor component, if a patient is asked to carry out any movement with the limb in question he is unable to do so unless is indicated in some other way than by the use of the words right and left. [...] Reason for this is that he has lost the knowledge of the meaning of these words either altogether or at all events when they are applied to limbs concerned. [...] For the introspective component a patient loses memory for feeling of part of the body that the stimulus is presented and declares that though he knows he has a part he cannot feel it.|$|E
60|$|III. Sectura Pantalunae, or Ripping of the Trousers, is {{generally}} caused by sitting upon warm beeswax or {{leaning against a}} hook. In {{the case of the}} very young it is not unfrequently accompanied by a distressing suppuration of the shirt. This, however, is not remarked in adults. The malady is rather mental than bodily, the mind of the patient being racked by a keen sense of indignity and a feeling of unworthiness.

The youth's life being in danger, Mackenzie once more tried his skill. He applied to it a poultice of bark stripped from the roots of the spruce fir, having first washed the wound with the juice of the bark. This proved to be a very painful dressing, but it cleaned the wound effectually. He then cut off the pendent thumb, and applied a dressing of salve composed of Canadian balsam, wax, and tallow dropped from a burning candle into the water. As before, the treatment was successful, insomuch that the young red-skin was soon in the hunting-field again, and brought an elk's tongue as a fee to his benefactor.|$|E
6000|$|The spiritual {{theory in}} some places is mixed up with the [...] "like to like" [...] theory, and the magical stones are found where the spirits have been heard twittering and whistling. [...] "A large stone lying {{with a number of}} small ones under it, like a sow among her sucklings, was good for a childless woman."(1) It is the savage belief that stones {{reproduce}} their species, a belief consonant with the general theory of universal animation and personality. The ancient belief that diamonds gendered diamonds is a survival from these ideas. [...] "A stone with little disks upon it was good to bring in money; any fanciful interpretation of a mark was enough to give a character to the stone and its associated Vui" [...] or spirit in Melanesia. In Scotland, stones shaped like various parts of the human body are expected to cure the diseases with which these members may be afflicted. [...] "These stones were called by the names of the limbs which they represented, as 'eye-stone,' 'head-stone'." [...] The patient washed the <b>affected</b> <b>part</b> of the body, and rubbed it well with the stone corresponding.(2) ...|$|E
6000|$|The ancients knew {{mandragora}} and the superstitions {{connected with}} it very well. Dioscorides mentions mandragorus, or antimelon, or dircaea, or Circaea, {{and says the}} Egyptians call it apemoum, and Pythagoras 'anthropomorphon.' In digging the root, Pliny says, 'there are some ceremonies observed, first they that goe about this worke, look especially to this that the wind be not in their face, but blow upon their backs. Then with {{the point of a}} sword they draw three circles round about the plant, which don, they dig it up afterwards with their face unto the west.' Pliny says nothing of the fetich qualities of the plant, as credited in modern and mediaeval Germany, but mentions 'sufficient it is with some bodies to cast them into sleep with the smel of mandrago.' This is like Shakespeare's 'poppy and mandragora, and all the drowsy syrups of the world.' Plato and Demosthenes {146a} also speak of mandragora as a soporific. It is more to the purpose of magic that Columella mentions 'the half-human mandragora.' Here we touch the origin of the mandrake superstitions. The roots have a kind of fantastic resemblance to the human shape; Pliny describes them as being 'of a fleshy substance and tender.' Now {{it is one of the}} recognised principles in magic, that things like each other, however superficially, affect each other in a mystic way, and possess identical properties. Thus, in Melanesia, according to Mr. Codrington, {146b} 'a stone in the shape of a pig, of a bread-fruit, of a yam, was a most valuable find,' because it made pigs prolific, and fertilised bread-fruit trees and yam-plots. In Scotland, too, 'stones were called by the names of the limbs they resembled, as [...] "eye-stane," [...] "head-stane." [...] A patient washed the <b>affected</b> <b>part</b> of his body, and rubbed it well with the stone corresponding.' {147a} In precisely the same way, the mandrake root, being thought to resemble the human body, was credited with human and superhuman powers. Josephus mentions {147b} a plant 'not easily caught, which slips away from them that wish to gather it, and never stands still' till certain repulsive rites are performed. These rites cannot well be reported here, but they are quite familiar to Red Indian and to Bushman magic. Another way to dig the plant spoken of by Josephus is by aid of the dog, as in the German superstition quoted from Grimm. AElian also recommends the use of the dog to pluck the herb aglaophotis, which shines at night. {147c} When the dog has dragged up the root, and died of terror, his body is to be buried on the spot with religious honours and secret sacred rites.|$|E
