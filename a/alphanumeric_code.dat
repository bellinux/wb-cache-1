The program will not work after the deadline without the 24-character product key. The product key used to activate a copy of Norton Internet Security ties in with an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code</b> based on a computer's hardware configuration. Users may activate their product five times with the same product key, however licensing terms dictate users are allowed only to install Norton Internet Security 2004 on one computer.|$|E
5|$|Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and {{the game}} ends {{immediately}} if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code</b> for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues {{as to what the}} player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien language.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis {{married in}} 1977. Soon after, {{while living in}} Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft. When they began work on Ravenloft, they felt the vampire {{archetype}} had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it {{with a group of}} players every Halloween for five years before it was published in 1983 by TSR. The plot combined elements of the horror genre with Dungeons & Dragons conventions for the first time. At the time of Ravenlofts release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code</b> indicating the series to which it belonged. Ravenloft was labeled I6: the sixth in a series of intermediate-level modules for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). It consisted of a 32-page book, with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>coding</b> {{began to}} appear on Japanese and European {{vehicles}} beginning in the mid 1970s, while North American vehicles used names for vehicles, such as Mustang, Torino, Impala, Chevelle, Barracuda, and Imperial. North American vehicles that were specially equipped did use special <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>coding</b> for exclusive vehicles like the [...] "SS" [...] designation on Chevrolet products, and Ford used the [...] "GT" [...] term on the high performance version of their products. GM did begin using <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>coding</b> to denote special handling packages installed on performance vehicles, such as [...] "Z28" [...] on the Camaro, the Buick GS, or the Oldsmobile 442, and currently uses the designation [...] "Z71" [...] on the Suburban and Tahoe. Toyota also uses this naming convention on the SR5.|$|R
5000|$|Mixed <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>codes</b> using similar {{characters}} (e.g. uppercase I and the digit 1, {{the letter}} O and the digit 0) can cause mistakes.|$|R
25|$|Bonds {{are often}} {{identified}} by its international securities identification number, or ISIN, {{which is a}} 12 digit <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code</b> that uniquely identifies debt securities.|$|E
25|$|Each {{station was}} also {{assigned}} a unique <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code,</b> with the alphabet indicating {{which part of}} the island the station lies at (North, East, West, Central, Marina Bay region or Choa Chu Kang Branch Line) & the numbers (in ascending order from the centre of the island) indicating which part of that region the station is located at.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the postal}} code systems are numeric; {{only a few}} are {{alphanumeric}} (i.e., use both letters and digits). Alphanumeric systems can, given {{the same number of}} characters, encode many more locations. For example, while a 2 digit numeric code can represent 100 locations, a 2 character <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code</b> using ten numbers and twenty letters can represent 900 locations.|$|E

25|$|Manipulation of the buffer, {{which occurs}} {{before it is}} read or executed, {{may lead to the}} failure of an {{exploitation}} attempt. These manipulations can mitigate the threat of exploitation, but may not make it impossible. Manipulations could include conversion to upper or lower case, removal of metacharacters and filtering out of non-alphanumeric strings. However, techniques exist to bypass these filters and manipulations; <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code,</b> polymorphic code, self-modifying code and return-to-libc attacks. The same methods can be used to avoid detection by intrusion detection systems. In some cases, including where code is converted into unicode, the threat of the vulnerability has been misrepresented by the disclosers as only Denial of Service when in fact the remote execution of arbitrary code is possible.|$|E
25|$|In certain circumstances, {{a target}} process will filter any byte from the {{injected}} shellcode {{that is not}} a printable or alphanumeric character. Under such circumstances, the range of instructions {{that can be used to}} write a shellcode becomes very limited. A solution to this problem was published by Rix in Phrack 57 in which he showed it was possible to turn any code into <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code.</b> A technique often used is to create self-modifying code, because this allows the code to modify its own bytes to include bytes outside of the normally allowed range, thereby expanding the range of instructions it can use. Using this trick, a self-modifying decoder can be created that initially uses only bytes in the allowed range. The main code of the shellcode is encoded, also only using bytes in the allowed range. When the output shellcode is run, the decoder can modify its own code to be able to use any instruction it requires to function properly and then continues to decode the original shellcode. After decoding the shellcode the decoder transfers control to it, so it can be executed as normal. It has been shown that it is possible to create arbitrarily complex shellcode that looks like normal text in English.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Giant" [...] modules {{were set}} in the Greyhawk {{campaign}} setting, and formed the lead-in to an overall campaign that then continued on an odyssey into the Underdark. These adventures included the [...] "Drow" [...] series of modules, Descent into the Depths of the Earth, Shrine of the Kuo-Toa, and Vault of the Drow. The campaign finally culminated with module Queen of the Demonweb Pits. [...] Steading and Glacial Rift were eight pages long, while Hall was 16 pages in length, and each featured an outer folder. The omnibus collection combination module Against the Giants was 32 pages long, and featured two outer folders. Against the Giants was revised and reprinted in the 128-page supermodule Queen of the Spiders in 1986 {{in combination with the}} three [...] "Drow" [...] series modules, and Queen of the Demonweb Pits. Hall of the Fire Giant King marked the first time that Dungeons & Dragons players encountered the drow; game statistics for the drow first appear in the module, although drow are mentioned in the 1977 edition of the Monster Manual. At the time these modules were released, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code</b> indicating the series to which it belonged. The earlier modules have module codes G1, G2, and G3 respectively, and the combined module's code is G13. [...] The [...] "G" [...] in the module code represents the first letter in the word [...] "giant". [...] The Original TSR Product Codes for these 3 modules are 9016, 9017, and 9018 respectively. Released in 1999 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of TSR, [...] provided a set of adventuring materials that expanded on the original three modules. 1999 also featured a reprinting of the three modules made available in the Dungeons & Dragons Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition boxed set, with slight modifications to make it distinguishable from the original (for collecting purposes).|$|E

50|$|There {{was also}} the 810-type engine, with 1,289 cc from a 73 x 77 mm bore and stroke. It {{was taken out of}} {{production}} before <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>codes</b> were introduced. Power ranged from 32-47 kW.|$|R
50|$|The first IEC {{standards}} for battery sizes were issued in 1957.Since 1992, International standard IEC 60086 defines an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>coding</b> system for batteries.British standard 397 for primary batteries was withdrawn {{and replaced by}} the IEC standard in 1996.|$|R
500|$|When Metamorphosis Alpha was updated and {{expanded}} into Gamma World, {{it seemed the}} right time for Gygax to reintroduce Expedition to the Barrier Peaks to the public. Said Gygax, [...] "What could be more logical than to make available a scenario which blends the two role playing approaches into a single form?" [...] Gygax updated the scenario to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) rules, hoping it could serve as a primer on how to integrate science into one's fantasy role playing game. In 1980, the updated version was published as Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. At the time of Expedition to the Barrier Peakss release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code</b> indicating the series to which it belonged. The 32-page adventure bears the code S3 ("S" [...] for [...] "special"). The module included a 36-page book and a 32-page book, with two outer folders; {{it was one of the}} first deluxe scenario modules, and included a book of illustrations intended to be shown to the players during the game, including four color paintings. This module was included as part of the Realms of Horror abridged compilation produced in 1987. Although an article on the Wizards.com web site did provide a conversion to Future Tech, the adventure never received an official sequel and was not updated for the D version 3.5 rules (Wizards of the Coast periodically alters the rules of Dungeons & Dragons and releases a new version). [...] It was made into a novel of the same name by Roland J. Green for the Greyhawk Classics series. The adventure has also been referenced in the Nodwick comic series. Unlike the other S series adventures, Expedition to the Barrier Peaks was not included in the Dungeon Survival Guide by author Bill Slavicsek because to him it was a [...] "wonderful adventure", but not [...] "a D adventure. Once you add ray guns and power armor to the game, you have a fundamentally different experience." [...] Other products that have introduced futuristic elements into D include the adventure City of the Gods (1987) and the novel Tale of the Comet (1997).|$|E
2500|$|Most NEMA {{connectors}} {{are named}} following a simple <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code</b> consisting of: a numeral preceding a hyphen, a numeral following the hyphen, and letters {{at the beginning}} and end of the code to indicate whether the connector is a locking type and whether it is a plug (male connector) or the corresponding receptacle [...] (female connector).|$|E
2500|$|Since then, {{several new}} {{proposals}} {{have been presented}} to the CEN working group. One of these, tabled by the , proposes a 5-character <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code,</b> consisting of the 3-digit centimetre figure of the primary body dimension, followed by one or two letters that code a secondary dimension, somewhat like the system already defined for bra sizes. For example, an item designed for 100cm bust girth, 104cm [...] hip girth and 176cm height could bear the compact size code [...] "100BG". This proposal was agreed upon in 2006, but later disregarded. A paper by Bogusławska-Bączek published in 2010 showed that there were still significant difficulties in identifying clothing sizes.|$|E

25|$|The colour and <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>codes</b> {{for each}} {{direction}} of travel remained unchanged, except that {{with the opening of}} the Woodlands Extension (connecting Yishun station to Choa Chu Kang station), the Jurong East – Choa Chu Kang Branch Line ceased to exist. As such, the formerly Northbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in khaki travelled southbound to Marina Bay & as such were denoted as red while the formerly Southbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in brown originated from Marina Bay, hence having travelled northbound it was denoted as yellow. The <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>codes</b> for these stations were also replaced. After Sembawang it is N14-N18, N20-N23, with the exception of N13 (Canberra) and N19 (Sungei Kadut).

2500|$|A newly {{discovered}} asteroid {{is given a}} provisional designation (such as [...] ) consisting of the year of discovery and an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code</b> indicating the half-month of discovery and the sequence within that half-month. Once an asteroid's orbit has been confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. 433 Eros). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. (433) Eros), but dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, {{it is common to}} drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text. In addition, names can be proposed by the asteroid's discoverer, within guidelines established by the International Astronomical Union.|$|E
2500|$|The Bukit Panjang LRT {{opened in}} 1999 {{and was given}} the colours purple and orange to {{represent}} its direction of travel. Due to the alignment of the route, which was a loop track around Bukit Panjang New Town, the map was different. The stations were given the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>code</b> A1 to A14, with numbering starting from Choa Chu Kang interchange and going anti-clockwise direction on the loop. The directional arrow on the shared service track (between stations A1 to A6) was split, half purple coloured and half orange coloured. From Bukit Panjang station, the orange arrows travelled in an anti-clockwise direction [...] while the purple arrows travelled in a clockwise direction (service A) towards Senja. These were standardised into grey colour since 2001 because of additional LRT lines such as Sengkang and Punggol LRT.|$|E

[...] Initially created for a CIA command post to support a local stronghold, the site was expanded with a 1966 TACAN area excavated on the mountaintop where a 1967 command guidance radar was added for Commando Club bombing of northern areas of North Vietnam. [...] The site ended operations with the Battle of Lima Site 85 {{when most of the}} U.S. technicians on the mountaintop were killed, including CMSgt Richard Etchberger. For his heroism and sacrifice, Etchberger received the Air Force Cross posthumously. The operation remained classified, however, and the existence of the award was not publicly acknowledged until 1998. After the declassification of LS 85 and a reevaluation of his actions, Etchberger was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2010.|$|E
