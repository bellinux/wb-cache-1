40|$|Abstract. Improving {{the level}} of {{accuracy}} in testing the principle of equivalence (PE) requires reliably extracting a very small signal from an instrument's intrinsic noise and the noise associated with the instrument's motion. In fact, the spin velocity required to modulate a PE-violating signal produces a relatively high level of motion-related noise and modulation of gravity gradients at various frequencies. In the test of the PE in an Einstein elevator under development by our team, the differential <b>acceleration</b> <b>detector</b> free-falls while spinning around a horizontal axis inside an evacuated, comoving capsule released from a stratospheric balloon. The accuracy goal of the experiment is to test the PE at an accuracy of a few parts in 10 ^ 15, a limit set by the expected white-noise sources in our detector. The extraction of a very small signal from the prevailing noise sources {{is necessary for the}} experiment to succeed. In this paper, we discuss different detector configurations and describe a particular design that is able to provide a remarkable attenuation and frequency separation of the effects of motion and gravity gradients with respect to a PE-violating signal. Numerical simulations of the detector's dynamics in the presence of relevant perturbations, realistic errors, and construction imperfections show the merits of this configuration for the differential <b>acceleration</b> <b>detector...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Testing the {{principle}} of equivalence with a differential <b>acceleration</b> <b>detector</b> that spins while free falling requires a reliable extraction of a very small violation signal from the noise in the output signal frequency spectrum. The experiment is designed such that the violation signal is modulated by the spin of the test bodies. The possible violation signal is mixed with the intrinsic white noise of the detector and the colored noise associated with the modulation of gravitational perturbations, through the spin, and inertial-motion-related noise. In order to avoid false alarms the frequencies of the gravitational disturbances and the violation signal must be separate. This paper presents {{a model for the}} perturbative gravitational torque that affects the measurement. The torque is expanded in an asymptotic series to the fourth order and then expressed as a frequency spectrum. A spectral analysis shows the design conditions for frequency separation between the perturbing torque and the violation signal...|$|E

Neuromasts are the basic unit of the lateral line system and consist of bundles of mechanoreceptive hair cells, which are comprised of a single kinocilium and numerous stereovilli protruding into a gelatinous cupula. The hydrodynamic properties of the neuromast act as a mechanical filter for sensory hair cells (van Netten, 1991). Hair cells are grouped into neuromasts located either upon the skin surface (superficial neuromasts) or enclosed within subdermal canals (canal neuromasts). Canal neuromasts function as water <b>acceleration</b> <b>detectors,</b> and superficial neuromasts act to determine water velocity (Kroese and Schellart, 1992).

40|$|The {{applications}} of Unruh-Fulling (UF) effect are mostly studied {{by considering the}} interaction of Unruh-DeWitt (UD) detector and single matter field. In this work we aim to study the transition rate of a system, by considering an interacting picture of a point like UD detector and multiple massive scalar fields of different masses. Our study reveals that for large number of scalar fields with m_i/a≪ 1 (m_i denotes {{the mass of the}} i^th scalar field and a is the <b>acceleration</b> of the <b>detector),</b> the transition rate of the system significantly depends on the acceleration of the UD detector. It is being predicted that there exist a critical acceleration of the UD detector, beyond which the transition rate becomes drastically high in comparison to the condition below the critical acceleration. We argue that in this theoretical framework, the presence of critical acceleration and the drastic change in the transition rate around the critical point, can be better understood by analytically stretching the number of scalar fields to infinity. The appearance of such critical point never occurs in case of the interaction of UD detector and single scalar field. On the other hand, in the limit m_i/a≫ 1, the transition rate of the system ceases to zero which in turn signifies that there is no detection of particle excitation by the UD detector.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study two quantum aspects of black holes, their entropy and the Hawking effect. First, {{we present a}} model for the {{statistical}} interpretation of black hole entropy and show that this entropy emerges as a result of missing information about the exact state of the matter from which the black hole was formed. We demonstrate that this idea can be applied to black holes made from both ultra-relativistic and nonrelativistic particles. In the second part we focus our attention on several features of black hole evaporation. We discuss the dependence of the Hawking radiation on the vacuum definition of different observers. It becomes evident that in certain cases the choice of observer has an influence on the particle spectrum. In particular, we study the meaning of the Kruskal vacuum on the horizon. After that we determine the Hawking flux for nonstationary black holes. We find approximate coordinates which are regular on the time dependent horizon and calculate the particle density measured by an observer at infinity. Finally, we derive the response of a particle detector in curved background. In our approach we use the Unruh detector to quantify the spectrum of radiation seen by general observers in Minkowski, Schwarzschild and Vaidya space-times. We find that an arbitrarily accelerated detector in flat space-time registers a particle flux with a temperature proportional to a time dependent <b>acceleration</b> parameter. A <b>detector</b> moving in Schwarzschild space-time will register a predominantly thermal spectrum with the exact temperature depending on the observer’s trajectory. If the detector is located at constant distance from the black hole it measures a shifted temperature which diverges on the horizon. On the other hand, a detector in free fall towards the black hole does not register a thermal particle flux when it crosses the horizon. In this framework corrections to the temperature measured by a detector moving in Vaidya space-time are obtained as well. We argue that our result also clarifies the role of horizons in black hole radiation. Content...|$|R
