5|$|Argentina {{possesses}} definite comparative <b>advantages</b> <b>in</b> agriculture, as {{the country}} is endowed with {{a vast amount of}} highly fertile land. Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income. By 1913, Argentina was the world's 10th wealthiest nation per capita.|$|E

5|$|George VI's {{coronation}} at Westminster Abbey {{took place}} on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony {{in a show of}} support for her son. There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the government of India. Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best, and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic <b>advantages</b> <b>in</b> the event of war.|$|E
5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative <b>advantages</b> <b>in</b> different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{theoretically}} and empirically {{the impact}} of comparative <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> international trade on fertility. We build a model in which industries differ in {{the extent to which}} they use female relative to male labor, and countries are characterized by Ricardian comparative <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> either female- or male-intensive goods. The main prediction of the model is that countries with comparative <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> female-intensive goods are characterized by lower fertility. This is because female wages, and therefore the opportunity cost of child-rearing are higher in those countries. We demonstrate empirically that countries with comparative <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> industries employing primarily women exhibit lower fertility. We use a geography-based instrument for trade patterns to isolate the causal effect of comparative advantage on fertility.

5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} <b>advantages</b> <b>in</b> long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the war, the Allies had significant <b>advantages</b> <b>in</b> both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP. In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.|$|E

40|$|Watkins, LeCompte, and Kim (2000) {{suggested}} that the recall advantage for rare words in mixed lists {{is due to a}} compensatory study strategy that favors the rare words. They found the advantage was reversed when rare and common words were studied under incidental learning conditions. The present study investigated the possibility that the rare-word <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> recognition memory is also the result of a compensatory study strategy. Experiment 1 replicated the findings of Watkins et al. that the rareword <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> recall is eliminated under incidental learning conditions. In contrast, Experiment 2 showed that the rare-word <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> recognition memory is maintained under both intentional and incidental learning conditions. Experiment 3 replicated the results of Experiments 1 and 2 using different stimuli and a different orienting task. Finally, Experiment 4 showed that the rare-word <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> recognition is maintained with pure lists. These findings show that the rare-word <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> recognition memory is not the result of a compensatory study strategy. Instead, rare words are encoded more distinctively than common words, irrespective of participants' intention to remember them...|$|R

40|$|Emerald Group Publishing LimitedThe {{increasingly}} important {{role played by}} sponsorship in the marketing mix {{has given rise to}} the view that it should be considered a strategic activity with the potential to generate a sustainable competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> the marketplace. This paper extends that line of argument through the development of a conceptual model of the sponsorship – competitive <b>advantage</b> relationship. <b>In</b> particular, it argues that two levels of competitive advantage need to be considered, namely the competitive advantage of the sponsorship and competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> the market. Critical to attaining an <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> the competitive world of sponsorship is the deployment of a range of organisational resources to support the sponsorship investment. A series of research propositions are advanced showing the relative importance of different organisational resources.

5|$|The Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, was {{the single}} bloodiest day in American {{military}} history. The outnumbered Confederate forces fought desperately and well. Despite significant <b>advantages</b> <b>in</b> manpower, McClellan was unable to concentrate his forces effectively, which meant that Lee was able to shift his defenders to parry each of three Union thrusts, launched separately and sequentially against the Confederate left, center, and finally the right. McClellan was also unwilling, due to Porter's opinion, to employ his ample reserve forces to capitalize on localized successes. Historian James M. McPherson {{has pointed out that}} the two corps McClellan kept in reserve were in fact larger than Lee's entire force. The reason for McClellan's reluctance was that, as in previous battles, he was convinced he was outnumbered.|$|E

Firstly, he was repatriated well before most servicemen and, secondly, South Australia had implemented a policy of preferment of returned servicemen for government employment. These circumstances helped him gain appointment as the first South Australian Public Service Commissioner in 1916. Weir was not suited to this role, being unable to navigate the competing personal and political agendas of senior public servants and politicians, and was soon sidelined. In 1925, legislative changes {{made it possible for}} the government to replace Weir, and this took place in 1930.
