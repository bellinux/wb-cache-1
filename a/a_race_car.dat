500|$|Alesi {{attacked}} Briatore's role {{in preventing}} the drivers from abiding by the pact {{that was to}} see no overtaking {{in the first two}} chicanes and told the Italian and French media that some team principals threatened their drivers if they did not race. Nevertheless, he was relieved that the race passed without any major incident and said the reason why the majority of the drivers supported Michael Schumacher was that he [...] "behaved like a perfect leader". Villeneuve said to British television station ITV that he felt discussing a no overtaking pact at the race circuit was not the appropriate place: [...] "We are race car drivers, Because we signed contracts before the season and everyone was happy to be <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>car</b> driver and to earn millions of dollars. Because we knew a year ago {{that there would be a}} race at Monza and nobody complained." [...] FIA president Max Mosley stated that he disagreed with the pact and said that the drivers should have raised the concerns in the months leading up to the Grand Prix.|$|E
