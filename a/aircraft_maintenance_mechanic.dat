40|$|The {{goals of}} this {{research}} project are to (a) provide a comprehensive analysis of the Maintenance ASAP program in the United States, including the analysis of factors that contribute toward the development or lack of development of such programs and (b) design a safety-information communication and tracking system. Background The primary purpose of an Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) is to identify and correct adverse safety events that would otherwise not be likely {{to come to the}} attention of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or company management. As of December, 2003, there are twenty-eight airlines that operate ASAPs for pilots, but there are only six ASAP MOUs for <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>mechanics.</b> Of the six maintenance ASAPs, most are considered by all stake-holders to be highly effective. Because of the potential benefits to safety, a major interest of the FAA is to determine whether the failure of ASAPs to expand to multiple operators as rapidly for <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> as it has for pilots is attributable to FAA’s ASAP policy, and/or to other factors beyond the control of the FAA. First Year’s Statu...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of attitude, behavioural intentions and actual behaviour on aircraft safety amongst by analyzing data collected from <b>aircraft</b> line <b>maintenance</b> <b>mechanics</b> in Hong Kong. The research, which used one conceptual framework model, PLS path modeling, and structural equation modeling to compare two <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> companies, {{was based on the}} theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behaviour. It was hypothesised that attitude affects behavioural intentions and that behavioural intentions also affect one's behaviour. The study assumes that attitude and behavioural intentions in turn affect actual behaviour; that behaviour then impacts aircraft safety. ...|$|R
40|$|Road safety {{studies using}} the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) have {{provided}} {{support for a}} three-way distinction between violations, skill-based errors and mistakes, and have indicated that a tendency to commit driving violations is {{associated with an increased}} risk of accident involvement. The aims of this study were to examine whether the three-way distinction of unsafe acts is applicable in the context of <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and whether involvement in maintenance safety occurrences can be predicted on the basis of self-reported unsafe acts. A Maintenance Behaviour Questionnaire (MBQ) was developed to explore patterns of unsafe acts committed by <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>mechanics.</b> The MBQ was completed anonymously by over 1300 Australian aviation mechanics, who also provided information on their involvement in workplace accidents and incidents. Four factors were identified: routine violations, skill-based errors, mistakes and exceptional violations. Violations and mistakes were related significantly to the occurrence of incidents that jeopardized the quality of <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance,</b> but were not related to workplace injuries. Skill-based errors, while not related to work quality incidents, were related to workplace injuries. The results are consistent with the three-way typology of unsafe acts described by Reason et al. (1990) and with the DBQ research indicating an association between self-reported violations and accidents. The current findings suggest that interventions addressed at maintenance quality incidents should take into account the role of violations and mistakes, and the factors that promote them. In contrast, interventions directed at reducing workplace injury are likely to require a focus on skill-based errors...|$|R
50|$|The make-up of the Flight Test Team {{will vary}} with the {{organization}} {{and complexity of the}} flight test program, however, there are some key players who are generally part of all flight test organizations. The leader of a flight test team is usually a flight test engineer (FTE) or possibly an experimental test pilot. Other FTEs or pilots could also be involved. Other team members would be the Flight Test Instrumentation Engineer, Instrumentation System Technicians, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> department (<b>mechanics,</b> electrical techs, avionics technicians, etc.), Quality/Product Assurance Inspectors, the ground-based computing/data center personnel, plus logistics and administrative support. Engineers from various other disciplines would support the testing of their particular systems and analyze the data acquired for their specialty area.|$|R
50|$|This airlift was {{the first}} major {{civilian}} airlift in history, and perhaps the largest of any civilian relief effort of any kind. Of the major participants, only OXFAM had any prior experience with field operations; Biafra was their second. Pilots and some of the maintenance crews were perhaps the only trained persons involved. Most others were volunteers, performing tasks for which they had no little or no training or prior experience, from loading and unloading, warehouse, inventory, to <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> and engine <b>mechanics.</b> The operating agencies were varied and often competing; many were also brand new to this type of effort. Organization and logistics were improved greatly through experience over months, with unloading times dropped from over 2 hours to 20 minutes per aircraft, often under attack or threat of attack.|$|R
