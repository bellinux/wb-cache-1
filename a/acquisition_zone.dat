40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} quiet zone probing {{approach}} {{which deals with}} low dynamic range quiet <b>zone</b> <b>acquisitions.</b> Lack of dynamic range is a feature of millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelength technologies. It is consequence of the gradually smaller power generated by the instrumentation, that follows a f^α law with frequency, being α≥ 1 variable depending on the signal source’s technology. The proposed approach {{is based on an}} optimal data reduction scenario which redounds in a maximum signal to noise ratio increase for the signal pattern, with minimum information losses. After theoretical formulation, practical applications of the technique are proposed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} the design techniques used to develop the antenna measurement system for the Terasense Project. This project, funded by the Spanish Government, involves millimetre-wave systems design. One of these systems is an antenna measurement facility. The antenna measurement system operates in a banded range of frequency. The lower frequencies deal between 75 – 110 GHz (WR 10 operation range) and the upper frequencies are set between 220 – 325 GHz (WR 03). Among the different possible configurations, the reflector-based compact range is chosen. The quiet zone is generated by a serrated-edge reflector, fed by a low gain horn. In this paper we will focus on the reflector design. A serrations study is carried out and quiet <b>zone</b> <b>acquisition</b> results are obtained...|$|R

A model is proposed here for the formation of these magnetization concentrations (or 'magcons') in which the partially ionized vapor cloud produced in a hypervelocity (greater than 10 km/s) basin-forming impact expands around the moon forcing a preexisting ambient magnetic field to be concentrated for a brief (less than 1 day) time period in the antipodal <b>zone.</b> <b>Acquisition</b> of magnetic remanence during the period of compressed field amplification may occur by one of several mechanisms, such as shock remanence by impact of solid secondaries ejected from the basin-forming event. The model implies that basin-forming impacts have {{played a major role in}} determining the large-scale distribution of crustal magnetization detectable from lunar orbit...|$|R
40|$|Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are {{important}} vectors of neoliberal globalization in India. Despite facing widespread resistance against the proposed land <b>acquisition</b> for these <b>zones,</b> {{they are still}} being promoted across the country. We argue that the wealth redistribution to the country's elites and the fractured resistance movements enable neoliberalism and its practices {{to grow in the}} countryside. Using a private sector SEZ in Gurgaon as a case study, this article explores how special economic zoning, as a neoliberal policy, has been implicated in the spatialized production of poverty. We also show that the main actors who promote neoliberalism in India (the state and the large-scale urban private sector) have found a seemingly unlikely ally in rural India in the form of farmers with large landholdings, rural elites who are willing to let go of their land under certain conditions. The data for the article was collected in India in 2009 – 10...|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) adapted to industry-scale, {{cryogenic}} wind tunnels (i. e. cryoTSP) {{is used to}} detect the natural, laminar-to-turbulent transition of a model’s boundary layer in high speed flows. Besides pure transition detection, cryoTSP result images provide information on the transition zone, the characteristics of transition and on the underlying instability. Because of the small boundary layer thickness given in cryogenic testing at high Reynolds numbers, the surface quality of the model must be very high. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} investigate the influence of the paint layer on resulting aerodynamic coefficients measured in parallel to transition detection by cryoTSP. Since temperature-sensitive paint has not to be oxygen permeable like pressure-sensitive paint (PSP), commercial three component polyurethan binders or clear coating can be used as the binder for cryoTSP. Such kind of paint layer can be polished to a desired level of roughness. We investigated the influence of surface roughness of cryoTSP on the free boundary-layer transition on 2 D and 3 D models in transonic wind tunnels. There are some criteria for surface finishing of cryogenic wind tunnel models. However, it can be shown that there may still be some effect of roughness on transition location for roughness of the order proposed by these values. As a rule of thumb it can be said, that surface finishing in cryogenic, high Reynolds number testing should be “as smooth as possible” when performing transition detection measurement. Using high resolution scientific CCD cameras for TSP image <b>acquisition,</b> a transition <b>zone</b> can be resolved rather than a sharp transition point in chord-wise direction, which represents the physical mechanism behind transition more accurately than specifying a transition point only. Additionally, laminar separation bubbles and flow separation can be detected by the cryoTSP method. Using a special technique when spraying the paint, it is possible to operate the pressure tappings on a model also during cryoTSP testing. Since the pressure orifices have to penetrate the paint layer, their shape and curvature are changed by the painting and polishing, which may lead to a deviation in the measured pressure values compared to the model without TSP. Furthermore, the thickness of the cryoTSP on the model (approx. 100 μm) can influence the pressure distribution. We experimentally investigated the effect of cryoTSP on pressure tapping on a natural laminar flow (NLF) airfoil at Reynolds numbers of 6 Mio and 15 Mio and for Mach numbers of M = 0. 30 and 0. 62, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (DEd) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 2009 We have {{ingrained}} {{into our}} teaching ideology that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) {{is an essential}} component of modern education. The computer pod was suggested in the early 2000 's by the Department of Education, Employment and Training (DEET) as the means of providing students with access to ICT, but neither the method to harness nor how to direct innovation for best practice were indicated. A literature review by Hennessy and Osborne (2003) provided information on the available ICT tools for Science teaching and suggestions exist for the merits of using computer pods in Culbertson's (1999) reflections on nine studies and Owen's (2003) discussions of English teaching, but rarely was there a merger between the fields of computer pods and Science teaching. Professional development within a department where teachers create their own tasks provides a method of computer pod integration when slotting the tasks into the curriculum. This provides a future teaching document incorporating computer pod usage. The process of creating activities provides a training opportunity for developing accessible resources. The hands-on experience of Science teachers developing their own tasks for sharing aligns with self-help and effective resource management. Impediments exist for teachers in the form of time, equipment, availability, booking requirements, a philosophy that a 1 : 1 student: computer ratio is essential, comfort zone, student management and supervision. Incentives such as: students being keen, comfortable, suited to this learning style and capable users in this environment, who knowledge share with their teachers provide balance to the impediments. This artefact (the computer pod) is acknowledged as a rich component of learning, particularly in promoting group work, where students build their knowledge together. The results of interviewing five Year 8 Science teachers before and after the research year, where pro-noun analysis was used, generated the findings that Science teachers automatically expand their comfort zone in this environment and acquire the desire to experiment via a transition into the classroom with the activities they have specifically created. Individual teachers ventured further and used tasks developed by others for shared use, while others limited their involvement. This research provided a spectrum of responses, which exhibits variability of success and enhances the reliability of the results when presenting individuals as a range within a small sample. A broad picture even though it had a small focus group. The generated direction was an ownership component was generated in what an individual has created for themselves, which gives the incentive to test it out and simultaneously motivates autonomous integration into teaching strategies. This process has potential applications to others; whether it is other Science teachers, faculties within schools, individual teachers or more broadly, where ownership of the artefact enables the individual to confidently step forward with what becomes part of their skill <b>acquisition</b> and comfort <b>zone.</b> Restricted Access: Staff and Students of the University Onl...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a qualitative mixed-methods study {{carried out in}} a vocational-technical secondary school with second-chance adolescent learners of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in a peripheral area of Israel. The learner population was characterized by complex, socio-economically disadvantaged family backgrounds and {{a high rate of}} learning disabilities. The study investigated the effects of a Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) intervention to support the development of basic EFL literacy skills by students who lacked solid foundational English skills. The intervention provided an interactive educational software application, The English Club™, on iPod Touch devices to scaffold learning and review of letter sounds and rules of English, integrate them into words and texts, and practice reading, writing and comprehension. Learners developed literacy skills depending on the level they reached in the application. The English Club follows a scaffolded Multi-Sensory Structured Language (MSL) approach, adapting for struggling EFL learners the Hickey Multi-Sensory Method (Combley, 2001), developed by Kathleen Hickey of the British Dyslexia Institute. Printed books containing the material complemented the use of the MALL. The English teachers at the school chose the learners who participated and determined how to integrate the intervention into their English classrooms. An investigation of the teachers’ roles was included in the study. The methodology was primarily action research with case studies of individual learners and teachers. Pre-intervention and post-intervention data on learners’ English knowledge, skills, attitudes and opinions and on teachers’ attitudes and opinions about use of this MALL intervention was generated via skills assessments and semi-structured interviews. As a participant-teacher-observer, I observed the intervention’s use in classes and in sessions with individual students. Changes in skills, attitudes and opinions were analyzed in the framework of Vygotsky’s theories of language <b>acquisition</b> and the <b>Zone</b> of Proximal Development as elaborated in Scaffolding Theory. Theories of motivation, literacy and second language acquisition, and how struggling learners experience these, have provided additional lenses for analysis. My goals in performing this study were to understand in depth the whole picture of the intervention, both its effects on students’ English skills and attitudes, and the factors that shaped these outcomes. The study’s findings contribute {{to an understanding of the}} ways in which delivering a scaffolded MSL approach to literacy education via MALL can contribute to addressing the world crisis in literacy acquisition, and issues that must be addressed for this type of intervention to be effective. Findings showed that learners who actively engaged in the intervention made significant progress in their English literacy skills, increased their confidence in their ability to learn English and thus their willingness to engage in learning, and demonstrated increased awareness of the connection between their own investment of effort and learning. This success was shaped by many factors, including variation among individual learner profiles, the degree of teachers’ support for the intervention, increasing students’ motivation to invest effort, minimizing disruptions to the students’ learning routine, and maximizing access to charged, working devices and to books. The individual MALL delivery platform enabled an untrained, inexperienced but committed teacher to provide the benefits of this scaffolded method, appropriate to her learners’ needs, in multi-level English classrooms and to provide a solution for students returning from extended absences to catch up with missed classwork. Recommendations for policy and practice include use of such scaffolded MSL MALL applications with struggling language learners in conjunction with printed materials and closely accompanied by committed teachers, who do not have to be highly trained in specialized methods to support learning by struggling students. Schools engaging in such interventions need to ensure that the devices will be fully available for use during learning hours, minimize disruptions to the class schedule, and maximize students’ use of the MALL app and books in class, during free time at school, and at home. If necessary, extrinsic rewards should be offered to overcome students’ learned helplessness...|$|R
