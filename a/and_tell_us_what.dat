25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for The Guardian, Philip Pullman remarked on Ruby Hollers [...] "larger-than-life, brighter-than-natural quality" [...] {{and concluded that}} while neither great literature nor the authors best work, [...] "its a book that shows how very satisfying unobtrusive craftsmanship can be, even working with slight materials, and its fun, and it celebrates kindness and decency." [...] Regarding the main plot line, he observed that [...] "its not hard to predict {{that there will be}} problems to overcome and dangers to face, but that theyll all live happily ever after."
