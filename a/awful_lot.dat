I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

[...] Felicity Montagu, who plays Partridge's assistant Lynn, felt he was a good person [...] "deep down" [...] and actually [...] "vulnerable and lovable". Iannucci said that Partridge stays optimistic because he never sees himself as others see him, and that despite his failings was [...] "the perfect broadcaster for these times, when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime – he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum." [...] Rob and Neil Gibbons felt that by the time of Mid Morning Matters, when Partridge is working for an even smaller radio station, he was more at peace with himself and that his lack of self-awareness saved him from misery.|$|R

He said in 2003 that [...] "to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since Watchmen, an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use Watchmen to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't {{have a lot to}} recommend them".

500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that <b>awful</b> man. A <b>lot</b> of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFounded by J. F. Ritt, Differential Algebra {{is a true}} part of Algebra so that {{constructive}} and algorithmic {{problems and}} methods appear in this field. In this talk, I {{do not intend to}} give an exhaustive survey of algorithmic aspects of Differential Algebra but I only propose some examples to give an insight of the state of knowledge in this domain. Some problems are known to have an effective solution, others have an efficient effective solution which is implemented in recent computer algebra systems, and the decidability of some others is still an open question, which does not prevent computations from leading to interesting results. Liouville's theory of integration in finite terms and Risch's theorem are examples of problems that computer algebra systems now deal with very efficiently (implementation work by M Bronstein). In what concerns linear differential equations of arbitrary order, a basis for the vector space of all liouvillian solutions can “in principle” be computed effectively thanks to a theorem of Singer's [17, 22]; the complexity bound is actually <b>awful</b> and a <b>lot</b> of work is done or in progress, especially by M. Singer and F. Ulmer, to give realistic algorithms [20, 21] for third-order linear differential equations. Existence of liouvillian first integrals is a way to make precise the notion of integrability of vector fields. Even in the simplest case of three-dimensional polynomial vector fields, no decision procedure is known for this existence. Nevertheless, explicit computations with computer algebra yield interesting solutions for special examples. In this case, the process of looking for so-called Darboux curves can only be called a method but not an algorithm; for a given degree, this search is a classical algebraic elimination process but no bound is known on the degree of the candidate polynomials. This paper insists on the search of liouvillian first integrals of polynomial vector fields and a new result is given: the generic absence of such liouvillian first integrals for factorisable polynomial vector fields in three variables...|$|R

Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead found touring {{stressful}} {{and took}} a break in January 1996. They sought to distance their new material from the introspective style of The Bends. Drummer Phil Selway said: [...] "There was an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of soul-searching [...] To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring." [...] Yorke, Radiohead's primary lyricist, said at the time, [...] "we could really fall back on just doing another miserable, morbid and negative record lyrically, but I don't really want to, at all.

In an interview with The Daily Telegraph he suggests that although relations between the actors were generally cordial [...] "There was bad feeling between the writers and the performers—the writers felt we were unilaterally altering the script and altering it for the worse. At {{end of the first}} day of rehearsals the writers would go away {{and by the time they}} came back we would have changed an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of it.

500|$|During {{the winter}} of 19751976, Moolin {{pronounced}} himself dissatisfied with progress, but promised improvements. [...] "We've learned an <b>awful</b> <b>lot.</b> This year (1975) was a pull-ourselves-up-by-our-bootstraps operation. We didn't really have our organization set until July, and it wasn't working at top effectiveness until October." [...] To {{take advantage of that}} [...] "top effectiveness", Moolin set an ambitious goal for 1976 construction: [...] "We're expecting to have all of the line installed, insulated, and hydro-tested by November 1," [...] he said in January. That goal was ambitious, because most of the work that had been done to that point was on floodplains and flat terrain. Still left to tackle were difficult construction projects in Atigun Pass and Keystone Canyon. [...] "In some areas, we did eat our cake last year," [...] Moolin said.|$|E

Flyers' coach Fred Shero commented: [...] "They had Orr and he can do an <b>awful</b> <b>lot.</b> But we've got 17 good hockey players {{and every one of them}} put out. It was 17 against one." [...] That season, Orr set the record (since surpassed) for the most points in a game by a defenceman, scoring 3 goals and 4 assists in a November 15, 1973 game against the New York Rangers.

500|$|Pollack and Rosenberg {{sent the}} script to Alan J. Pakula, {{who felt that}} it needed {{improvement}} and spent a year rewriting it with Pierson. Regarding the screenwriting process, Turow said, [...] "There were three large narrative problems to solve. Point of view; getting around the first person narrative; time sequence; it's all flashback and Hollywood doesn't like that; and then just an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of plot." [...] Pierson originally envisioned the film adaptation as being [...] "a movie full of sex and blood". Pakula felt {{that the concept of}} justice was more central to the story. He also wanted to present the film in a visual style that echoed the novel's narrative. In making various changes from the novel, Pakula and Pierson added new dialogue and rewrote the ending. Pakula signed on to direct the film in January 1989.|$|E
500|$|Leave Home was {{released}} on January 10, 1977 and was well received by critics. Although the album did not receive much initial reception, Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone magazine gave the album a favorable review in 1977, {{saying that it is}} very similar to their debut yet more experienced sounding. He sums up the album with: [...] "The Ramones are as direct and witty as before. They've also lost just a pinch of their studied rawness: whether this is a sign of maturity or sellout is a matter for debate. The Ramones make rousing music and damn good jokes, but they're in a bind: the hard rock of this group is so pure it may be perceived as a freak novelty by an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of people." [...] In the 1979 book The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the album was given 4.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E

The Arsenal captain spoke of how his team-mates were [...] "really fired up" [...] before the game and was delighted with the effort they put in {{during the course of}} the match. Graham was proud of his team's performance, and credited Adams, who [...] "suffered an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of stick which has given football very little dignity." [...] When asked about the result he said, [...] "Nobody outside Highbury expected us to do it, but when you lose belief you might as well get out of football."

500|$|Betrayal is the {{secondary}} theme of The Wild Bunch. [...] The characters suffer from {{their knowledge of}} having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ("$10,000 cuts an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of family ties"). However, Bishop says, [...] "When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal." [...] Such oppositional ideas lead to the film's violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable. Bishop remembers his betrayals, most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton (in flashback) when the law catches {{up to them and}} when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery (ostensibly to guard the hostages). Critic David Weddle writes that [...] "like that of Conrad's Lord Jim, Pike Bishop's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{said she}} loved the chemistry between Michael and Dwight, and enjoyed the direction the Michael Scott Paper Company plot was going. She also liked the bond that was forming between Jim and Andy, and said Ed Helms was particularly good in [...] "Heavy Competition". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called the episode [...] "just an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of fun", and wrote having Michael and Dwight at odds with each other [...] "forced both characters to be just human enough for the story and the jokes to breathe". Sepinwall did not enjoy the Jim and Andy subplot, except for the final moment when Jim comforted Andy. Will Leitch of New York magazine said, [...] "This {{might have been the}} funniest Rainn Wilson has been in an episode all season, and that's saying something." [...] Leitch also said B. J.

In terms of his character Jackman views Wolverine as [...] "the ultimate outsider" [...] and that [...] "the great battle, I always thought with Wolverine, is the battle within himself". Regarding Logan's struggle with extreme life longevity, Jackman said, [...] "He realizes everyone he loves dies, and his whole life is full of pain. So it's better that he just escapes. He can't die really. He just wants {{to get away from}} everything." [...] Jackman stated that he ate six meals a day in preparation for the role. Jackman contacted Dwayne Johnson for some tips on bulking up for the film. Johnson suggested that for six months, he gain a pound a week, by eating 6,000 calories a day which consisted of [...] "an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of chicken, steak and brown rice".|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, but wrote: [...] "Flashes of brilliance aside, the result sounds an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> like something Yorke dashed off {{to pass the}} time before delving into the new Radiohead album." [...] Mark Beaumont of the Guardian called it [...] "deviously understated", but found that its unconventional release was [...] "more impactful than the product." [...] Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork wrote: [...] "There's precious little to grab on to in terms of melody and feeling, and you won't find yourself humming along to anything here. That said, certain elements of Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, if given the right amount of attention, can be enjoyable to luxuriate in." [...] Chris Barton of the Los Angeles Times found the album too similar to Yorke's 2006 solo album The Eraser and his work with Atoms for Peace, writing that [...] "it’s just a bit disappointing that Yorke's path seems short on new directions." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{most common}} {{criticism}} is the {{heavy emphasis on}} sailing, especially later in the game when Link must trek around the ocean to collect Triforce pieces. GameSpot wrote that while the main quest [...] "starts out in a very brisk manner", by {{the last third of}} the game, the [...] "focus on sailing ... is pretty tedious". Edge wrote that the sailing was [...] "convincingly organic", but even with the warp feature, [...] "there remains an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of relatively dull seafaring activity". Others complained about having to use the Wind Waker so frequently to change wind direction. IGN wrote that using the device became [...] "a tedious nuisance", and that the inability to skip the accompanying animation was [...] "more bothersome still". Some reviewers enjoyed the sailing; two Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers appreciated the combat, exploration, and side quests available at sea. Another common criticism was the game's comparatively low level of difficulty. IGN wrote that once the player added enough hearts to Link's health meter, [...] "he becomes nearly invincible, which is a true shortcoming as far as we concerned".|$|E

Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of people and places because of my work.

If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe I can bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E
500|$|Marlohe {{expanded}} on Sévérine's personality {{beyond what}} {{was written in}} the screenplay. She said she added a feeling of [...] "raziness" [...] to the character, partially basing it on Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight. She also thought more critically about Sévérine's relationship with Silva, saying: [...] "I just built everything with my imagination, and that is very exciting, too, because there's room for accidents on set." [...] GMA Network's Mikhail Lecaros wrote that Marlohe approached the character with a [...] "bemused cynicism". Daniel Craig praised Marlohe's approach to the character, saying she [...] "brought a huge amount of depth to what is essentially a very small part" [...] and [...] "gave her an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of history in the way she played it". He added that he felt her preparation made the scenes easier to act, and would make the interactions between Bond and Sévérine more appealing to the audience. While discussing her working relationship with Craig, Marlohe described him as [...] "funny, very humble...".|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy's Robert Copsey, who {{although}} {{stated that}} the song isn't anything [...] "we haven't heard before," [...] it is worthy of a standalone release. Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots disagreed, stating that [...] "the lyrics are a little repetitive to be a feature single", but it could, however, be a [...] "great follow up to 'On the Floor' {{if you want to}} listen back to back and keep dancing". A staff member from Idolator stated that: [...] "In a parallel universe, we could definitely hear Gaga herself singing 'Invading My Mind,' though it has more in common with early tracks from Fame than anything the p-p-p-pointy-faced provocateur has done lately". He also {{stated that the}} verses of the song [...] "remind us an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of Lopez's current RedOne-produced hit 'On the Floor'." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that [...] "Lopez shines" [...] on the Love? album cuts which clock at and above 120bpm, except for what he said was the [...] "throwaway" [...] song [...] "Invading My Mind".

500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept is intriguing, bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm {{just not sure}} if it works.

[...] Isler observed that he would have [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup...

He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E
500|$|Marmarosa {{departed}} for California by car in 1960, but {{problems with the}} vehicle halted him in Chicago. Promoter Joe Segal organized an Argo Records session for him there, but Marmarosa departed suddenly and the recording was delayed until the following year. The resultant trio music from two days in May was released as Dodo's Back! in 1962. Leonard Feather described it as [...] "required listening for anyone with a serious interest {{in the history of}} modern jazz piano", but it failed to gain Marmarosa more than a brief resurgence of interest. He made his final studio recordings in 1962. One album from these, Jug & Dodo, contained trio and quartet tracks, with saxophonist Gene Ammons; it was released on Prestige Records more than a decade later. The other, in a quartet with trumpeter Bill Hardman, was released in 1988. Segal commented that Marmarosa [...] "didn't talk much, was very mild-mannered. He just drank an <b>awful</b> <b>lot,</b> shot and a beer all day long. It would've put nine out of ten people under the table, but he was still walking around." [...] The pianist shuttled between Chicago and Pittsburgh for a time, then settled again in the latter.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, giving the episode a {{negative}} review, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories" [...] "proves less successful [...] ". He {{added that he}} [...] "just think the brevity required by the inclusion of three separate tales better suits the world of horror spoofs than it does these Bible pieces," [...] as they [...] "try to pack an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> into very little time." [...] He concluded by writing that, while the episode has [...] "some good moments", he did not {{find a lot of}} entertainment in it. Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News was also critical, and wrote that the episode [...] "fails to be funny" [...] because it [...] "strays too far from the source material". He added [...] "have you read the bible? That stuff’s funny enough in and of itself." [...] Aaron Roxby of Collider described [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories" [...] as his least-favorite trilogy episode, and wrote [...] "Considering that, in earlier seasons, the show had some of the most thoughtfully edgy religious humor on television, this one feels surprisingly toothless." [...] However, he gave praise to the talking pig in the Garden of Eden.|$|E

[...] On 26 December, at the Teatro Regio Ducal (Milan's great opera {{house at the}} time), Wolfgang directed the first public performance [...] from the keyboard, dressed for the occasion in a scarlet coat lined with blue satin and edged with gold. The occasion was a triumph: the audience demanded encores and at the conclusion cried [...] "Evviva il maestro!" [...] (Long live the master!). The opera ran for 22 performances, and the Gazetta di Milano praised the work handsomely: [...] "The young maestro di capella, who is not yet fifteen years of age, studies the beauties of nature, and represents them adorned with the rarest musical graces." [...] The arias sung by Bernasconi [...] "vividly expressed the passions and touched the heart". Subsequent reactions to the opera proved less effusive; there are no records of further performances of Mitridate before its revival in Salzburg in 1971.|$|E

Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{said the}} group were poised to succeed [...] "where other X Factor winners have failed by releasing a great single at the right time". Cragg highlighted the song's production, writing that it had [...] "everything you'd want to hear in a pop song in 2012", and likened Little Mix's [...] "ridiculous vocal runs" [...] to those of Christina Aguilera. Tim Lee from musicOMH called it [...] "an absolutely stomping pop song" [...] and [...] "possibly the best mass market pop song since Girls Aloud's heyday", complimenting its brass production and call and response. According to Lee, the track is [...] "all shot through with such sassiness that you nearly forget it sounds an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> like 'Ain't No Other Man' by Christina Aguilera." [...] Joe Rivers of No Ripcord gave the song a rating of nine out of ten, regarding it as [...] "vivacious, fun, brash and confident", and noting its [...] "absolute belter of a chorus".
