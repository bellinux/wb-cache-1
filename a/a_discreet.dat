Mulder flashes back to the night when his sister, Samantha, was abducted.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme and}} its broken seventh chord (G-B-D-F) which {{characterize}} this movement is stated {{first as a}} major seventh in the two first passages of the first section A with <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> accompaniment. To finish this section, the theme arpeggiates a dominant seventh. In the second A section, the theme first repeats the major seventh before developing into a minor seventh with a minor third in the second passage (G-B-D-F).|$|E
5|$|In Hastings's view, Lang was {{probably}} {{more sympathetic to}} Rome than any other Church of England archbishop of modern times, responsible for <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> catholicisation of the Church of England's practices. A small outward indication of this was his decision to use a cassock as everyday dress and to wear a mitre on formal occasions, the first archbishop since the English Reformation to do so. Lang believed that {{in relation to the}} supreme truths of the church, rituals and dress were of small account, but that if people's worship was assisted by such customs they should be allowed.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully conduct <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> {{meeting with}} a Russian informant, Vsevlod Pudovkin, {{who claims to have}} seen a UFO at a secret {{research}} center. Upon returning to FBI headquarters, Mulder heads out on vacation to visit Graceland, leaving Scully to follow up on the Pudovkin case for him. Scully is uninterested in the case and expresses serious doubts about Pudovkin's credibility, leading to an argument with an inconsiderate Mulder. Scully becomes upset over the direction her life and career are going.|$|E
5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E
5|$|Soona {{gives the}} digital {{cassette}} to Mulder at <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> {{meeting in a}} park. An excited Mulder returns to FBI headquarters, {{only to find that}} the cassette is encrypted. Scully believes the encryption is based on the Navajo language and takes the tape in order to investigate. When Skinner calls Mulder to his office to question him about the tape, Mulder physically attacks him. Scully is brought before an FBI panel led by Skinner and is questioned about Mulder's actions. Scully is told that Mulder faces dismissal from the FBI, and that she will suffer a similar punishment if she has lied to them.|$|E

5|$|While making The Gold Rush, Chaplin {{married for}} the second time. Mirroring the {{circumstances}} of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under California law. He therefore arranged <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924. Their first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr., was born on 5 May 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926.|$|E

The Federal Bureau of Investigation sends two agents, Rupert Anderson—a former Mississippi sheriff—and Alan Ward, to investigate. The pair {{find it difficult}} to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies exert influence over the public and are linked to a branch of the Ku Klux Klan. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> conversation that the three missing men have been murdered. Their bodies are later found buried in an earthen dam. Stuckey deduces Mrs Pell's confession to the FBI and informs Pell, who brutally beats his wife in retribution.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the events}} of the series, the {{pioneering}} scientist Professor Humbert invented the Minimiser, a device capable of shrinking people or objects to one third of their original size. After Humbert's death, it was passed down to Father Unwin, who conceals his deceased parishioner's parting gift inside a copy of Milner's Gallery of Nature. The regular focus of the Minimiser is Harding, whom Unwin reduces to a height of two feet (0.6m) to enable him to infiltrate situations to which no ordinary-sized person could make <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> entry. In this manner, the Harding puppet interacts with life-sized sets and live actors whose faces are excluded from shots. The Minimiser is also used to shrink enemy agents, literally bringing them down to Harding's size.|$|E

Following the services, the coffin was taken in procession to the railway station to begin its trip to Portugal. Around 300,000 people lined the route under incessant rain and cold. The journey continued on to the Church of São Vicente de Fora near Lisbon, where the body of Pedro was interred in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza on 12 December.|$|E

25|$|Visually, Series II {{cars are}} {{differentiated}} from their predecessors by raised front bumpers to meet US crash safety regulations, which necessitated a smaller grille, complemented by <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> additional inlet directly below the bumper.

The canal camps remained in existence for another year, and their prisoners progressively relocated, to similar conditions at other work sites in Northern Dobruja. Penal facilities on the canal site were shut down in mid-1954.|$|E
25|$|On October 19, 1796 Azanza {{was named}} viceroy of New Spain. Many people took this as <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> form of exile. Godoy {{was thought to}} want to rid himself of Azanza {{because he was a}} strong critic. Azanza took {{possession}} of the office of viceroy in 1798, at Orizaba. The change from Miguel de la Grúa Talamanca y Branciforte, marqués de Branciforte, viewed as an immoral thief, was welcomed by the populace.|$|E

25|$|More secular Jews also {{supported}} the synagogue, {{and eventually the}} school founded by the Arbeiterring closed down. The synagogue observed traditional rites and came to be considered Orthodox although it was never formally affiliated with any broader Orthodox Jewish group. Farmers and hotel owners in the congregation, many of whom lived a long distance from the town, would often drive in for Shabbat services, park <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> distance from the synagogue and walk from there to services to maintain the appearance of following Jewish law against driving (considered work).|$|E
25|$|In early May 1914, Safirin {{returned}} to Roman alongside Cernăianu, and resumed <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> existence {{as a translator}} of church literature from the Greek. He eventually withdrew to the area north of Băile Olănești, to Frăsinei Monastery (which he had refurbished during his time as bishop), and lived there {{for the rest of}} his life. He spent his final years composing psaltic music, and, still a student of church literature and hesychasm, obtained a typewritten copy of the Philokalia. The manuscript was later kept by Dumitru Stăniloae, and possibly used as reference for his own Philokalia edition.|$|E
25|$|This {{doctrine}} of the Virgin Birth is often represented Christian art {{in terms of the}} annunciation to Mary by the Archangel Gabriel that she would conceive a child to be born the Son of God, and in Nativity scenes that include the figure of Salome. The Annunciation {{is one of the most}} frequently depicted scenes in Western art. Annunciation scenes also amount to the most frequent appearances of Gabriel in medieval art. The depiction of Joseph turning away in some Nativity scenes is <b>a</b> <b>discreet</b> reference to the fatherhood of the Holy Spirit, and the {{doctrine of}} Virgin Birth.|$|E
