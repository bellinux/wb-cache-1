50|$|An {{impact wrench}} (also {{known as an}} impactor, impact gun, <b>air</b> <b>wrench,</b> air gun, rattle gun, torque gun, windy gun) is a socket wrench power tool {{designed}} to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft.|$|E
50|$|The Miller Genuine Draft 500 {{was held}} July 19 at Pocono Raceway. Davey Allison won the pole. This race {{changed the face}} of the 1992 NASCAR Winston Cup season. Allison had set a new track record during his pole run, then totally {{dominated}} the first 140 laps. An <b>air</b> <b>wrench</b> broke during yellow flag pit stops, putting Allison in seventh for the lap 146 restart. He moved quickly up to fourth on lap 148. But on lap 149, disaster struck. Allison and Darrell Waltrip tangled while jockeying for position exiting turn 2, sending Allison spinning and flipping through the infield grass, and over the inside guardrail. Allison suffered a broken right forearm, a dislocated wrist and a severe concussion. Waltrip drove to victory, and Allison was hospitalized in Pennsylvania for four days. Elliott finished 13th, but took over the points lead for the first time of the year. Allison, his immediate future unknown, now trailed by 13 points.|$|E

5000|$|Impact <b>wrench</b> - An <b>air</b> powered socket <b>wrench</b> that {{delivers}} high torque output by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft. Nearly every auto body or mechanic shop {{will have an}} air compressor and impact wrench to loosen and tighten lug nuts on wheels. [...] Most major tool manufacturers carry an <b>air</b> impact <b>wrench,</b> including DeWalt, Ingersoll, and Craftsman.|$|R
50|$|A {{power wrench}} is type of wrench that {{is powered by}} other means than human force. A typical power source is {{compressed}} air. There are two main types of power wrenches: impact <b>wrenches</b> and <b>air</b> ratchet <b>wrenches</b> or pneumatic ratchet wrenches.|$|R
50|$|An <b>air</b> ratchet <b>wrench</b> is {{very similar}} to hand-powered ratchet {{wrenches}} in that it has the same square drive, but an air motor is attached to turn the socket drive. Pulling the trigger activates the motor which turns the socket drive. A switch is provided to change which direction the socket drive turns.|$|R
5000|$|Pneumatic {{torque wrench}} - Operates like the torque {{multiplier}} but is mated to a pneumatic air motor. It {{is essentially a}} mix of the compressed <b>air</b> powered impact <b>wrench</b> and the traditionally hand operated torque multiplier, delivering aspects of both tools.|$|R

Nobody seemed to be striking or murdering or having violent accidents. The universe was torpid. In these circumstances, the escape of Eustace seemed to present possibilities. Reporters had been sent down. There were three of them {{living in the house}} now, and <b>Wrench's</b> <b>air</b> of disapproval was deepening every hour.|$|R
50|$|S-K Hand Tools is an American tool company {{located in}} Sycamore, Illinois. Major {{products}} include sockets and drive tools, <b>wrenches,</b> <b>air</b> tools, and other mechanics' tools. The {{company has a}} tool line of over 3,500 items including wrenches, ratchets, screwdrivers, tool boxes and air tools. It has manufacturing facilities in Colorado Springs, Colorado and Sycamore, Illinois. Outlets for their products include independent tool-truck dealers, auto parts stores, and major internet vendors such as Sears and Amazon.com.|$|R
5000|$|Compressed air is air {{kept under}} a {{pressure}} that {{is greater than}} atmospheric pressure. Compressed air is an important medium for transfer of energy in industrial processes. Compressed air is used for power tools such as <b>air</b> hammers, drills, <b>wrenches</b> and others. Compressed air is used to atomize paint, to operate air cylinders for automation, and {{can also be used}} to propel vehicles.Brakes applied by compressed air made large railway trains safer and more efficient to operate. Compressed air brakes are also found on large highway vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Torque {{multipliers}} {{are most}} often used when a compressed <b>air</b> powered impact <b>wrench</b> is unavailable due to remote locations without power, or where cost considerations require manually operated tools which do not require any power supply or power source of any kind. There are many instances where screws, bolts and other fasteners are secured so tightly that using a typical lug wrench with a cheater bar {{is not sufficient to}} loosen them. These include automotive repair, product assembly, construction projects, heavy equipment maintenance and other instances where high torque output is needed. A torque multiplier allows the user to generate high torque output without the use of an air compressor or impact gun.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} power tool {{versions}} of [...] "air" [...] (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive <b>air</b> powered socket <b>wrenches</b> which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are impact wrenches {{which are used}} for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric powered impact wrenches for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts. Hydraulic motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called [...] "impact sockets") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness {{so as not to}} shatter under the impacts of the impact tool. They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the hand-tool variety. Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with impact wrenches, presenting a safety risk.|$|R
50|$|Constructed without {{planning}} permission {{during the winter}} of 1997/1998 as part of the secret Brithdir Mawr project, That Roundhouse was discovered by the authorities from the <b>air</b> in 1998. <b>Wrench</b> applied for {{planning permission}} which was turned down and a 10-year legal battle ensued, which included appearances in the magistrates court, county court, crown court, fines, threats of injunctions and a public inquiry. At one point they announced {{that they were going to}} comply with the court and 'deconstruct' the building, however on the day the deconstruction was due to start a well-organised protest was arranged by supporters who threatened to squat the roundhouse to delay its destruction further. During this whole process the National Park was also developing a new more sympathetic policy towards Low Impact development to which Wrenches were providing evidence. Every move in the process led to renewed interest from the media who were generally more sympathetic with the Wrenches than with the authority especially where the chair of the planning authority received planning permission for a large new building within sight of a land around the roundhouse. and in the end the enforcement of the court's original decision was delayed long enough for the park guidance to be approved and finally for the roundhouse to be given planning approval.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the output}} of an impact wrench, when hammering, is a very short impact force, the actual {{effective}} torque is difficult to measure, with several different ratings in use. As the tool delivers a fixed amount of energy with each blow, rather than a fixed torque, the actual output torque changes with {{the duration of the}} output pulse. If the output is springy or capable of absorbing energy, the impulse will simply be absorbed, and virtually no torque will ever be applied, and somewhat counter-intuitively, if the object is very springy, the wrench may actually turn backwards as the energy is delivered back to the anvil, while it is not connected to the hammer and able to spin freely. [...] A wrench that is capable of freeing a rusted nut on a very large bolt may be incapable of turning a small screw mounted on a spring. [...] "Maximum torque" [...] is the number most often given by manufacturers, which is the instantaneous peak torque delivered if the anvil is locked into a perfectly solid object. [...] "Working torque" [...] is a more realistic number for continually driving a very stiff fastener. [...] "Nut-busting torque" [...] is often quoted, with the usual definition being that the wrench can loosen a nut tightened with the specified amount of torque in some specified time period. Accurately controlling the output torque of an impact wrench is very difficult, and even an experienced operator will have a hard time making sure a fastener is not undertightened or overtightened using an impact wrench. Special socket extensions are available, which take advantage of the inability of an impact wrench to work against a spring, to precisely limit the output torque. Designed with spring steel, they act as large torsion springs, flexing at their torque rating, and preventing any further torque from being applied to the fastener. Some impact wrenches designed for product assembly have a built-in torque control system, such as a built-in torsion spring and a mechanism that shuts the tool down when the given torque is exceeded. When very precise torque is required, an impact wrench is only used to snug down the fastener, with a torque wrench used for the final tightening. Due to the lack of standards when measuring the maximum torque, some manufacturers are believed to inflate their ratings, or to use measurements with little bearing on how the tool will perform in actual use. Many <b>air</b> impact <b>wrenches</b> incorporate a flow regulator into their design, either as a separate control or part of the reversing valve, allowing torque to be roughly limited in one or both directions, while electric tools may use a variable speed trigger for the same effect.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the ergonomic risk factors, the prevalence of body discomfort among workers and sources of injury/discomfort in a car tyre service centre. Questionnaire survey and interview session was used to identify the level of body discomfort areas and sources of injury or discomfort. Direct observation was performed by “walk through” inspection using digital camera to evaluate and identify ergonomic risk factors based on work activity. From questionnaire survey findings, the twelve (12) of respondents have body discomfort in the neck (8 each), shoulder (10 each),elbow/forearm (9 each), hand/wrist (11 each), knee (7 each),lower leg (7 each) ankle/foot (4 each) and lower back (9 each). The main sources of injury/discomfort in workplace were poor body posture (75 %), bending the back (75 %), highly repetitive motion (75 %), lifting heavy object (83. 3 %), the long term standing (66. 7 %), long term squatting (58. 3 %), bending the neck (66. 7 %) and high hand force (58. 3 %). About 50 % reported that poor workplace design also contributed to injury while 41. 7 % reported in use of hand tools. Eight (8) pictures were taken by using digital camera for the eight (8) different tasks to identified the ergonomic physical risk factors. Most of the physical risk factors identified were awkward posture from working with the hands above the shoulders, neck bending, bending the back forward, repeated bending, reaching, squatting and kneeling on the hard surface. Lifting heavy objects more than 10 kg, not wearing a hand gloves and exposed to high hand arm vibration when using high impact <b>wrench</b> (<b>air</b> gun) also contributed to the ergonomic physical risk factor. To address modifying the ergonomic hazards, engineering controls and administrative controls can be used. The study will be useful to ergonomists,researchers, consultants, workshop managers, maintenance workers and others concerned with identifying ergonomic risk factor on the workplace...|$|R
40|$|The {{project title}} is to {{evaluate}} an ergonomic on workplace at car tyre service centre. Too {{many people are}} injured while working in automotive workshops. Questionnaire survey on the workers by through interview session is used to identify a level of body discomfort area and sources of injury or uncomfortable feelings. Direct observation is performed by "walk through" inspection using digital camera to evaluate and identify ergonomic risk factor based on work activity that has ergonomic stressors present at the workplace. In particular, the application of Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) is used to evaluate exposures to postures, forces and muscle activities that {{have been shown to}} contribute to Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs). From questionnaire survey findings, the twelve (12) of respondents have body discomfort in the neck (8 each), shoulder (10 each), elbow/forearm (9 each), hand/wrist (11 each), knee (7 each), lower leg (7 each) ankle/foot (4 each) and lower back (9 each). The main sources of injury/uncomfortable feeling in workplace are poor body posture (75 %), bending the back (75 %), highly repetitive motion (75 %), heavy lifting object (83. 3 %), the long term standing (66. 7 %), long term squatting (58. 3 %), bending the neck (66. 7 %) and high hand force (58. 3 %). And about 50 % reported that poor workplace design was contributed to source of injury while 41. 7 % reported in use of hand tools. Eight (8) pictures were taken by using digital camera for the eight (8) different tasks to identify the ergonomic physical risk factors. Most of the physical risk factors identified were awkward posture from working with the hands above the shoulders, neck bending, bending the back forward, repeated bending, reaching, squatting and kneeling on the hard surface. Lifting heavy objects more than 10 kg, not wearing a hand gloves and exposed to high hand arm vibration when using high impact <b>wrench</b> (<b>air</b> gun) also contributed to the ergonomic physical risk factor. The REBA analysis showed, mostly in a score of eleven (11), very high risk which require action to be taken immediately. This study also includes controlling, minimizing and eliminating the risks of work-related entire body disorders exposure. There is a two hierarchy of controls that are widely accepted for modifying ergonomic hazards in which are engineering controls and administrative controls. Engineering controls involve changing the workstation layout, selection and use of tools, position of process materials, or work methods used to complete a task. Administrative controls are policies or practices directed by management that can reduce or prevent exposure to ergonomics risk factors. The study will be useful to ergonomists, researchers, consultants, workshop managers, maintenance workers and others concerned with ergonomics design in workplace...|$|R
