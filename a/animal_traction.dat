40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impacts of access to {{inventory}} credit (warrantage), input supply shops, fertilizer micro-dosing demonstrations, and other factors on farmers' use of inorganic and organic fertilizer in Niger, and the impacts on crop yields. We find that access to warrantage and input shops and participation in fertilizer micro-dosing demonstrations have increased use of inorganic fertilizer. Access to off-farm employment and ownership of <b>traction</b> <b>animals</b> also contribute to use of inorganic fertilizer. Use of organic fertilizer is less affected by these factors, but is substantially affected by the household's crop mix, access to the plot, ownership of durable assets, labor and land endowments, and participation in farmers' associations. Land tenure influences both inorganic and organic inputs, with less of both on sharecropped and encroached plots. Inorganic fertilizer has {{a positive impact on}} millet yields, with an estimated marginal value-cost ratio greater than 3, indicating significant profitability. Organic fertilizer has a positive impact on millet-cowpea yields. We find little evidence of complementarity between inorganic and organic fertilizer. Since warrantage, input supply shops and fertilizer micro-dosing demonstrations increase use of inorganic fertilizer which in turn increases millet yields, these interventions indirectly increase millet yields, although the impacts are relatively small. These findings support promoting increased input use through promotion of inventory credit, input supply shops and fertilizer micro-dosing demonstrations. Other interventions that could help to boost productivity include promotion of improved access to farm equipment and <b>traction</b> <b>animals</b> and improved access to land under secure tenure.

50|$|Cattle races may be portable, {{or may be}} a {{permanent}} fixture with a concrete walkway. Portable races may be made of steel, iron or aluminium; but modern permanent ones are usually of steel or iron (sometimes timber or even concrete) which is usually set in concrete, with solid or railed sides and a non-slip floor. Anti-bruise races do not have sharp edges, and instead use pipe with rounded edges such as oval rails; alternatively sides with sheet iron or steel can be found or built onto the races, which improves livestock movement and also prevents injuries from animals getting their legs or heads caught between the rails. Races that have concrete floors have the flooring made wider than the race itself to prevent hooves catching between the bottom rail and {{the edge of the}} concrete.

40|$|AbstractThree-dimensional {{cell culture}} is {{becoming}} mainstream {{as it is}} recognized that many animal cell types require the biophysical and biochemical cues within the extracellular matrices to perform truly physiologically realistic functions. However, tools for characterizing cellular mechanical environment are largely limited to cell culture plated on a two-dimensional substrate. We present a three-dimensional traction microscopy {{that is capable of}} mapping three-dimensional stress and strain within a soft and transparent extracellular matrix using a fluorescence microscope and a simple forward data analysis algorithm. We validated this technique by mapping the strain and stress field within the bulk of a thin polyacrylamide gel layer indented by a millimeter-size glass ball, together with a finite-element analysis. The experimentally measured stress and strain fields are in excellent agreements with results of the finite-element simulation. The unique contributions of the presented three-dimensional traction microscopy technique are: 1), the use of a fluorescence microscope in contrast with the confocal microscope that is required for the current three-dimensional traction microscopes in the literature; 2), the determination of the pressure field of an incompressible gel from strains; and 3), the simple forward-data-analysis algorithm.

40|$|One {{alternative}} approach to diversify agricultural production is to integrate cropping with livestock {{production at the}} farm scale. Cropping, when possible, tends to become more important than animal production because, in general, it can feed more people per area unit in terms of calories and protein.

The paper summarizes the current state of mixed crop-livestock farming and assesses the factors affecting sustainability of crop-livestock farming, such as seasonal forage availability or suboptimal pasture utilization due to overgrazing, and emphasizes that Prespa area agriculture is essentially characterized by mixed farm operations in which crops and animals play an important part. This paper also assess future challenges, determine new opportunities, and present some remedies for sustainable intensification of crop-livestock systems, considers how the application of practices in sustainable crop-livestock farming may contribute to promoting sustainable land use and improving environment conservation, natural resource management, livelihoods of crop-livestock producers, and product quality.

50|$|C. elegans is unsegmented, , and bilaterally symmetrical. It has a cuticle (a tough outer covering, as an exoskeleton), {{four main}} {{epidermal}} cords, and a fluid-filled pseudocoelom (body cavity). It {{also has some}} of the same organ systems as larger animals. About one in a thousand individuals is male and the rest are hermaphrodites. The basic anatomy of C. elegans includes a mouth, pharynx, intestine, gonad, and collagenous cuticle. Like all nematodes, they have neither a circulatory nor a respiratory system. The four bands of muscles that run the length of the body are connected to a neural system that allows the muscles to move the animal's body only as dorsal bending or ventral bending, but not left or right, except for the head, where the four muscle quadrants are wired independently from one another. When a wave of dorsal/ventral muscle contractions proceeds from the back {{to the front of the}} animal, the animal is propelled backwards. When a wave of contractions is initiated at the front and proceeds posteriorly along the body, the animal is propelled forwards. Because of this dorsal/ventral bias in body bends, any normal living, moving individual tends to lie on either its left side or its right side when observed crossing a horizontal surface. A set of ridges on the lateral sides of the body cuticle, the alae, are believed to give the <b>animal</b> added <b>traction</b> during these bending motions.|$|R
30|$|Cropping is a {{controversial}} option for pastoralists in Ethiopia. On the one hand, government studies argue that transforming pastoralism to a sedenteralized farming system diversifies pastoralists’ income, enables {{them access to}} modern education and health, provides manure fertilizer, increases feed availability, minimizes the need of animal slaughtering for food, and ultimately improves livelihoods (Mohammed, M., 2004. A comparative study of pastoralist parliamentary groups: Case study on the pastoral affairs standing committee of Ethiopia, unpublished; Fratkin and Smith 1995; Smith 1999). While Coppock (1994) and Angassa and Oba (2008) argue that expansion of crop cultivation into pastoral areas has constrained mobility by removing the most productive lands from the grazing herds and has eroded pastoralist populations. Furthermore, shifting to crops is difficult due to a shortage of labour lack of sufficient <b>traction</b> <b>animals,</b> and unreliable rainfall to cultivate crops. As a result, these authors argue, sedentarized farming systems mean the pastoral community becomes poorer than under traditional pure pastoralist systems.|$|R

30|$|The {{major factors}} {{constraining}} crop {{production in the}} Borana Zone include lack of rainfall, grazing land decrements, presence of different harmful agricultural pests, {{lack of access to}} well-functioning markets, population growth, lack of agricultural inputs, land competition due to crop cultivation, and issues over climate change. Similarly, Coppock (1994) indicated that the Borana system appears to be becoming more unstable and less reliable for supporting livelihoods due to both external and internal factors. Despite these problems, key informants stated that if the production activity is properly handled, crop and livestock production can complement each other as sources of food and cash income. In this way, if grain is produced on each farm, there is reduced need for selling animals to buy grain for human consumption or slaughtering animals as sources of food. Thus crops can supplement the family diet and cash income of the agro-pastoralists. Moreover, crop residues can be used as feed for animals and the manure {{can be used as a}} fertilizer, thereby enhancing soil fertility and crop production. <b>Animals</b> also provide <b>traction</b> power for land cultivation for crop production.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impacts of access to inventory credit, input supply shops, fertilizer microdosing demonstrations, and other factors on farmers' use of inorganic fertilizer and other inputs in Niger and on crop yields. We found that access to inventory credit and input supply shops has increased the use of inorganic fertilizer and seeds and that microdosing demonstrations have increased the use of inorganic fertilizer. Ownership of <b>traction</b> <b>animals</b> and access to off-farm employment have {{also contributed to the}} use of inorganic fertilizer, while larger farms use less fertilizer and labor per hectare. The impacts of these interventions and technologies depend on the crop mix. Inorganic fertilizer has a positive impact on millet and millet–cowpea yields when applied using microdosing, with an estimated marginal value-cost ratio greater than 3 for those crops indicating significant profitability. By contrast, microdosing has a negative impact on yields of the millet–sorghum–cowpea intercrop, suggesting that microdosing should not be promoted when sorghum is part of the crop mix. However, better access to input supply shops has contributed to higher yields of the millet–sorghum–cowpea intercrop. The predicted effect of inventory credit on farmers' income as a result of increased inorganic fertilizer use is an increase of 5, 000 to 10, 000 FCFA per hectare (about US$ 10 to US$ 20 per hectare in 2005) in millet or millet–cowpea production. Similarly, being 10 km closer to an input supply shop is predicted to increase farmers' income by 3, 200 to 4, 500 FCFA per hectare. These benefits do {{not take into account the}} impacts of the interventions on seeds or other inputs, which are also generally positive. The positive impacts are linked to the use of fertilizer microdosing, which has increased the productivity of fertilizer use in millet and millet–cowpea production, indicating synergies among the various interventions. They are also linked to these specific crops, because we found less favorable impacts of these interventions for the millet–sorghum–cowpea intercrop and for peanuts. Other interventions that could help to boost the use of inputs and productivity include promotion of improved access to farm equipment and <b>traction</b> <b>animals</b> and promotion of higher-value crops such as hibiscus.

Measuring these traction forces requires a workflow combining cell experiments, image processing and force reconstruction based on elasticity theory. Such procedures have already been established mainly for planar substrates, in which case one can use the Green's function formalism. Here we introduce a workflow to measure traction forces of cardiac myofibroblasts on non-planar elastic substrates. Soft elastic substrates with a wave-like topology were micromoulded from polydimethylsiloxane and fluorescent marker beads were distributed homogeneously in the substrate. Using feature vector-based tracking of these marker beads, we first constructed a hexahedral mesh for the substrate. We then solved the direct elastic boundary volume problem on this mesh using the finite-element method. Using data simulations, we show that the traction forces can be reconstructed from the substrate deformations by solving the corresponding inverse problem with an L 1 -norm for the residue and an L 2 -norm for a zeroth-order Tikhonov regularization. Applying this procedure to the experimental data, we find that cardiac myofibroblast cells tend to align both their shapes and their forces with the long axis of the deformable wavy substrate...|$|R

This changing role of animals in the sustainability of agriculture is addressed in this paper to discuss options and constraints for animal production in newly developing farming systems. Based on a brief literature review, this paper discusses how and in which way ruminant livestock has played or can continue {{to play a role in}} (newly developing forms of) sustainable agriculture. The role of livestock in different modes of agriculture ranging from expanded agriculture (EXPAGR), and high external inputs agriculture (HEIA) to low external inputs agriculture (LEIA), and new conservation agriculture (NCA) are elaborated. It is argued that even when fossil reserves based external inputs such as oil and fertilisers become more widely used, they should still be used with care to save money and finite resources as well as to avoid problems of waste disposal. However, in conditions with limited access to resources, it continues to be difficult to obtain inputs from fossil reserves. Under these conditions, the major options to increase system sustainability by reducing pollution problems and dependency on external resources are (a) to adjust ways and objectives of production systems to the access to resources, and (b) to achieve increased use and recycling of resources within the system itself. Definitions for sustainability are given and translated into four criteria, i. e. food production and degree of self-sufficiency in the short term based on energy, protein, clothing, shelter, etc.; food production and degree of self-sufficiency in the long term expressed in the form of soil organic matter (SOM) content; reduced dependence of external inputs (=nitrogen use); and aspects of resilience, stability and equity in crop–livestock systems.
