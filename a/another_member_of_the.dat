In {{retaliation}} for Soběslav's role in Géza's capture, Emperor Frederick dethroned Soběslav and appointed <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Přemyslid dynasty, Frederick, {{to the position of}} duke. The Holy Roman Emperor ordered the new Duke of Austria, Leopold V, to storm Bohemia. Béla soon intervened, threatening Leopold V with an invasion, which forced Leopold to leave Bohemia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the face}} of {{neighbourhood}} gossip about the death rate in the home, Catherine, Margaret, and Thomas moved their household to 105 Latimer Street and then again to 27 Ascot street. In September 1883, Thomas Higgins, then 45, became yet <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> household to fall mysteriously ill. His stomach pains were severe enough that Doctor Whitford was called; the doctor attributed Higgins's illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap whiskey and prescribed opium and castor oil. Higgins died {{after two days of}} illness. Days later, the same doctor was contacted and asked to provide a death certificate. He did so, attributing the death to dysentery.|$|E

5|$|Remains of Megalomys audreyae {{were found}} by John Walter Gregory among cave breccia on Barbuda around 1900. The exact {{locality}} is unknown. In his 1901 description of Oryzomys luciae, Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major mentioned the Barbuda animal as <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Megalomys group, {{but he never}} published {{a description of the}} latter. Édouard Louis Trouessart gave the name Oryzomys (Megalomys) majori to it in his Catalogus Mammalium, but he did not describe it and therefore the name is a nomen nudum. In 1926, Arthur Hopwood finally described it and named it Megalomys audreyae after Gregory's wife Audrey, following Major's intention.|$|E

5|$|Working {{with the}} Archbishop of Gniezno, Jakub Świnka, he sought the {{unification}} of the principalities of the Piast dynasty. Unexpectedly, in 1290, under the will of Henryk IV Probus, he managed to obtain the Duchy of Kraków and with this the title of High Duke of Poland; however, not having sufficient support from the local nobility (who supported <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Piast dynasty, Władysław I the Elbow-high) and faced with the increasing threats of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, Przemysł II finally decided to retreat from Lesser Poland, which was then {{under the rule of}} Přemyslid dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E

5|$|During the {{training}} expedition, Shaw's group came to Walla Brook at a crossing near Watern Tor in the north-east of Dartmoor. According to evidence given at Shaw's inquest in 2009, the group {{believed they had}} to cross because the alternative route would add at least four miles to the trek. <b>Another</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group got into difficulties crossing the stream, which, due to heavy rain, had swollen to approximately five times its normal size.

5|$|Finally on 10 June 1917, Charles Jonnart, the Entente's High Commissioner in Greece, ordered King Constantine {{to give up}} his power. On {{the threat}} of Entente forces landing in Piraeus, the king conceded and agreed to go into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while {{determined}} to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the natural heir, was ruled out by the Allies because they thought him too pro-German, like his father. Instead, they considered installing Constantine's brother (and Alexander's uncle), Prince George, but he had tired of public life during his difficult tenure as High Commissioner of Crete between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne. As a result, Constantine's second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.|$|E

It has been lent out for exhibitions to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1976, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm in 1979–1980, and Paris (Grand Palais), New York (Metropolitan) and the Tate in London in 1990.
