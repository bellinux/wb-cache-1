40|$|A {{system to}} use contextual {{information}} {{to improve the}} level of sort achievable with a machine-printed address block is described. The USPS ZIP+ 4 database is searched for records corresponding to different information fields found in the address. The amount of contextual information depends on the configuration (nature of the address fields) within the address block. Three major configurations of address blocks have been defined {{by the presence of}} a street <b>address,</b> <b>PO</b> <b>Box,</b> [...] or Rural Route. Of these, the street address case is the most challenging because of the need for street name recognition, as well as digit recognition. Making use of word recognition algorithms developed at SUNY /Buffalo, the system attempts to recognize th,e street name, street suffix, and the city name. These recognition results are then used in a search of the USPS ZIP+ 4 database. By constraining the search to only valid combinations of words and numbers from the ZIP+ 4 database and by setting thresholds on confidence values, the search converges to a single best choice without a complete expansion of the search tree, thus aVOiding combinatorial explosion. 1...|$|R

40|$|European postal {{markets are}} to be {{completely}} liberalized {{by the end of}} 2012 at the latest. At the same time national regulatory frameworks are being adapted to the new requirements.

In this respect the postal sector is often compared to the telecoms sector. However, {{the differences between the two}} industries are so great that regulation of telecommunications cannot be transferred to the mail sector. Obligations to provide network access and regulations on final prices in particular can scarcely be justified in the mail sector.
