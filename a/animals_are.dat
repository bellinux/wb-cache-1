30|$|Anaesthetized rats {{underwent}} the sCASP procedure, whereas sham <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> sham operated {{and control}} <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> just monitored invasively. Haemodynamic variables and blood gases were continuously measured. After 24 h, <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> reanesthetized; cardiac output (CO), inulin and PAH clearances were measured {{and later on}} kidneys were harvested; and creatinine, urea, cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were analysed. Additional sCASP-treated <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> investigated after 3 and 9 days.|$|R
30|$|Twenty-four intact male {{yearling}} Washera sheep {{with similar}} body condition and initial body weight of 18.14 [*]± 1.07  kg (mean[*]±[*]SD) were bought {{from a local}} market of Genet Abo town. Age of the <b>animals</b> <b>was</b> determined by dentition and information obtained by the owners. <b>Animals</b> <b>were</b> neck tagged for identification, and were quarantined for 21 days. During this time, <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> dewormed for internal parasites using albendazol and fasinex and sprayed for external parasites using diazinon. Experimental <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> also vaccinated against pasteurollosis and anthrax based on recommendation of a veterinarian. After the quarantine period, <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> housed individually in separate pens.|$|R
5|$|<b>Animals</b> <b>are</b> {{raised for}} a wide variety of products, principally meat, wool, milk, and eggs, but also {{including}} tallow, isinglass and rennet. <b>Animals</b> <b>are</b> also kept for more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines and antiserum (containing antibodies) for medical use. Where fodder or other crops are grown alongside animals, manure can serve as a fertiliser, returning minerals and organic matter to the soil in a semi-closed organic system.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, 982,842 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> used in {{research}} in Sweden. If fish used in sample-based fishery surveys <b>are</b> included, 5,535,458 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> used.|$|R
5|$|Several <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> {{unique to}} Craters of the Moon and the {{surrounding}} area.

25|$|In most cases, the Purkinje neurons {{begin to}} die off {{shortly after the}} <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> born and the {{condition}} is noticeable when the <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> {{less than six months}} old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms is gradual and the <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem.|$|R
50|$|For instance, <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> a {{generalization}} of bird because every bird <b>is</b> an <b>animal,</b> and there <b>are</b> <b>animals</b> which <b>are</b> not birds (dogs, for instance). (See also: Specialisation (biology)).|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, the Society made a {{commitment}} to become a no-kill shelter, disclosing detailed statistics including [...] "No Kill Equation" [...] topics, such as the number of animals in foster care, and numbers of feral cats benefiting from trap-neuter-return. In 2010, the organization reported saving 81.8% of the animals leaving its custody, while 50 healthy or treatable <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> euthanized. These numbers were a significant improvement over a 65% save rate in 2009, when 301 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> euthanized for space. In 2012, the organization reported saving 91.2% of animals leaving its custody, although 12 healthy or treatable <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> euthanized.

5|$|Among {{many other}} things, he gave {{accurate}} {{descriptions of the}} four-chambered stomachs of ruminants, and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the dogfish. His accounts of about 35 <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently detailed to convince biologists that he dissected those species, indeed vivisecting some; he mentions the internal anatomy of roughly 110 animals in total.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is {{the general}} appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> brightly coloured, while others are hard to see. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{testing has}} also {{included}} {{the use of}} placebo testing. In these cases <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> treated with a substance that produces no pharmacological effect, but is administered {{in order to determine}} any biological alterations due to the experience of a substance being administered, and the results are compared with those obtained with an active compound.|$|E
50|$|Testing {{cosmetics}} on <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> currently {{legal in}} the US. The Humane Cosmetics Act to prohibit testing cosmetics on <b>animals</b> <b>was</b> re-introduced to Congress in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} element in their culture is nagualism. When a baby is born {{it is said that}} at the same time an <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> born and that that <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> the nahual of the child. No one except the child knows which <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> its nahual because the nahual will only show itself to the child in its dreams.|$|R

5|$|Both {{plant and}} animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the {{adaptive}} mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.|$|E
5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because this is what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E
50|$|Not all the <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> ferocious, {{though most}} <b>were.</b> <b>Animals</b> that {{appeared}} in the venatio included lions, elephants, bears, tigers, deer, wild goats, dogs, and rabbits. Some of these <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> trained, and instead of fighting, performed tricks.|$|R
40|$|In England, {{owners of}} farm <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> {{required}} to fence them in; if an animal damaged someone else’s property, {{the owner of}} the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> liable in court. In comparatively thinly-settled colonial America, however, <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> allowed to run free, and farmers had to build fences around their crops or gardens; if an animal damaged property without a fence around it, {{the owner of the}} <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> not guilty of a tort. As settlement patterns became more dense, however, movements to adopt the English system of “stock laws” spread...|$|R
30|$|The animals {{underwent}} up to 7  days of acclimatization {{prior to}} study start. The body weights of the <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> recorded. All <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> confirmed {{to be in}} good health.|$|R
5|$|Habitats in Boise National Forest support nearly 300 {{terrestrial}} vertebrate {{species and}} 28 fish species. The most common large <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> mule deer and elk, but other mammals present include moose, black bears, cougar, coyote, yellow-bellied marmot, beaver, porcupine, Canadian lynx, mountain goat, pika, river otter, muskrat, pronghorn, mink, bobcat, marten, and timber wolves.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. <b>Animals</b> <b>are</b> used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E
5|$|In several cultures, {{goods for}} use in the afterlife are still interred or cremated, for example Hell bank notes in East Asian communities. In Ghana, mostly among the Ga people, {{elaborate}} figurative coffins in the shape of cars, boats or <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> made of wood. These were introduced in the 1950s by Seth Kane Kwei.|$|E

30|$|In total, 24 <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> {{subjected}} to CA and resuscitated using CPB. Those <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> randomized into the sham (n[*]=[*] 8), the CVVH (n[*]=[*] 8), and the HVHF (n[*]=[*] 8) groups. Basal characteristics and resuscitation data {{are shown in}} Additional file 4 : Table E 1. There {{were no significant differences}} between groups. All <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> successfully resuscitated by CPB and survived more than 6  h after resuscitation.
