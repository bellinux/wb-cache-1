5|$|McCall {{brought in}} seven new signings in pre-season, {{as well as}} a number of loan players, but from September to November, the club failed to win in eight games, leaving them in 21st place in League Two.

5|$|Middleton-led Texas A went 24-9 <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the NCAA Tournament Round of 64 to Florida State 57-50, in {{a contest}} in which Middleton contributed 16 points.

5|$|On April 26, 2006 Martin {{announced}} {{the breakup of}} his long-time, Olympic silver medalist team of lead Don Bartlett, second Carter Rycroft and third Don Walchuk. The team had disappointed at the 2005 Trials, had not won a single Grand Slam title in the 2005–06 season, and topped it off by finishing fourth at the Brier. Martin replaced Walchuk, Rycroft and Bartlett with World Junior Champion skip John Morris at third, Marc Kennedy at second and Ben Hebert at lead. His new team won the 2007 Alberta provincials, and at their first Brier, the team finished the round robin with an 8–3 win-loss record in second place, tied with Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador. The new team struggled at the 2007 Brier in Hamilton, <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the 3 vs. 4 game to Jeff Stoughton, 6–3. Despite their Brier failure, however, the season was a success on the World Curling Tour, where they won {{three of the four}} Grand Slams. During the 2006–07 and 2007–08 curling seasons, Martin and his team won an unprecedented five consecutive Grand Slams, three in the 2006–07 season and two in the 2007–08 season.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, it was {{reported}} that Schroeder intended to leave the University of Minnesota and join the Everett Silvertips, a team in the major junior Western Hockey League. This was denied by Schroeder, who wanted to spend at least another year with the Golden Gophers.

5|$|The 1999–2000 season {{proved to}} be a {{frustrating}} one for both Arsenal and Bergkamp. The club finished second in the league, 18 points behind Manchester United, <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the 2000 UEFA Cup Final to Turkish opponents Galatasaray on penalties. The departure of compatriot Marc Overmars and French midfielder Emmanuel Petit in the close season led to speculation over Bergkamp's future. He ultimately agreed terms on a contract extension in December 2000. Despite an array of new signings made in the 2000–01 season, Arsenal were runners-up in the league for a third year in succession. The emergence of Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord as the main strikers saw Bergkamp's first-team opportunities limited as a result. He was used as a late substitute in Liverpool's win over Arsenal in the 2001 FA Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|The Golden State Warriors are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Oakland, California. The franchise {{had been known}} as the Philadelphia Warriors and the San Francisco Warriors, due to it previously being based in or near those cities. The team {{is a member of}} the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Warriors initially joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946, and won the first BAA championship title in the same year under coach Edward Gottlieb. The Warriors later joined the NBA at its foundation in 1949. The Warriors' record was 26–42 in their first NBA season <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the first round of the playoffs to the Syracuse Nationals. Franklin Mieuli and the Diners Club put together a group of 40 local investors to move the Warriors to San Francisco before the 1962–63 NBA season, with Mieuli eventually buying all the shares of the franchise to keep the team from collapsing and to keep it in the area. The team became the Golden State Warriors and moved to Oakland before the 1971–72 NBA season.|$|E
