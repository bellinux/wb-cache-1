5|$|Some {{critics have}} noted {{similarities}} between names in Septimus Heap {{and those in}} Harry Potter, such as Petroc Trelawney (Jenna's pet rock) and Sybill Trelawney (a professor in Harry Potter); also both series feature Boggarts (which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape-shifters in Harry Potter). In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is nothing at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise will be known over the air. Think: why would Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly logical... And as for Boggarts, they've been around here in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example. They're not really like either Sage's or Rowling's creatures, but pre-exist either of them.|$|E

500|$|Mwng was {{eventually}} released on 15 May 2000 in the United Kingdom on CD, cassette, and vinyl, and reached number 11 in the UK Albums Chart. In the United States, Mwng {{was released on}} 20 June 2000 by Flydaddy, with a bonus CD entitled Mwng Bach ( [...] ; English: Little Mane) featuring five Welsh language tracks: [...] "Sali Mali", from the 1995 EP Moog Droog, and four songs which had originally been released in the UK as B-sides. [...] This two-disc version of Mwng was reissued in the US in 2005 by XL Recordings/Beggars Banquet US. [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] was released as the only single from the album, and failed to chart inside the UK Singles Top 75. Although the Super Furry Animals had [...] "no commercial expectations" [...] for the album, Mwng became the first Welsh-language record to reach the Top 20 of the UK album charts, and has frequently been called the biggest-selling Welsh language album of all time. As {{a result of the}} record's success, Mwng was mentioned in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by Plaid Cymru's Elfyn Llwyd, who called on his fellow politicians to congratulate the band on their [...] "chart topping new album" [...] and recognise Mwng as a celebration of a [...] "new wave of confidence in the Welsh nation". Rhys dismissed Llwyd's statement, saying that the record is very personal and has [...] "bugger <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a celebration".|$|E

Polanyi further {{asserted that}} all knowledge is personal and therefore the scientist must be performing a very personal if not necessarily subjective role when doing science. Polanyi added that the scientist often merely follows intuitions of [...] "intellectual beauty, symmetry, and 'empirical agreement'". Polanyi held that science requires moral commitments {{similar to those found}} in religion.|$|E

[...] Graham Cornes who was coached by Kerley for South Australia, has stated his hatred for Victoria came from Neil Kerley. Cornes {{would go on to}} coach South Australia, with great successes and was a promoter of the South Australian team.

2500|$|According to Avi Primor, {{president}} of the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, Grass was the only important German cultural figure who had refused {{to meet with him}} when he served as Israeli ambassador to Germany. Primor noted: [...] "One explanation for [...] strange behavior might be found in the fact that Grass (who despite his poem is probably not the bitter enemy of Israel that one would imagine) had certain personal difficulties with Israel." [...] Primor said that during Grass's earlier visit to Israel, he [...] "was confronted with the anger of an Israeli public that booed him in successive public appearances. To be sure, the Israeli protestors were not targeting Grass personally and their anger had nothing at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his literature. It was the German effort to establish cultural relations with Israel to which they objected. Grass, however, did not see it that way and may well have felt personally slighted." ...|$|E

Several women of social standing were listed as patronesses such as the Duchess of Buccleuch, Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury, Dowager Countess Harcourt, Lady Emily Pusey, Lady Eyre and Lady Mackintosh. At this meeting Richard Martin contradicted the impression held in public circles that he had founded the Society: [...] "I have nothing at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it," [...] he said [...] "it is quite a child of Mr Broome's and he has acted the part of a good father to it." [...] Broome also sought that year to develop an anti-vivisection position and requested written advice from several medical practitioners concerning the efficacy of surgical or laboratory experiments on animals and received letters that did not support vivisection.|$|E

2500|$|After the Reactionaries disbanded, Boon and Watt formed Minutemen in January 1980. Watt {{has said}} their name had nothing at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the brevity of their songs; rather, it was derived partly from the fabled minutemen militia of colonial times and partly to lampoon a right-wing reactionary {{group of the}} 1960s that went by that name. In the {{documentary}} We Jam Econo, Watt also states that the name was a play on [...] "minute" [...] ( [...] ). After a month with no drummer, during which Boon and Watt wrote their first songs, the band rehearsed and played a couple of early gigs with local welder Frank Tonche on drums. The group had originally wanted George Hurley to join, but he had joined a hardcore punk band called Hey Taxi! with Michael Ely and Spider Taylor after the Reactionaries disbanded. Tonche quit the group, citing a dislike of the audience the band initially drew, and Hurley took over as drummer in June 1980. (Early rehearsal recordings with Tonche on drums later became the georgeless EP.) Their first live gig was as an opening band for Black Flag.|$|E
2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{inside the}} house suddenly turned ugly when Dillon asked the teenagers what they felt about the LVF killing of UVF Mid-Ulster brigadier Richard Jameson, {{who had been a}} successful businessman and was extremely popular in the Portadown area. McIlwaine remained silent, however Robb had replied [...] "so fucking what, it's got fuck <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> me" [...] which Dillon had taken exception to. When he informed Robb that Jameson had been his good friend, Robb had made further disparaging comments which also angered Brown. Brown, out of earshot of the teenagers, had decided to assault Robb in retaliation, saying he would [...] "punch the head off Andrew". Neither Robb nor McIlwaine {{had been a member of}} any loyalist paramilitary organisation, although Robb had tenuous links to the LVF having been an associate of Billy Wright, and even photographed in 1996 at a march led by Wright. Writers Henry McDonald and Ian S. Wood alleged that, unknown to the teenagers, a UVF unit had gone to [...] "The Spot" [...] to seek out two known LVF individuals rumoured to have been involved in Jameson's killing; however, they had already left the nightclub by the time the UVF arrived. The UVF men encountered Robb and McIlwaine instead, and targeted them as LVF members implicated in Jameson's death.|$|E
2500|$|Manchester United {{were unable}} to defend their FA Cup title the {{following}} season, having instead been invited {{to compete in the}} inaugural FIFA Club World Championship in Brazil. The Football Association (FA) encouraged the club {{to take part in the}} new tournament as they believed it would help their bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Alex Ferguson initially suggested that The FA could allow his team a bye to a later round of the competition to help alleviate the fixture congestion that would arise from entering both competitions, but the FA suggested that Manchester United simply pull out of the FA Cup altogether, putting the club in what chairman Martin Edwards called a [...] "no-win" [...] situation. Edwards said: [...] "We're going to get criticised whatever we do. If we don't go people will say that we are selfish and only looking after ourselves and not prepared to help the 2006 World Cup bid. But we will also be criticised if we say we're not going to compete in the FA Cup." [...] The offer was also criticised by Manchester United fans, with Andy Walsh of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association saying: [...] "They've shown very little offer of help in the past when United have looked to ease their fixture congestion. This blinding conversion is <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the 2006 campaign." ...|$|E

I saw it a couple years ago, and it was called 'Ceremonials' and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of stuck with me, and I think {{the whole idea of}} performance, and kind of putting on this outfit and going out almost to find some sort of exorcism or absolution, to kind of get outside yourself, there's a sense of ceremony to it." [...] Welch also revealed that she wanted to call the album Violence, stating, [...] "I wanted to make an album that sounded like the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, the violence mixed with the classical Shakespearean drama mixed with the pop and the pulp, extreme neon stuff." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she described the album as [...] "much bigger" [...] and categorised its genre as [...] "chamber soul", a mixture of chamber pop and soul. The liner notes of Ceremonials contain an essay by English writer Emma Forrest, dated 21 September 2011.|$|E
