These QIs epitomize an evidence-based and somatic point of view of guided treatment, but {{little is known about the}} experiences and views of patients with their guideline-based treatment across multiple health care sectors. Objective: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore patient perspectives on guided treatment of CHF across multiple health care sectors. Furthermore, it was investigated to what extent patient perspectives are represented by the QIs of the German NDMG. Methods: Using a qualitative approach, semistructured interviews were carried out with 17 CHF patients. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Patient-identified needs focused primarily on aspects like the doctor–patient relationship, communication, quality of individual-tailored information, and professional advice. Patients perceived shortcomings in processes of care such as communication and cooperation <b>across</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sectors,</b> especially at the transition between hospital and outpatient care. Discussion: From the patient perspectives, the QIs do represent relevant somatic and clinical aims for quality measurement. However, deficits were identified, especially related to communication and cooperation <b>across</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sectors.</b> Given the fact that the inclusion of patient perspectives in quality improvement processes provides an important contribution to patient-centered health care, possible approaches for QI development such as direct and indirect patient involvement or generic vs disease-specific patient-related QIs should be the subject of future discussions.

40|$|Background. Non-attendance at {{paediatric}} hospital outpatient appointments poses potential risks to children's health and welfare. Prevention {{and management of}} missed appointments depends on the perceptions of clinicians and decision makers from both primary and secondary care, including general practitioners (GPs) who are integral to non-attendance follow-up. Objectives. To examine the views of clinical, managerial and executive health care staff regarding occurrence and management of non-attendance at general paediatric outpatient clinics. Methods. A qualitative study using individual semi-structured interviews was carried out at three English Primary Care Trusts and a nearby children's hospital. Interviews were conducted with 37 staff, including GPs, hospital doctors, other health care professionals, managers, executives and commissioners. Participants were recruited through purposive and 'snowball' sampling methods. Data were analysed following a thematic framework approach. Results. GPs focused on situational difficulties for families, while hospital-based staff emphasized the influence of parents' beliefs on attendance. Managers, executives and commissioners presented a broad overview of both factors, but with less detailed views. All groups discussed sociodemographic factors, with non-attendance thought to be more likely in 'chaotic families'. Hospital interviewees emphasized child protection issues {{and the need for}} thorough follow-up of missed appointments. However, GPs were reluctant to interfere with parental responsibilities. Conclusion. Parental motivation and practical and social barriers should be considered. Responsibilities regarding missed appointments are not clear <b>across</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sectors,</b> but GPs are uniquely placed to address non-attendance issues and are central to child safeguarding. Primary care policies and strategies could be introduced to reduce non-attendance and ensure children receive the care they require. © The Author 2013...|$|E

40|$|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples {{comprise}} about 2. 4 % of the Australian population. There {{is little}} information about stroke among these groups of people. Most information comes from national mortality and hospital morbidity data, and population-based surveys of risk factors. Hospitalisations for stroke among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are 1 - 2 -fold that of non-indigenous males and 1. 9 -fold that of non-indigenous females. Similarly, deaths from stroke are greater among Indigenous Australians, being approximately {{double that of}} non-Indigenous Australians. The disparity in stroke deaths is greatest among younger individuals. Differences in hospitalisations and mortality from stroke {{can be attributed to}} both a greater prevalence of modifiable risk factors for stroke among the Indigenous population and poorer access to acute care services.

40|$|Introduction: Frail {{elderly are}} {{at higher risk}} of {{negative}} outcomes such as disability, low quality of life, and hospital admissions. Furthermore, a peak in readmission of acutely admitted elderly patients is seen shortly after discharge. An investigation into the daily life experiences of the frail elderly shortly after discharge seems important to address these issues. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore how frail elderly patients experience daily life 1 week after discharge from an acute admission. Methods: The qualitative methodological approach was interpretive description. Data were gathered using individual interviews. The participants were frail elderly patients over 65 years of age, who were interviewed at their home 1 week after discharge from an acute admission to a medical ward. Results: Four main categories were identified: “The system,” “Keeping a social life,” “Being in everyday life,” and “Handling everyday life. ” These categories affected the way the frail elderly experienced daily life and these elements resulted in a general feeling of well-being or non-well-being. The transition to home was experienced as unsafe and troublesome especially for the more frail participants, whereas the less frail experienced this less. Conclusion and discussion: Several elements and stressors were affecting the well-being of the participants in daily life 1 week after discharge. In particular, contact with the health care system created frustrations and worries, but also physical disability, loneliness, and inactivity were issues of concern. These elements should be addressed by health professionals in relation to the transition phase. Future interventions should incorporate a multidimensional and bio-psycho-social perspective when acutely admitted frail elderly are discharged.

40|$|The optometric {{profession}} in the UK {{has a major}} role in the detection, assessment and management of ocular anomalies in children between 5 and 16 years of age. The role complements a variety of associated screening services provided <b>across</b> several <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sectors.</b> The review examines the evidence-base for the content, provision and efficacy of these screening services in terms of the prevalence of anomalies such as refractive error, amblyopia, binocular vision and colour vision and considers the consequences of their curtailment. Vision screening must focus on pre-school children if the aim of the screening is to detect and treat conditions that may lead to amblyopia, whereas if the aim is to detect and correct significant refractive errors (not likely to lead to amblyopia) then it would be expedient for the optometric profession to act as the major provider of refractive (and colour vision) screening at 5 - 6 years of age. Myopia is the refractive error most likely to develop during primary school presenting typically between 8 and 12 years of age, thus screening at entry to secondary school is warranted.

Aims: To identify health professionals' perspectives of systems related barriers to implementation of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines Strengthening Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with health professionals involved in CR within mainstream and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services in Western Australia (WA). Thirty-eight health professionals from 17 services (ten rural, seven metropolitan) listed in the WA Directory of CR services and seven Aboriginal Medical Services in WA were interviewed.

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{explore how}} {{the use of}} {{electronic}} messages support hospital and community care nurses’ collaboration and communication concerning patients’ admittance to and discharges from hospitals. Background: Nurses in hospitals and in community care {{play a crucial role}} in the transfer of patients between the home and the hospital. Several studies have shown that transition situations are challenging due to a lack of communication and information exchange. Information and communication technologies may support nurses’ work in these transition situations. An electronic message system was introduced in Norway to support patient transitions <b>across</b> the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector.</b> Design: A descriptive, qualitative interview study was conducted. Methods: One hospital and three adjacent communities were included in the study. We conducted semi-structured interviews with hospital nurses and community care nurses. In total, 41 persons were included in the study. The analysis stemmed from three main topics related to the aims of e-messaging: efficiency, quality and safety. These were further divided into sub-themes. Results: All informants agreed that electronic messaging is more efficient, i. e. less time-consuming than previous means of communication. The shift from predominantly oral communication to writing electronic messages has brought attention to the content of the information exchanged, thereby leading to more conscious communication. Electronic messaging enables improved information security, thereby enhancing patient safety, but this depends on nurses using the system as intended. Conclusion: Nurses consider electronic messaging to be a useful tool for communication and collaboration in patient transitions. Relevance to clinical practice: Patient transitions are demanding situations both for patients and for the nurses who facilitate the transitions. The introduction of information and communication technologies can support nurses’ work in the transition situations, and this is likely to benefit the patients...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} a realist {{evaluation}} of developmental mentoring. It aims {{to contribute to the}} accumulation of knowledge about how mentoring works as an intervention and an approach. It is based on a project-in-practice: a Mentoring Programme that was offered to a group of non-medical specialist practitioners <b>across</b> all <b>health</b> and <b>care</b> <b>sectors.</b> Their specialism involved working with people living with long term neurological conditions. As a strategic innovation in workforce development, it was set up to address gaps in services and training opportunities. It ran in the north east of England from 2009 - 11. The research uses realist methodologies to understand ‘what works, how, for whom, in what circumstances and to what extent’ (Pawson and Tilley, 2004, p. 2). It therefore focuses on causality and the way intervention outcomes evolve through people’s responses to resources and opportunities, contextually influenced. Having established the scope and framing of the research, and with the benefit of expert opinion, this study reviews relevant substantive theory and developmental mentoring literature to build a theory-primed and literature-populated framework to evaluate participant data. The analysis leads to the generation of a developmental mentoring model; an inverted hierarchy model for complex interventions, informed by developmental mentoring in a Mentoring Programme; an overarching programme theory that addresses ‘diversity and opportunity’, with subsidiary programme theories for learning and working differently and making a difference; and an evaluation framework for developmental mentoring in a Mentoring Programme. This study contributes to the accumulation of knowledge about developmental mentoring’s core concepts and theory in this field, using realist methodologies that are suited to the complexity of the topic. ...|$|R

40|$|Postnatal {{depression}} (PND) is a depressive {{disorder that}} may impact up {{to a third}} of all postpartum women worldwide, with rural Australian women being more than one-and-a-half times more likely to develop PND than their urban counterparts. The factors affecting the development of PND are broadly biological, psychological and social. The social determinants of health, in addition to lower levels of access to appropriate <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and support services, are the underlying risk factors for PND among rural women. The treatments used for those experiencing PND include pharmacological, psychological, psychosocial, complementary and alternative therapies. However, some women prefer non-pharmacological treatments largely because of their desire to continue breastfeeding, and the stigma associated with mental ill health and medication use. In addition, women in rural and remote areas encounter various difficulties accessing specialist <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and PND-specific <b>health</b> services. Complementary and alternative therapies have come to take a more prominent role in <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> It has been reported that music, yoga, massage, and meditation have been effective in relieving stress, anxiety and reducing pain. Music therapy, in particular, has taken on a more prominent role in <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> including mental <b>health,</b> and has been utilised among those experiencing depression, stress and anxiety. However, very few studies have explored music as therapy for PND. Thus, this research explores the effectiveness of music as a therapy option for women with PND, particularly for those women living in rural and remote areas. This study aims to examine the perspectives of, and issues concerning rural Tasmanian women with PND where access to services is limited or non-existent and particularly, to explore what role music plays in alleviating PND. In relation to the research aim, the study responds to the following research questions: 1) What are <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers’ perspectives regarding current PND <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services, what improvements are required, and what impact does music have on PND? 2) What are the current services available to and accessed by women with PND? 3) What are the lived experiences and perceptions of rural women concerning PND? 4) What impact has music had in reducing the effects of PND among rural Tasmanian women? and 5) What are the implications and recommendations for health services and policy makers to address PND using music therapy?Two theoretical frameworks underpin this study: phenomenology and feminism. Phenomenology helps to examine the everyday subjective experiences of an individual’s lived world, whereas feminism is used to understand the lived experience {{of what it means to}} be a woman experiencing PND and seeking care. This approach provided a perspective of PND that is juxtaposed to gender and the powerful medical model of health and disease. Utilising an explorative research approach, qualitative methods were used to address the study’s aims and questions. Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data from 23 key <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers (HCPs), including general practitioners (GPs), child and family health nurses (CHN), psychologists and psychiatrists, perinatal mental health co-ordinators and music therapists. In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 women who had been clinically diagnosed with PND, who were identified through media campaigns, advertisements, or purposive snowball sampling. All interviews were analysed using thematic analysis via NVivo v 10. 0 software. The study provides insights into the everyday experiences of women with PND, the perspectives of HCPs within rural settings, and how these factors impact service access, acceptance, and utilisation. It was shown that there is an augmentation in current <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services due to reduced funding <b>across</b> the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector.</b> In addition, there is poor recognition and diagnosis of PND among HCPs; and, due to the stigma of mental illness, and specifically, PND, women have a tendency to fabricate the truth about coping in order to reduce further intrusion from HCPs. While current treatments for PND emphasise the use of medication; women in the study seek to avoid medication in favour of psychological and complementary therapies, such as music, to cope. However, there are various barriers to accessing these complementary treatments. The research discusses the complexities of obtaining a diagnosis and receiving subsequent treatment for PND in rural and remote Tasmania. The study delivers insight into various service provision issues, while offering an understanding of the needs, desires and challenges encountered by women with PND as well as the HCPs who strive to care for these women. Improvements to current PND <b>health</b> <b>care</b> processes and treatments are also suggested from both the women as well as the HCPs. Although music was recognised as a complementary treatment, current services require further training and development centred on improved education, screening, and diagnosis of PND to make music therapy a viable option...|$|R

Studies have also shown that the fear of making mistakes, {{as well as the}} fear and threat of being reported, contribute to the psychological pressure experienced by personnel in the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector.</b> Therefore, improving safety is vital from the work environment perspective. There are many indicators showing that risks in the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> are increasing, despite the fact that fewer reports are being sent to the monitoring authorities. This study attempts to analyze whether the methods of risk management used by civil aviation have any relevance to the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector.</b> A comparison shows that the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> lacks an organization on both the local and national levels that specifically deals with safety-related matters. The system of risk reporting and management used in civil aviation can provide valuable insight in designing a similar system within the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector.</b> Requirements for periodic proficiency testing and regulation of the length of work shifts are other areas in which aviation can {{serve as a model for}} improving safety in <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> The study shows that the safety-related efforts made in civil aviation are in many cases highly relevant to the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector,</b> even in relation to the formulation of legislation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Based on {{four years}} of province-level <b>health</b> <b>care</b> data, this paper {{analyzes}} the productive efficiency of China’s <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> in the post reform period. Data envelopment analysis is used to compute efficiency measures, which indicate that there was still room for improvement in the technical efficiency of the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> in China between 2002 and 2005. This is particularly {{the case in the}} coastal provinces. According to the computed Malmquist index and its decomposition components, China’s <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> suffers from productivity decline, especially for the coastal provinces. Nevertheless, there has been technological improvement across all provinces...|$|R

40|$|Entrenched {{poor health}} and health {{inequity}} are important public health problems. Conventionally, solutions to such problems originate from the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector,</b> a conception {{reinforced by the}} dominant biomedical imagination of health. By contrast, attention to the social determinants of health has recently been given new force {{in the fight against}} health inequity. The <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> is a vital determinant of health in itself and a key resource in improving health in an equitable manner. Actors in the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> must recognize and reverse the sector's propensity to generate health inequity. The sector must also strengthen its role in working with other sectors of government to act collectively on the deep-rooted causes of poor and inequitable health...|$|R
