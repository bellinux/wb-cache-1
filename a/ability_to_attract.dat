5|$|Acarya Ananda Jha, {{the author}} of the Chinnamasta Tattva, prescribes her worship by {{soldiers}} as she embodies self-control of lust, heroic self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and fearlessness in the face of death. In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, ability to sway kings, <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but will grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Diệm {{had little}} {{authority}} beyond {{the gates of}} his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing {{the head of state}} to be weak and ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the French Expeditionary Corps maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, hoping he would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.|$|E

30|$|Our {{case study}} on PNAS 1999 – 2013 verifies the similar transitivity and assortativity of {{collaboration}} patterns in biological, physical and social sciences. The data demonstrate that the degree distribution types of the three science categories are identical, which are a mixture of a generalized Poisson distribution and a power-law. This also holds for hyperdegree. We provided {{an explanation for the}} emergence of this distribution type through authors’ “yes/no” decisions and their different <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> collaborations.|$|R

5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc and its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> oxidation to itself {{makes it an}} efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline {{can be achieved by}} connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E
5|$|White's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> new writers {{suffered}} {{because of}} the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. White made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer {{because of the}} financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed {{it was a good}} story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid was a {{prolific}} founder of churches, which he then controlled until his death, {{and was a}} great fundraiser, acquiring lands and money {{from many of the}} kings he was in contact with. He was also noted for his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> support from powerful women, especially queens. Queen Eanflæd, his first patron, introduced him to a number of helpful contacts, and he later attracted the support of Queen Æthelthryth, who gave the endowment for Hexham Abbey. Ælfflæd, sister of King Aldfrith of Northumbria and daughter of Wilfrid's old patron Queen Eanflæd, helped to persuade the Northumbrians to allow Wilfrid to return from his last exile.|$|E
30|$|Collaboration {{relationship}} {{can be expressed}} by graphs, termed as coauthorship networks. Hence the patterns can be studied in network perspective. Coauthorship networks from different scientific fields appear specific similarities, such as partial transitivity of coauthorship, homophily {{on the number of}} collaborators, the right-skewed distribution of collaborators per author [13 – 19]. These commonalities also appear in the collaboration networks of three author sets (which come from the three science categories of PNAS respectively). We dived more into the rule and reason of these commonalities. We found that the distribution of collaborators per author and that of papers per author follow the same distribution type: a mixture of a generalized Poisson distribution and a power-law. We provided a possible explanation for the distribution type and these commonalities through the diversity of author <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> collaborations.|$|R
40|$|Universities {{around the}} United States are seeking ways <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> {{students}} <b>to</b> their institutions. One possible {{strategy is to}} compete for out-of-state students. Since an early 1970 s examination of the determinants of student migration by Tuckman, {{there have been several}} subsequent studies that have either further developed the methodology of the studies or taken some different perspective on the problem. This paper differs from the existing literature in two ways. First, it focuses exclusively on land-grant institutions. Second, it uses panel data rather than just time-series or cross-sectional data. Evidence regarding the impact of historical Black college/university status and regional variations are presented as well. The evidence indicates that quality has more influence on student migration than price, indicates that historical Black college/universities attract fewer out-of-state students than other land grant institutions and indicates that there are non-specific regional differences in land grant institutions' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> migrant students. land grant, student migration, tuition,...|$|R

Since then, wrestlers from past and present, others employed in the professional wrestling industry, and wrestling journalists and historians have been selected by Meltzer to cast secret ballots to determine annual groups of inductees. Voting criteria include {{the length of time}} spent in wrestling, historical significance, <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> viewers, and wrestling ability. Inductees must have at least 15 years of experience in the wrestling business or be over 35 years old and have 10 years of experience. To gain membership in the hall, potential inductees must receive 60% support on the ballots from their geographic region. Any person that gets less than 10% of the vote is eliminated from the ballot. If a person fails to get inducted 15 years after being put on the ballot, they must get 50% of the vote or be eliminated. There are 211 inductees, including the seven tag teams.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, {{failure to maintain}} infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the five member nations, which could eventually lead to a common East African shilling.|$|E
5|$|Wes Gephart, {{though his}} {{personal}} brilliance and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> investment, {{was able to}} cover the decline to some extent. By his death in 1905, he had assembled a seemingly puissant empire of two iron furnaces, extensive ore mines, and two railroads. But even during his lifetime, Bellefonte had seen {{the end of its}} glory: after 1890, its population, heretofore steadily growing, would decline for the next thirty years. Nor did Gephart's empire long survive him; little more than a decade after his death, the furnaces were demolished, the mines shut down, and one railroad scrapped. Only the Central Railroad remained, staggering to a pauper's grave in 1918, sold for the wartime price its scrap could bring. The era of Nittany Furnace was the twilight of ironmaking in Bellefonte. Though not fully apparent at the time, neither the rising lime industry nor any other would replace ironmaking as the guarantor of the town's prosperity. The fall of the furnaces marked the beginning of a long decline which would see Bellefonte supplanted by State College as the nexus of activity in Centre County.|$|E

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that long-term familiarity with neighbors is advantageous by determining whether male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) breeding adjacent to familiar neighbors have better reproductive success than other males. Using data gathered during a 10 -yr study of breeding success, we found that males with familiar neighbors fledged, on average, significantly more offspring annually than males without familiar neighbors. We {{also found that the}} same males, breeding in different years on the same territories, had significantly larger harems in the years they had familiar neighbors. Improved reproductive success was due <b>to</b> the males' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> more females <b>to</b> nest in their territories.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} political pressures on universities to raise research funding from industry and contribute actively to economic development. However, {{whether or not}} promotion of the so called third mission in universities, of interacting with industry, is effective without government funding remains an open question, {{and we do not}} know whether government funding ‘crowds-out’ or ‘crowds-in’ business funding. In this paper we argue that government funding provides universities with the vital resources to carry out research activities whose results can be transferred at a later stage to industry, leveraging private funding. It is inevitable, therefore, that without government support to academic institutions knowledge transfer activities will be hampered, and financial cuts to universities may reduce rather than foster their self-financing capability. The empirical analysis presented in this paper is based on financial data for the whole population of Italian university departments engaged in research in the Engineering and Physical Sciences. Based on a set of probit and tobit cross-section and panel data models this paper investigates the impact of different forms of public funding to university departments, on their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> private funding.

40|$|Both {{investors and}} borrowers are {{concerned}} about liquidity.

Borrowers {{are concerned about}} liquidity because they are uncertain about their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> or retain funding. Because borrowers typically cannot repay investors on demand, investors will require a premium or significant control rights when they lend to borrowers directly, as compensation for the illiquidity investors will be subject to. We argue that banks can resolve these liquidity problems that arise in direct lending. Banks enable depositors to withdraw at low cost, as well as buffer firms from the liquidity needs of their investors. We show the bank {{has to have a}} fragile capital structure, subject to bank runs, in order to perform these functions.
