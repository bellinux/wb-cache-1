40|$|We have {{developed}} a system with a flexible RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) antenna mat to assist caregivers in a group home. In Japan, a group home {{is a type of}} home-based care service for elderly persons who suffer from dementia. The caregivers working in the group home must always pay attention to such persons. Since the level of dependency of each elderly person is different, the caregivers must check whether the person requires support or not. However, the checking demands extra efforts on part of the caregivers in addition to the support tasks. To simplify this task, we introduce a system consisting of RFID <b>antenna</b> <b>sheet</b> sensors and RFID tags embedded in inner shoes or slippers of the elderly persons. The system can assist the caregivers to monitor the activities of the persons with dementia by specifying whether the person passed through the sheet on the corridor. It not only helps the caregivers to understand such persons by reviewing their activities but also keeps them informed about the person’s ongoing activities.

50|$|Researchers {{from the}} Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have {{discovered}} a unique way to create an atomic <b>antenna.</b> Two <b>sheets</b> of graphene can be connected by a silicon wire that is approximately 0.1 nanometer in diameter. This is approximately 100 times smaller than current metal based wires, {{which can only be}} reduced to 50 nanometers. This silicon wire however, is a plasmotic device, which would enable the formation of surface plasmon polariton waves required to operate this nano antenna.|$|R

40|$|The 60 GHz {{short-range}} {{wireless communication}} system {{has gained a}} lot of attention because it can offer high rate data communications with the free-licensed band. Development of wideband, high gain, compact 60 GHz antennas is a crucial issue in the system.

The system consists of the following components. · <b>Sheet</b> <b>antenna</b> that checks loading of tools · Onboard data transfer device that emits signals the <b>sheet</b> <b>antenna</b> · Handy terminals that read temporarily placed tools and operate various devices · IC tags attached to the tools (active/passive) · Control terminal in which items such as tools and track work managers are registered 2. 1 <b>Sheet</b> <b>Antenna</b> (1) Placement of trigger coils and receiving antenna Tools loaded on the carrier vehicle are read as follows. i) Trigger coils built in the <b>sheet</b> <b>antenna</b> generate a magnetic field. ii) Active tags attached to the tools respond. iii) The receiving antenna reads response signals. In light of the collision between a train and the bucket of a backhoe that occurred in the section between Oimachi and Omori on the Keihin Tohoku line on October 6, 2003, we put together rules for checking after maintenance work including a post-work checking manual to prevent reoccurrence of such an accident. Still, some incidents related to post-work checking occurred such as the collision between a train and a trolley on the Ofunato line in June 2008. In light of those circumstances, we decided in October of 2008 to develop a support system for post-work checking of larger tools left on the track that would hinder safe train operation if a train collided with them. In order to minimize the burden of new work in post-work checking using the system, we studied a method of checking that would not interfere with the usual workflow. As a result, we decided to check the number of tools loaded on the carrier vehicle. Workers load necessary tools on that vehicle at the office before leaving for the worksite and also load used tools on the carrier vehicle before returning to the office. In this basic workflow, we put together a system to systemize checking of tools by detecting and managing the loaded tools through simpl...|$|R

40|$|Textile diamond dipole and Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) {{have been}} {{proposed}} and tested under wearable and body centric measurements. The proposed <b>antenna</b> and AMC <b>sheet</b> are entirely made of textiles for both the substrate and conducting parts, thus making it suitable for wearable communications. Directive radiation patterns with high gain are obtained with the proposed AMC sheet, hence minimizing the radiation towards the human body. In this study, wearable and body centric measurements are investigated which include bending, wetness and Specific Absorption Rate (SAR). Bending is found not to give significant effect to the antenna and AMC performance, as opposed to wetness that yields severe performance distortion. However, the original performance is retrieved once the antenna and AMC dried. Moreover, notable SAR reduction is achieved {{with the introduction of}} the AMC sheet, which is appropriate to reduce the radiation that penetrates into human flesh...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{microstrip}} bowtie {{patch antenna}} (MBPA) for wireless indoor communications is carried out. Here, a microstrip transmission-line feed network was designed {{in order to}} match the MBPA. The proposed antenna uses a ground plane {{with the aim of}} narrowing down the back lobes in comparison with bowtie <b>sheet</b> <b>antennas,</b> which radiation pattern is omni-directional. The far-field pattern of the antenna was simulated using a finite-element numerical algorithm and obtained by interpolation employing near-field equipment. The experimental results are described in detail intending to agree well with the simulated predictions. The antenna was designed, measured and built and its far field performance was evaluated with a 2. 11 GHz resonant frequency. The azimuth and elevation antenna patterns, antenna gain and, the matching frequency were the main parameters obtained to analyze the antenna behaviour. The antenna has a gain approximately equal to 8. 77 dBi and its beam-widths are higher than 100 ° in E plane...|$|R
40|$|Planar antennas {{based on}} tightly coupled dipole arrays (also {{known as a}} current <b>sheet</b> <b>antenna</b> or CSA) are {{amenable}} for use as electronically scanned phased arrays. They are capable of performance nearing a decade of bandwidth. These antennas have been demonstrated in many implementations at frequencies below 18 GHz. This paper describes the implementation using a relatively new multi-layer microfabrication process resulting in a small, 6 x 6 element, dual-linear polarized array with beamformer that operates from 8 to 40 GHz. The beamformer includes baluns that feed the dual-polarized differential antenna elements and reactive splitter networks that also cover the full frequency range of operation. This antenna array serves as a reflector feed for a multi-band instrument designed to measure snow water equivalent (SWE) from airborne platforms. The instrument has both radar and radiome try capability at multiple frequencies. Scattering-parameter and time-domain measurements {{have been used to}} characterize the array feed. Radiation patterns of the antenna have been measured and are compared to simulation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the most integrated multi-octave millimeter-wave antenna feed fabricated to date...|$|R
