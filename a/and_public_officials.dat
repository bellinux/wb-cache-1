5|$|Since the attack, Canadians have debated various {{interpretations of}} the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> have {{characterized}} the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women. Consequently, {{the anniversary of the}} massacre has since been commemorated as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine's abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of a madman, unrelated to larger social issues. Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty, isolation, and alienation in society, particularly in immigrant communities.|$|E

25|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{organizations have}} traditionally defined vice as including prostitution, gambling, alcohol and narcotics, and pornography.

25|$|How cities {{implement}} {{human rights}} ideals varies {{from city to}} city. This allows for each city {{to develop a plan}} that is specific to its capacities, needs, problems, and concerns. Formally designated “Human Rights Cities” typically create a leadership body made up of community activists, residents, <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> (or their appointees) working in partnership. Other cities may adopt human rights language and standards without officially adopting the name of Human Rights City. For instance, Barcelona is a leading human right city in Europe, and it created an Office of Non-Discrimination to implement the EU anti-racial discrimination policy within its borders as part of becoming a Human Rights City.|$|E
25|$|Paid {{subscription}} to The Liberator was always smaller than its circulation. In 1834 it had two thousand subscribers, three-fourths {{of whom were}} blacks. Benefactors paid to have the newspaper distributed to influential statesmen <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>officials.</b> Although Garrison rejected physical force {{as a means for}} ending slavery, his critics took his demand for immediate emancipation literally. Some believed he advocated the sudden and total freeing of all slaves, and considered him a dangerous fanatic. Nat Turner's slave rebellion in Virginia just seven months after The Liberator started publication fueled the outcry against Garrison in the South. A North Carolina grand jury indicted him for distributing incendiary material, and the Georgia Legislature offered a $5,000 reward for his capture and conveyance to the state for trial.|$|E
