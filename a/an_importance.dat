5|$|As Western Europe {{witnessed}} {{the formation of}} new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with the Sasanian Empire, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted {{throughout most of the}} 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming <b>an</b> <b>importance</b> in Eastern politics {{that they did not have}} in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Codex Theodosianus—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests.|$|E
5|$|Originally, historians {{believed}} that Edward's decision to rebuild {{much of the}} castle {{was in response to}} the growing tensions with France; in this version of events, Hadleigh would have formed <b>an</b> <b>importance</b> coastal fortification along the Thames estuary, protecting it from French raids. Current historical opinion plays down this motivation, noting {{that at the time of}} the work on Hadleigh relations with France were unusually good. Instead, it is suspected that the increasing elderly Edward intended Hadleigh more as a personal retreat close to London, where he could stay in privacy and considerable comfort. Whilst the entrance on the inland side remained relatively basic, the building work created a grander impression from the estuary – any visitors to London, English or French, would have passed by Queenborough Castle on the south bank and Hadleigh on the north, the combination communicating a strong sense of royal power.|$|E

25|$|In the 11th and 12th centuries, Narbonne {{was home}} to an {{important}} Jewish exegetical school, which {{played a pivotal role}} in the growth and development of the Zarphatic (Judæo-French) and Shuadit (Judæo-Provençal) languages. Jews had settled in Narbonne from about the 5th century, with a community that had risen to approximately 2000 in the 12th century. At this time, Narbonne was frequently mentioned in Talmudic works in connection with its scholars. One source, Abraham ibn Daud of Toledo, gives them <b>an</b> <b>importance</b> similar to the exilarchs of Babylon. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the community went through a series of ups and downs before settling into extended decline.|$|E

In the case of <b>a</b> low <b>importance</b> of coordination, the coordination benefits are small. The additional incentive costs exceed the coordination benefits. Whereas coordination benefits are increasing {{in the importance of}} coordination the additional incentive costs are decreasing. Thus, for <b>a</b> high <b>importance</b> of coordination, the coordination benefits outweigh the additional incentive costs. Then, the participative budgeting process is preferred by the company. Hence, the managing owner affects the company’s profitability through the choice of the budgeting process.|$|R
25|$|Necessity {{compelled}} him to {{work with}} the clergy and people rather than the gentry; hence it was that the Riksens ständer (Riksdag) assumed under his regency government a power and <b>an</b> <b>importance</b> which it had never possessed before. In 1595, the Riksdag of Söderköping elected Charles regent, and his attempt to force Klas Flemming, governor of Österland (Finland of the day), to submit to his authority, rather than to that of the king, provoked a civil war. Charles sought to increase his power and the king attempted to manage the situation by diplomacy over several years, until fed up, Sigismund got permission from the Commonwealth's legislature to pursue the matters dividing his Swedish subjects, and invaded with a mercenary army.|$|E
25|$|In the 9th century, {{the rise}} of the cult of the Apostle James in Santiago de Compostela gave Galicia a {{particular}} symbolic importance among Christians, <b>an</b> <b>importance</b> it would hold throughout the Reconquista. As the Middle Ages went on, Santiago became a major pilgrim destination and the Way of Saint James (Camiño de Santiago) a major pilgrim road, a route for the propagation of Romanesque art and the words and music of the troubadors. During the 10th and 11th centuries, a period during which Galician nobility become related to the royal family, Galicia was at times headed by its own native kings, while Vikings (locally known as Leodemanes or Lordomanes) occasionally raided the coasts. The Towers of Catoira (Pontevedra) were built as a system of fortifications to prevent and stop the Viking raids on Santiago de Compostela.|$|E
25|$|Hickories are {{consistently}} {{present in the}} broad eastern upland climax forest association commonly called oak-hickory, {{but they are not}} generally abundant (18). Locally, hickories may make up to 20 to 30 percent of stand basal area, particularly in slope and cove forests below the escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau (23) and in second-growth forests in the Cumberland Mountains, especially on benches (14). It has been hypothesized that hickory will replace chestnut (Castanea dentata) killed by the blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) in the Appalachian Highlands (10,12). On Beanfield Mountain in Giles County, Virginia, the former chestnut-oak complex has changed to an oak-hickory association over a period of 50 years. This association is dominated by pignut hickory with <b>an</b> <b>importance</b> value of 41.0 (maximum value = 300), northern red oak (36.0), and chestnut oak (25.0). White oak, red maple (Acer rubrum), and sugar maple are subdominant species.|$|E

25|$|European {{colonisation}} {{of southern}} Africa began on Tuesday 6 April 1652 when the Dutch East India Company established a settlement called the Cape Colony on Table Bay, near present-day Cape Town, {{and continued to}} expand into the hinterland through the 17th and 18th centuries. It was founded as a victualling station for the Dutch East Indies trade route but soon acquired <b>an</b> <b>importance</b> of its own due to its good farmland and mineral wealth. There was no significant British interest in South Africa until 1795, when British troops under Sir James Craig seized Cape Colony during the French Revolutionary War, the Netherlands having fallen to Napoleon the same year. After the British seized Cape Colony a second time in 1806 to counteract French {{interests in the region}} {{in the course of the}} Napoleonic Wars, Cape Colony was turned into a permanent British settlement. As in most other parts of the world, British colonization brought in its wake the introduction of the game of cricket, which began to develop rapidly. The first ever recorded cricket match in South Africa took place in 1808, in Cape Town between two service teams for a prize of one thousand rix-dollars.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebellion}} {{itself had}} lasted until March 1939, {{when it was}} finally quelled by British troops. It forced Britain to make substantial concessions to Arab demands. Jewish immigration was to continue but under restrictions, with a quota of 75,000 places spread out over the following five years. On the expiry of this period further Jewish immigration would depend on Arab consent. Besides local unrest, another key factor in bringing about a decisive change in British policy was Nazi Germany's preparations for a European war, which would develop into a worldwide conflict. In British strategic thinking, securing the loyalty {{and support of the}} Arab world assumed <b>an</b> <b>importance</b> of some urgency. While Jewish support was unquestioned, Arab backing in a new global conflict was by no means assured. By promising to phase out Jewish immigration into Palestine, Britain hoped to win back support from wavering Arabs. Husseini, allied to radical elements in exile, hailing from provincial Palestinian families, convinced the AHC, against moderate Palestinian families who were minded to accept it, to reject the White Paper of 1939, which had recommended an Arab-majority state and an end to building a Jewish national home. The rejection was based on its perceived failure to promise an end to immigration; the land policy it advocated was thought to provide imperfect remedies: and the promised independence appeared to depend on Jewish assent and cooperation. Husseini, who also had personal interests threatened by these arrangements, also feared that acceptance would strengthen the hand of his political opponents in the Palestine national movement, such as the Nashashibis. Schwanitz and Rubin argued that Husseini was a great influence on Hitler and that his rejectionism was, ironically, the real causal factor for the establishment of the state of Israel, a thesis Mikics, who regards Husseini as a 'radical anti-semite, finds both 'astonishing' and 'silly', since it would logically entail the collateral thesis that the Zionist movement triggered the Holocaust.|$|E

500|$|The new {{constitution}} addressed {{many of the}} reformist concerns of the Patriots since 1785 (no hereditary offices; no sinecures; accountability of officials). It also came {{down on the side}} of economic liberalism (as opposed to mercantilism) in the economic debate then raging in republican circles (and therefore promised to do away with guilds and internal impediments to trade). The old provincial-repartition system of public finance was to be replaced by a system of national taxation. There was to be a five-man Uitvoerend Bewind as a collective Executive, with eight national Agenten (government ministers) doing the actual Administration work (Foreign Affairs, Police and Interior, Justice, Finance, War, Navy, National Education, and National Economy). Most importantly, as the British historian Simon Schama states: [...] "ts central aim was to change the nature of the Dutch state and to bind its new institutions into the framework of an electoral democracy."
