5|$|One {{can form}} a 2-satisfiability {{instance}} at random, {{for a given}} number n of variables and m of clauses, by choosing each clause uniformly at random from the set of all possible two-variable clauses. When m is small relative to n, such <b>an</b> <b>instance</b> will likely be satisfiable, but larger values of m have smaller probabilities of being satisfiable. More precisely, if m/n is fixed as a constant α ≠ 1, the probability of satisfiability tends to a limit as n goes to infinity: if α<1, the limit is one, while if α>1, the limit is zero. Thus, the problem exhibits a phase transition at α=1.|$|E

This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance.

5|$|Ale {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} ala is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and harvest, and as protectors against bad weather. When an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds, a dragon comes out to fight with her and drive her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons (during which ale hide in tall trees). <b>An</b> <b>instance</b> of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pčinja region {{as a result of a}} dragon having struck an ala with lightning just over that place, making her drop the looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears. If an ala finds a dragon in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E
5|$|In January 1195 Geoffrey {{was ordered}} to appear in Rome to answer various charges, under the threat of {{suspension}} from office {{if he did not}} appear by 1 June. Further quarrels with his cathedral clergy followed, including <b>an</b> <b>instance</b> of the cathedral chapter throwing chrism on a dungheap in protest. Geoffrey protested to the king after Richard forbade Geoffrey's projected journey to Rome and in retaliation the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates once more. This left Geoffrey vulnerable when Walter held a legatine council at York in June 1195. Geoffrey had managed to secure a postponement of his case at Rome until 1 November, but was still unable to attend, which led Pope Celestine to order that Geoffrey's suspension should be performed by Hugh of Lincoln. Hugh protested, and as a result Celestine himself suspended Geoffrey on 23December 1195, finally forcing Geoffrey to answer the charges against him. He travelled to Rome in 1196, where his accusers were unable to substantiate their claims and he was restored to office by the pope.|$|E

Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is <b>an</b> <b>instance</b> of a United Kingdom {{case in which}} an order of {{prohibition}} was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E
5|$|The GCD of two numbers a and b is {{the product}} of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used {{multiple}} times, but only as long as the product of these factors divides both a and b. For example, since 1386 can be factored into 2×3×3×7×11, and 3213 can be factored into 3×3×3×7×17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63=3×3×7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as <b>an</b> <b>instance</b> of the empty product), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility.|$|E
5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial.

A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E
