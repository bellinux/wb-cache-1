25|$|The Neolithic temple {{builders}} 3800–2500 BCE endowed {{the numerous}} temples of Malta and Gozo with intricate bas relief designs, including spirals evocative {{of the tree}} of life and animal portraits, designs painted in red ochre, ceramics, and a vast collection of human form sculptures, particularly the Venus of Malta.

25|$|Transgenic {{studies have}} shown that growth and {{dormancy}} of hair follicles are related to the activity of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) at the dermal papillae, which is affected by DHT. Androgens are important in male sexual development around birth and at puberty. They regulate sebaceous glands, apocrine hair growth, and libido. With increasing age, androgens stimulate hair growth on the face, but can suppress it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> and scalp vertex, a condition that has been referred to as the 'androgen paradox'.|$|E

At Pachaimalai, there is a huge statue of Lord Senthilandavar, which can be seen miles away from the temple. Apart from his normal gold peacock mount, the temple also has a golden chariot. It is believed that sage Dhurvasa initially installed the deities at both Pachaimalai and Pavalamalai.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} finds of {{roof tiles}} of the Archaic period in Greece are documented {{from a very}} restricted area around Corinth, where fired tiles began to replace thatched roofs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> of Apollo and Poseidon between 700 and 650 BC. Spreading rapidly, roof tiles were within fifty years in evidence for {{a large number of}} sites around the Eastern Mediterranean, including Mainland Greece, Western Asia Minor, Southern and Central Italy. Being more expensive and labour-intensive to produce than thatch, their introduction has been {{explained by the fact that}} their fireproof quality would have given desired protection to the costly temples. As a side-effect, it has been assumed that the new stone and tile construction also ushered in the end of overhanging eaves in Greek architecture, as they made the need for an extended roof as rain protection for the mudbrick walls obsolete.|$|E
25|$|The forbidding of shaving {{the corners}} of the head was {{interpreted}} by the Mishnah as prohibiting the hair <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> being cut so that the hairline was a straight line from behind the ears to the forehead; thus it was deemed necessary to retain sidelocks, leading {{to the development of a}} distinctly Jewish form of sidelock, known as payot. As for the beard, more complicated views arose; {{the corners of}} the beard were explained to refer to five extremities in the Talmud. There are many opinions in mediaeval scholars as to what these five points are. For example, it may be a point on each cheek near the temples, a point at the end of the cheek bone towards the centre of the face, and the point of the chin. Or it may be 2 on the mustache, 2 somewhere on the cheek and one on the point on the chin. As a result, Shulchan Aruch prohibits the shaving of the entire beard and mustache.|$|E

25|$|Hari Raya Saraswati is {{dedicated}} {{the goddess of}} learning, science, and literature. She rules the intellectual and creative realm, and is the patron goddess of libraries and schools. Balinese Hindus believe that knowledge is an essential medium to achieve the goal {{of life as a}} human being, and so honor her. She is also celebrated because she succeeded in taming the wandering and lustful mind of her consort, Brahma, who was preoccupied with the goddess of material existence, Shatarupa. On this day, offerings are made to the lontar (palm-leaf manuscripts), books, and shrines. Saraswati Day is celebrated every 210-days on Saniscara Umanis Wuku Watugunung and marks the start of the new year according to the Balinese Pawukon calendar. Ceremonies and prayers are held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> in family compounds, educational institutions and temples, villages, and businesses from morning to noon. Teachers and students replace their uniforms for the day with bright and colourful ceremonial clothing, filling the island with color. Children bring fruit and traditional cakes to school for offerings at the temple.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1243, Ejō left Kōshōhōrin-ji for Echizen with Dōgen and his other {{students}} after Hatano Yoshishige, a magistrate from that area, offered land and protection for a new monastery. Dōgen and his followers accepted the offer largely because of continuous tensions with the Tendai community in Kyoto which threatened the long-term stability of their practice. Before {{the construction of the}} new temple had been completed, the monks stayed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> Kippō-ji and Yamashibu. During this time, Ejō served Dōgen as before, continued a project managing the texts for what would become Dōgen's magnum opus, the Shōbōgenzō (not {{to be confused with the}} Shōbōgenzō zuimonki mentioned above), and also assisting in the planning of the new temple being constructed. In {{the summer of}} 1244 the hattō (法堂; dharma hall) of the new temple, originally called Daibutsu-ji, was completed. In June 1246, the temple name was changed to what it is still known as to this day: Eihei-ji. For these first years at the new temple, Ejō found himself taking on many of the responsibilities for the day-to-day functioning of the new temple. He simultaneously began work on Eihei kōroku (Broad Record of Eihei) and Eihei shingi (Pure Criteria of Eihei) with the help of the other students Gien and Sene.|$|E

Mayan mythology expert Migel Angel Vergara relates that the Mayans held a belief that bees came from Venus, the [...] "Second Sun." [...] The relief might be indicative of another [...] "insect deity", that of Xux Ex, the Mayan [...] "wasp star." [...] The Mayan embodied Venus in the form of the god Kukulkán (also known as or related to Gukumatz and Quetzalcoatl in other parts of Mexico), Quetzalcoatl is a Mesoamerican deity whose name in Nahuatl means [...] "feathered serpent". The cult was the first Mesoamerican religion to transcend the old Classic Period linguistic and ethnic divisions. This cult facilitated communication and peaceful trade among peoples of many different social and ethnic backgrounds. Although the cult was originally centered on the ancient city of Chichén Itzá in the modern Mexican state of Yucatán, it spread as far as the Guatemalan highlands.|$|E

500|$|In the 1980s, the Bond {{series was}} {{initially}} revived with new novels by John Gardner, although initially he almost turned the series down. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner {{went on to}} write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote – Licence to Kill and GoldenEye – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner stated that he wanted [...] "to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s", although he retained {{the ages of the}} characters as they were when Fleming had left them.

Kodial Theru, also known as Mangaluru Rathotsava (Mangalore Car Festival) is a festival unique to the Goud Saraswat Brahmin community, and is celebrated at the Sri Venkatramana Temple in Mangalore. The Mangalorean Catholics community's unique festivals include Monti Fest (Mother Mary's feast), which celebrates the Nativity feast and the blessing of new harvests.

Aati, a festival worshiping Kalenja, a patron spirit of the city, occurs during the Aashaadha month of Hindu calendar. Festivals such as Karavali Utsav and Kudlotsava are highlighted by national and state-level performances in dance, drama and music.

500|$|In 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) {{approached}} Gardner {{and asked}} him to revive Ian Fleming's James Bond series of novels. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels, and the novelizations of two Bond films. Gardner stated that he wanted [...] "to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s", although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them.

Whilst Gardner's Bond novels received a mixed reaction from the critics, they were popular and a number appeared in The New York Times Best Seller list, bringing the author commercial success. Gardner had an ambivalent view on being the Bond author, once saying that [...] "I'm very grateful to have been selected to keep Bond alive. But I'd much rather be remembered for my own work than I would for Bond", while saying on another occasion that [...] "I remain proud that my contribution to the Bond saga played a great part in its development". In the mid-1990s, after discovering he had esophageal cancer, Gardner officially retired from writing Bond novels and Glidrose Publications quickly chose Raymond Benson to continue the literary stories of James Bond.|$|E
