Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
5|$|Worsley, in London while {{awaiting}} a new berth, joined the expedition {{as a result}} of a dream, in which he was navigating a ship around icebergs drifting down Burlington Street. He took it as a premonition and the next day hurried down to Burlington Street, where he noticed a sign on a building advertising what Shackleton called the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. He promptly entered the building whereupon he met Shackleton. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of conversation, Shackleton offered him the captaincy of the Endurance, which Worsley accepted.|$|E
5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E

5|$|The {{regular season}} home-opener was another {{victory for the}} team, as they {{defeated}} Nicholls State 85–62on November 13. Early in the game, Melquan Bolding hit the floor on a hard foul during a breakaway. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> he recovered {{and went on to}} lead the team with 25points. Saunders scored 17points with 19 rebounds, his first of a long streak of double-doubles. This game was also the second and final game of B.J. Monteiro's 2-game suspension following allegations of participating in a robbery. Three days later, it was announced that Bolding had fractured his wrist when he was fouled, and would be unable to play for 4–6weeks.|$|E
5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E

5|$|The seventh {{match of}} the night was for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Reigning champions Demolition (Ax and Smash), {{accompanied}} by both Mr. Fuji and Jimmy Hart, were challenged by The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart). As soon as the bell sounded, The Hart Foundation attacked both members of Demolition. Their control was brief, as Demolition then gained the advantage over Neidhart. As Bret Hart was tagged into the match, Demolition got the advantage over {{him when he was}} whipped shoulder first into the turnbuckle, breaking Mr. Fuji's cane that he had placed there when the referee wasn't looking. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of Demolition working over Hart's shoulder, a frustrated Neidhart chased Jimmy Hart from ringside and returned to tag back into the match. When all four men began fighting inside the ring, Neidhart attacked Mr. Fuji, who was on the ring apron. At the end of the match, Bret Hart attempted a piledriver but Ax hit him a megaphone given by Jimmy Hart sneaking back to the ring. Smash then pinned Bret Hart for the win.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

50|$|Located in Akaki woreda is the Aba Samuel {{hydroelectric}} power plant, named <b>after</b> <b>a</b> nearby church. The complex includes the first dam {{built in the}} Awash valley, though it is actually on the Akaki river, constructed by the Italians in 1939, and the lake created by the dam has a storage capacity of 40,000 cubic meters. Originally a 6,600 kW hydro-electric plant, it was enlarged in the early 1950s so that it produced 20 million kWh a year by 1955. In the early 1940s, the British attempted to carry away vital parts of the electrical generator, but were stopped <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minute's</b> battle with the police of Addis Ababa.|$|R
25|$|On 30 October Gontermann {{took off}} in a Fokker Dr.I. He had not yet {{recovered}} fully from a bout of dysentery.

He {{pulled out of the}} second loop and dived into a left turn. The upper wing collapsed and broke completely off. His airplane plunged into the ground.|$|E
25|$|The pyramid {{method of}} {{harvesting}} worm compost {{is commonly used}} in small-scale vermiculture, and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins. In this process, compost is separated into large clumps, which is placed back into composting for further breakdown, and lighter compost, with which {{the rest of the}} process continues. This lighter mix is placed into small piles on a tarp under the sunlight. The worms instinctively burrow {{to the bottom of the}} pile. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> the top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until the worms are again visible. This repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms.|$|E
25|$|General {{anesthesia}} is not maintained with barbiturate drugs. An induction dose of thiopental {{wears off}} <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> because the thiopental redistributes {{from the brain}} {{to the rest of}} the body very quickly. However, it has a long half-life, which means that a long time is needed for the drug to be eliminated from the body. If a very large initial dose is given, little or no redistribution takes place (since the body is saturated with the drug), which means that recovery of consciousness requires the drug to be eliminated from the body, which is not only slow (taking many hours or days), but unpredictable in duration, making barbiturates very unsatisfactory for maintenance of anesthesia.|$|E

She is briefly overcome with faintness, and Rodolfo helps her to a chair and offers her a glass of wine. She thanks him. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> she says that she is better and must go. But as she turns to leave, she realizes that she has lost her key.|$|E
25|$|Next, Owen Hart and Yokozuna, {{accompanied}} by Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji, defended their WWF Tag Team Championship against the Allied Powers (Lex Luger and The British Bulldog). The challengers got the advantage early on, with Luger wearing down Yokozuna by smashing Yokozuna's {{head into the}} top turnbuckle. Yokozuna accidentally fell onto Hart's foot, sparking a confrontation between the tag team partners. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> the two settled their differences, the challengers retained the advantage {{for much of the}} match. The finish came after the Allied Powers double-teamed on Yokozuna. Following a back suplex, the referee ordered Bulldog, who wasn't the legal man, out of the ring. Hart hit the distracted Luger with a double axe handle from the top rope, allowing Yokozuna to pin Luger with a leg drop.|$|E
25|$|Warren found Crawford's {{division}} hesitating at {{the edge}} of the woods on the east side of Gilliam's field at the same time Custer's division was being held back by Rooney Lee's men to the south and west. The Union soldiers were not heeding officers' orders to move forward against Corse's line of breastworks. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> for reorganization of the units, Warren took the corps flag and rode into the field with his staff officers and called for the men to follow. The men then rose and followed their officers and color bearers to attack Corse's brigade, capturing many prisoners and dispersing the other Confederates. In the attack, Warren's horse was shot from under him just short of the Confederate line, an orderly was killed and Lieutenant Colonel Hollon Richardson of the 7th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment was badly wounded when he jumped his horse between Warren and the Confederate defenders.|$|E
