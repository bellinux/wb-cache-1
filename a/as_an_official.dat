5|$|English was the {{official}} language of Sarawak from 1963 to 1974 due to opposition from First Chief Minister of Sarawak Stephen Kalong Ningkan {{to the use of}} the Malay language in Sarawak. In 1974 the new Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub recognised Malay alongside English <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> language of Sarawak. This new status given to the Malay language was further reinforced by new education standards transitioning curriculum to Malay. In 1985 English lost the status of an official language, leaving only Malay. Despite official policy, Sarawak opposition members argue that English remained the de facto official language of Sarawak. English is still spoken in the legal courts, and state legislative assembly.

5|$|In 1979, McNair's {{idea for}} a Yellow Jacket was reintroduced by another Georgia Tech student, Richie Bland. Bland, who was {{apparently}} unaware of McNair's prior initiative, paid $1,400 to have a local theme park costume designer make a yellow jacket costume that he first wore at a pep rally prior to the Tennessee football game. Rather than obtain permission from Georgia Tech as Judi had done in 1972, this student, {{a few weeks later}} simply sneaked onto the field in costume during a football game and ran across the field. The fans naturally believed that this costumed character was acting <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> member of the cheerleading squad and responded accordingly. By 1980 this new incarnation of the yellow jacket mascot was given the name Buzz Bee and was adopted <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> mascot by Georgia Tech. This new Buzz character would be the model for a new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.|$|E
