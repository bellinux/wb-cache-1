5|$|An {{analysis}} of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by June Swann and published in 1996, reveals that the most common place of concealment is the chimney, fireplace or hearth (26.2 per cent), followed by under the floor or above the ceiling (22.9 per cent), <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around doors and windows, under the stairs, and among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, town houses, manor houses, hospitals, workhouses, factories, public houses, and two Oxford colleges, St John's and Queen's. They have even been found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a Benedictine monastery in Germany and a Baptist church in Cheshire, England.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} years of the 19th century and {{the first years of the}} 20th, the {{escalation}} in the building of battleships became an arms race between Britain and Germany. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power. Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the United States and Japan. Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Chile and Brazil all had second-rate fleets led by armored cruisers, coastal defence ships or monitors.|$|E

25|$|The {{point of}} Task Force Growdon reached Munsan-ni at 18:30 on March 23, but the {{remainder}} of the extended column took several hours longer. The force encountered no Chinese positions along Route 1 but was kept to an intermittent crawl by having to lift or explode over 150 live mines, some of them booby-trapped, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> many dummy mines, including a five-mile (8km) stretch of buried C-rations and beer cans. Casualties were few, but four tanks were disabled by mines. As the last of these tanks hit a mine a mile (1.5km) below Munsan-ni, the explosion attracted artillery fire that damaged two more. The tail of the task force finally arrived at the airborne position at 07:00 on March 24.|$|E
25|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are large}} and broad, with rounded margins. The two dorsal fins are roughly equal in size and have rounded apices and angular free rear tips; the first dorsal fin originates over the bases of the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins are rounded <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> large as the pectoral fins. The anal fin {{is less than half}} the size of the dorsal fins and is positioned very close {{to the base of the}} long, low caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises about a quarter of the total length, with no ventral lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are large, giving the skin a rough texture. This species is light to dark brown above, often with white flecks, and lighter below. Juveniles also have dark bands over the body and tail, which fade with age. The blind shark can reach a length of , though most are much smaller.|$|E
25|$|While {{this was}} happening, Hart took {{advantage}} of a momentary lapse in concentration by Austin, who had just finished attacking Diesel, and threw him over the top rope {{on the far side}} of the ring. As Austin got to his feet, he quickly realized that none of the officials had seen his feet touch the floor as they were too busy with breaking the brawl up on the opposite side of the ring. Austin then got back into the ring and continued in the match as if he had not been eliminated, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> soon as he did so he pushed both Undertaker and Vader, who were locked in a battle of their own to try to stay in the match, over the top. By this time, Mankind and Funk had been separated and the officials could focus again on the match, just in time to see Hart eliminate Diesel. Just after he did, though, Austin returned the favor from before and dumped Hart out of the ring. As a result, since as far as the officials were concerned Austin was still a legal participant in the match, he was declared the winner of the Royal Rumble.|$|E

[...] The upper surface may be â€”lined with {{what appear to be}} multiple concentric zones of texture caused by areas of fine hairs (a tomentum); and the edges of the caps have a layer of very fine hairs and are lobed and wavy. The underside of the caps bears the fertile, spore-making tissue called the hymenium, which typically has shallow, crowded wrinkles or veins that are roughly the same color or paler than the top surface. Some variation in color has been observed depending on the collection location. For example, specimens found in Alaska {{are more likely to be}} jet-black in color with a dark gray underside.|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine complimented Carey's mixture of pop and hip hop melodies, and wrote, [...] "Though there's nothing as {{immediate}} as 'Fantasy' or 'My All' here, Charmbracelet is significantly less contrived than 1999's Rainbow <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> creatively liberating as Butterfly. British columnist Angus Batey, writing for Yahoo! Music UK called the songs on Charmbracelet forgettable, and wrote, [...] "She used to take risks, but Charmbracelet is conservative, unadventurous and uninspiring; and, while it's understandable that simply to make another record marks a triumph of sorts, it's impossible to admire Mariah to the degree that her talent ought to merit." [...] John Mulvey from NME criticized its content, writing, [...] "Nominally, Charmbracelet is R, much like Tony Blair is nominally a socialist...Tragedies, all told, have been worse" ...|$|E

[...] Jacobs also opined that the leading tone that begins [...] "Never mind the why and wherefore" [...] "serves to emphasize the phrase like a Johann Strauss-ian grace-note". The Sullivan scholar David Russell Hulme noted Sullivan's parody of operatic styles, [...] "particularly the Handelian recitatives and the elopement scene (evocative of so many nocturnal operatic conspiracies), but best {{of all is the}} travesty of the patriotic tune in 'For he is an Englishman!'" [...] Buttercup's Act II song, in which she reveals the dark secret of the baby-switching is preceded by a quote from Franz Schubert's [...] "The Erl-King" [...] and also parodies the opera Il Trovatore. Jacobs notes that Sullivan also adds his own humorous touches to the music by setting commonplace expressions in [...] "Donizettian recitative". But on the serious side, he enhances the moments of true emotional climax, as in Josephine's Act II aria, and added musical interest to concerted numbers by [...] "subtly shifting the rhythms and bar groupings." ...|$|E
500|$|At that time, the Yellow River was flooding, causing {{widespread}} devastation to {{the people}} and the rice harvests.

The emperor granted Luan Da the title of the General of Five Boons, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> an afterthought, three other such titles: the General of Heavenly Practitioners, the General of the Earth Practitioners, and General Grand Communicator. Emperor Wu also lavished gifts on him; he was granted the marquisate of Letong, giving him some 2,000 households to rule over, and the emperor also gave him a luxurious mansion, a thousand servants, opulent transportation, many decorations, a seal labelled [...] "General of Heavenly Way", and even the hand in marriage of Princess Wei Zifu, the emperor's eldest daughter, accompanied by a dowry estimated at 10,000 catties of gold. The emperor himself, along with envoys, members of the royal family, and high-ranking officials often invited Luan Da to dine or paid him house calls merely to ask how he was doing. With his marquisate and five generalships, Luan Da had become a man of great standing only a few months after his introduction to the emperor. He was no longer merely Emperor Wu's subject, but an envoy of the immortal beings with status equal to the emperor.|$|E
