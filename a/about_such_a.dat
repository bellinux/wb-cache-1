5|$|What Hasekura said or did {{to bring}} <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> result is unknown. As later events tend to {{indicate}} {{that he and his}} descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E

25|$|While {{in-house}} production had ceased, the BBC {{hoped to find}} an independent production company to relaunch the show.

Segal's negotiations eventually led to a Doctor Who television film, broadcast on the Fox Network in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, Universal Pictures, the BBC and BBC Worldwide. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1million viewers), it was less so in the United States and {{did not lead to}} a series.|$|E

25|$|Bacon {{has been}} called the father of empiricism. His works argued for the {{possibility}} of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> method, the Baconian method, did not have a long lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology today. In addition to his work in the sciences, Bacon was also a venerable patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories- history, poesy, and philosophy- which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings.|$|E

He further maintains that, if Weems was making up a story, he would have more dramatically depicted the young Washington chopping down the cherry tree, not merely [...] "barking it" [...] (i.e., removing some of the bark), as Weems never claimed that the tree was chopped down. There has been much conjecture and ad hominem attacks from some historians about Weems and his story, but none have proven or disproven the story.|$|E

By contrast, at a fan gathering in 2008, St. John joked about Todd and Marty bonding during the Carlivati storyline, stating, [...] "I'm all for gang rape."

500|$|After {{the almost}} {{unanimous}} praise {{received by the}} album Decipher and the perplexities raised by the new musical direction of the EP Exordium, there were great expectations for the new album by fans and specialized press alike. The complexity {{of the music and}} concept of Invisible Circles produced mixed reviews, ranging from highest praise to complete failure, even in the same publication. The bold move of making a concept album <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> controversial matter was generally appreciated but, as Eduardo Rivadavia said in his AllMusic review, this could be a [...] "slightly overambitious creation". The Maximum Metal reviewer states that [...] "concept albums are always hard to pull off and not many bands can do it well" [...] and [...] "here is another failed attempt".|$|E
500|$|Trying {{to unravel}} {{the mystery of the}} song, Greil Marcus writes that the song is {{concerned}} with internal questions, rather than external ones: [...] "Line by line, 'Blowin' in the Wind' is pious, or falsely innocent—isn't it obvious that whoever wrote [...] "Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand?" [...] already knows the answer, assuming he, or anyone, can actually bring themselves to care <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> precious question? But 'Visions of Johanna' is asking different sorts of questions. Such as: Where are you? Who are you? What are you doing here?" [...] Evoking the drugged, urban milieu of the song, Marcus writes of [...] "People wandering from one corner of a loft to another, doped, drunk, half-awake, fast asleep, no point to the next breath, let alone the next step." [...] For Marcus, [...] "'Visions of Johanna' makes a narrative solely out of atmosphere." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter how bad things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E

When speaking of the song, Gore said [...] "the song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonna's rendition. It also speaks to the fact that there's got to be more support and more communication in families about this problem, and anything that fosters that I applaud." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fur Trade in Canada also {{describes}} the cultural interactions among {{three groups of}} people: the Europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items; the European colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from the home country, and First Nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots, knives, guns and liquor. Innis {{describes the}} central role First Nations peoples played {{in the development of}} the fur trade. Without their skilled hunting techniques, knowledge of the territory and advanced tools such as snowshoes, toboggans and birch-bark canoes, the fur trade would not have existed. However, dependence on European technologies disrupted First Nations societies. [...] "The new technology with its radical innovations", Innis writes, [...] "brought <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> rapid shift in the prevailing Indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of the peoples concerned by warfare and disease." [...] Historian Carl Berger argues that by placing First Nations culture at the centre of his analysis of the fur trade, Innis [...] "was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of European capitalism." ...|$|E
