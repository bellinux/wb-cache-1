5|$|In May 2002, Payá {{presented}} NAPP with 11,020 signatures {{calling for}} a referendum on safeguarding {{freedom of speech and}} assembly, allowing private business ownership, and ending one-party rule. On 3 October 2003, he delivered an additional 14,000 signatures. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter endorsed the petition when granted <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> on Cuban television, bringing Payá's efforts to the attention of a wide Cuban audience. Cuban President Fidel Castro described the petition drive as a U.S.-backed conspiracy to overthrow his government.|$|E
5|$|The Sun Bowl was not {{the only}} bowl game to involve racial exclusion. Many {{football}} games during the twentieth century affected the integration of collegiate football and sports in general: in addition to Lafayette, there were games played at The University of California, Los Angeles (19381941), Drake University (19481952), Georgia Tech (19541956), and the University of Wyoming (19671970) that led to integrated football games. At the time, these schools conducted studies to monitor the treatment of African American players and how the schools reacted to certain situations involving segregation and prejudice. The teams that were in favor of African Americans participating in football gave players <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> out against the racism {{that took place in the}} sport. As a result of protests and communities coming together to support black football players, college football slowly became integrated.|$|E

25|$|To {{celebrate}} the official launch of The Book of Air Collector's Edition, PlayFirst invited four local Dream Chronicles fans in San Francisco, United States. The invitation included {{one and a}} half hour to preview the game, a trip to the California Academy of Sciences, a tour around their office, and time to speak with a panel of the local Dream Chronicles team about the inspiration, story, and future of the Dream Chronicles series. Here, the fans got <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with Kenny Dinkin, PlayFirst's Chief Creative Officer then about the inspiration for Dream Chronicles, and how they work with the developer KatGames. PlayFirst also hosted seven members of the media, three of their local Dream Chronicles fans, their CEO Mari Baker, and senior product marketing manager Becky Ann Hughes on a real airship ride over San Francisco Bay Area, mimicking Lyra’s own travels in the game.|$|E

25|$|In June, Gravano was {{approached}} by Ruggiero and, supposedly at Gotti's behest, given orders to murder capo Robert DiBernardo for making negative remarks about Gotti's leadership. Gravano was friendly with DiBernardo {{and tried to get}} the murder called off until he had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with Gotti after his trial. Ruggiero claimed to have met again with Gotti and told Gravano that the boss wanted DiBernardo killed right away. Gravano arranged a meeting with DiBernardo where Joe Paruta, a member of Gravano's crew, shot DiBernardo twice {{in the back of the}} head as the underboss watched. Gravano later learned that Ruggiero was $250,000 in debt to DiBernardo and realized Ruggiero may have fabricated the orders from Gotti or simply lied to Gotti about what DiBernardo was accused of saying in order to erase the debt and improve his own standing in the family. In any event, DiBernardo's death proved profitable for Gravano, as he took over the deceased man's control of Teamsters Local 282.|$|E
25|$|King Lear of Britain, {{elderly and}} wanting to retire from {{the duties of the}} monarchy, decides to divide his realm among his three daughters, and {{declares}} he will offer the largest share to the one who loves him most. The eldest, Goneril, speaks first, declaring her love for her father in fulsome terms. Moved by her flattery Lear proceeds to grant to Goneril her share as soon as she has finished her declaration, before Regan and Cordelia have <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> He then awards to Regan her share as soon as she has spoken. When it is finally the turn of his youngest and favorite daughter, Cordelia, at first she refuses to say anything ("Nothing, my Lord") and then declares there is nothing to compare her love to, nor words to properly express it; she speaks honestly but bluntly, which infuriates him. In his anger he disinherits Cordelia and divides her share between Regan and Goneril.|$|E

50|$|Under the bilingual {{policy of}} Singapore, Chinese Singaporeans had <b>a</b> greater <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> and use English {{especially}} {{in school and}} at work.

Generally speaking, most Chinese Singaporeans are able <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> Mandarin, and also read newspapers in it, but only a minority is able to use it at a professional level such as academic research, literary writing etc. In the endeavor to use English, some Chinese Singaporeans even distanced themselves from the mother tongue culture, resulting in the erosion of Chinese culture in Singapore.|$|R
500|$|Critical {{response}} of the time to the program was mixed. The New York Times, The Washington Star, and the Chicago Daily News praised CBS for addressing the subject. George Gent of the Times, however, commented on the anti-gay bias of the show, noting that it would [...] "have been better to give the minority viewpoint that homosexuals are just as normal as anyone else <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> for itself."

500|$|The flight, {{eventual}} arrest, {{and murder}} of Caro Payán angered his associates that headed the Sinaloa and Sonora Cartels. Two leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, Joaquín [...] "El Chapo" [...] Guzmán, now Mexico's most-wanted, and his business partner Héctor [...] "El Güero" [...] Palma, attempted {{to take control of}} Tijuana from the hands of the Arellano Félix in the early 1990s. The antagonism lasted for several years and was accompanied by violent acts in the states of Baja California, Sonora, Sinaloa, Durango, Jalisco, Guerrero, Michoacán and Oaxaca. In 1989, [...] "El Chapo" [...] Guzmán sent Armando López (alias [...] "El Rayo"), one of his most-trusted men, to speak with the Arellano Félix in Tijuana. Before he had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> face-to-face with them, López was killed by Ramón. The corpse was disposed in {{the outskirts of the city}} and the Tijuana Cartel ordered a hit on the remaining family members of the López family to prevent future reprisals. Two years later, Ramón killed another Sinaloa Cartel associate, Rigoberto Campos Salcido (alias [...] "El Rigo"), prompting bigger conflicts with the rival cartel. In September 1992, the Tijuana Cartel ordered another hit against their rivals; in Iguala, Guerrero, lawyers of Félix Gallardo and several of his family members were kidnapped and killed by gunmen. [...] "El Güero" [...] Palma responded to the attacks by ordering several of his men to kill eight members of the Arellano Félix organization at the Christine discothèque in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Ramón and Francisco Javier were the prime targets but they escaped uninjured.|$|E

2500|$|Nine {{government}} {{witnesses were}} {{called by the}} prosecution. Army Captain Robert Snyder, John Threadcraft, a former army officer, and FBI agent John Jefferson testified first.

Give me a little credit, this is not a list of targets against New York. I was never planning to bomb it. You're lying."

The judge disallowed as evidence her possession of chemicals and terror manuals and her alleged ties to al-Qaeda because they could have created an inappropriate bias.|$|E

This was what the carabinieri thought. When I had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to one of them – something which didn't happen often because I didn't really trust them – I realised that it was a widely held belief that Tano Badalamenti was a gentleman and it was us who were the trouble-makers."

2500|$|Using as a {{model the}} [...] "Mississippi Plan", which had {{redeemed}} that state in 1874, South Carolina whites used intimidation, violence, persuasion, {{and control of the}} blacks. In 1876, tensions were high, especially in Piedmont towns where the numbers of blacks were fewer than whites. In these counties, blacks sometimes made up a narrow majority. There were numerous demonstrations by the Red Shirts—white Democrats determined to win the upcoming elections by any means possible. The Red Shirts turned the tide in South Carolina, convincing whites that this could indeed be the year they regain control and terrorizing blacks to stay away from voting, due to incidents such as the Hamburg Massacre in July, the Ellenton riots in October, and other similar events in Aiken County and Edgefield District. Armed with heavy pistols and rifles, they rode on horseback to every Republican meeting, and demanded <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> The Red Shirts milled among the crowds. Each selected a black man to watch, privately threatening to shoot him if he raised a disturbance. The Redeemers organized hundreds of rifle clubs. Obeying proclamations to disband, they sometimes reorganized as missionary societies or dancing clubs—with rifles.|$|E
