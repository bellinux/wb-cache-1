40|$|In this work, {{surge of}} {{prevention}} {{is a critical}} problem in oil and gas industries, particularly when return gas flow or gas flow reduces in transportation of gas pipelines. This paper is illustrated new results about surge control of centrifugal compressors. surge phenomenon is flow unsteady state in compressors which causes damages seriously in compressor construction. Furthermore, it also demonstrates in comparison with <b>anti</b> <b>surge</b> control ،active surge control expands stability range. Active surge control which based on fuzzy logic،is the main idea that used in this investigation. Using fuzzy controller causes an improvement in compressor's condition and increase performance range of the compressor, in addition to prevention of any instability in compressor. The simulation results is also satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{describe}} a modular control system development for Turbogas Power Units (TPU) {{based on a}} PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). The starting up control sequence, protections, process supervision, <b>anti</b> <b>surge</b> control and speed/load regulation functions were developed and implanted in a modern high performance PLC according to the state-of-the-art IEC 1131 - 3 programming standard. Simulation tests were carried out with a dynamic mathematical model of a TPU implanted in an industrial PC (Personal Computer) with hardware interfaces for input/output process signals. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the control system strategy over the whole operating range. With little effort, the control system can be easily implanted in other PLC´s (from different manufacturers) thanks to the modular design of the software. The software with modular structure can accept changes of the control strategies...|$|E
40|$|Surge of turbo {{compressors}} {{can cause}} large stepwise changes in flow and pressure, which can potentially damage the compressor and any equipment {{that is in}} direct connection with the compressor. Surge is usually avoided by an <b>anti</b> <b>surge</b> controller (ASC). However, {{in spite of the}} ASC surge cycles may occur. A more robust approach is therefore to design the compressor, piping layout and attached equipment such that surge cycles can be sustained, For the evaluation of the effect of surge on a new centrifugal compressor it was intended to apply a model that simulates the flow and pressure variations that occur during a deep surge cycle. In order to increase the confidence in the reliability of the model, experimental data from two existing compressor systems forced into surge were compared with the results of simulations, It appeared that the simulation results compared very well with the measurements. As a next step, the model has been applied to evaluate the forces that can occur on a cooling circuit in the driver. © TNO Science and Industry, 2010...|$|E
