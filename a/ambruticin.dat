50|$|<b>Ambruticin</b> and Jerangolid A - Antifungal agents.|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antifungal}} inhibitory activities of <b>ambruticin</b> and of various antifungal drugs of choice against 190 fungal pathogens {{representative of the}} major human mycoses were compared using a modification of the ICS agar dilution technique. <b>Ambruticin</b> compared favorably with amphotericin B and miconazole when tested against the dimorphic pathogens Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Blastomyces dermatitidis and against Aspergillus fumigatus. Miconazole was the most active compound against Sporothrix schenckii, Allescheria (Petriellidium) boydii, and selected dematiaceous fungi, with <b>ambruticin</b> giving minimal inhibitory, concentrations from 3 - to 74 -fold higher. <b>Ambruticin</b> compared unfavorably with amphotericin B and 5 -fluorocytosine when tested against Candida and Torulopsis species. <b>Ambruticin</b> was not as active in vitro as tolnaftate when tested against the three genera of dermatophytic fungi, but compared favorably with miconazole...|$|E
40|$|The polyketide <b>ambruticin</b> is an {{attractive}} candidate for drug development as an antifungal agent, but its mechanism of action {{has not yet been}} elucidated. Here we present evidence that <b>ambruticin</b> exerts its effect by targeting HOG, the osmotic stress control pathway, through Hik 1, a group III histidine kinase. Ambruticins are polyketides of unusual structure produced by strains of Sorangium (Polyangium) cellulosum (4, 9, 17). The S and VS congeners (Fig. 1) have potent antifungal activity and might provide new drugs to treat certain fungal infections. <b>Ambruticin</b> S and two derivatives of <b>ambruticin</b> VS 3 have been shown to cure mice of acute pulmonary coccidodiomycosis or histoplasmosis with twice-a-day oral dosing (6, 18). Similarly, oral administration of an analog of <b>ambruticin</b> VS 3 signifi-cantly reduced pulmonary fungal burdens and promoted im-proved survival in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (3). A number of fungicides, including phenylpyrroles (e. g., pyr...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ambruticin</b> (W 7783) was {{evaluated}} in vivo in mice subacutely or nonlethally infected with Histoplasma capsulatum. Results {{were compared with}} those obtained with amphotericin B, the drug of choice in human histoplasmosis. In one experiment, <b>ambruticin</b> was shown {{to be capable of}} curing infected animals as evidenced by totally negative liver and spleen cultures obtained when mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks of oral treatment with 150 mg of drug per kg per day. The 50 % cure dose for <b>ambruticin</b> was between 75 and 150 mg/kg per day; the 50 % cure dose for oral amphotericin B in this experiment was between 1. 56 and 6. 25 mg/kg per day. In a second experiment, both oral <b>ambruticin</b> (150 mg/kg per day) and oral amphotericin B (25 mg/kg per day) were again curative, but to a lesser degree than in the first experiment. Biological cures were obtained with both drugs after 3 and 4 weeks of treatment but not after 2 weeks...|$|E
40|$|We {{have shown}} that the plant {{pathogen}} Alternaria brassicicola exhibited very high susceptibility to <b>ambruticin</b> VS 4 {{and to a lesser extent}} to the phenylpyrrole fungicide fludioxonil. These compounds are both derived from natural bacterial metabolites with antifungal properties and are thought to exert their toxicity by interfering with osmoregulation in filamentous fungi. Disruption of the osmosensor group III histidine kinase gene AbNIK 1 (for A. brassicola NIK 1) resulted in high levels of resistance to <b>ambruticin</b> and fludioxonil, while a mutant isolate characterized by a single-amino-acid substitution in the HAMP domain of the kinase only exhibited moderate resistance. Moreover, the natural resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to these antifungal molecules switched to sensitivity in strains expressing AbNIK 1 p. We also showed that exposure to fludioxonil and <b>ambruticin</b> resulted in abnormal phosphorylation of a Hog 1 -like mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in A. brassicicola. Parallel experiments carried out with wild-type and mutant isolates of Neurospora crassa revealed that, in this species, <b>ambruticin</b> susceptibility was dependent on the OS 1 -RRG 1 branch of the phosphorelay pathway downstream of the OS 2 MAPK cascade but independent of the yeast Skn 7 -like response regulator RRG 2. These results show that the ability to synthesize a functional group III histidine kinase is a prerequisite for the expression of <b>ambruticin</b> and phenylpyrrole susceptibility in A. brassicicola and N. crassa and that, at least in the latter species, improper activation of the high-osmolarity glycerol-related pathway could explain their fungicidal properties...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ambruticin</b> is a cyclopropyl-pyran acid, {{representing}} {{a new class}} of antibiotics. It has a relatively broad antifungal spectrum in vitro and is highly active against dimorphic as well as filamentous organisms. Of 24 strains of dermatophytic fungi tested, the majority were susceptible to <b>ambruticin</b> at 0. 049 μg/ml or less. The minimal inhibitory concentration for the systemic fungi Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis was 0. 049 to 0. 39 μg/ml. <b>Ambruticin</b> is fungicidal for metabolizing cells of Microsporum fulvum and does not cause cell leakage of 260 -nm absorbing material. The antibiotic is effective orally as well as topically in guinea pigs experimentally infected with Trichophyton mentagrophytes. In mice, a single oral dose of 75 mg/kg produced peak serum levels of 45 μg/ml in 1 h with a serum half-life of 3. 1 h. Excretion of the antibiotic is principally by the biliary route...|$|E
40|$|Ring A of <b>Ambruticin,</b> in derivatized form (88), and a ring B {{derivative}} (93) were synthesized {{and used}} to determine the absolute stereochemistry of <b>Ambruticin.</b> The critical step that served to fix the stereochemistry in ring A could not be repeated on another system. Phosphonate 46 allowed the three-carbon homologation of aldehydes to conjugated ketene dithioacetals, but these could not be hydrolyzed. The resolution of 2 -acetoxyaldehydes by 1 -ephedrine was generalized, and an attempt was made to rationalize the behaviour of the intermediate oxazolidines, and to settle the controversy over their C(, 2) -configurations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ambruticin</b> S, an {{antifungal}} cyclopropyl-pyran acid, showed curative effects against murine coccidioidal infection. Two analogs of this compound {{with greater}} in vitro potency were tested against lethal murine Coccidioides infection. Both improved {{the survival of}} mice over that of controls; one resulted in near-sterilization of infection...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAmbruticins and jerangolids are {{structurally}} related antifungal polyketides {{produced by}} Sorangium cellulosum strains. Comparative {{analysis of the}} gene clusters and characterization of compounds produced by gene knockout strains suggested hypothetical schemes for biosynthesis of these compounds. Polyketide synthase (PKS) architecture suggests that the pyran ring structure common to ambruticins and jerangolids forms by an intramolecular reaction on a PKS-bound intermediate. Disrupting ambM, encoding a discrete enzyme homologous to PKS C-methyltransferase domains, gave 15 -desmethylambruticins. Thus, AmbM is required for C-methylation, but not pyran ring formation. Several steps in the post-PKS modification of <b>ambruticin</b> involve new enzymology. Remarkably, the methylcyclopropane ring and putative carbon atom excision during <b>ambruticin</b> biosynthesis apparently occur on the PKS assembly line. The mechanism probably involves a Favorskii rearrangement, but further work is required to elucidate these complex events...|$|E
40|$|Ambruticins are {{a family}} of polyketides. The {{antifungal}} activity of an <b>ambruticin,</b> KOSN- 2079, was tested in the mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. KOSN- 2079 significantly reduced pulmonary fungal burdens and improved survival over that with the vehicle control. These results support the continued development of ambruticins as antifungal agents...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{products}} (+) -decarestrictine L and (+) -ambruticin are tetrahydropyran containing {{molecules that}} were isolated from different soil inhabiting bacteria. They possess important biological properties and make interesting synthetic targets. * Decarestrictine L is a tetrahydropyran that was isolated from bacteria {{of the species}} Penicillium simplicissimum and Penicillium corylophilum that were present in soil samples collected in the United States and Portugal. Initial investigations revealed that cholesterol biosynthesis in HEP-G 2 liver cells of normolipidemic rats was significantly inhibited {{in the presence of}} Decarestrictine L. Previously, five total syntheses were described in the literature. Our synthesis begins with commercially available tri- O -acetyl-D-glucal, relies upon a C -glycosidation reaction, and prepares (+) -decarestrictine L in 13 steps and 8. 5 % overall yield. <b>Ambruticin</b> contains a tetrahydropyran ring, a divinylcyclopropane, and a dihydropryan ring that are joined via three E -olefinic bonds. <b>Ambruticin</b> was isolated from the myxobacteria Polyangium Cellulosum var. fulvum and {{has been found to be}} an orally active antifungal agent that exhibits pronounced activity against Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Blastomyces dermatitidis and has been shown to kill the yeast strain Hansenula anomala. To date four total syntheses and numerous partial syntheses have been reported. Our synthesis of the C 17 -C 24 dihydropryan containing segment relies upon a dienealdehyde cyclocondensation reaction and a C -glycosidation reaction. The synthesis begins with a known diene and known optically active aldehyde and results in the dihydropryan in 6 total steps and 33 % overall yield. The C 9 -C 16 cyclopropane containing segment was prepared using organoiron methodology with the C 13 -C 14 E -olefin formed via olefin cross metathesis. The cyclopropane containing segment was synthesized from a known optically active iron cation in three steps and 24 % overall yield. *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams...|$|E
40|$|Actinomycetes produce many pharmaceutically useful {{compounds}} through type I polyketide biosynthetic pathways. Soil {{has traditionally}} been an important source for these actinomycete-derived pharmaceuticals. As the rate of antibiotic discovery has decreased and the incidence of antibiotic resistance has increased, researchers have looked for alternatives to soil for bioprospecting. Street sediment, where actinomycetes make up a larger fraction of the bacterial population than in soil, is one such alternative environment. To determine if these differences in actinomycetal community structure are reflected in type I polyketide synthases (PKSI) distribution, environmental DNA from soils and street sediments was characterized by sequencing amplicons of PKSI-specific PCR primers. Amplicons covered two domains: the last 80 amino acids of the ketosynthase (KS) domain and the first 240 amino acids of the acyltransferase (AT) domain. One hundred and ninety clones from ten contrasting soils from six regions and nine street sediments from six cities were sequenced. Twenty-five clones from two earthworm-affected samples were also sequenced. UniFrac lineage-specific analysis identified two clades that clustered with actinomycetal GenBank matches that were street sediment-specific, one similar to the PKSI segment of the mycobactin siderophore involved in mycobacterial virulence. A clade of soil-specific sequences clustered with GenBank matches from the <b>ambruticin</b> and jerangolid pathways of Sorangium cellulosum. All three of these clades were found in sites > 700 km apart. Street sediments are enriched in actinomycetal PKSIs. Non-actinomycetal PKSI pathways may be more chemically diverse than actinomycetal PKSIs. Common soil and street sediment PKIs are globally distributed. ...|$|E
