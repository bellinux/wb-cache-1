40|$|This paper compares {{alternative}} liability {{rules for}} allocating losses from defective products when consumers under- estimate these losses and producers {{may have some}} market power. If producers {{do not have any}} market power, the rule of strict liability. leads to both the first-best <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> and industry output. If producers do have some market power, strict liability still leads to the first-best <b>accident</b> <b>probability,</b> but there will now be too little output of the industry. It is shown that if market power is sufficiently large, a negligence rule is preferable. Under this rule, firms can still be induced to choose the first-best <b>accident</b> <b>probability,</b> but now the remaining damages are borne by consumers. Since consumers underestimate these damages, they buy more than under strict liability. However, {{there is a limit to}} how much the negligence rule can encourage extra consumption. It is shown that if market power is sufficiently large, the rule of no liability may then be preferred to the negligence rule. Without any liability imposed, producers will not choose the first-best <b>accident</b> <b>probability.</b> However, this may be more than compensated for by the increased output of the industry. ...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} risk management, the routing of hazardous materials (hazmat) {{has relied on}} relatively simplistic methods. In this paper, we apply an advanced risk measure, called conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), for routing hazmat trucks. CVaR offers a flexible, risk-averse, and computationally tractable routing method that is appropriate for hazmat accident mitigation strategies. The two important data types in hazmat transportation are <b>accident</b> <b>probabilities</b> and <b>accident</b> consequences, {{both of which are}} subject to many ambiguous factors. In addition, historical data are usually insufficient to construct a <b>probability</b> distribution of <b>accident</b> <b>probabilities</b> and consequences. This motivates our development of a new robust optimization approach for considering the worst-case CVaR (WCVaR) under data uncertainty. We study important axioms to ensure that both the CVaR and WCVaR risk measures are coherent and appropriate in the context of hazmat transportation. We also devise a computational method for WCVaR and demonstrate the proposed WCVaR concept with a case study in a realistic road network.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD thesis is the investigation of <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> and severity exploiting high resolution traffic and weather data from urban roads and motorways, collected on a real-time basis, with specific focus on Powered-Two-Wheelers. For that purpose, an advanced mesoscopic multi-faceted statistical analysis was conducted in order to expand previous road safety work {{and contribute to the}} further understanding the complex issues of <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> and severity. Linear models as well as non-linear models were developed on the basis of 6 -year accident data from urban roads as well as an urban motorway in Greater Athens area (Attica Tollway). Empirical findings indicate that high resolution traffic and weather data are capable of opening new dimensions in accident analysis in urban roads and urban motorways. The multi-faceted statistical analysis conducted in the thesis has revealed a consistent and strong influence of traffic parameters on <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> and severity. It is interesting that weather parameters were not found to influence <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> and severity when linear relationships are considered. Lastly, the application of cusp catastrophe models demonstrated that it is likely that even small traffic and weather changes may have a critical impact on road safety in urban roads as sudden transitions from safe to unsafe conditions (and vice versa) may occur...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of liability, insurance, and side {{payments}} for independent safety controls with unobservable care levels. By independent safety controls we mean that the <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> depends on the care levels of two parties, and {{that the effects of}} the controls on the <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> are stochastically inde-pendent. We show that efficiency can be reached for these kinds of double moral hazard through side payments if one agent detects that the other agent's security control has failed. This requires either an appropriate liability rule, or an arbitrarily chosen liability rule combined with fair insurance coverage. ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{competitive}} {{models of}} insurance markets under asymmetric information predict {{a positive relationship}} between coverage and the <b>accident</b> <b>probability.</b> This paper derives the conditions under which this prediction holds true in a general setting involving multiple loss levels and fixed administrative costs. If there is one loss level, this prediction holds necessarily true only if all equilibrium contracts offer strictly positive coverage. With multiple loss levels, the positive relationship between coverage and the <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> may not hold true even if all contracts offer strictly positive coverage and administrative costs are zero. These results have important implications for empirical testing. (c) 2607 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

In particular, we examine the question whether choosing finer partitions to define these groups generates more equitable situations than coarser groups. Though it turns out that partitioning the agents into finer groups can never be Lorenz dominated by the coarser partition, it cannot be guaranteed that finer partitions represent improvements over coarser ones except in very restrictive circumstances. ...|$|R
40|$|Encouraging {{people to}} cycle more often is well {{supported}} {{in the academic}} literature due to the numerous positive economic, social and environmental benefits {{that are associated with}} the use of bicycles as a form of transportation. Despite these benefits, the use of the bicycle for day to day transportation remains relatively low outside of European and Asian countries, with one of the main barriers to encouraging more people to cycle more often being related to the perceived and actual dangers associated with riding a bicycle. Using a case-control methodology, this research investigated what characteristics contribute to where bicycle accidents occur in proportion to where to people cycle. Logistic regression analysis identified that the probability of being involved in a bicycle-motor vehicle (BMV) accident increases when specific characteristics are present and decreases with the presence of on road cycle lanes.

40|$|Societal {{debates about}} the riskiness and {{acceptability}} of controversial technologies have led scientists to propose and apply quantitative definitions of risk.

One such factor is the (subjective) probability of a future loss or accident. The present monograph reports on a series of studies about the cognitive mechanisms underlying <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> assesment. For complex and realistic risky activities, <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> judgments may be based on two fundamentally different types of information: frequency and scenario information. Frequency information refers to the outcomes of similar situations or activities in the past (''how often did accidents happen?''). Scenario information describes the way(s) in which a future accident may occur (''how might an accident happen?''). The aim of the present research was to study the role and relative importance of these types of information for risk judgment and risky decision making. [...] . Zie: Summary. ...|$|E

40|$|Given that, in equilibrium, all agents freely opt for {{strictly}} positive own coverage, competitive {{models of}} asymmetric information predict {{a positive relationship}} between coverage and ex post risk (<b>accident</b> <b>probability).</b> On the other hand, some recent empirical studies find either negative or no correlation. This paper, by introducing heterogeneity in risk perceptions into an asymmetric information competitive model, provides an explanation to this puzzle. The more optimistic agents underestimate their <b>accident</b> <b>probability</b> relative to less optimistic and so purchase less insurance. They also tend to be less willing to take precautions. This gives rise to separating equilibria exhibiting negative or no correlation between coverage and ex post risk that potentially explain the puzzling empirical findings. Moreover, the no-correlation equilibrium involves some agents being quantity-constrained due to adverse selection. Thus, although the no-correlation empirical findings indicate that there may not be risk-related adverse selection, they do not imply the absence of other forms of adverse selection that have significant effects on the resulting equilibrium. ...|$|E

40|$|Moral hazard and adverse {{selection}} are potentially important features of car insurance markets. Interestingly, the empirical literature has found hard {{to establish the}} presence of asymmetric information. Such surprising findings are {{in part due to}} the lack of extensive longitudinal data. ^ In the first chapter of the dissertation I present a survey of both theoretical and empirical studies regarding information asymmetries in car insurance markets. ^ In the second chapter I examine the empirical importance of moral hazard, {{adverse selection}} and true state dependence in the determination of motor vehicle accidents using a longitudinal data set on car insurance policies that I obtained from an Italian insurance company. I develop a dynamic model of driving effort given an insurance contract that allows for moral hazard, for adverse selection and for state dependence. Simulations based on a calibrated version of the structural model suggest that driving effort increases in the marginal premium price increase. From the model I derive an approximate decision rule for driving effort that underlies my empirical specification for the probability of having an accident. ^ My strategy for disentangling moral hazard from adverse selection makes use of the fact that policy holders in the same experience rating class face the same pricing schedule for future accidents, whereas policy holders belonging to different experience rating classes face different marginal price increases upon having an accident. Under the model, in the presence of moral hazard drivers would take into account marginal price increases when choosing their driving effort. ^ The estimating equation is a dynamic discrete choice panel data model with unobserved heterogeneity, state dependence and predetermined variables. My unusually rich data allow me to incorporate in a flexible way all these factors into the model. I estimate the model using the semi parametric estimator proposed by Arellano and Carrasco (2003). I find much stronger evidence of moral hazard than in the previous literature. In particular there is negative dependence between <b>accident</b> <b>probabilities</b> and the experience rating class. Thus monetary costs are important determinants of <b>accident</b> <b>probabilities.</b> ...|$|R
