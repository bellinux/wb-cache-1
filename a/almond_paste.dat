5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, <b>almond</b> <b>paste,</b> roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E
25|$|In Iceland, the day {{is known}} as Sprengidagur (Bursting Day) and is marked by eating salted meat and peas. In Lithuania, {{the day is}} called Užgavėnės. People eat pancakes (blynai) and Lithuanian-style doughnuts. In Sweden, the day is called Fettisdagen (Fat Tuesday), and is {{generally}} celebrated by eating a type of pastry called fastlagsbulle or semla. In Finland, the day is called laskiainen and is generally celebrated by eating green pea soup and a pastry called laskiaispulla (sweet bread filled with whipped cream and jam or <b>almond</b> <b>paste,</b> same as the Swedish semla). The celebration often includes downhill sledging. In Estonia, the day is called Vastlapäev and is generally celebrated by eating pea soup and whipped-cream or whipped-cream and jam filled sweet-buns called vastlakukkel, similar to the Swedish fastlagsbulle or semla. Children also typically go sledding on this day.|$|E

2500|$|Poles though take small boxes {{containing}} chalk, a gold ring, incense and a {{piece of}} amber, in memory of the gifts of the Magi, to church to be blessed. Once at home, they inscribe [...] "K+M+B+" [...] and the year with the blessed chalk above every door in the house, according to tradition, to provide protection against illness and misfortune for those within. The letters, with a cross after each one, [...] are said to stand either for the traditionally applied names of the Three Kings in Polish – Kacper, Melchior and Baltazar – [...] or for a Latin inscription meaning [...] "Christ bless this house." [...] They remain above the doors all year until they are inadvertently dusted off or replaced by new markings the next year. On January 6, as in much of Europe, a Polish style Three Kings cake is served with a coin or almond baked inside. The one who gets it is king or queen for the day, signified by wearing the paper crown that decorates the cake. According to Polish tradition this person will be lucky in the coming year. Recipes vary by region. Some serve a French-type puff pastry cake with <b>almond</b> <b>paste</b> filling, others favor a sponge cake with almond cream filling, and yet others enjoy a light fruitcake.|$|E
60|$|The little cards, however, {{with names}} {{engraved}} on them, are {{a more serious}} problem than the flowers. More horses' legs have been worn out, more coachmen's lives consumed, more hours of sound afternoon time vainly lavished than served to win us the battle of Waterloo, and pay for it into the bargain. The little demons {{are the source of}} as many reprieves, calamities, and anxieties as the battle itself. Sometimes Mrs. Bonham has just gone out; at others she is at home. But, even if the cards should be superseded, which seems unlikely, there are unruly powers blowing life into storms, disordering sedulous mornings, and uprooting the stability of the afternoon--dressmakers, that is to say, and confectioners' shops. Six yards of silk will cover one body; but if you have to devise six hundred shapes for it, and twice as many colours?--in the middle of which there is the urgent question of the pudding with tufts of green cream and battlements of <b>almond</b> <b>paste.</b> It has not arrived.|$|E

40|$|Four {{kinds of}} nut <b>paste</b> (<b>almond,</b> hazelnut, peanut, walnut) in three {{different}} percentages (5, 10, and 15 %) were added to bread formula to study the morphogeometric and textural characteristics, and the consumer acceptability of enriched breads. The change of texture along time was also studied. Control bread presented the lowest volume, water loss and height, and the highest firmness and chewiness. The enrichment with 15 % of nut paste caused a decrease in loaf volume, weight loss, cohesiveness, and resilience but an increase in height, firmness, and chewiness. Almond and walnut breads presented the lowest values in firmness and chewiness. The lowest cohesiveness and resilience corresponded to hazelnut bread. The increased firmness during storage was slower in enriched than in nonenriched breads. The adhesiveness, cohesiveness, and resilience decreases were {{more important in the}} first 2 days of storage. Breads added with 10 and 15 % nut paste showed the highest intent for consumption, persistence, and texture values. Peanut-enriched bread was the least accepted bread.

5000|$|Under EU law, {{marzipan}} {{must have}} [...] a minimum almond oil content of 14% {{and a maximum}} moisture content of 8.5%. Optional additional ingredients are rosewater, honey, pistachios, preservatives, and sometimes hazelnut.
