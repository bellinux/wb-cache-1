5|$|Each {{county of}} Lithuania {{has adopted a}} flag, each of them {{conforming}} to a pattern: a blue rectangle, with ten instances of the Cross of Vytis (double cross or) appearing in gold, acts as <b>a</b> <b>fringe</b> to the central feature of the flag, which is chosen by the county itself. Most of the central designs were adapted from the counties' coat of arms.|$|E

5|$|The sunset moth {{is black}} with {{iridescent}} red, {{blue and green}} markings. There is <b>a</b> <b>fringe</b> of white scales on the wing edges, wider on the hindwings. The moth has six tails, very often lost or damaged during its life. Pattern variations are common, and the moth is often partly asymmetrical; {{one of the factors}} causing this is temperature shock during the pupal stage.|$|E

King Faisal bought the necklace, made by the American jeweller Harry Winston, and presented it to her while on a state visit to the United Kingdom in 1967.

5|$|Schumacher {{is often}} {{credited}} with popularising Formula One in Germany, {{where it was}} formerly considered <b>a</b> <b>fringe</b> sport. When Schumacher retired in 2006, three of the top ten drivers were German, {{more than any other}} nationality and more than have ever been present in Formula One history. Younger German drivers, such as Sebastian Vettel, felt Schumacher was key in their becoming Formula One drivers. In the latter part of his Formula One career, and as one of the senior drivers, Schumacher was the president of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association. In a 2006 FIA survey, Michael Schumacher was voted the most popular driver of the season among Formula One fans.|$|E

Carl Kennedy portrayed Jason, Evelyn Chew portrayed Number 18, Alysa van Haastert portrayed Ali, and Warkentin and Howell-Holden returned as Marta and Mama.

Canterbury also hosts the annual Lounge On The Farm festival in July, which mainly sees performances from rock, indie and dance artists.|$|E
5|$|The Shakespeare authorship {{question}} is the argument that someone other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield {{the identity of the}} real author or authors, who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit. Although the idea has attracted much public interest, all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it <b>a</b> <b>fringe</b> belief and, for the most part, acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>fringing</b> reef {{is one of}} {{the three}} main types of coral reefs {{recognized}} by most coral reef scientists. It is distinguished from the other two main types (barrier reefs and atolls) in that it has either an entirely shallow backreef zone (lagoon) or none at all. If <b>a</b> <b>fringing</b> reef grows directly from the shoreline (see photo, right) the reef flat extends right to the beach and there is no backreef. In other cases (e.g., most of the Bahamas), fringing reefs may grow hundreds of yards from shore and contain extensive backreef areas with numerous seagrass meadows and patch reefs.|$|R

5|$|The episode {{marked the}} first time {{composer}} Michael Giacchino worked with assistant Chad Seiter on <b>a</b> <b>Fringe</b> episode. Seiter would continue to score the rest of the season's first half. Joshua Jackson's character briefly plays the piano in a scene {{near the end of the}} episode, and it is really Jackson playing. The writers noted in the audio commentary that Jackson can actually play the piano, and that when he receives musical scenes, he learns the piece(s) beforehand to be able to play it for the scene.|$|E
5|$|The episode's teleplay was co-written by J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, while Wyman and Pinkner co-wrote {{the story}} with Akiva Goldsman. Joe Chappelle served as director. It marked the return of {{previous}} guest actor Leonard Nimoy, who had announced his retirement the previous year. Production of the animated portions was completed by Zoic Studios in an eight-week effort, the longest amount of man hours placed into <b>a</b> <b>Fringe</b> episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} flies with long glides on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and {{typically}} at a greater height. The {{flight of the}} tawny owl is rather heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff. As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and <b>a</b> <b>fringe</b> {{on the leading edge}} of the outer primaries. Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; great grey, eagle and Ural owls are similar in shape, but much larger.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine cavalry {{was armed}} with a long sword, known as the spathion. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a kontarion and a bow (toxarion) with forty arrows in a quiver, hung from a saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as skoutatoi, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the {{shoulder}} across the back and a quiver of arrows. Cavalry armor consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant, i.e. a throat-guard lined with fabric and having <b>a</b> <b>fringe</b> and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a helmet and leg armor. Light lamellar and scale armor was also used.|$|E
5|$|The Prieuré de Sion (French: IPA/API:), {{translated}} as Priory of Sion, is <b>a</b> <b>fringe</b> fraternal organisation, founded and dissolved in France in 1956 by Pierre Plantard {{as part of}} a hoax. In the 1960s, Plantard created a fictitious history for that organization, describing it as a secret society founded by Godfrey of Bouillon on Mount Zion in the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1099, conflating it with a genuine historical monastic order, the Abbey of Our Lady of Mount Zion. In Plantard's version, the Priory was devoted to installing a secret bloodline of the Merovingian dynasty on the thrones of France and the rest of Europe. This myth was expanded upon and popularised by the 1982 pseudohistorical book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail and later claimed as factual in the preface of the 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code.|$|E
5|$|The {{posterior}} thoracic {{group is}} made up of six somites, each possessing a pair of long multi-jointed appendages. The segments of these appendages are longer near the body and taper towards the flexible distal segments, extending past the carapace. They bear <b>a</b> <b>fringe</b> of long, slender filaments, all of which are directed towards the middle of the body, a characteristic shared by extant crustaceans. Though usually squashed into blade-like shapes from the fossilisation process, the filaments were slender cylindrical tubes when the animal was alive. The filaments at the tipmost segment are often bunched together. These appendages are believed to be the exopodites and may have functioned as gills and as swimming limbs. They are possibly biramous, with some specimens showing traces of what may be small endopodites at their bases.|$|E
