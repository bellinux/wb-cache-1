40|$|The South American {{sea lion}} Otaria flavescens is {{abundant}} off southern Chile. Because Chilean salmon farming has experienced an explosive {{growth in the}} past two decades, interactions between O. flavescens and this industry have increased. Fieldwork, including in situ behavioural observations, was carried out at three salmon farms off southern Chile from May to July 2008. The aim was to analyse possible patterns in the interactions and to evaluate whether they were influenced by the endogenous circa-rhythms of the species, prey size, tidal flux, and the use of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>device</b> (AHD). The results showed that the attacks by O. fla-vescens followed seasonal patterns, with salmon predated more in autumn and winter, and daily patterns, with more interactions at night. In addition, attacks were more frequent on larger salmon, suggesting the existence of a prey-size preference. More sea lions were sighted at the ebb and flow tide peaks, when currents are stronger, suggesting that currents linked to tidal flux might facilitate the access of the sea lions to the farmed salmon. Although the use of AHDs appeared positive at one site, there is a strong suspicion that their efficacy may be site-specific...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{problematic}} interaction {{going on between}} grey seals and the small scale coastal fisheries in the Baltic. A large number of seals are by-caught and drowned each year, and {{the viability of the}} fishery is threatened by catch losses caused by the seals. Traditional mitigation methods are not sufficient, or have in some cases not been properly evaluated. Available methods of quantifying and analysing the catch losses are also insufficient. This thesis consists of three parts, each studying a different angle of this conflict. In the first part, new models for estimating catch losses are presented. In addition to the commonly used method of counting the number of damaged fish in the nets, the new models also allow for an estimation of the hidden losses. Hidden losses may be fish that are completely removed from nets without leaving any traces, fish that escape through holes in the net torn by the seals, or even fish that are scared away from the fishing gear. Such losses were found to be significant, and hence {{it is now clear that}} the traditional models seriously underestimate the total losses. The new models also allow for a deeper analysis of the interaction process. The first presented model compares catches between adjacent days (day-pairs), the second uses nets that are pre-baited before deployment, and the third relies on a detailed inspection and repair of all seal-induced damage to the net meshes. In the second part, some traditional methods of mitigating the conflict are evaluated. A commercially available <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Harassment</b> <b>Device</b> was tested in a field trial. AHDs were deployed at several set-traps for salmonids for three consecutive years. The damage reducing effect was persistent throughout a season, as well as over the full three-year test period, and no “dinner bell” effect was observed. When seal attacks became frequent in the 1980 ´s, several of the traditional salmon traps were reinforced with newly developed extra strong net materials. These materials dramatically reduced the damage to the nets, and to some degree also the catch losses. However, the losses were still substantial, and the traditional gear was gradually phased out when better solutions emerged. In the third part, new methods of mitigating the conflict are evaluated. A salmon trap was built, using net meshes which were large enough to allow seal-chased fish to escape through, but which would still guide and confine non-stressed fish. The trap was fitted with a fish chamber with a double wall of very taut netting, separating the catch from the surroundings by a fixed distance. Interference by seals was significantly reduced with this construction. Field experiments revealed that seals used their above-water vision to locate and search out buoys of the type that are used in the fisheries. Larger buoys were more readily found than smaller. A set of trials was initiated where certain geographical areas were made unattractive for seals prior to their seasonal arrival to the region, by deploying stationary AHDs. Finally, aquarium experiments demonstrated that underwater vision and hearing were equally important in seals’ detection of fish in a test box. It was also found that there was a “near zone”, within which seals stayed focused on a fish and attempted to catch it by a quick thrust of the head. These studies strongly suggest that new seal-safe fishing gear and mitigation methods should be based on, and would benefit from, an in-depth understanding and analysis of natural seal behaviour...|$|E
5000|$|While {{they have}} proven {{effective}} over the short-term, animals {{tend to become}} conditioned over time and can even be drawn to the sounds once they habituate {{to the lack of}} real danger and the presence of sustenance. [...] Only <b>acoustic</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>devices</b> that cause actual pain {{have been found to be}} effective over the longer term. The devices can cause hearing damage in non-targeted species and design changes in the fishing gear, fishing methods, and fish farm design to provide a permanent solution are preferable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>harassment</b> and <b>acoustic</b> deterrents are {{technologies}} {{used to keep}} {{animals and}} in some cases humans away from an area. Applications of the technology are used to keep marine mammals away from aquaculture facilities and to keep birds away from certain areas (for instance in the vicinity of airports and blueberry fields). The devices have also been employed to keep marine mammals away from fishing nets. The devices are known as <b>acoustic</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>devices</b> (AHDs) and <b>acoustic</b> deterrent devices, which are smaller AHDs or intended as an awareness tool to warn away species to the presence of danger rather than as a tool of harassment at a much louder level.|$|R
5000|$|Primitive {{harassment}} methods included firecrackers, rubber bullets, chasing animals by boat, banging {{pipes and}} seal bombs (incendiary devices). Devices emitting loud noises {{have also been}} used, including broadcasts of killer whale sounds, pingers, and acoustic buzzers. These often employ shrill sounding screams broadcast between 12 and 17 kHz. Acoustic deterrent devices normally broadcast near 10 kHz and use high volume. [...] The intensity level of <b>acoustic</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>devices</b> has been measured up to 194 dB re 1uPa @ 1 m and the noise can be audible up to 50 kilometers away.|$|R
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic <b>acoustic</b> experimentation. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>devices</b> and <b>acoustic</b> deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|R
40|$|The marine {{aquaculture}} industry suffers losses due to pinniped attacks which damage net enclosures and fish stocks. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>devices</b> (AHDs) emit loud sounds which {{are intended to}} deter pinnipeds from approaching aquaculture enclosures. At present, many AHDs emit sounds in the 8 - 20 kHz frequency range. It is not known whether sounds of higher frequencies have a deterrent effect on seals. Therefore five captive harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) were subjected to four series of tone pulses together spanning a broad frequency range (8, 16, 32 and 45 kHz). Pulse duration was 250 ms and pulse interval was 5 s. Each of the four sounds was made deterrent by increasing the amplitude. The seals reacted by swimming away from the sounds. The displacement effect of each sound was judged by comparing the animals' surface positions, and number of surfacings, during ten 45 min baseline periods with ten 45 min test periods per frequency (one frequency per day in rotation, 40 sessions in total). The seals were displaced by all four frequencies throughout the 40 trial days. The seals came to the surface more often when the test tones were produced than in the baseline periods. The initial displacement distances did not change over the 40 test days. This suggests that operating AHDs for only short periods will be more effective {{and less likely to}} result in habituation by the seals than operating them continuously. The discomfort threshold sound pressure level (SPL) was established {{for each of the four}} pulse frequencies. The acoustic discomfort threshold SPL is defined as the boundary SPL between the area that the animals generally occupied during the transmission of the sounds and the area that they generally did not enter during sound transmission. The discomfort threshold SPL may depend on the context. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In 1994, Congress reauthorized the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). As {{part of the}} reauthorization, a {{coalition}} of environmental organizations, animal welfare groups, commercial fishing industry representatives, and Alaska Natives, assisted by a professional facilitator, developed a negotiated proposal to govern the incidental take of marine mammals during commercial fishing operations. A subgroup of the negotiating parties also met {{to address the issue}} of pinniped predation on declining salmon stocks. This subgroup proposed to Congress a multiphased process to evaluate whether all feasible methods of nonlethal deterrence had been tried, and whether the target marine mammals were responsible for the fish declines. This proposal also called for a task force to consult with the Secretary of Commerce about seals and sea lions considered 2 ̆ 2 nuisance 2 ̆ 2 animals because of their predation of steelhead and salmon, species prized by commercial and recreational fishermen, at the Ballard Locks in Seattle and in the Columbia River. Proponents of the legislation argued that the predation had contributed to declines in several species of fish. Based on the outcome of the consultation and the evaluation by the task force, the proposal created a process whereby the Secretary of Commerce may authorize a state to lethally remove pinnipeds that prey on endangered salmonid stocks, provided the nuisance pinniped(s) is identified as habitually exhibiting dangerous or damaging behavior that could not be deterred by other means. On November 8, 1993, Senators Kerry, Stevens, and Packwood introduced Senate Bill 1636 to reauthorize the MMPA. On November 9, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee amended the bill to include this nuisance pinniped proposal. Ultimately this proposal, which provides a process whereby states and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) can address interactions between pinnipeds and declining salmonid stocks, was codified at section 120 of the IMPA. On June 30, 1994, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) requested authority under section 120 to lethally remove problem California sea lions from the Ballard Locks in Seattle, Washington. Evidence indicated that the nonlethal methods used -underwater firecrackers, chaser boats, <b>acoustic</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>devices,</b> taste aversion conditioning, experimental barrier nets, trapping and relocating sea lions to the outer coast of Washington and to their breeding grounds off southern California, and use of acoustic deterrence devices - were not entirely successful in eliminating sea lion predation. On January 6, 1995 (less than six months later), NMFS provided WDFW with a three-year conditioned authority to lethally remove fifteen California sea lions in order to protect steelhead salmon from sea lion predation at the Ballard Locks. The hearings to reauthorize the MMPA began in 1999, with a goal to amend the Act by the end of 2000. The 1998 stock assessments indicate that California sea lion populations on the west coast have increased at a rate of more than five percent annually since the mid- 1970 s; the present population is now estimated at 161, 000 to 181, 000. These increases foreshadow the difficult issues for this upcoming reauthorization, including pressure to weaken both the lethal and the nonlethal take provisions of the Act...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{in water}} tends to travel {{much faster than}} in air. Cetaceans started to use the hearing system as a tool for their {{communication}} and so this system must have been adapted during the evolution. Every species form his specific sound repertoire which is used mainly for food finding, detection of predator or other hazards, communication and reproduction. Ocean ambient noise is created by natural sources of sound and man-made sounds (also called as anthropogenic sounds). Natural sounds are produced by marine organisms and processes like earthquakes, rainfall and so on. Anthropogenic sounds are made by man either intentionally or unintentionally and these sounds mostly disrupt the oceanic environment. Sound frequency and intensity level are the main factors when we determine the intensity of distortion in communication of Cetaceans. The most detrimental sounds are those with low frequency (from 10 to 500 Hz) and long-ranged propagation (hundreds of kilometers). Into this category we can include shipping and seismic surveys. In general, the most of anthropogenic sources of noise belong to this category. Other sources of anthropogenic noise are industrial activities, military sonar and <b>acoustic</b> deterrent and <b>harassment</b> <b>devices</b> (ADDs/AHDs). Responses of Cetaceans to anthropogenic noise {{can be divided into}} three categories: physiological, behavioral and acoustic. The physiological reaction can be increasing metabolism, increasing baseline concentration of glucocorticoids in the blood and ultimately reducing immunity. Behavioral responses include changes in heading patterns and swim speed, changes in diving and breathing. Also included are social activities like food finding or nursing. Every change in vocalization represents acoustic responses. With growing number of studies which prove a negative influence of anthropogenic noise on Cetaceans there is an increasing need to introduce effective measures which could reduce or limit this negative influence. For this purpose there are established marine protected areas and safety zones which avoid exposure to loud noise (circa 120 dB and more) thanks to their regulations. As well there was developed a technology to modify the ship equipment and the using of an air bubble curtain in the immediate area of the industrial activity shows efficiency in acoustic attenuation...|$|R
50|$|Shellfish {{aquaculture}} {{takes up}} space so in effect creates competition for space. However, {{there is little}} direct competition for aquaculture shellfish harvest. On the other hand, marine mammals regularly take finfish from farms, which creates significant problems for marine farmers. While there are usually legal mechanisms designed to deter marine mammals, such as anti-predator nets or <b>harassment</b> <b>devices,</b> individuals are often illegally shot.|$|R
50|$|Studies of {{long-term}} {{effects on the}} marine environment have not been carried out, including damage to non-targeted species. Results of the devices are mixed, and they have proved ineffective in some circumstances, especially over the long term, while design improvements such as electric fences to keep seals from climbing into enclosures, gear modification to exclude certain species, and keeping aquaculture plants clean of dead fish have often been effective at solving the problem of keeping predatory species away. Reports indicate that {{in contrast to the}} <b>harassment</b> <b>devices,</b> the deterrent devices have been very effective in dealing with cetacean bycatch.|$|R
5000|$|A heat ray is an RF <b>harassment</b> <b>device</b> {{that makes}} use of {{microwave}} radio frequencies to create an unpleasant heating effect in the upper layer of the skin.

The inventor of the death ray, Harry Grindell Matthews, claims to have lost sight in his left eye while developing his death ray weapon based on a primitive microwave magnetron from the 1920s (note that a typical microwave oven induces a tissue damaging cooking effect inside the oven at about 2 kV/m.) ...|$|R
40|$|The double-crested {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax auritus) {{is the primary}} avian predator on the southern catfish industry, estimated to cause $ 5 million in damage per year. To date, the most effective strategy for alleviating cormorant depredations in areas of intensive catfish production is coordinated dispersal of cormorant night roosts with pyrotechnics. Many of these night roosts are located in waterfowl refuges or wetland habitat leased for waterfowl hunting. Thus, there is an increasing concern {{about the effects of}} cormorant harassment efforts on waterfowl and other wildlife inhabiting these sites in cypress-swamp habitat. To address the need for a roost <b>harassment</b> <b>device</b> that was more species-specific, we evaluated two commercially available low- to moderate-powered lasers in a series of large-pen and field trials for their effectiveness in moving cormorants from test ponds and dispersing cormorants from their night roosts, respectively. In pen trials, laser beams directed at small groups of captive birds produced negligible effects, suggesting that the laser light was not highly aversive. This was consistent with a series of veterinary investigations suggesting no detectable ocular damage to cormorant eyes directly exposed to a selected laser at varying distances down to 1 m. During field trials both lasers, directed at roost trees after sunset, were consistently effective in dispersing cormorants in 1 to 3 evenings of harassment and is comparable to the harassment effort needed with pyrotechnics. Because laser treatment is completely silent and can be directed selectively at cormorants, these devices may be extremely useful for dispersing cormorants in sites where disturbance of other wildlife is a concern. Advantages and disadvantages of lasers relative to pyrotechnics are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAcoustic <b>harassment</b> <b>devices</b> (AHDs) {{have been}} {{increasingly}} implemented in various fisheries that suffer significant losses caused by odontocetedepredation. However, {{the efficacy of}} AHDs to deter odontocetes from fishing gear remains poorly investigated. To determine the effectiveness ofAHDsin deterring depredation,weexperimentally tested a high amplitude device (195 dB re 1 mPa 6. 5 kHz 1 mfrom the source) froma Patagoniantoothfish Dissostichus elegenoides longliner operating off the Crozet Islands, while it was subjected to heavy depredation by killer whales Orcinusorca. This species usually depredates longlines within a 10 - to 300 -m range from the vessel, as they only have access to fishing gear during hauling. Weexpected this distance to increase {{in response to the}} acoustic disturbance created by the AHD. The distances of 29 killer whales from the vessel(n ¼ 1812 records) were collected during phases of AHD activation and phases during which the AHD was turned off. Two multiexposed killerwhale social units fled over 700 m away from the vessel when first exposed to the AHD. However, they remained within a 10 - to 300 -m rangeand depredated longlines again past the third and seventh exposures, respectively, showing an insignificant behavioural response to further activationsof the AHD. When tested through generalized linear mixed models, the effect of AHD activation was only significant when killer whales werefirst exposed to the device. However, the effect disappeared after successive exposures suggesting that killer whales became habituated to the AHDand may sustain potentially harmful hearing disturbance to access the resource made available by longliners. In addition to raising significant conservationconcerns, this rapid return of initial depredation behaviour strongly suggests that AHDs are ineffective at deterring depredating killerwhales, and that fisheries should favour the use of other mitigation techniques when facing repeated depredation by this species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Wyoming Game and Fish Department is {{responsible}} for controlling depredations by big game, trophy game, and game birds. Under certain guidelines landowners can submit a claim to the department for compensation from wildlife depredations. Measures used by department personnel to prevent wildlife damage are the use of scare <b>devices,</b> <b>harassment</b> techniques, repellents, fencing, trapping, issuing of kill permits, and modifying hunting seasons. In evaluating the damage to estimate monetary losses, sources of information used include AUM's, consumptive rates, fecal analysis, enclosures, production records, and necropsies. In terms of depredation compensation, the most costly species to the department over the last 5 years has been deer, both mule deer and white-tailed deer. Depredation costs to the department for all species is approximately 2 million dollars each year...|$|R
