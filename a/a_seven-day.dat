5|$|Major {{entry points}} to Skyline Drive located in Front Royal, Thornton Gap, Swift Run Gap, and Rockfish Gap. Fees are {{collected}} at the Skyline Drive's four access points. The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $25.00 pass is valid for unlimited entrances within <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> period for a private non-commercial vehicle. <b>A</b> <b>seven-day</b> pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the America the Beautiful: National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for persons with disabilities, and the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year. A free Annual Pass is also available for members of the United States Armed Forces and fourth graders can get free admission for their whole family through the Every Kid in a Park Pass.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of The Land of Gorch, Henson and his team had {{learned a great deal}} from being involved with the production. They gained institutional knowledge about adapting and quickly creating a television program within <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> period. He also gained valuable friendships with multiple celebrities through his work on Saturday Night Live. They were later able to use these skills and relationships on Henson's next television venture, The Muppet Show.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{mission at}} Wonsan, the next day, was her last. Here she {{destroyed}} large-caliber guns, bunkers, caves and trenches. Two days later, she {{learned of the}} truce. Her crew celebrated during <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> visit at Hong Kong, where she anchored 20 August. Operations around Japan and off Formosa were carried out {{for the remainder of}} her tour, which was highlighted by a visit to Pusan.

5|$|A {{number of}} SmarTrip {{features}} {{that were supposed}} to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that customers would have the ability to add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online reload feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers to load <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|All trips {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E

5000|$|Around {{the year}} 890, Wulfstan of Hedeby (by his own account) {{undertook}} <b>a</b> <b>seven-days</b> boat journey from Hedeby to Truso {{at the behest}} of king Alfred the Great. One possible reason for this expedition was because Alfred needed aid in his defense against the Danes or Vikings, who had taken over most of England. The reasons for this journey are fundamentally unclear, since Truso was at the time little more than a trading center, and Alfred the Great, the West Saxon ruler, already kept in close contact with the continental Saxons and the Franks.|$|R

5|$|ArtRave: The Artpop Ball (stylized as artRAVE: the ARTPOP ball) was {{the fourth}} {{headlining}} concert tour by American singer Lady Gaga. Supporting her third studio album Artpop (2013), the tour ran from May 4, 2014 to November 24, 2014. The tour dates included cities where Gaga had canceled shows of her previous Born This Way Ball tour after suffering a hip injury. The ArtRave tour was preceded by a performance at the South by Southwest music festival, which drew controversy due to a segment where an artist vomited on Gaga, and <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> residency at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 on 29 January 1968, South Vietnamese forces began a 36-hour ceasefire {{in celebration}} of {{the arrival of the}} Year of the Monkey. Earlier, the communists had {{declared}} <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> ceasefire as part of the Tet festival, that was normally a period of truce and for community gatherings and family reunions in Vietnamese society. However, unbeknown to the South Vietnamese and their allies, the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to use the cease-fire to launch a large offensive in the south in order to break the deadlock that had developed in the conflict—despite the reluctance of Democratic Republic of Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh and Defence Minister General Vo Nguyen Giap.|$|E

An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} two further matches before their {{international}} against England. The first was {{against one of}} the strongest clubs in England, Blackheath. Andrew Stoddart, who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the 1888 British Isles side, played for the club in their 9–3 defeat to the Natives. The New Zealanders won having scored four tries, including two by Keogh. Their next opposition was a United Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players. The Natives were again victorious, this time 10–0. The match against Oxford University was postponed due to heavy frost, and so the team had <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> break from playing– their longest of the tour.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being an}} internationally {{successful}} film, Let the Right One In was not submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The details surrounding the film's eligibility for the award resulted in some confusion. Being released on 24 October 2008, the film {{would normally be}} eligible for submission for the 82nd Academy Awards. However, the producers decided to release it on 24 September as <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> limited run only in Luleå. This would be exactly enough to meet the criteria for the 81st Academy Awards instead. When the Swedish Film Institute on 16 September announced that Jan Troell's Everlasting Moments had been selected instead of Let the Right One In, the Luleå screenings were cancelled. Despite {{the fact that the}} film was released within the eligibility period for the 82nd Academy Awards, it wasn't among the films considered because the Swedish Film Institute doesn't allow a film to be considered twice.|$|E

5|$|The FNLC invaded Shaba {{again on}} 11 May 1978, {{capturing}} Kolwezi in two days. While the Carter Administration had accepted Cuba's insistence on its non-involvement in Shaba I, and therefore did not stand with Mobutu, the U.S. government now accused Castro of complicity. This time, when Mobutu appealed for foreign assistance, the U.S. government {{worked with the}} French and Belgian militaries to beat back the invasion, the first military cooperation between France and the United States since the Vietnam War. The French Foreign Legion took back Kolwezi after <b>a</b> <b>seven-day</b> battle and airlifted 2,250 European citizens to Belgium, but not before the FNLC massacred 80 Europeans and 200 Africans. In one instance, the FNLC killed 34 European civilians who had hidden in a room. The FNLC retreated to Zambia, vowing to return to Angola. The Zairean army then forcibly evicted civilians along Shaba's border with Angola. Mobutu, wanting to prevent any chance of another invasion, ordered his troops to shoot on sight.|$|E
