The conceptual discussion in the first chapter identifies three underresearched factors (reaction of the Protectorate elites to the Nazi occupation policy; variety-based approach to the "language" and physicalism) that had negative effect to the debate on these questions and therefore they should not be taken into consideration; the terminological discussion in the second chapter supports the claim that it is not suitable to associate the traditional term (theory <b>of)</b> <b>language</b> cultivation with this novel conceptualization. The third chapter introduces in detail the so-called ontological "socialism" according to which there are not only spatiotemporal entities, i. e. language means, but also non-spatiotemporal entities, i. e. language rules qua actually existing social facts, in the subject field of linguistics.

40|$|This is a sociolinguistic {{investigation}} of regional dialect levelling {{and the role}} that standardised language plays for this particular type of dialect change. This study combines a quantitative variationist {{investigation of}} linguistic variation and change in East Norwegian cities Hønefoss and Oslo with experimental and qualitative studies of attitudinal data in Hønefoss. The aim {{of the study is}} to shed light on the role that standard language ideologies play for loss of localised dialects. Varieties of East Norwegian spoken in the small city Hønefoss and the capital city Oslo are becoming increasingly alike. Oslo speech is an influential factor in the loss in Hønefoss of local linguistic variants in variables 3 pl personal pronouns and. The force behind the regional dialect levelling is not the Oslo dialect only, however. Overt and covert attitudinal data show that the influence is twofold and that the codified written variety of Norwegian, Bokmål, largely influences speakers’ usage of local variants for linguistic variables stress in loanwords and plural definite article suffixes. The investigation considers linguistic ideals that speakers link to codification <b>of</b> <b>language</b> (<b>correctness),</b> education or the capital city and attest that language that can be linked to all these ideals is becoming more widely used in the East Norway region. Speech that can be linked to the codified variety Bokmål is an overt as well as a covert ideal to speakers in Hønefoss. Covert positive attitudes towards speech from Oslo are also found.

We design and implement heuristics to address these problems and show their effectiveness on a set of well-known malware morphing engines and a realworld malware collection reaching detection accuracies of 96 % and higher. Our experiments confirm the applicability of the proposed approach in practice and indicate that engine attribution may offer a viable enhancement of current defenses against malware...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} nature and the {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>language</b> prestige and language attitudes in two neighbouring languages: Occitan and Catalan. These two Romance minority languages show great similarities in their early external history and striking differences in their more recent past. The concepts <b>of</b> <b>language</b> attitudes and prestige call for a multidisciplinary approach which incorporates aspects from social psychology, ethnography, historical sociolinguistics and sociology to enable the author to depict in a comprehensive manner {{the interaction between the}} formation of the perception <b>of</b> <b>language</b> prestige and the declaration <b>of</b> <b>language</b> attitudes. An important rationale in this thesis is the search for an understanding of the patterns of change in prestige descriptions. Prestige and attitudes are generally interpreted as static entities but a diachronic overview of the values attached to Catalan and Occitan displays signs of disparity and evolution which are scrutinised through the analysis of selected Occitan and Catalan grammars from different periods. The data collected through semi-structured interviews with Occitan and Catalan speakers and processed with the method of Critical Discourse Analysis provides an enlightening synchronic perspective on the language situations. The combination of diachronic and present-day approaches to language representations fosters an original apparatus to investigate the gradually developing contrasts between the symbolisation <b>of</b> the two <b>languages.</b> A second point of focus for the comparison of the Occitan and Catalan linguistic situations resides in the transnational position of their linguistic communities. Since Occitan and Catalan are both spoken in France and Spain, the fascinating mismatch between the linguistic borders and the political territories provide an original and supplementary instrument of analysis of the influences of the national policies on individual attitudes. The bi-national division of Catalan and Occitan offers an examination of the inter-relation between macro-level representations and micro-level perceptions and a clarification of the dynamicity of the power relations between minority and majority groups. The objective of the study is primarily to contribute to a theorisation <b>of</b> <b>language</b> prestige through its conceptualisation as a process, and not an inherent quality, influencing, renewing or destroying, positive language attitudes which, in turn, can reinforce or challenge the preconceived and established form of prestige. The dynamic and malleable forms of prestige and attitudes need the explanatory help of the concept <b>of</b> <b>language</b> ideologies which, taken as beliefs about a language, embodies the modern and growing differentiation in the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> values to Catalan and Occitan. Language ideologies as well as constituting a link between the macro and micro-domains reflect the emblematic discrepancies between a growingly powerful and confrontational Catalan prestige and a compartmentalised and disunited Occitan prestige.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{students}} 2 ̆ 7 {{acquisition of a}} metalanguage for writing through the constant interplay of conversational processes, thus achieving {{a starting point for}} evaluative authority over their own written communication. Forty-seven representative eleventh and twelfth grade students, ranging from honors to remedial levels, participated in a writing center elective designed to engage students in metalinguistic activities in spoken and written communicative events. Students 2 ̆ 7 written dialogue with the teacher about strategies used to compose and revise their written texts provides the principal data for the study. ^ The analysis of dialogic communication reveals students 2 ̆ 7 potential for monitoring language processes that are at work in their writing and provides insight about how students acquire metalinguistic awareness. The term metallinguistic borrows from the wider linguistic field and has generally been used to mean language about language. Messages acquire metalinguistic character when some aspect <b>of</b> the <b>language</b> itself becomes the object or focus of thought. This process begins with, and stems from, interspeaker processes on the social dimension before they become realized as intraspeaker variations by the individual speaker/writer. ^ This study focuses on emergent, dynamic aspects of metalinguistic awareness. From linguistic theory (Jakobson, 1960) and sociolinguistic theory (Hymes, 1972), a provisional scheme of linguistic variables was complied and applied to seven case studies. Five metalinguistic activities forming a descriptive typology suggest how students may begin to attend to their writing through a shared metalanguage. The activities include (1) poetic [...] monitoring the creative play <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> (2) key [...] monitoring voice, the spirit of self as writer, (3) audience [...] monitoring the initiative or responsive attention to the perceptions of an interlocutor, (4) evaluation [...] monitoring the specific <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> focusing on the properties of the text, and (5) setting [...] monitoring the social and situational aspects of the speaking/writing event. ^ The study indicates that teachers can provide a context for metalinguistic awareness to enhance each stage of the writing process by using a social model for writing. This study suggests that a writer 2 ̆ 7 s evaluative autonomy first proceeds through interactive modes of communication before it can be realized intra-actively by the writer as an individual communicator. ...|$|R

30|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{mobility}} {{is closely related}} to the notion of space and time, which is subsequently related to issues of cultural ‘dis-embedding’ and ‘re-embedding’ (Eriksen 2007, pp. 8 - 9), ‘deterritorialisation’ and ‘territorialisation’ (Blommaert 2010; Scholte pp. 45 - 46; Scholte 2000, pp. 15 - 17), and ‘supraterritoriality’ and ‘transnationalism’ (Garrett 2010, p. 449). Cultural ‘dis-embedding’ and ‘re-embedding’ are two of the key features of globalization identified by Eriksen (2007, pp. 8 - 9). Dis-embedding ‘includes all manners through which social life becomes abstracted from its local, spatially fixed context’, while re-embedding is a countervailing process to territorialize a mix of local and global cultures through ‘strong networks of moral commitment, concerns with local power and community integration, national and sub-national identity politics’ (Eriksen 2007, pp. 8 - 9). Cultural dis-embedding and re-embedding processes are also closely related to deterritorialization and territorialization. The former stands for ‘the perception and <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> values to <b>language</b> as something which does not belong to one locality but which organizes translocal trajectories and wider spaces’, while the latter refers to ‘the perception and <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> values to <b>language</b> as a local phenomenon, something which ties people to local communities and spaces’ (Blommaert 2010, pp. 45 - 46). With globalization, the notion <b>of</b> <b>language</b> (de)territorialisation can become relative and fluid due to the increased velocity of movement of people and the unprecedented engagement of people in the virtual online world. ‘Interaction across large distances enters into a complex relationship with local activity’, therefore, the local has never been more closely connected to the global through the ‘compressed time and space’ in terms of ‘supraterritoriality and translationalism’ (Garrett 2010, p. 449). In the Chinese context, Xu’s research (2009, pp. 123 - 124) shows that it can be hypothesized that there are varying ‘micro-linguistic markets’ co-existing in China, including a ‘global linguistic market’ where English is used for transnational communication; a ‘supra-local market’ where cosmopolitan Mandarin Chinese (often code-mixed with English) is used for trans-regional interaction among Chinese elite groups, and a ‘local linguistic market’ where dialects and vernacular Chinese are used in local communities. It {{should be noted that the}} ‘micro-linguistic market’ is not a geographical concept, but a conceptualization in relation to mobility, and dynamic communities <b>of</b> multiple <b>language</b> users in contemporary China. One implication of globalization as mobility for learning and using English in China is that ELT materials should reflect the dynamic linguistic and cultural complexities of a mobile world both in a global sense and the local reality. In other words, ELT materials should facilitate Chinese learners of English to raise their awareness that English has increasingly been used as an international language, and to cater for their needs of using English both locally and globally for intra- and international communication.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} {{percentage of}} dyslexia together with low cultural levels {{which have been}} noticed in the most industrialized western countries denounce a diffuse and alarming incapacity in cognitive reading of reality interrelated to the own culture. So, where’s the problem? It ‘s in the lack of synchronization between the world’s shape (things around us) and the model {{of access to the}} world as it is practiced and taught. The organ <b>of</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> new generations develops in a context where its contents are given in a sketchy, chaotic way, in constant evolution with demands for competence to handle this new modality. If for thousands of years a specific cultural model that had used the linearity as a representative form of the linguistic meaning (e. g. the alphabets) is prevailing, the learning brains has adapted to that method. On the other hand, when the reticular complexity of representative forms is prevailing like nowadays, it’ll be necessary to use teaching models based on this new competence For some years, we are experimenting competent models for the development <b>of</b> The <b>language</b> organ that show how the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> meaning and <b>language</b> competence (which are basic strategies and cognitive categories already present at the natural language-thought level) become decisive for the development of the scientific and organized thought, because for a child “the voice of reality as for a mathematician is in the symbol’s meaning”.

Unfortunately, the implementation of each such tool requires an early commitment to a particular methodology and <b>language,</b> in terms <b>of</b> both high-level semantic concerns and the lower-level syntactic representations of properties and proofs. In this paper, we present Prufrock, a novel approach to automated reasoning systems, which abstracts semantic concerns over entire classes <b>of</b> potential implementation <b>languages.</b> Prufrock is a modular prover framework written in the Haskell programming <b>language.</b> It consists <b>of</b> a set of largely independent logic modules, which define the semantics required for proof over entire classes of abstract syntaxes, using polytypic programming techniques.

The implementation details of the reasoning system thus remain independent of the structure specification language, facilitating large-scale reuse in the construction of automated reasoning tools. At the same time, Prufrock aids in closing the gap between actual source-level implementation and the formal specification and verification of correctness properties.

I go through the most important examples of the asymmetry in the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> intentionality and point out that the modal account can cover all the problematic cases, whereas the moral account can’t.

Participants were 488 Grade XI students of SMA Negeri ”A” Bantul, SMA Negeri “B” Bantul, SMA Negeri “C” Sanden, and SMA Negeri “D” Bambanglipuro. Data were collected using self regulated learning scale, mastery goal orientation scale, performance goal orientation scale, causal <b>attribution</b> scale <b>of</b> success, and causal <b>attribution</b> scale <b>of</b> failure. The data were analyzed using the technique of analysis of variance. The results suggest that: (1) there is significant difference of self regulated learning based on goal orientation (F= 36. 814 p= 0. 000), (2) there is significant difference of self regulated learning based on causal <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> success (F= 31. 081 p= 0. 000), (3) there is significant difference of self regulated learning based on causal <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> failure (F= 21. 837 p= 0. 000), 4) there is significant difference of self regulated learning based on interaction between goal orientation and causal <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> success (F= 2. 983 p= 0. 031), and 5) there is no significant difference of self regulated learning based on interaction between goal orientation and causal <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> failure (F= 2. 444 p= 0. 063) Keywords: self regulated learning, mastery goal orientation, performance goal orientation, causal <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> success, causal <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> failur...|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{theories}} on embodied cogni-tion have caused high expectations, ambi-tious promises, and strong controversies. Several criticisms have been explained elsewhere (Mahon and Caramazza, 2008; Cardona et al., 2014) {{and will not}} be discussed further here. In this paper, we will focus on a specific explanatory strat-egy frequently assessed by the radical embodied cognition approaches: the use of homuncular explanations for the explicit (or implicit) <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> causal roles in the comprehension <b>of</b> <b>language</b> under-standing. We first present this criticism regarding a prototypical example: the mir-ror neuron system (MNS) (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004; Iacoboni and Dapretto, 2006) in the field <b>of</b> <b>language</b> understand-ing and then extend our conclusions to other programs of embodied cognition. Here we discuss the radical claims that propose the MNS as the putative mech-anism for multiple cognitive and social psychology constructs (e. g., Gallese, 2008...|$|R
