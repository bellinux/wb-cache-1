5|$|During this time, Overton {{was known}} to sit in his bases' chapel in silence for {{extended}} periods of time, not praying, to calm his nerves.

5|$|Galba {{may have}} chosen to award Halotus the lucrative procuratorship for <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of reasons; during his reign, Galba was known for making often unpopular {{political}} and economical actions, supposedly for what was, at least in Galba's mind, the financial health of the city. Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, {{may have been in}} some way beneficial in Galba's eyes. Less specifically, the move would certainly have had some degree of benefit for Galba in some way, whether indirectly, or directly, economically or financially.|$|E

50|$|Up to 2014, {{players in}} FIBA-organized {{competitions}} for national teams, including the Olympic Games, World Cup and Women's World Championship, {{had to wear}} numbers from 4 to 15. Under FIBA rules, national federations could also allow <b>any</b> <b>numbers</b> with a maximum of 2 digits for their own competitions; this rule also applied in transnational club competitions, most notably the Euroleague. At present, players are allowed <b>any</b> <b>numbers</b> from 1 to 99, additionally 0 and 00.|$|R

By mid-decade, these outlets had vanished and the automobile dealer became the sole source of new automobiles.|$|E
5|$|The cottage {{garden in}} France is a {{development}} of the early 20th century. Monet's garden at Giverny is a prominent example, a sprawling garden full of varied plantings, rich colors, and water gardens. In modern times, the term 'cottage garden' is used to describe <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of informal garden styles, using design and plants very different from their traditional English cottage garden origins. Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California chaparral cottage gardens.|$|E
5|$|The modern form of {{a binary}} logarithm, {{applying}} to <b>any</b> <b>number</b> (not just powers of two) was considered explicitly by Leonhard Euler in 1739. Euler established the application of binary logarithms to music theory, long before their more significant applications in information theory and computer science became known. As part of his work in this area, Euler published a table of binary logarithms of the integers from 1 to 8, to seven decimal digits of accuracy.|$|E

5|$|The {{spectacular}} play {{died out}} with the Restoration period, but spectacle would continue on the English stage as the splendours of Italian grand opera hit London in the early 18th century. The dangerous Restoration economic spiral of the ever-more-expensive machine plays would teach 18th- and 19th-century theatrical entrepreneurs to dispense with playwrighting altogether and minimise the cast, utilising <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of surprising effects and scenes in the dumbshow of pantomime and Harlequin, without attendant costs in music, dramatists, and cast.|$|E
5|$|Unlike C++, C# {{does not}} support {{multiple}} inheritance, although a class can implement <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of interfaces. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, C# allows implementing each method depending on which interface that method is being called through, or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and have that be the one invocation on a call through any of the class's interfaces.|$|E
5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E

5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; {{the water from the}} tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E
5|$|Any true {{physical}} color can {{be represented}} {{by a combination of}} pure spectral colors. As physical colors can be composed of <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors {{can be represented}} by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated {{to a certain extent}} based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E
