50|$|A top-hat shim (US: lash cap) is a small, inverted, hardened-metal cup, placed atop a {{valve stem}} in an {{internal}} combustion engine. Varying thicknesses of top-hat shims {{are used to}} <b>adjust</b> <b>valve</b> clearances {{in much the same}} way as standard flat disc shims (as used in Fiat SOHC/DOHC, Volvo, and early Jaguar engines), where the cam-lobe operates directly on the valve without an intermediate rocker arm. Top-hat shims offer a dramatic weight-reduction over standard disc shims, and are used where valve-train weight reduction is important (i.e. high-performance road- and race-orientated engines).|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} {{power demands}} of the 1800s, especially in manufacturing, innovations were made to existing steam engines {{and a number of}} entirely new steam engines were developed. Of these, few brought the high levels of horsepower and efficiency produced by the Corliss engine. [...] Named after its inventor, George Henry Corliss, this stationary steam engine was introduced to the world in 1849. The engine boasted a number of desired features, including fuel efficiency (lowering cost of fuel by a third or more), low maintenance costs, 30% higher rate of power production, high thermal efficiency, and the ability to operate under light, heavy, or varying loads while maintaining high velocity and constant speed. While the engine was loosely based on existing steam engines keeping the simple piston-flywheel design, the majority of these features were brought about by the engine’s unique valves and valve gears. Unlike most engines employed during the era that were using mainly slide-valve gears, Corliss created his own system that used a wrist plate to control a number of different valves. Each cylinder was equipped with four valves, with exhaust and inlet valves {{at both ends of the}} cylinder. Through a precisely tuned series of events opening and closing these valves, steam is admitted and released at a precise rate allowing for linear piston motion. This provided the engine’s most notable feature, the automatic variable cut-off mechanism. [...] This mechanism is what allowed the engine to function under varying loads without losing efficiency, stalling, or being damaged. Using a series of cam gears, which could <b>adjust</b> <b>valve</b> timing (essentially acting as a throttle), the engine’s speed and horsepower was adjusted. This proved extremely useful for most of the engine’s applications. In the textile industry, it allowed for production at much higher speeds while lowering the likelihood that threads would break. [...] In metallurgy, the extreme and abrupt variations of load experienced in rolling mills were also countered by the technology. These examples demonstrate that the Corliss engine was able to lead to much higher rates of production, while preventing costly damages to machinery and materials. It was referred to as “the most perfect regulation of speed.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in the 1997 model year, the 2.2-litre {{engine for}} 1997 Legacy and Impreza models had {{internal}} and external changes that yield an approximately 10% increase in power and 3% increase in fuel economy.Accomplishing this involves many factors, {{one of which is}} engine friction reduction. The pistons were coated with molybdenum to reduce friction. The thin coating reduces moving friction and reduces cylinder wall scuffing.The piston skirt was reshaped and the piston weight was reduced by approximately 100 grams. Compression ratio was increased to 9.7:1 by reshaping the piston crown. This eliminates the clearance that was available between the piston at TDC and the fully opened valve.Piston pin offset has been changed to 0.5mm (0.020 in). Piston to cylinder wall clearance has been reduced by increasing the piston diameter.Another source of high engine friction is the valve train. Hydraulic lash adjusters (HLAs) are always in contact with the valves. The hydraulic pressure of the lash adjuster must be overcome during operation and during the most critical time of engine start.To overcome this situation and to contribute to the total reduction of friction loss, 1997 and later SOHC engines have solid valve adjusters. The scheduled service of this valve train is set at 100000 mi. SOHC engines now use an adjustment screw to <b>adjust</b> <b>valve</b> clearance. Engines with the earlier HLA are recommended to use 10W30 or 10W40 oil year-round; 5W30 can be used at very low winter temperatures.The roller rocker cam follower system that was introduced on the 1.8L Impreza engines, is installed on all 1996 model year and later 2.2-litre engines. The roller assemblies are not serviceable separately, but the rocker arms may be serviced as individual units.The carbon composition head gaskets with integrated o-rings are interchangeable from left to right on 1990 to 1994 NA engines only.Other Engine Modifications (2.2L 1997): The intake manifold has been reshaped to increase the airflow mass and speed, contributing to improved low and mid engine speed operation. Components located on the intake manifold have been relocated as compared to the 1996 models.

50|$|Camless engines {{can produce}} less {{emissions}} because they allow for more precise {{control of the}} combustion procedure, allowing for more complete combustion of all hydrocarbons. The computer will sense when not all fuel is being consumed and immediately relax valve timings to supply less fuel to the cylinder. Also, the ECU constantly <b>adjusts</b> <b>valve</b> timings, height and fuel/air mixtures to optimize efficiency for a given RPM/torque load. The ECU can also sense {{when there is a}} high amount of NOx and SOx (Sulfur oxide) emission and change the timing to make the Exhaust gas hotter or cooler. Since the engine is run electronically and not mechanically, camless engines can be updated to meet new emission regulations without mechanical modifications.|$|R

The mixing ratio of the composite and the degree of magnetization can be utilized to adjust the switching point of each single valve.

Then, one-week operational states were simulated with actual meteorological data exerted and validated. And then, different control strategies were implemented and the one-week operational situations were simulated, respectively. The smallest indoor temperature variations could be achieved if the fuel, the primary piping network and radiator water flow rates were jointly controlled.

40|$|Reciprocating-piston devices {{can be used}} as high-efficiency {{compressors}} and/or expanders. With {{an optimal}} valve design and by carefully <b>adjusting</b> <b>valve</b> timing, pressure losses during intake and exhaust can be largely reduced. The main loss mechanism in reciprocating devices is then the thermal irreversibility due to the unsteady heat transfer between the compressed/expanded gas and the surrounding cylinder walls. In this paper, pressure, volume and temperature measurements in a piston-cylinder crankshaft driven gas spring are compared to numerical results. The experimental apparatus experiences mass leakage while the CFD code predicts heat transfer in an ideal closed gas spring. Comparison of experimental and numerical results allows one to better understand the loss mechanisms in play. Heat and mass losses in the experiment are decoupled and the system losses are calculated over a range of frequencies. As expected, compression and expansion approach adiabatic processes for higher frequencies, resulting in higher efficiency. The objective {{of this study is to}} observe and explain the discrepancies obtained between the computational and experimental results and to propose further steps to improve the analysis of the loss mechanisms...|$|R
