The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Lerkendal {{started as}} a public works during the 1930s, as a measure to create jobs. It opened on 10 August 1947, and {{consisted}} of a main grass field, two gravel fields, two handball courts and two tennis courts. The main field had a spectator capacity for 37,000 on temporary stands, making it the second-largest stadium in the country. The long sides consisted of temporary wooden stands, with seating on the south stand <b>and</b> <b>standing</b> places on terraces on the north stand. The end sides of the stadium consisted of grass embankments at a 30 percent angle, allowing for standing space for spectators without having to build stands. Changing rooms were located in a nearby German-built barracks dating from the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} October 1999, costing NOK140 million. A new south stand was built with a roof, offices and change rooms, while a smaller stand without a roof {{was built to}} the east. The project cost NOK40 million less than the {{original}} plans, in part because no stands were built on the west end. The two new stands had 4,350 seats and the venue was approved for UEFA matches. However, the venue {{was not allowed to}} use the old grandstand seating or the terraces for UEFA matches. The two new stands gave the stadium seating for 6,100 <b>and</b> <b>standing</b> room for 2,000 spectators. The first match at the upgraded venue was played on 22 April 2001.|$|E
