The attractive possibility of minimizing ordering, handling and warehousing problems by employing uniform longitudinal scantlings and constant plating thicknesses throughout the <b>midship</b> <b>section</b> led to the decision to carry out an investigation of such a design methodology. The design technique proved to be feasible, but less economical that conventional techniques of <b>midship</b> <b>section</b> design. A computer tool for the systematic variation of longitudinal intervals has been developed and is now ready to be applied to <b>midship</b> <b>section</b> design with varying structural materials and different plating thicknesses and longitudinal scantlings.
