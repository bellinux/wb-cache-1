5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> for a smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} an {{observational}} study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a cohort study, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> {{for the number of}} cases of lung cancer in each group. A case-control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses are {{typically}} {{inserted into the}} eye by placing them on the pad of the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the lens on the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may {{be placed on the}} sclera (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may close their eyes <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye.|$|E

25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E
500|$|The {{other main}} type {{of science is}} {{experimental}} science, which is often said to work by conducting experiments to disprove hypotheses about the workings and causes of natural phenomena– note that this approach cannot confirm a hypothesis is correct, since some later experiment may disprove it. However, when confronted with totally unexpected phenomena, such as the first evidence for invisible radiation, experimental scientists often use the same approach as historical scientists: construct a set of hypotheses about the causes <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> for a [...] "smoking gun".|$|E
500|$|Peng's {{forces were}} the most poorly armed of the newly reorganized army, but were {{responsible}} for the area around the communist capital, Yan'an. In March 1947, the Kuomintang general, Hu Zongnan, invaded this area with 260,000 soldiers. Hu's forces were among the best-trained and most well-supplied Nationalist units, but one of Zhou Enlai's spies was able to provide Peng with information about Hu's strategic plans, his forces' troop distributions, strength, and positions, and details about the air cover available to Hu. Peng was forced to abandon Yan'an in late March, but resisted Hu's forces long enough for Mao and other senior Party leaders to evacuate safely. Mao wanted Peng to provoke a decisive confrontation with Hu immediately, but Peng dissuaded him, and by April Mao agreed that Peng's objective was to [...] "keep the enemy on the run... tire him out completely, reduce his food supplies, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> for an opportunity to destroy him".|$|E

500|$|While {{investigating}} the VIN from an axle {{of the truck}} used in the explosion and {{the remnants of the}} license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, [...] "People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what [...] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him." ...|$|E
500|$|Skyrim {{is powered}} by Bethesda's Creation Engine, created {{specifically}} for Skyrim. After Fallout 3s release, the team devised numerous design objectives to meet for Skyrim, and according to Howard, the team [...] "got all those done and kept going". Had the team {{not been able to}} meet their design goals with current hardware, they would have waited for the next generation and released Skyrim then, but Howard felt that the technology of the time did not hold the team back at all. The Creation Engine allows for numerous improvements in graphical fidelity over Bethesda's previous efforts. For example, the draw distance renders farther than in previous Elder Scrolls games; Howard provided an example where the player can stare at a small object such as a fork in detail, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> up at a mountain and run to the top of it. Dynamic lighting allows shadows to be created by any structure or item in the game world, and the Creation Engine allowed for greater detail in flora production than SpeedTree had in previous Bethesda games. For example, with Bethesda's own technology, developers were able to give weight to the branches of trees, which affects how trees blow in the wind. In addition, the technology allows wind to affect the flow of water in channels such as rivers and streams. Because of the large presence of snow in Skyrims game world, the technological upgrades were applied to weather effects and allow for dynamic snow fall upon the terrain, instead of snow that was rendered as a textural effect in previous games.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the current}} state of cinema, Korine comments, [...] "When I {{look at the history of}} film – the early {{commercial}} narrative movies directed by D.W. Griffith, say – <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> at where films are now, I see so little progression in the way they are made and presented, and I'm bored with that.

2500|$|It is, of course, {{possible}} to describe ordinals beyond the Feferman-Schütte ordinal. [...] One {{could continue to}} seek fixed points {{in more and more}} complicated manner: enumerate the fixed points of , then enumerate the fixed points of that, and so on, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> for the first ordinal α such that α is obtained in α steps of this process, and continue diagonalizing in this ad hoc manner. [...] This leads to the definition of the “small” and “large” Veblen ordinals.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{entering}} college, Robinson held {{a short-term}} job as shoeshine man before {{getting a job}} as warehouse personnel. [...] After finishing his college degree, Robinson {{was unable to find}} a suitable career in his hometown of Gulfport. Robinson attributed this to racial discrimination as many of the local garages were under white ownership; speaking to his father, he said, [...] " [...] give me a job sweeping, filling gas tanks, changing tires, or washing, but I'm an engine man... When I talk to [...] about automotive science they smile, look at each other, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> at me like I belong behind a mule and a plow." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much like in cluster-scale weak lensing, {{detection}} of a galaxy-galaxy shear signal requires one {{to measure the}} shapes of background source galaxies, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> for statistical shape correlations (specifically, source galaxy shapes should be aligned tangentially, relative to the lens center.) [...] In principle, this signal could be measured around any individual foreground lens. [...] In practice, however, due to the relatively low mass of field lenses and the inherent randomness in intrinsic shape of background sources (the [...] "shape noise"), the signal is impossible to measure on a galaxy by galaxy basis. [...] However, by combining the signals of many individual lens measurements together (a technique known as [...] "stacking"), the signal-to-noise ratio will improve, allowing one to determine a statistically significant signal, averaged over the entire lens set.|$|E
2500|$|MacMillan was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in August 1915. Due to him not being 19, he was posted to the 3rd Battalion, Argylls, a training unit, stationed near Edinburgh. In April 1916 {{he was sent to}} the Western Front where he joined the 2nd Battalion (the 93rd), a Regular Army unit which was then serving as part of the 98th Brigade of the 33rd Division, in Northeast France, and immediately became involved in fierce trench warfare at Brickstacks. This was followed by engagements, as part of the battles of the Somme and Passchendaele, at Cuinchy, Bazentin-le-Petit, High Wood, Mametz Wood, Arras, Le Cateau and the Selle. While still only 19 years old and a second lieutenant, he was appointed acting adjutant of the battalion in November 1916. He was promoted to lieutenant in April 1917, and formally confirmed as Adjutant in June. He remained in this post {{for the rest of the}} war, serving seven different commanding officers (CO). The casualties were immense and, at one time, while a second lieutenant, he found himself by default commanding the battalion. MacMillan wrote [...] "I would say that I was fortunate to belong to the best battalion in the Army, with an unbreakable spirit. You can see this from the record of their operations – <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>look</b> at the casualty list: 63 officers and 1175 men killed, and ready for anything at the end of it all".|$|E
