5|$|Although a {{fair use}} issue, Combs <b>and</b> <b>Bad</b> Boy never raised the legal {{concept of the}} fair use {{doctrine}} in their defense. This decision was questioned by some legal experts: Anthony Falzone of the Fair Use Project at Stanford Law School criticized Combs <b>and</b> <b>Bad</b> Boy for not defending the legality of sampling and suggested {{that they might have}} refused to raise such a defense because they feared it could later imperil their control over their own music.|$|E

5|$|Despite improvements, {{several aspects}} of the {{transport}} sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> decision-making by the central authorities. The demand for transport infrastructure and services was rising, but the Soviet authorities proved to be unable to meet the growing demand of the people.

5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical {{discussion about}} the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles. He argues in favour of reincarnation; a collective consciousness that has intentionality; modal realism (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the law of attraction (that good <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> thoughts can attract experiences).|$|E

5|$|The Normans {{transformed}} Carmarthen into {{an international}} trading port, the only staple port in Wales. Merchants imported food and French wines and exported wool, pelts, leather, lead and tin. In the late medieval period the county's fortunes varied, as good <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> harvests occurred, increased taxes were levied by England, there were episodes of plague, and recruitment for wars removed the young men. Carmarthen was particularly susceptible to plague as it was brought in by flea-infested rats on board ships from southern France.|$|E
5|$|The Shasekishū, {{a book of}} Buddhist parables {{from the}} Kamakura period, {{makes a point of}} {{distinguishing}} between good <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> tengu.

5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals.

It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself with the work and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
