40|$|The {{disintegration}} of drops in strong electric fields {{is believed to}} play an important part in the formation of thunderstorms, at least in those parts of them where no ice crystals are present. Zeleny showed experimentally that disintegration begins as a hydrodynamical instability, but his ideas about the mechanics of the situation rest on the implicit assumption that instability occurs when the internal pressure is the same as that outside the drop. It is shown that this assumption is false and that instability of an elongated drop would not occur unless a pressure difference existed. When this error is corrected it is found that a drop, elongated by an electric field, becomes unstable when its length is 1 - 9 times its equatorial diameter, and the calculated critical electric field agrees with laboratory experiments to within 1 %. When the drop becomes unstable the ends develop obtuse-angled conical points from which <b>axial</b> <b>jets</b> are projected but the stability calculations give no indication of the mechanics of this process. It is shown theoretically that a conical interface between two fluids can exist in equilibrium in an electric field, but only when the cone has a semi-vertical angle 49 - 3 ?. Apparatus was constructed for producing the necessary field, and photographs show that conical oil/water interfaces and soap films can be produced at the calculated voltage and that their semi-vertical angles are very close to 49. 3 ?.

The Avon design team was initially headed by Stanley Hooker assisted by Geoff Wilde until the development of the engine was moved from Barnoldswick to Derby in 1948 and Hooker subsequently left the company, moving to Bristol Engines. Design had started in 1945 and the first engine ran on March 25, 1947, with a 12-stage compressor. The engine was difficult to start, would not accelerate and broke first-stage blades. Two-position inlet guide vanes and compressor bleed were among the design changes which allowed the engine, as the RA.2, to run a 25-hour test and fly in the two outboard positions on the converted Avro Lancastrian military serial VM732, from Hucknall on August 15, 1948.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} seeks {{to examine the}} effects of co-flow, {{confinement}} and a shaping jet on the mixing and combustion characteristics of a precessing jet flow. In particular, scientific analysis is used to investigate the physical mechanisms by which the control and optimisation of heat transfer and pollutant emissions from natural gas burners for rotary kilns can be achieved. To achieve these aims, a range of experimental techniques in reacting, nonreacting, confined and unconfined conditions have been employed. The precessing jet, in conjunction with a shaping jet, is shown to provide continuous control of mixing characteristics and corresponding combustion characteristics. Hence the optimum mixing characteristics for the maximum heat transfer and minimum emissions and the conditions under which the precessing jet nozzle produces such mixing characteristics are determined. A scaling procedure is also proposed for the precessing jet nozzle that, for the first time, provides a method to relate the results of small-scale isothermal mixing experiments to operating rotary kilns. Flow visualisation using a two colour planar laser-induced fluorescence technique in an unconfined, isothermal environment is used to demonstrate that a central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> is the most effective form of shaping jet for controlling the mixing from a precessing jet nozzle. The characteristics of the combined jet flow are shown, by a semi-quantitative image processing technique, to be controlled by the ratio of the central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> momentum to the combined jet momentum, denoted by Γ [subscript]CAJ =superscript]G [subscript]CAJ/(G[subscript]PJ+[superscript]G [subscript]CAJ). The flow visualisation results also demonstrate that, when the momentum ratio is in the range 0 ≤ Γ [subscript]CAJ ≤ 0. 2, corresponding to low proportions of flow through the central <b>axial</b> <b>jet,</b> the combined flow field visually appears to be “precessing jet dominated”. For momentum ratios in the range 0. 23 < Γ [subscript]CAJ ≤ 1, the flow appears visually to be dominated by the features of the central <b>axial</b> <b>jet.</b> The effect of a central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> on the characteristics of a precessing jet flame is assessed in an unconfined environment by recording the visible flame luminescence photographically. The results demonstrate that a significant change in the flame volume, length and width is achieved by varying the proportion of central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> to total flow rate and hence the momentum ratio, Γ [subscript]CAJ. These parameters were correlated with changes in the global residence time, radiant fraction and NOx emissions based on scaling criteria from the literature. These correlations suggest that, consistent with the flow visualisation results, the momentum ratio, Γ [subscript]CAJ, controls the combustion characteristics, which in turn change significantly in the precessing jet and central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> dominated flow regimes. Confined combustion experiments are undertaken in a pilot-scale cement kiln simulator to quantify the heat flux and NOₓ emission characteristics as a function of the combined precessing jet and central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> flows and to compare them with that of a conventional burner in a well controlled, confined facility. These experiments demonstrate that the central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> provides good control over the heat flux profile, consistent with the experience in industrial installations. Furthermore, the heat transfer from a precessing jet burner is shown to be enhanced relative to a conventional burner and the NOₓ emissions and process interaction is taken into account. To quantify the mixing characteristics of each of the above flows and so to provide insight into the characteristics of relatively “good” and “bad” mixing for the optimisation of combustion in rotary kilns, concentration measurements are performed in a confined, isothermal environment. The effect of co-flow, confinement and the central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> on the mixing from a precessing jet nozzle are also assessed. The experiments are performed in a water-tunnel using a quantitative planar laser-induced fluorescence technique to provide measurement of a conserved scalar. The effect of the central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> is quantified with respect to its influence upon concentration decay, concentration fluctuations, jet width and probability distribution functions. The effect of co-flow and confinement are also quantified by measurement of the concentration decay, concentration fluctuations, jet width and probability distribution functions. The data is used to develop equations relating the flow conditions and geometry to the mean concentration on the jet axis and jet spread. These equations can be used to describe the entire mean concentration distribution in the far field of the precessing jet flow. Based on the modelling equations a scaling procedure is proposed that provides a method to scale the precessing jet flow, i. e. to relate isothermal laboratory scale investigations to full scale plant. The scaling procedure is based on a first order assessment of the separate effects of confinement, velocity ratio and mass flow ratio on the scalar mixing. The final scaling parameter represents an additional correction to a modified form of the well known Thring-Newby scaling criteria which distorts the mixture fraction ratio, i. e. the air-fuel ratio, in the model from that in the industrial scale. This correction enables similarity of the jet mixing characteristics to be preserved while correcting for the geometric distortion of the confinement ratio. The new scaling procedure is used to show that the isothermal concentration measurements are representative of the mixing conditions within the pilot-scale combustion facility and hence that the scaling procedure is appropriate for the precessing jet nozzle. The optimum combustion characteristics of the precessing jet nozzle, defined as the maximum heat transfer and minimum NOₓ emissions, are shown to occur at the maximum momentum ratio that still generates a flow characterised as precessing jet dominated. The mixing characteristics associated with high radiation and low NOₓ emissions are shown, by the quantitative mixing experiments, to be associated with the maximum mean concentration and the widest range of instantanteous concentrations measured on the jet axis of any flows produced by the combined precessing jet and central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> flows. This suggest that such mixing characteristics are desired from any natural gas burner for the maximum heat transfer and minimum emissions in a rotary kiln. The optimal mixing characteristics for the maximum efficieny and lowest emissions from a gas-fired rotary kiln are hence shown to be generated by the precessing jet-central <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> nozzle at a momentum ratio of 0. 17 ≤ Γ [subscript]CAJ ≤ 0. 23.

Simulations with a weak large-scale initial field differ little from simulations that evolve from only the poloidal field. Simulations where the large-scale initial field distorts or completely overwhelms the poloidal loops show more extensive regions of turbulence, due to the action of the MRI on the large-scale field.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of several thermodynamic vent system (TVS) tests with liquid oxygen plus a test with liquid nitrogen. In all tests, the liquid was heated above its normal boiling point to 111 K for oxygen and 100 K for nitrogen. The elevated temperature was representative of tank conditions for a candidate lunar lander ascent stage. An initial test series was conducted with saturated oxygen liquid and vapor at 0. 6 MPa. The initial series was followed by tests where the test tank was pressurized with gaseous helium to 1. 4 to 1. 6 MPa. For these tests, the helium mole fraction in the ullage was quite high, about 0. 57 to 0. 62. TVS behavior is different when helium is present than when helium is absent. The tank pressure becomes the sum of the vapor pressure and the partial pressure of helium. Therefore, tank pressure depends not only on temperature, as is the case for a pure liquid-vapor system, but also on helium density (i. e., the mass of helium divided by the ullage volume). Thus, properly controlling TVS operation is more challenging with helium pressurization than without helium pressurization. When helium was present, the liquid temperature would rise with each successive TVS cycle if tank pressure was kept within a constant control band. Alternatively, if the liquid temperature was maintained within a constant TVS control band, the tank pressure would drop with each TVS cycle. The final test series, which was conducted with liquid nitrogen pressurized with helium, demonstrated simultaneous pressure and temperature control during TVS operation. The simultaneous control was achieved by systematic injection of additional helium during each TVS cycle. Adding helium maintained the helium partial pressure as the liquid volume decreased because of TVS operation. The TVS demonstrations with liquid oxygen pressurized with helium were conducted with three different fluid-mixer configurations-a submerged <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> mixer, a pair of spray hoops in the tank ullage, and combined use of the <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> and spray hoops. A submerged liquid pump and compact heat exchanger located inside the test tank were used with all the mixer configurations. The initial series without helium and the final series with liquid nitrogen both used the <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> mixer. The <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> configuration successfully demonstrated the ability to control tank pressure; but in the normal-gravity environment, the temperature in the upper tank region (ullage and unwetted wall) was not controlled. The spray hoops and <b>axial</b> <b>jet</b> combination also successfully demonstrated pressure control as well as temperature control of the entire tank and contents. The spray-hoops-only configuration was not expected to be a reliable means of tank mixing because there was no direct means to produce liquid circulation. However, surprisingly good results also were obtained with the sprayhoops- only configuration (i. e., performance metrics such as cycle-averaged vent flowrate were similar to those obtained with the other configurations). A simple thermodynamic model was developed that correctly predicted the TVS behavior (temperature rise or pressure drop per TVS cycle) when helium was present in the ullage. The model predictions were correlated over a range of input parameters. The correlations show that temperature rise or pressure drop per cycle was proportional to both helium mole fraction and tank heat input. The response also depended on the tank fill fraction: the temperature rise or pressure drop (per TVS cycle) increased as the ullage volume decreased...|$|E

The elastic boundary consists of a transparent polyacrylamide (PAA) gel with 80 % water concentration with elastic modulus E = 0. 25 MPa. At this E-value, the deformation and rebound of the boundary is very pronounced providing particularly interesting features of bubble dynamics. It is shown by means of highspeed photography with up to 5 million frames s − 1 that bubble splitting, formation of liquid jets away from and towards the boundary, and jet-like ejection of the boundary material into the liquid are the main features of this interaction. The maximum liquid jet velocity measured was 960 m s − 1. Such high-velocity jets penetrate the elastic boundary even through a water layer of 0. 35 mm thickness.

The primary objective is to understand physics of unsteady tip clearance flow, unsteady tip leakage vortex, and cavitation inception in an <b>axial</b> water <b>jet</b> pump. Steady pressure field and resulting steady tip leakage vortex from a steady flow analysis {{do not seem to}} explain measured cavitation inception correctly. The measured flow field near the tip is unsteady and measured cavitation inception is highly transient. Flow visualization with cavitation bubbles shows that the leakage vortex is oscillating significantly and many intermittent vortex ropes are present between the suction side of the blade and the tip leakage core vortex. Although the flow field is highly transient, the overall flow structure is stable and a characteristic frequency seems to exist. To capture relevant flow physics as much as possible, a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculation and a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) were applied for the current investigation. The present study reveals that several vortices from the tip leakage vortex system cross the tip gap of the adjacent blade periodically. Sudden changes in local pressure field inside tip gap due to these vortices create vortex ropes. The instantaneous pressure filed inside the tip gap is drastically {{different from that of the}} steady flow simulation. Unsteady flow simulation which can calculate unsteady vortex motion is necessary to calculate cavitation inception accurately even at design flow condition in such a water jet pump...|$|R
