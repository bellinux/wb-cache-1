500|$|In 2009, Aronofsky {{reflected}} on the reception of The Fountain, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} Fountain-haters out [...] The film's about the fact that it's OK that we die, and we should come to terms with it. But many, many people don't want to think about that, so why pay money for a meditation on losing someone you love? Everything about western culture denies that." [...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally. So we can stop thinking about the culture of superficiality, start to remember there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> going on." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arrival at}} their destination, the crew assists Timicin in modifying photon torpedos to launch into the proxy sun with the {{expectation}} that it will repair the damaged star and prove that the technique can be safely applied to the Kaelon sun. [...] The torpedos are fired and, although the experiment seems initially to work, the effect is short-lived and the star explodes. [...] The Enterprise returns to Kaelon II. [...] Timicin is crushed, and after some questioning by Lwaxana, he [...] reveals that there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> troubling him. Timicin tells Lwaxana [...] that he is about to turn 60, and on Kaelon II, everyone who reaches that age performs the [...] "Resolution", [...] a ritual act of voluntary euthanasia. Lwaxana is outraged to learn of this and brings it to the attention of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). [...] Picard makes it clear to Lwaxana that due to the Prime Directive, he will not interfere in the planet's local affairs. Lwaxana tries to beam herself down to the planet to halt the process herself but she is thwarted by Deanna who comforts her.|$|E

500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'" [...] He graduated in 1987, {{at the age of}} 22.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} cut of {{the film}} ran for slightly over two hours, and several scenes were cut out, including a scene which depicted an extended scene of Kerry and Rigg examining Troy's trap, where Kerry reveals to Rigg she has had nightmares about Eric, and she blames herself {{for what happened to}} him. Adam had more scenes in the original cut. A scene that showed Jigsaw regretting his actions was also cut. Bell said, [...] "I'm glad they cut that scene. This guy knows exactly what he's doing. Does he start off with a model, then refine it? Yeah, he probably does. But {{there are certain things that}} are interesting and advance the story, and there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that are basically sort of backstory, and you don't really need to know".|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} on February 7, 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Palin if she supported repeal of [...] "don't ask, don't tell", the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, [...] "I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent {{of his time in}} the State of the Union on national security issues. And I say that because there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to be worried about right now with the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now. To put so much time and effort and politics into it– unnecessary." ...|$|E

2500|$|During her June 12, 2010, {{appearance}} on Freedom Watch, Palin elaborated on her stance {{that even though}} marijuana should not be legalized, enforcement of marijuana prohibition laws should be made a lower priority: [...] "Well, if we’re talking about pot, I’m not for the legalization of pot because I think that that would just encourage, especially, our young people {{to think that it}} was okay to go ahead and use it. And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I {{think that we need to}} prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country." ...|$|E
2500|$|This legend {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} ones in the history of drug testing, and is only partly true. [...] Consumption of vinegar will lower the pH (i.e. {{increasing}} the acidity) of the blood and urine, and drugs that contain amine groups (such as amphetamines) will be cleared out somewhat faster as their water solubility increases due to protonation. Also, the reduced pH can potentially throw off the pH-sensitive enzymes in a particular type of bioassay (EMIT) often (but not always) used as the initial screening test, even for non-amine-containing drugs such as THC. However, vinegar is not necessary to do so, as there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> (such as high doses of vitamin C) that can do the same thing, but without the almost inevitable diarrhea and vomiting that vinegar can produce after consuming large quantities. Saliva testing can be deterred with the use of vinegar—not to say drinking it, but merely washing out the mouth will throw off most saliva kits.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the Redskins started 2–0 but {{finished}} 5–11, {{with several}} close losses {{coming down to}} the 4th quarter. The offense was a bit improved, but the departure of defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis to become the {{head coach of the}} Cincinnati Bengals saw the defense fade from 5th in scoring defense during the previous season to 24th in 2003. The team as a whole faded late in the season, and were outscored 85–31 over their last three games. Spurrier resigned on December 30, 2003, choosing to walk away from $15 million still owed to him over the remaining three years of his contract. In a statement released by the team, Spurrier said [...] "I apologize to Redskins fans that we did not reach a level of success that we had all hoped... It's a long grind and I feel (that) after 20 years as a head coach there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> I need to do. I simply believe this is the right time for me to move on because this team needs new leadership." ...|$|E
