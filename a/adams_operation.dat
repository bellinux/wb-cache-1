As in the Lie case [23], a map is constructed from the classifying space of the discrete Kac-Moody group over the algebraic closure of the field with p elements to the complex topological Kac-Moody group of the same type. Rank 2, non-Lie, Kac-Moody groups are studied to show that {{in contrast to the}} Lie case [22] the classifying space of the discrete Kac-Moody group over the field with the kth power of p elements and the homotopy fixed points of the complex topological Kac-Moody group of the same type with respect to a newly constructed kth power of p unstable <b>Adams</b> <b>operation</b> frequently have different homotopy types after localization with respect to homology with coefficients in a field of characteristic relatively prime to...|$|E

40|$|Bousfield {{recently}} gave {{a formula}} for the odd-primary v 1 -periodic homotopy groups of a finite H-space {{in terms of its}} K-theory and Adams operations. We apply Bousfield's theorem to give explicit determinations of the v 1 -periodic homotopy groups of (E 8, 5) and (E 8, 3), thus completing the determination of all odd-primary v 1 -periodic homotopy groups of compact simple Lie groups, a project suggested by Mimura in 1989. The method involves no homotopy theoretic input and no spectral sequences. The input is the second eexterior power operation in the representation ring of E 8, which we determine using specialized software. This can be interpreted as giving the <b>Adams</b> <b>operation</b> psi^ 2 in K(E 8). Eigenvectors of psi^ 2 must also be eigenvectors of psi^k for any k. The matrix of these eigenvectors {{is the key to the}} analysis. Its determinant is closely related to the homotopy decomposition of E 8 localized at each prime. By taking careful combinations of eigenvectors, we obtain a set of generators of K(E 8) on which we have a nice formula for all Adams operations. Bousfield's theorem (and much Maple computation) allows us to obtain the v 1 -periodic homotopy groups. Comment: 50 pages; available at [URL]...|$|E
