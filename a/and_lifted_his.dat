25|$|In Bremen Prince-Archbishop Valdemar {{had been}} warmly welcomed and nobody {{cared about the}} anathema. After Philip's {{assassination}} in June 1208, Prince-Archbishop Valdemar {{as well as the}} burghers and the city of Bremen joined the party of the former rival king OttoIV, whom InnocentIII crowned Emperor in 1209. OttoIV persuaded ValdemarII to withdraw into the north of the Elbe and urged anti-archbishop Burchard to resign. Bremen's cathedral chapter had fallen out with Valdemar and reconciled with Hamburg's concathedral chapter to elect a new archbishop, this time searching the papal consent. This made Valdemar search for the papal recognition as archbishop, in 1210 he pilgrimaged to Rome and craved Innocent's forgiving, and he pardoned him <b>and</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> ban against Valdemar. Innocent entitled Valdemar to serve as metropolitan of Bremen ecclesiastical province and archbishop and to ordain priests. Thus recognised by pope and emperor Valdemar departed for Bremen.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Arsène Wenger arrived at Arsenal in September 1996, Wright was nearly 33. Despite his age, he {{continued}} to score regularly, and was the second-highest Premier League scorer in the 1996–97 season with 23 goals. On 13 September 1997, he broke Cliff Bastin's club record of 178 to become Arsenal's all-time top scorer with a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers. Wright's final goal at Highbury, on 4 October against Barnsley, was his 300th career goal for both Crystal Palace and Arsenal. He scored his final goal for the club on 6 January 1998 in a League Cup quarter-final victory against West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground. A hamstring injury ruled him out {{for much of the}} remainder of the season. In his absence, Arsenal were eliminated in the semi-final by Chelsea, ending their hopes of a domestic treble. He was an unused substitute as Arsenal won the 1998 FA Cup Final, <b>and</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> first Premier League title as the Gunners completed a league and cup double.|$|E
500|$|Before {{leaving town}} after Congress adjourned in March 1865, Stevens privately urged Lincoln {{to press the}} South hard militarily, though the war was ending. [...] Lincoln replied, [...] "Stevens, {{this is a pretty}} big hog we are trying to catch and to hold when we catch him. [...] We must take care that he does not slip away from us." [...] Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with [...] "a homely metaphor but no real {{certainty}} of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln's policy.” On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. [...] Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons. [...] According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, Stevens stood at a railroad bridge <b>and</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> hat.|$|E

500|$|Walker is {{best remembered}} {{for a pair}} of one-handed catches he made in 2001. [...] Prior to the 2002 NFL Draft, Baltimore Ravens Senior vice {{president}} of football operations, Ozzie Newsome referred to Walker's collegiate catches as some of the best catches he has seen in college in a long time. [...] One of the one-handed catches was a touchdown catch {{in the back of the}} end zone against the Iowa Hawkeyes football team in a 32–26 comeback from a 21–7 deficit on October 27, 2001. [...] The Post-Standard, Walker's hometown newspaper, described his grab in the Iowa game this way: [...] "There he was in the corner of the end zone, as two Iowa defensive backs stalked him like [...] [...] The ball, delivered high and wide, seemed an improbable stretch, an impossible goal. [...] And yet, as it spiraled toward him, Marquise Walker leaped <b>and</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> right arm. [...] His fingertips grazed the leather and tipped it skyward. [...] And then, as he tumbled back to earth, he wrapped his hands around the ball and caressed it to his chest. [...] Touchdown Michigan." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In total {{disregard}} {{of his own}} safety, Lance Corporal Apiata stood up <b>and</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> comrade bodily. He then carried him across the seventy metres of broken, rocky and fire swept ground, fully exposed {{in the glare of}} battle to heavy enemy fire and into the face of returning fire from the main Troop position. That neither he nor his colleague were hit is scarcely possible. Having delivered his wounded companion to relative shelter with the remainder of the patrol, Lance Corporal Apiata re-armed himself and rejoined the fight in counter-attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, he famously officiated {{over the}} first all LBW hat trick in cricket, taken by Horace Fisher, the Yorkshire slow left-armer against Somerset CCC at Bramall Lane in 1932. After giving Mitchell-Innes and Andrews out lbw, he stared up the wicket at batsman Luckes when the third appeal was made, and finally-almost in disbelief-announced, [...] "As God's my witness, that's out, too." [...] <b>and</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> finger. [...] "I was never more sure that I was right in each case," [...] he said afterwards, {{and each of the}} batsmen agreed that he had been trapped dead in front.|$|E
