25|$|In January 2004, Andrea Constand, {{a former}} Temple University employee, accused Cosby of drugging and fondling her; however, in February 2005, Montgomery County's District Attorney {{said there would}} be no charges due to {{insufficient}} credible and <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence.</b> Constand then filed a civil claim in March 2005, with 13 women as potential witnesses if the case went to court. Cosby settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in November 2006.|$|E
25|$|Appearing {{before some}} {{administrative}} tribunals may feel like appearing in court, but the tribunal's procedure is relatively less formal {{than that of}} a court, and more importantly, the rules of evidence are not as strictly observed, so that some evidence that would be inadmissible in a court hearing may be allowed in a tribunal hearing, if relevant to the proceeding. While relevant evidence is <b>admissible,</b> <b>evidence</b> which the adjudicator determines to have questionable reliability, or is otherwise questionable, is most likely to be afforded little or no weight.|$|E
25|$|In December 2010, Coulson – {{while under}} oath {{as a witness}} in HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan – denied any {{knowledge}} of phone hacking at the News of the World or that he knew the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The following day, the Crown Prosecution Service said that it had determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge Coulson over allegations that {{he was aware of}} phone hacking at the publication. The CPS said that witnesses interviewed by the Metropolitan Police – including those who had previously made allegations through media outlets – had not been willing to provide <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} was praised by civil libertarians. Former President of the Victorial Council of Civil Liberties, Robert Richter QC, {{said that the}} {{decision was}} important [...] "because the pressure is to say, 'Well, do anything' if the case {{is said to be}} a terrorist case. That is unacceptable, the Court of Appeal has said it's unacceptable." [...] University of Melbourne evidence law professor Andrew Palmer said that [...] "I think that it was a little bit naive to think that they could interview somebody and gather <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence...</b> when that person was being held in conditions which were possibly oppressive... I don't really know what they were thinking." ...|$|E
500|$|The parties made submissions, {{and there}} was an oral hearing on 1 December 2006. All parties {{accepted}} that the relevant test to be applied was the test set out in the High Court case of DPP (Nauru) v Fowler, which sets out two preconditions for a retrial; the first requiring that the <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence</b> presented at trial be [...] "sufficiently cogent" [...] to support a conviction, the second requiring consideration of circumstances that would make it unjust to put the accused through a retrial. However this case had an unusual feature, namely that the evidence that the prosecution would seek to use at a retrial had not been available at the original trial, through no fault of the prosecution, since although the interviews had been taken at that time they had not been published. Ultimately all parties agreed that all evidence, not just evidence submitted in the original trial, should be considered when applying {{the first part of the}} Fowler test.|$|E
500|$|John Hart {{and nine}} others were {{teachers}} at Malvern College who {{benefited from a}} [...] "concessionary fee" [...] scheme that allowed their children to be educated at the college for one fifth of the normal fees of a pupil. The Inland Revenue attempted to tax this benefit based on the Finance Act 1976. There was a dispute over the correct interpretation of the Act. [...] The Special Commissioners charged with assessing the tax found in favour of Hart, but both the High Court of Justice and Court of Appeal of England and Wales found in favour of the Inland Revenue. The case {{then went to the}} House of Lords, which, making use of statements in Parliament as recorded in Hansard, found in favour of Hart. [...] Lord Mackay, dissenting, argued that Hansard should not be considered <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence</b> because of the time and expense involved in a lawyer having to look up every debate and discussion on a particular statute when giving legal advice or preparing a case.|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} that if one of two persons, accused of having {{together}} committed the crime of murder, makes a voluntary confession {{in the presence of}} the other, without threat or coercion, the confession is <b>admissible</b> in <b>evidence</b> against both. However, declarations of one accomplice after the killing made in the absence of the other implicating the guilt of both are <b>admissible</b> in <b>evidence</b> only against the one making the declarations, not against the other.|$|R

500|$|No [...] "John Doe #2" [...] {{was ever}} identified, nothing {{conclusive}} was ever reported regarding {{the owner of}} the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence,</b> of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: [...] "You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?" [...] On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written [...] "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else. Financing? Logistics? Specialized tech skills? Brainpower? Strategy? ... Show me where I needed a dark, mysterious 'Mr. X'!" ...|$|E
500|$|On 8 March, Thomas {{was interviewed}} again by {{two members of}} the AFP, who had made special {{arrangements}} with the Pakistani Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to have the interview conducted pursuant to Australian law, particularly the requirements of the federal Evidence Act 1995 and Crimes Act 1914, so that <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence</b> could be gathered. ISI allowed the interview, but with a very limited timeframe, and did not allow Thomas to have access to legal advice. During this interview, Thomas made several self-incriminatory statements, which were key to his later convictions and the admissibility of which was the central issue in the appeal. In the statements, Thomas admitted that he had tampered with his passport to conceal the amount of time he had been in Pakistan, and also admitted that the money and airline ticket had been given to him by Tawfiq bin Attash, a high ranking Al Qaeda lieutenant involved with the 1998 United States embassy bombings and the USS Cole bombing. On 10 March, the AFP wrote again to the ISI, reiterating the requirements of the Australian legislation, and saying that [...] "the admissibility of [...] in Australian Courts has been seriously compromised." ...|$|E
