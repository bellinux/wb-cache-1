5|$|Historically, {{the first}} form of graph duality to be {{recognized}} was the <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Platonic solids into pairs of dual polyhedra. Graph duality is a topological generalization of the geometric concepts of dual polyhedra and dual tessellations, and is in turn generalized algebraically by {{the concept of a}} dual matroid. Variations of planar graph duality include a version of duality for directed graphs, and duality for graphs embedded onto non-planar two-dimensional surfaces.|$|E

5|$|More {{schools for}} the deaf were founded after ASD, and {{knowledge}} of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL. Societies such as the National <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country. This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these new}} rules, {{football}} remained a violent sport. Dangerous mass-formations, which involved interlocking interference, like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths. A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide {{resulted in a}} threat by President Theodore Roosevelt to abolish the game unless major changes were made. In response, sixty-two colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905, and these proceedings resulted {{in the formation of}} the Intercollegiate Athletic <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Harlan {{volunteered for}} {{military}} duty, {{serving as a}} colonel in the United States Army Air Force from 1943 to 1945.

In 1946 Harlan returned to private law practice representing Du Pont family members against a federal antitrust lawsuit. In 1951, however, he returned to public service, serving as Chief Counsel to the New York State Crime Commission, where he investigated the relationship between organized crime and the state government as well as illegal gambling activities in New York and other areas. During this period Harlan also served as a committee chairman of the <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bar of the City of New York, and to which he was later elected vice president. Harlan's main specialization at that time was corporate and anti-trust law.|$|E
5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
