40|$|Two {{attempted}} syntheses of a functionalized {{ring system}} common to kaurenoid natural products is presented. One of the attempts employed a bridgehead enone as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. One example {{in this series}} resulted in the synthesis of the tetracyclic ring system, but the angular C- 8 (kaurene numbering) methyl group could not be added. Another example in this series resulted in the synthesis of <b>a</b> tricyclic <b>intermediate</b> containing the carbons to form the fourth ring, but this could not be cyclized. The other approach employed a Michael addition followed by an oxy-ene reaction for the synthesis of the tetracyclic framework, but a suitable precursor for the oxy-ene reaction was not realized. Also described is an attempted cyclization of <b>a</b> bicyclic <b>intermediate</b> to <b>a</b> tricyclic <b>intermediate</b> that contained functionality to prepare the bicyclo (3. 2. 1) octene ring system {{using a variety of}} reagents, but with no success;A synthesis of <b>an</b> advanced <b>intermediate</b> toward the synthesis of trixikingolide is also described. This synthesis employed bridgehead carbocation chemistry in the construction of <b>a</b> key <b>intermediate.</b> <b>A</b> tricyclic <b>intermediate</b> is prepared by a regioselective intramolecular aldol condensation.
