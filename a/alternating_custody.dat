5|$|Many {{parenting}} schedules {{for joint}} physical custody provide for a more equal time share between parents. For example, parents may choose a form of <b>alternating</b> <b>custody,</b> pursuant to which the children live {{for a period of}} time with one parent, and then for a similar amount of time with the other parent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alternating</b> <b>custody,</b> {{also known}} as serial custody or shared custody, is an {{arrangement}} in which children live {{for long periods of}} time with one parent, and then spend a similar amount of time with the other parent. The primary difference between <b>alternating</b> <b>custody</b> and joint custody is that in <b>alternating</b> <b>custody,</b> the parent that currently has the child also retains sole authority over the child/children for the duration that the child/children are with said parent. The general reason for using this arrangement rather than a more commonly used arrangement is that the parents tend to live too far away from each other to allow for other arrangements to be feasible.|$|E
50|$|Shared custody is an {{arrangement}} whereby the child/children live {{for an extended}} period of time with one parent, and then for a similar amount of time with the other parent. Opposite to <b>alternating</b> <b>custody,</b> both parents retain authority over the child/children.|$|E
40|$|Sentencing in Canada is {{beset by}} many {{problems}} yet one weakness stands above the rest: the disproportionately {{high rates of}} Aboriginal incarceration. This article documents current and historical trends in levels of Aboriginal incarceration at the provincial/territorial and federal levels since 1978. We {{pay particular attention to}} the years following two important Supreme Court judgments (in 2001 and 2012) which directed courts to use custody with greater restraint when sentencing an Aboriginal offender. The primary data derive from the annual Adult Correctional Services (ACS) Survey conducted by Statistics Canada. In 2014, Aboriginal persons accounted for just over one quarter of all provincial and territorial admissions, significantly higher than the percentage recorded in 1978 (16 %). In fact, over the last 20 years all jurisdictions save one have experienced an increase in the percentage of Aboriginal admissions to provincial correctional institutions. Despite judgments from the Supreme and provincial courts of appeal, {{and a number of other}} remedial interventions such as the creation of so-called ‘Gladue’ courts and an <b>alternate</b> form of <b>custody</b> served in the community, the problem of Aboriginal over-incarceration has worsened, not improved.

40|$|The work titled,,Impact of {{marriage}} break-up on value orientation {{of children and}} youthq deals with values and value system of youth, divorce {{of marriage}}, post-divorce family setup and impact of divorce on children. I have briefly discussed also issues concerning family and marriage. The purpose and aim of the work was to identify how children and youth understand and experience break-up of their parents marriage, how they managed {{to cope with this}} situation and if their moral development and value orientation have been affected. In relation to such objective I have brought up four hypothesis. Hypothesis H 1 : I assume that divorce of parents affects value scale of children and youth. Hypothesis H 2 : Divorce of parents predominantly evokes negative feelings, uncertainty, nostalgia. Hypothesis H 3 : Frustration related to family situation after divorce results in deterioration of school results of children and youth. And at the end the hypothesis H 4 : After divorce behavior of children and youth towards authorities and their surroundings deteriorates. I have chosen quantitative research for my work and used questioning method, questionnaire technique. The questionnaires have been designed for pupils and students of elementary and secondary schools in Písek and Strakonice. With regard to my hypothesis the research revealed interesting findings. Hypothesis H 1 and H 2 have been confirmed, however hypothesis H 3 and H 4 were negated. Therefore divorce impact on deterioration of behavior and school results of respondents has not been confirmed. The following interesting facts resulted from the research. I have found that every 4 th pupil or student experienced divorce of his/her parents. The traditional post-divorce family setup still prevails, i. e. children are in the custody of their mother. <b>Alternating</b> or joint <b>custody</b> is quite exceptional as well as custody of a father. The work results are intended mainly for parents and social workers in order to understand what impact divorce may have on children and {{how important it is to}} provide them special care in these difficult times. Divorce does not necessarily need to have negative impact on children, if they do not experience hostility between parents and the post-divorce family setup is adopted to individual needs of all family members, i. e. also of children...|$|R

40|$|The main {{theme of}} the work is finding an answer to the {{question}} why in the past years Czech Parliament has failed to enforce measures improving {{the quality of life of}} lone-parent families, and what could be done for these measures to be adopted. Theoretical support for answering both questions is provided by a) frame analysis (Schőn and Rein), which works with the idea of conflicting frames and bridging conflicts through reframing, and b) the theory of social construction of target groups (Schneider and Ingram). Based on an analysis of stenographic minutes from proceedings dealing with the issue of non-payment of child support (in particular with proposals for the state to pay child support first and then to receive it from the obligor) and the arrangements connected to child custody (in particular the proposal to strengthen <b>alternating</b> <b>custody),</b> conflicting frames are reconstructed (in the case of non-payment, there are three conflicting frames, in the case of child custody two). These conflicting frames, or rather the fact that they are insufficiently addressed, may be the cause of the incapacity of Czech political representation to address the above agenda. An "efficient penalizing of the debtor" is described as a possible reframing of the problem in the field of non-payment of child support [...] . ...|$|E

The Royal Academy of the Spanish Language defines as > His concept evokes therefore the enunciation of a scientific proposition, an axiom or a demonstrable fact. In this paper we carry out {{a study on the}} regime of shared or <b>alternating</b> <b>custody,</b> conceptualizing the notion of custody {{in order to determine the}} rights and duties that the scheme entails for the holder or holders of the same are, so that both parents can take their offspring to the position of guarantors of the child or children when they are in their company. Thus it corresponds to the parents the task of ensuring the maintenance of family functioning as holders of parental authority. Parental authority to exercise dual function as equal on the children born in wedlock. However, when dysfunctional family situation becomes difficult to determine whether the exercise of parental authority must be maintained for both parents or whether there is a unilateral attribution arises. This leads us to believe that custody as dual function in situations of marital crisis suffered a breakdown when the custody of the children is attributed to one parent. While the situations of family crisis, with the inevitable conflicts that lead to marital breakdown must not affect the obligations that parents have for their children, must be taken to avoid, insofar as possible, that minors become an instrument of defense or thrown to resolve personal differences between parents weapon. The Spanish Civil Code after the promulgation of the Law 15 / 2005, of 8 July, amending the Civil Code regarding separation and divorce, expressly provides for the possibility of implementing joint custody in cases of family crisis. Joint custody that would aim the equitable and equal distribution rights and duties of parents towards the children, and the allocation of space and equitable and egalitarian times both parents to the children following the breakdown of couple [...] ...|$|E
