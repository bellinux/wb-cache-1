5|$|Basil cultivars are {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} basil. They {{are used in}} a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes <b>annuals,</b> non-woody perennials and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum, or sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either <b>annuals</b> or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E

5|$|Roy of the Rovers first {{appeared}} on 11 September 1954, as a weekly feature in the comic magazine Tiger, debuting {{on the front page}} of the first issue. After 22years of continued popularity, the strip was judged successful enough to sustain its own weekly comic, the eponymous Roy of the Rovers, launched on 25 September 1976. The comic ran for 851issues, until 20 March 1993, and included other football strips and features. At the peak of the comic's success about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback <b>annuals</b> and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, Roy of the Rovers was serialised in the now defunct Today newspaper. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. Between 1988 and 1993, a Best of Roy of the Rovers monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories.|$|E

Strips from Joe 90 Top Secret were reprinted in a new publication, Joe 90, which was launched to tie in with the 1994 BBC re-runs but which also, after just seven issues, merged into a related comic, on this occasion Fleetway's Thunderbirds. Other Joe 90 print media include 1968 and 1969 Joe 90 <b>annuals</b> from Century 21 Publishing and two short paperback novels, Joe 90 and the Raiders (by Tod Sullivan) and Joe 90 in Revenge (by Howard Elson), published by May Fair Books.|$|E
5|$|The Diversity {{indices of}} the plant species were recorded; they were a {{richness}} of 48, diversity of 0.29 and evenness of 0.47 in summer. In winter, the respective figures were 81, 0.17 and 0.52. Species richness {{was found to be}} different in 48 samples of thin phumdis, 53 samples of thick phumdis and 14 samples on hard ground. The eight plant communities identified during winter and summer were Capillipedium, Leersia hexandra, Oenanthe javanica, Phragmites karka, Kyllinga triceps, Pteridium aquilinum, Zizania latifolia and Persicaria perfoliata. Zizania latifolia recorded the highest productivity with (13.90±5.01)g/m2 for winter and (102.96±26.03)g/m2 for summer.

5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as <b>annuals.</b> Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables {{have been}} part of the human diet from time immemorial. Some are staple foods but most are {{accessory}} foodstuffs, adding variety to meals with their unique flavors and at the same time, adding nutrients necessary for health. Some vegetables are perennials but most are <b>annuals</b> and biennials, usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation of the soil by loosening it, removing or burying weeds, and adding organic manures or fertilisers; sowing seeds or planting young plants; tending the crop while it grows to reduce weed competition, control pests, and provide sufficient water; harvesting the crop when it is ready; sorting, storing, and marketing the crop or eating it fresh from the ground.|$|E
5|$|After Joe Colquhoun departed, he was succeeded {{first by}} Paul Trevillion, then by Yvonne Hutton, who {{illustrated}} from 1967 to 1974, before David Sque {{took over in}} 1975. Despite reportedly not being a football fan, {{he was responsible for}} one of the strip's more definitive looks in its early '80s period. He was replaced in 1986 by former 2000AD artist Mike White, who gave Roy a more muscular look and the strip a more modern feel. Barrie Mitchell took over in 1992, with a style quite similar to White's. A number of artists worked on the monthly comic, such as David Jukes, Sean Longcroft and Garry Marshall, in contrast to the lengthy tenures of the weekly strip's creative team. Tony Harding often illustrated Roy for the Roy of the Rovers <b>annuals</b> and also drew the Roy's Action Replay strip that appeared in All Action Monthly in the late eighties (Fleetway). Mitchell returned in 1997 as the sole artist of the Match of the Day strips for all four years.|$|E
40|$|This paper applied an {{integrated}} method combining grey relation analysis, wavelet analysis and statistical analysis to study {{climate change and}} its effects on runoff of the Kaidu River at multi-time scales. Major findings are as follows: 1) Climatic factors were ranked in the order of importance to <b>annual</b> runoff as average <b>annual</b> temperature, average temperature in autumn, average temperature in winter, <b>annual</b> precipitation, precipitation in flood season, average temperature in summer, and average temperature in spring. The average <b>annual</b> temperature and <b>annual</b> precipitation were selected as the two representative factors that impact the <b>annual</b> runoff. 2) From the 32 -year time scale, the <b>annual</b> runoff and the average <b>annual</b> temperature presented a significantly rising trend, whereas the <b>annual</b> precipitation showed little increase over the period of 1957 - 2002. By changing the time scale from 32 -year to 4 -year, we observed nonlinear trends with increasingly obvious oscillations for <b>annual</b> runoff, average <b>annual</b> temperature, and <b>annual</b> precipitation. 3) The changes of the runoff and the regional climate are closely related, indicating that the runoff change {{is the result of the}} regional climate changes. With time scales ranging from 32 -year, 16 -year, 8 -year and to 4 -year, there are highly significant linear correlations between the <b>annual</b> runoff and the average <b>annual</b> temperature and the <b>annual</b> precipitation...|$|R
