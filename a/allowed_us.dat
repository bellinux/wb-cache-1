Hoge had no intelligence on the number and size of German forces on the east bank. The standing bridge could have been a trap.

[...] "What they've <b>allowed</b> <b>us</b> {{to do is take}} a licensed property and treat it like a brand new IP" [...] stated Tieger. The vehicle modes for car-based characters initially consisted of wheels, however the developers found that it crippled gameplay by removing the player's ability to strafe while in vehicle mode. [...] Taking the dilemma to Hasbro, the two companies agreed that characters would turn their wheels down and hover while in vehicle mode, allowing for more movement. [...] The vehicles would then revert to the traditional wheeled mode while using a character's boost, maintaining what the Transformers license had established with previous canon.|$|E
