5|$|Josiah Collins {{was one of}} {{the first}} European-descended {{settlers}} to live and farm in the area of Pettigrew State Park, arriving in the 1780s. Collins <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> drained the swamps surrounding Lake Phelps and established an extensive plantation known as Somerset Place.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} the center point of their parcel, Hudson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> built a trail {{from that point}} to their boat on the Cuyahoga. It {{took more than a}} week for the group to build the trail and carry their goods from the boat. They then built a small shelter, and began to establish the township.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, the Newby-McMahon Building {{had proved}} to be an {{excessive}} burden on the limited capital reserves of the WCHS. The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims & Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building. Dick Bundy <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building. In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $3,748.|$|E

5|$|Collins <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> {{brought in}} slaves from Africa {{to dig a}} canal from Lake Phelps to the Scuppernong River. The canal served two purposes: first, {{as a means of}} {{transporting}} goods and people to and from the plantation; and second, it served as a massive drainage ditch as the slaves of Somerset Place worked to drain the surrounding swamps. Later, the canal system was expanded to provide irrigation for the rice and corn fields of the plantation.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Widney wanted Los Angeles {{to have a}} harbor, {{and with}} Phineas Banning {{successfully}} lobbied the United States Congress for funding for the harbor at San Pedro, California (the Port of Los Angeles). He {{was chairman of the}} Los Angeles Citizens' Committee on the Wilmington Harbor. He successfully opposed the attempt of the railroad interests of Collis Potter Huntington <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> from claiming the state tidelands of the harbor for their own purposes, ensuring these lands remained in public hands.|$|E
5|$|Nikolai Volkoff competed at Survivor Series 1990 in a {{match that}} pitted him <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> against Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and The Orient Express.

5|$|The Sunderland Echo is {{an evening}} {{newspaper}} serving the Sunderland, South Tyneside and East Durham areas of North East England. The newspaper {{was founded by}} Samuel Storey, Edward Backhouse, Edward Temperley Gourley, Charles Palmer, Richard Ruddock, Thomas Glaholm and Thomas Scott Turnbull in 1873, as the Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette. Designed to provide a platform for the Radical views held by Storey <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners,</b> it was also Sunderland's first local daily paper.|$|E
5|$|Zacharie's death {{threatened}} {{to disrupt the}} project, but King Louis XVI of France was personally interested, and Zacharie's oldest son, Guillaume, was allowed to resume the work. On 14 December 1771, new letters patent were given to Guillaume <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners,</b> replacing the earlier ones. Under the new terms, all the land needed could be expropriated including two toises, or , of land on either side for tow paths. The builder could take materials wherever they could be found.|$|E
5|$|Heartland Food Corporation (Heartland) {{came into}} {{existence}} when Miami-based franchisee Al Cabrera purchased {{a large chunk of}} stores, 130 locations primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid-west, from the failed franchise AmeriKing for a bargain basement price of $16million, or approximately 88% of their original value in December 2003. Taking these stores, he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> created a new company called Core Value Partners to renovate and update the locations which had deteriorated during Ameriking's decline. During this time, the company was renamed Heartland Food Corp. and it purchased 120 additional stores from other financially distressed owners and completely revamped them as well. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra Burger King's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKC's top franchisee groups at the time. By 2006, the company was valued at over $150million, and was sold to New York-based GSO Capital Partners.|$|E

5|$|James Dudley {{began working}} for Jess McMahon in the 1950s, when McMahon was a {{co-owner}} of the Capitol Wrestling Corporation. When McMahon <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> {{broke away from the}} National Wrestling Alliance to form the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in 1963, Dudley continued to work for McMahon. Dudley performed many different jobs, from carrying buckets of waters to counting ticket sales. Dudley was a close friend of Vincent J. McMahon and continued working for the family when the younger McMahon took over the business from his father; in particular, he drove McMahon's limousine and served as his bodyguard. He has said that he thought of McMahon as a father figure. McMahon later increased Dudley's responsibilities with the company several times, and eventually assigned him to manage Turner's Arena in Washington, D.C., which made Dudley the first African-American to hold such a position in the United States. His role required him to oversee several other events, including the Town and Country Jamboree television show.|$|E
5|$|McBride <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> {{sold the}} team {{to a group of}} Cleveland {{businessmen}} in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive Art Modell. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back Jim Brown. The Browns won the championship in 1964 and reached the title game the following season, losing to the Green Bay Packers. The team subsequently reached the playoffs three times in the late 1980s, but fell short of playing in the Super Bowl, the inter-league championship game between the NFL and the rival American Football League (AFL) that started in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few people}} visited the cave during the next decade. Among them was Thomas Condon, {{professor}} of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson's brother, in 1884 he {{and a group of}} students hiked from Williams to the cavern, which they inspected by candlelight. Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business. Burch <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.|$|E

5|$|These {{characters}} also assist Mario in the game's turn-based battles, where damage inflicted {{against them}} results in temporary paralysis as the characters {{do not have}} individual HP statistics. Attacks in the game {{are similar to those}} in traditional RPGs, although the player can influence the power of a move when attacking or defending by timing a button-press accurately or performing some other action command as required. Mario <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> have a finite capacity to perform special moves, with each of these consuming a particular number of flower points (FP) when performed. Such statistics can be increased by earning Star Points (experience points) in combat to level up. There is also an on-screen gauge to display Star Energy, which is required to perform another type of move that accumulate in number as the player advances through the game. The player can locate hidden battle upgrades in the game's overworld, which promotes one partner character to a new rank at a time.|$|E
5|$|With {{a series}} of {{farewell}} performances, Garrick left the stage in 1776 and sold his shares in the theatre to the Irish playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Sheridan <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners,</b> Thomas Linley the elder and Doctor James Ford (court physician to King George III), completed their purchase of Drury Lane two years later, and Sheridan owned it until 1809. Sheridan premiered his own comedy of manners The School for Scandal in 1777. Active management of the theatre {{was carried out by}} a number of parties during Sheridan's ownership, including himself, his father Thomas, and, from 1788 to 1796 and 1800 to 1802, the popular actor John Philip Kemble. Linley took up the post of Musical Director at the theatre, receiving a retainer of £500 per annum.|$|E
5|$|Foxgrover {{remained}} {{involved in}} the Millennium Park restaurant after she recused herself from contract negotiations in May, 2002. In October 2003, Foxgrover spoke {{in favor of the}} restaurant getting a liquor license before a Chicago City Council committee while O'Malley owed Foxgrover at least $5,000. On the same day, Foxgrover worked to get O'Malley's Clock Tower Cafe a liquor license. In one July 2003 e-mail, Foxgrover, then the acting director of park services, said that if O'Malley's contractor had any questions for the Park District, she will be the point person. In August 2003, Horan sent out an e-mail mentioning a discussion Horan had with Foxgrover, in which Horan asked Foxgrover if the Park District would waive a form of insurance on the restaurant's construction. A provision in the Park Grill contract allows the restaurant to arrange a series of summer concerts on the Millennium Park ice-skating rink, drawing crowds that bolster food and drink sales. In summer 2004, O'Malley <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> asked Clear Channel-owned WNUA Radio to conduct the concerts. In February 2005, Foxgrover led a five-member Park District committee that chose Clear Channel over JAM Productions to operate the new concert venue at Northerly Island on the former site of Meigs Field.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 LeMond {{joined with}} his parents-in-law David and Sacia Morris, friend Michael Snow and J.P. Morgan & Co. fund manager Jorge Jasson {{to invest in}} the {{exclusive}} Yellowstone Club, a Big Sky, Montana private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth and his wife Edra. Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $750,000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort. LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort. Four years later LeMond and partners sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $375million from which Blixseth reportedly took $209million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake. The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $1.16billion Cushman & Wakefield valuation of the resort, for which LeMond and partners each sought $11.6million for their one-percent shares. In 2007, LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $39million; however, he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20million payment (after having already paid the group $18 million), followed by their divorce and the bankruptcy of the Club in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Spreckels <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> William G. Irwin and F. F. Low {{formed the}} Spreckels & Company Bank in Hawaii in 1884, for the {{specific}} purpose of circulating the silver coins. The first Hawaiian silver coin {{known to have been}} spent, a half dollar, was found among the receipts at the Honolulu Music Hall on January 10, 1884. It was placed in a pendant and given to the leading lady. The new coinage went into general circulation on January 14, with coins available at the Hawaiian Treasury and at Spreckels' new bank in Honolulu. There was considerable demand, and the coins (all of which were received by June 1884) displaced American quarter dollars and half dollars in circulation, something taken (depending on political position) to mean that they were accepted, or that Gresham's Law (bad money drives out good) was in operation. The Hawaiian Treasury had been almost out of cash before receiving the coins, and they entered commerce as the government paid for goods and services, increasing the money supply and risking inflation. Within six months of issue, the coins traded against American currency at a discount of 2 percent.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoe Brothers {{returned}} to ROH at the Fourth Anniversary Show in 2006, forcibly including {{themselves in a}} match that was at first between the teams of Tony Mamaluke and Sal Rinauro and Jason Blade and Kid Mikaze. They won in their re-debut. They then feuded for the tag team championship again, but much as they had against Styles and Red three years earlier, they lost in three shots against the champions at the time, Austin Aries and Roderick Strong, at Ring of Homicide, Destiny, and Unified. As before, the storyline was that this cost them any chance at the belts {{for as long as}} those champs held them. It was around this time that the Brothers became enforcers for Jim Cornette's heel character as ROH Commissioner, fighting battles against his enemies, most notably Homicide and his partner Samoa Joe at Glory By Honor V: Night Two and in anything goes, falls count anywhere, elimination match at Dethroned. During this time, they also feuded with Kenta <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners</b> Davey Richards and Naomichi Marufuji, facing Kenta and Richards at Time to Man Up and Kenta and Marufuji at Glory By Honor V: Night One.|$|E
