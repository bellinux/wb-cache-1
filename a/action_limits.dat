50|$|The {{ground loop}} will be {{carrying}} some current {{at the local}} supply frequency, typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz, due to electromagnetic induction from current-carrying conductors nearby. There is an AC magnetic field everywhere in developed areas; however, its magnitude and direction depend strongly on the local environment and arrangement of current-carrying wiring. This influences the current induced in the ground loop, which is also dependent on the area enclosed by the ground loop and its orientation. The impedance of the loop, basically just its resistance at low frequencies, also influences the induced current that will flow. It is important to realise that for a ground loop to cause problems, {{there must be a}} local magnetic field produced by power frequency or other systems. It is the combination of radiated field and receptive ground loop that causes problems, and the situation can be improved by attention to either one, or both of these. In effect, the ground loop is the secondary of a very loosely coupled transformer, the primary being the summation of all current carrying conductors nearby. Transformer <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> the induced voltage in the loop, and the weak coupling limits the maximum current that will flow, even if the loop resistance is very low. The maximum induced energy is normally quite small, and except in situations very close to a radiating loop carrying high current, there is no prospect of inducing sufficient energy to cause a hazard to humans.|$|E

40|$|A {{state space}} process control model {{involving}} deterministic drift {{of the process}} mean and adjustment error is presented. A Kalman filter estimator of the process mean is developed. Optimal adjustment strategies based on this Kalman filter estimator are developed by the technique of dynamic programming for two special cases of the model and for the general model. The optimal policy in the general case calls for an adjustment to the process when the estimate of the process mean is outside an interval bounded by lower and upper <b>action</b> <b>limits.</b> The <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> depend on the variability associated with the Kalman estimator. The optimal adjustment consists of compensation for the currently perceived misadjustment of the process mean and the anticipated drift, and possibly, depending {{on the cost of}} adjustment {{and the size of the}} drift, a small over-compensation to anticipate future drift. Computational methods for approximating the <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> and over-compensation constants are presented. The effects of parameter values on these limits and constants are described...|$|E

40|$|Background: Many {{bacteria}} {{of clinical}} importance survive and may grow in different environments. Antibiotic pollution may exert on them a selective pressure {{leading to an}} increase in the prevalence of resistance. Objectives: In this study we sought to determine whether environmental concentrations of antibiotics and concentrations representing <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> used in environmental risk assessment may exert a selective pressure on clinically relevant bacteria in the environment. Methods: We used bacterial inhibition as an assessment end point to link antibiotic selective pressures to the prevalence of resistance in bacterial populations. Species sensitivity distributions were derived for three antibiotics by fitting log-logistic models to end points calculated from minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions based on worldwide data collated by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). To place bacteria represented in these distributions in a broader context, we performed a brief phylogenetic analysis. The potentially affected fraction of bacterial genera at measured environmental concentrations of antibiotics and environmental risk assessment <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> was used as a proxy for antibiotic selective pressure. Measured environmental concentrations and environmental risk assessment <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> were also directly compared to wild-type cut-off values. Results: The potentially affected fraction of bacterial genera estimated based on antibiotic concentrations measured in water environments is ≤ 7 %. We estimated that measured environmental concentrations in river sediments, swine feces lagoons, liquid manure, and farmed soil inhibit wild-type populations in up to 60 %, 92 %, 100 %, and 30 % of bacterial genera, respectively. At concentrations used as <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> in environmental risk assessment, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin were estimated to inhibit wild-type populations in up to 25 % and 76 % of bacterial genera. Conclusions: Measured environmental concentrations of antibiotics, as well as concentrations representing environmental risk assessment <b>action</b> <b>limits,</b> are high enough to exert a selective pressure on clinically relevant bacteria that may lead {{to an increase in}} the prevalence of resistance...|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between serum cholesterol concentrations and {{the incidence of}} coronary heart disease is continuous and curvilinear; there is neither epidemiological nor biological {{evidence to support the}} existence of a threshold value. There is a clinical need, however, for an acceptable definition of <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> and desirable ranges, based on the evidence that raised cholesterol concentrations are causally related to atherosclerotic heart disease. The European Atherosclerosis Society has proposed a set of cut off points, which, together with age and the presence of other risk factors, direct the clinician to an appropriate level of treatment. Because the changes of serum cholesterol during adult life appear unphysiological, these <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> do not require adjustment for age.

40|$|The idea {{of varying}} the chart {{parameters}} has been explored extensively in recent years. Basically, the value establishes if the control should be relaxed or not.

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} technical justification for choosing and using propane as a calibration standard for estimating total flammable {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) in an air matrix. A propane-in-nitrogen standard was selected based {{on a number of}} criteria: (1) has an analytical response similar to the VOCs of interest, (2) can be made with known accuracy and traceability, (3) is available with good purity, (4) has a matrix similar to the sample matrix, (5) is stable during storage and use, (6) is relatively non-hazardous, and (7) is a recognized standard for similar analytical applications. The Waste Retrieval Project (WRP) desires a fast, reliable, and inexpensive method for screening the flammable VOC content in the vapor-phase headspace of waste containers. Table 1 lists the flammable VOCs of interest to the WRP. The current method used to determine the VOC content of a container is to sample the container's headspace and submit the sample for gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The driver for the VOC measurement requirement is safety: potentially flammable atmospheres in the waste containers must be allowed to diffuse prior to processing the container. The proposed flammable VOC screening method is to inject an aliquot of the headspace sample into an argon-doped pulsed-discharge helium ionization detector (Ar-PDHID) contained within a gas chromatograph. No actual chromatography is performed; the sample is transferred directly from a sample loop to the detector through a short, inert transfer line. The peak area resulting from the injected sample is proportional to the flammable VOC content of the sample. However, because the Ar-PDHID has different response factors for different flammable VOCs, a fundamental assumption must be made that the agent used to calibrate the detector is representative of the flammable VOCs of interest that may be in the headspace samples. At worst, we desire that calibration with the selected calibrating agent overestimate the value of the VOCs in a sample. By overestimating the VOC content of a sample, we want to minimize false negatives. A false negative is defined as incorrectly estimating the VOC content of the sample to be below programmatic <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> when, in fact, the sample,exceeds the <b>action</b> <b>limits.</b> The disadvantage of overestimating the flammable VOC content of a sample is that additional cost may be incurred because additional sampling and GC-MS analysis may be required to confirm results over programmatic <b>action</b> <b>limits.</b> Therefore, choosing an appropriate calibration standard for the Ar-PDHID is critical to avoid false negatives and to minimize additional analytical costs...|$|E
