5|$|In 1973, a {{biochemical}} polymorphism {{study was}} conducted in four sample areas of the species. Electrophoretically demonstrable variation was found in one or more populations at 15 of 39 (38%) of the loci examined, and two and sometimes three alleles per locus were detected. At the least, the findings give an indication of the kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> was similar to findings in examinations of Peromyscus polionotus, Sigmodon, and Dipodomys.|$|E
5|$|These {{outcomes}} of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs {{at or above}} the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in gene frequency and adaptation. In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one—the difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{developmental}} buffering processes has been debated extensively, based on both theoretical reasoning and empirical studies. In particular, controversy {{has focused on}} the question of whether distinct processes are responsible for canalization, the buffering against environmental or genetic variation, and for developmental stability, the buffering against random variation intrinsic in developmental processes. Here, we address this question for the size and shape of Drosophila melanogaster wings in an experimental design with extensively replicated and fully controlled genotypes. The <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> among individuals and of fluctuating asymmetry differ markedly among genotypes, demonstrating a clear genetic basis for size and shape variability. For wing shape, there is a high correlation between the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry, which indicates a correspondence between the two types of buffering. Likewise, the multivariate patterns <b>of</b> shape <b>variation</b> among individuals and of fluctuating asymmetry show a close association. For wing size, however, the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>variation</b> and fluctuating asymmetry are not correlated. There was a significant link between the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> between wing size and shape, more so for fluctuating asymmetry than for variation among individuals. Overall, these experiments indicate a considerable degree of shared control <b>of</b> individual <b>variation</b> and fluctuating asymmetry, although it appears to differ between traits...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{have applied}} the PCA method to the AQDs for {{investigating}} normal and abnormal variations. This method is variance oriented {{and the first}} principal component is the linear combination of the variables that explains the greatest <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations.</b> The second principal component defines the next largest <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> and is independent to the first principal component. According to Rajaram (1985), the major advantages of PCA as applied to geomagnetic field variations are the following: (a) The eigenvectors are derived directly from the input data, (b) maximum variance of the data is contained {{in the first few}} principal components, (c) different components generally correspond to different spatio-temporal characteristics of the source field, and (d) one can simultaneously look at both the space and time characteristics of the input data. Using this technique, Rajaram (1980, 1983) (for more details, see references therein) studied the common and anomalous features <b>of</b> equatorial geomagnetic <b>variations</b> and also determined the latitude of the Sq focus.|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} corporate governance and capital structure on companies’ performance using a comprehensive sample from 181 non-financial and non-utilities companies listed in the UK during the period 2004 - 2012. Three panel data linear regression models {{have been used to}} explore the relationships between corporate governance, capital structure and firm performance. Firm performance is measured in terms of Tobin’s Q. Corporate governance variables identified as probably explaining a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> in company’s performance include CEO Duality, board size, independent board members and highest remuneration package. Capital structure variables identified as probably explaining a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> in company’s performance include leverage, growth, firm size and profitability. Results from this study shows corporate governance has an influence on firm performance, but is not the only factor.

25|$|Proposition 13 {{sets the}} {{assessed}} value of properties {{at the time}} of purchase (known as an acquisition value system), with a possible 2% annual assessment increase.

25|$|The {{relative}} {{youth of}} this field {{means there is}} still much progress to be made in characterizing all modifications to the transcriptome and elucidating their mechanisms of action. Once these questions are answered and biologists have a better sense of the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> in RNA modification, the focus will turn to each modification’s biological function. This has already been investigated in a select few proteins such as adenosine deaminase, which acts on RNA (ADAR). ADAR has been shown to affect antibody production and the innate immune system as well as transcripts encoding important receptors for the central nervous system. This plurality in function has caused some scientists to speculate that the epitransciptome may be even more expansive than the better defined epigenome.|$|E
25|$|Education at Râmnic {{evolved as}} follows from the 16th to the early 19th century. During the 16th century, there was a bishop's school for cantors, with musical texts in Old Church Slavonic. It also trained copyists, grammarians and logothetes, who learned {{to read and write}} in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet. In the 17th century, the bishop's school taught reading and writing in Slavonic; arithmetic, {{geometry}} and the basics of chronology and administration; and church music in Slavonic. In the 18th century, there was a Romanian school founded by Bishop Anthim (1705-1708). This was free, training priests, cantors and grammarians from the diocese and from Transylvania. After a break, it resumed in 1719, following the start of Austrian occupation over the region, under Bishop Damaschin (1708-1725). In 1726, a textbook of his, including prayers, liturgical texts and church music, was printed posthumously, followed in 1749 under Bishop Grigorie Socoteanu by a spelling book. The latter's well-developed structure was emulated in later editions at Iași, Vienna, Blaj, Sibiu, Buda and Cernăuți. From 1741 to 1755, there was a Slavonic school, established to counter Greek influence in the church. This was absorbed into the Romanian and Greek school, begun in 1746. Several of this school's graduates, such as Naum Râmniceanu, were authors during the premodern period of Romanian literature. Finally, during the 19th century (1800-1831), there was a Romanian school characterized by a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> in curriculum and teachers' pay, unsurprising given the transitions of the period.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{and discusses}} a new methodology {{for measuring the}} variation between linguistic varieties.

500|$|Lettuce is {{very easy}} to grow, and as such has been a {{significant}} source of sales for many seed companies. Tracing the history of many varieties is complicated by the practice of many companies, particularly in the US, of changing a variety's name from year to year. This was done for several reasons, the most prominent being to boost sales by promoting a [...] "new" [...] variety or to prevent customers from knowing that the variety had been developed by a competing seed company. Documentation from the late 19th century shows between 65 and 140 distinct varieties of lettuce, depending on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> allowed between types– a distinct difference from the 1,100 named lettuce varieties on the market at the time. Names also often changed significantly from country to country.
