25|$|I {{was born}} Jewish and so I remain, {{even if that}} is {{unacceptable}} for many. For me, the vocation of Israel is bringing light to the goyim. That is my hope <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Christianity is the means for achieving it.|$|E
25|$|To put {{artifacts}} {{in their proper}} context I consider it most important {{to pay attention to}} the chronological sequence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the old idea of first stone, then copper, and finally iron, appears to be ever more firmly established as far as Scandinavia is concerned.|$|E

25|$|I am {{neither a}} prophet, nor {{the son of}} a prophet, yet I will venture to predict that in five years we shall make the journey hence to Quebec and Montreal, and home through Portland and St. John, by rail; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> many in this room will live to hear the whistle of the steam engine in the passes of the Rocky Mountains, and to make the journey from Halifax to the Pacific in five or six days.|$|E
25|$|I {{have the}} {{greatest}} consideration for the goals which are pursued by the physicists of the latest generation which go {{under the name of}} quantum mechanics, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this theory represents a profound level of truth, but I also believe that the restriction to laws of a statistical nature {{will turn out to be}} transitory....Without doubt quantum mechanics has grasped an important fragment of the truth and will be a paragon for all future fundamental theories, for the fact that it must be deducible as a limiting case from such foundations, just as electrostatics is deducible from Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic field or as thermodynamics is deducible from statistical mechanics.|$|E
25|$|I {{must tell}} you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E

Trouble with you fellows is, you're always scared of {{anything}} that's new. Too--heavy! Huh! Always wanted to see a Gomez--never have, except in pictures. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that's</b> a New York license. Let me at it!" ...|$|R
60|$|Never for {{a moment}} did I {{lose sight of the}} fact that it was {{necessary}} I have my wits about me in case I counted on keeping my hair, for many a scalp had been taken in that vicinity within the six months just passed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> nothing larger than a squirrel could come within striking distance, save by my own knowledge and consent.|$|R

The second time--and not very long after--I saw him well dressed, lounging like any other young man on a Sunday afternoon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> he took the liberty of bowing to me then because I had once looked at him under a misapprehension." ...|$|R

500|$|In the Time interview, Cada {{expressed}} {{his thoughts on}} legislation related to the legality of gambling: [...] "I support the right to play poker online. Poker isn't gambling. It's a hobby, an activity, a game. It's not about luck—it's about logic, decision-making, math. We all {{should be able to}} play poker on the Web if we want to, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> making it illegal strips us of our rights. This is an important issue, and hopefully we'll see it resolved soon." [...] Outside of poker, Cada also plays indoor soccer. , he was considering purchasing a second home in Las Vegas, Nevada and possibly opening a bar.|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{long career}} as a teacher {{influenced}} generations of English composers and performers. Tippett was never a formal pupil, but has acknowledged a deep debt to Bush. [...] Herbert Murrill, a pupil of Bush's at the RAM in the 1920s, [...] wrote in 1950 of his tutor: [...] "here is humility in his makeup, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> no man can achieve greatness in the arts without humility ... To Alan Bush I owe much, not least the artistic strength and right to differ from him". Among postwar Bush students who later led distinguished careers are the composers Edward Gregson, Roger Steptoe and Michael Nyman, and the pianists John Bingham and Graham Johnson. [...] Through his sponsorship of the London String Quartet Bush helped launch the careers of string players such as Norbert Brainin and Emanuel Hurwitz, both of whom later achieved international recognition.|$|E

500|$|Northumberland rode {{through the}} City of London to the Tower on 25 July, with his guards {{struggling}} {{to protect him}} against the hostile populace. A pamphlet appearing shortly after his arrest illustrated the general hatred of him: [...] "the great devil Dudley ruleth, Duke I should have said". He was now commonly thought to have poisoned King Edward while Mary [...] "would have been as glad of her brother's life, as the ragged bear is glad of his death". Dumbfounded {{by the turn of}} events, the French ambassador Noailles wrote: [...] "I have witnessed the most sudden change believable in men, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> God alone worked it."

500|$|She met a young poet, Nikolay Gumilev, on Christmas Eve in 1903. Gumilev, {{encouraged}} her to write and pursued her intensely, making numerous marriage proposals starting in 1905. At 17 years old, in his journal Sirius, she published her first poem which could be translated as [...] "On his hand you may see many glittering rings", (1907) signing it [...] "Anna G." [...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for three years now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it is my fate to be his wife. Whether or not I love him, I do not know, {{but it seems to}} me that I do.” [...] She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova’s family attended the wedding. The couple honeymooned in Paris, and there she met and befriended the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.|$|E

[...] Grey's Anatomy is about Meredith's journey. Men and romantic interests {{are a part of}} her life, but they are not the priority. She doesn't need McDreamy. Grey's Anatomy doesn't need McDreamy. So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey (Martin Henderson, perhaps?), it wouldn't matter. I have faith that the show's writers will do this storyline justice, because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate." [...] The site added, [...] "This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey's Anatomy. When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research, Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career. She didn't chase him. Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this won't change after Derek's death." ...|$|E
60|$|That tough old lion {{went away}} from there {{a good deal}} tamed and civilizednot to say {{softened}} and sweetened, for perhaps those expressions would hardly fit him.

500|$|Motivated {{by her own}} {{battle to}} gain {{credibility}} as {{a woman in a}} field dominated by male astronomers, [...] Rubin encouraged girls interested in investigating the universe to pursue their dreams. She faced discouraging comments on her choice of study throughout her life, but persevered, supported by family and colleagues. In addition to astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of women in the sciences and for scientific literacy. She and Burbidge advocated together for more women in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on review panels, and in academic searches. She said that despite her struggles with the NAS, she continued to be dissatisfied with the number of women who are elected each year, and called it [...] "the saddest part of [...] life". Rubin was Jewish, and saw no conflict between science and religion. In an interview, she stated: [...] "In my own life, my science and my religion are separate. I'm Jewish, and so religion to me is a kind of moral code and a kind of history. I try to do my science in a moral way, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> ideally, science should be looked upon as something that helps us understand our role in the universe." ...|$|E
