5|$|The men torment the {{bound and}} gagged Sally while Leatherface, now {{dressed as a}} woman, serves dinner. Leatherface and the {{hitchhiker}} bring down Grandpa (John Dugan), one of the desiccated bodies from upstairs. He is revealed to be alive when he sucks blood from a cut on Sally's finger. They decide that Grandpa, the best killer in the old slaughterhouse, should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer but is too weak. In the ensuing confusion, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and flees to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing truck. Armed with his chainsaw, Leatherface attacks the truck when the driver stops to help; the driver knocks down Leatherface with <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> causing the chainsaw to cut his leg. The driver flees, and Sally escapes {{in the back of}} a passing pickup truck as Leatherface dances maniacally in the road with his chainsaw.|$|E

50|$|An {{eccentric}} {{toothed gear}} {{is mounted on}} a hexagonal shaft. The wrench is introduced inside the <b>pipe</b> (especially <b>a</b> close nipple, which has threading its entire length, and therefore no surface for an outside wrench). As the wrench is turned, the eccentric gear is forced to grip {{the inside of the}} <b>pipe.</b> <b>As</b> with <b>a</b> regular <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> the mechanism is such that the grip on the pipe increases with the torque applied on the wrench.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with <b>a</b> large <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b> The racers smash the looking glass with the <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|R
5000|$|On February 4, 2007, during Super Bowl XLI, Snickers {{commercials}} aired {{which resulted}} in complaints by gay and lesbian groups against the maker of the candy bar, Masterfoods USA of Hackettstown, New Jersey, a division of Mars, Incorporated. The commercial showed a pair of auto mechanics accidentally touching lips while sharing a Snickers bar. After quickly pulling away, one mechanic says, [...] "I think we just accidentally kissed.", and another mechanic exclaims, [...] "Quick! Do something manly!" [...] and {{in three of the}} four versions, they do so mostly in the form of injury, including tearing out chest hair, striking each other with <b>a</b> very large <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> and drinking motor oil and windshield washer fluid.

50|$|A {{threaded}} pipe has a screw thread at {{one or both}} ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered threads are cut into {{the end of the}} pipe, sealant is applied in the form of thread-sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape) and the pipe is threaded into a threaded fitting with <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{the handle}} of <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> box wrench or ratchet is {{inserted}} into a cheater bar, the additional distance {{makes it possible to}} generate the required torque with the same amount of force being applied. However, the work done is the same with or without the cheater bar because the torque and angle of rotation needed to accomplish a particular task does not change.|$|E
50|$|A plumber wrench (or plumber's wrench) is <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> used {{to rotate}} {{plumbing}} pipes. It is adjusted to different pipe diameters by rotating the key ring (silver in the picture). Its {{advantage is that}} it grips with significant force without needing to engage a nut. However, if used carelessly, it can dent or break the pipe. It {{can also be used}} on nuts and other flat engagement points.|$|E
50|$|The zipper {{is often}} the least durable {{component}} in any garment or type of equipment. Most often the zipper fails to close due to a worn or bent slider {{not being able to}} apply the necessary force to the sides of the teeth to cause them to interlock. This problem can sometimes be redressed by using <b>a</b> small <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> or similar pliers to carefully squeeze the back part of the slider together a fraction of a millimeter. This can compensate for the wear of the slider. The slider is typically made as a magnesium diecast which breaks easily. It is necessary to reduce the force on the pliers before it can be felt that the slider actually gives in. If it is not yet possible to successfully close the zipper, the pressure applied to the slider should only gradually be increased. Another way to reduce the gap of the open end of the slider is by preparing a small block of wood by sawing a slot into one end so that it fits over the upper arm of the slider. Then a hammer can be used to exact a force onto the slider by carefully hitting the wood.|$|R

5000|$|Ricci was {{tortured}} to death, {{with some}} of his fingers having been removed and put inside bodily orifices. Pieces of his face were cut, his tongue was removed, and his penis was put into his mouth, which caused him to die of asphyxiation, according to the post-mortem. De Negri also pierced one of Ricci's eyes with the cut fingers, smashed his teeth and head with <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> and [...] "washed" [...] his brain with dog shampoo.|$|E

25|$|The <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> or Stillson wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface.

They brought Shea down a hill behind the ranch and stabbed and brutally tortured him to death. Bruce Davis recalled at his parole hearings: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{length of}} the nipple is usually {{specified}} by the overall length with threads. It may have a hexagonal section in the center for wrench to grasp (sometimes {{referred to as a}} [...] "hex nipple"), or it may simply be made from a short piece of pipe (sometimes referred to as a [...] "barrel nipple" [...] or [...] "pipe nipple"). A [...] "close nipple" [...] has no unthreaded area; when screwed tightly between two female fittings, very little of the nipple remains exposed. A close nipple can only be unscrewed by gripping one threaded end with <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> which will damage the threads and necessitate replacing the nipple, or by using a specialty tool known as a nipple wrench (or known as an internal pipe wrench) which grips the inside of the pipe, leaving the threads undamaged. When the ends are of two different sizes it is called a reducer or unequal nipple.|$|E
50|$|Robin reveals he {{was once}} a bank robber and offers to partner with Luke in hitting several local banks.

50|$|On 17 August 1888 the Swedish {{inventor}} Johan Petter Johansson (1853-1943) {{took his}} first patent on the adjustable <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b> The Swedish Patent Office issued the patent (SE 5636) again in 1894. The idea emerged after he established his company Enköpings Mekaniska Verkstad. Back then there was no standard on nut dimensions so each time a trades man was out on a job, he needed a trolley to take {{a whole set of}} fixed <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches</b> with him. Johan Petter Johansson invented a tool that could grip nuts of different dimensions.|$|R
5000|$|The plumber wrench {{was invented}} in the year 1888 by Swedish {{inventor}} Johan Petter Johansson. His wrench shares some principles with both the Stillson-pattern <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> and the rigid <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b> Nevertheless, it is a decidedly different and improved tool. It allows plumbers to use the wrench rather than a pair of tongs to separate or join pipes. It is not widely known in North America. It is common in Europe, where it may be called a [...] "pipe wrench", [...] "Swedish wrench", or [...] "Swedish pattern wrench".|$|R
