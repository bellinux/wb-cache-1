5|$|Wilkes wrote a History of Oregon, Geographical and Political in 1845, {{which was}} inaccurate. Notwithstanding this, an extract {{from the work}} was {{published}} as Project for a National Railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, also in 1845. It was popular and was in its fourth edition by 1847. In 1848 and 1849, Wilkes wrote a novel, loosely based on the life and murder of Helen Jewett, a New York prostitute. The novel was first serialized in the National Police Gazette before being published as a stand-alone work in 1849, titled The Lives of Helen Jewett and Richard P. Robinson. The novel was only based on Jewett's life and death, with much embellishment. It combined {{the facts of the}} case with elements from contemporary novels of murder mysteries and seduction in the growing cities of the time. Wilkes did have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of Jewett's letters, which had been held by the district attorney's office since Jewett's murder in 1836 and the subsequent trial. Wilkes, who obtained the letters in 1848, also acquired the hatchet which had murdered Jewett. The letters were eventually published in the Police Gazette and even were displayed, along with the murder weapon, in the newspaper's office window.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{appropriate}} technology {{was developed in}} the 20th century by thinkers such as E. F.

25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Tanzania has been characterised by decreasing access to improved water {{sources in the}} 2000s (especially in urban areas), steady <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> form of sanitation (around 93 percent since the 1990s), intermittent water supplies, and generally low quality of service. Many utilities are barely able to cover their {{operation and maintenance costs}} through revenues because of low tariffs and poor efficiency. There are significant regional differences, with the best performing utilities being Arusha, Moshi, and Tanga.|$|E

Walking through the city you will find vendors selling hot coffee, chocolate, soup and pancakes from cargo bikes with gas stoves installed, cooled sushi and cocktails or pedal blended smoothies. As with the cycle taxis, there are now so many vendors that the city has started to limit their <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> parts of the city, where they, along with the bicycle taxis, have created access problems for pedestrians.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, while Sweden was {{deciding}} on its stance toward nuclear weapons, Swedish representatives, through their {{contacts with the}} American Department of Defense gained <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> secret information in the late 1960s. This information included nuclear weapons tactics, reconnaissance requirements, ideas regarding the necessity of quick decision-making, and nuclear physics data. Swedish representatives also looked at the MGR-1 Honest John weapons system that could utilize W7 or W31 nuclear warheads. For artillery purposes, the US developed a W48 projectile for 155mm artillery with 0.072 kiloton effect. Any plans for such a small Swedish nuclear device have never been recovered.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Vienna {{group also}} {{demonstrated}} the wave nature of tetraphenylporphyrinâ€”a flat biodye with {{an extension of}} about 2nm and a mass of 614u. For this demonstration they employed a near-field Talbot Lau interferometer. In the same interferometer they also found interference fringes for C60F48., a fluorinated buckyball with a mass of about 1600 u, composed of 108 atoms. Large molecules are already so complex that they give experimental <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> aspects of the quantum-classical interface, i.e., to certain decoherence mechanisms. In 2011, the interference of molecules as heavy as 6910u could be demonstrated in a Kapitzaâ€“Diracâ€“Talbotâ€“Lau interferometer. In 2013, the interference of molecules beyond 10,000u has been demonstrated.|$|E

25|$|Pre-production {{planning}} {{began in}} January 1941, {{and once the}} generous $1.7 million budget was established, a tight schedule of two months was determined for principal photography on location. Although the U.S. Navy had agreed to cooperate, providing over 1,000 officers and enlisted men along with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of its most highly secured facilities, world events had dictated a full war-readiness, which placed additional pressures on the film cast and crew. With all naval air and sea forces committed to training and war exercises, Curtiz was notified in advance {{so that he could}} take advantage of the ongoing activities and set up his camera crews accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Through this program, Sweden {{was able}} to obtain {{materials}} from America both faster and cheaper than had it relied on internal production. However, such access required comprehensive assurances that the materials were used only for civil purposes. On July 1, 1955, the first agreement was signed between Sweden and the United States regarding nuclear material. A second agreement on cooperation in civil nuclear research was signed on January 18, 1956. As a result, Sweden got <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> previously classified materials, {{and the opportunity to}} import small amounts of enriched uranium and heavy water at prices lower than those from Norway. The agreement required guarantees that the materials would not be used for the production of nuclear weapons or for any other military purposes.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s The Weather Channel (TWC) and A.M. Weather {{were popular}} with chasers, {{in the morning}} {{preceding}} a chase for the latter and both before and during a chase for the former. Commercial radio sometimes also provides weather and damage information. The 1990s brought technological leaps and bounds. With the swift development of solid state technology, television sets for example could be installed with ease in most vehicles allowing storm chasers to actively view local TV stations. Mobile phones became popular making group coordination easier when traditional radio communications methods were not ideal or for those possessing radios. The development of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1993 hastened adoption of the Internet and led to FTP <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of the first university weather sites.|$|E
