50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{conversion}} of Hanover's main roads into the Cityring in the 1950s, the Aegidientorplatz was made significantly more spacious. Beginning in September 1968, a raised roadway was built above the square as part of the inner city ring, despite five construction stoppages to allow the construction of the Stadtbahn Hannover. It was opened to traffic on 1 November 1968. This street, usually known as Aegi High Street or Aegi Bridge, was originally intended as a temporary measure, but remained in use until it was demolished on the 17 and 18 October 1998. The Aegi-High Street often had to be closed in winter due to ice build up, was only <b>authorised</b> for cars <b>weighing</b> under 3.5 tonnes, and limited to a top speed of 30 km/h.|$|R

5000|$|Narahari Sonar {{composed}} Marathi devotional poetry called abhanga. He {{speaks the}} ephemeral and unreal world, which like {{a picture on}} the wall. Just as children build stone houses and then abandon them, people engage in world affairs and then die. In another abhanga, he speaks {{about the importance of}} a guru. Just like an elephant is controlled by a ankusha (goad) and a tiger by a cage, Narahari is brought under control by the grace of his guru Gaibinatha. He talks about an [...] "unstruck sound" [...] has mesmerized his mind. By this sound, he thinks of God and mediates upon Him. Narahari says by his own experience that this sound will fill one with true love of God and lead to Him. Narahari also refers to his profession as a goldsmith in an abhanga. He calls himself a goldsmith who deals in the name of God. Narahari's body is the melting vessel for his soul of gold. [...] "In the matrix of three gunas, he pours the juice of God". He hammers out anger and passion from the soul. With scissors of discernment, he cuts the gold leaf of the name of God. He <b>weighs</b> the <b>name</b> of God with a balance of spiritual enlightenment. Narahari Sonar, the devotee of God, mediates upon Him eternally.|$|R

5000|$|Born in Ruyang (汝陽), Ru'nan (汝南) commandery (near modern Shangshui, Henan province) to a gentry family, Yuan An {{inherited}} {{knowledge in}} the Book of Changes from his grandfather Yuan Liang (袁良), who had reached the position of magistrate around 25. With this learning, Yuan An established a reputation for himself in his native commandery.

[...] She also pointed out that [...] "Aashiq Abu seems to have borrowed heavily from Quentin Tarantino for the titling, segmenting and visual effects, but hasn’t quite managed to get right the punch that characterises the master filmmaker’s movies." [...] Veeyen of Nowrunning.com rated the film 2.5/5 and said, [...] "'Idukki Gold' does disseminate a heavy scent that enthralls you, and yet which is never intoxicating enough to leave you blissfully smashed." [...] Sify.com's reviewer gave the verdict as [...] "average" [...] and wrote, [...] "We are ready to accept a movie without a conventional or a hard-hitting storyline, if it is entertaining. But the film never really succeeds beyond a point in that way and Aashiq Abu tries his best by packaging the whole film deliciously." ...|$|R
