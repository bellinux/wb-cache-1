The <b>air</b> <b>piping</b> would normally be run {{in such a way}} that there were natural low points where water condensing out of the air would collect and could be removed. On APT these runs were tortuous, and resulted in numerous points where the water would collect, and in cold weather, freeze.

40|$|At the Jülich Solar Power Tower, two new {{shut-off}} dampers {{have been}} {{installed in the}} hot <b>air</b> <b>piping</b> system {{in order to reduce}} thermal losses during downtime of the plant. The thermodynamic behavior of the thermal energy storage and the steam boiler has been investigated with respect to heat losses after shut-down of the plant. Also, the change of temperature and the pressure drop at both shut-off dampers during downtime has been analyzed. Results show that for the storage, a reduction of thermal losses can be achieved by closing the damper overnight. Regarding the steam boiler, no improvements on heat losses were observed. If only two of the four storage chambers have been charged during operation, heat transfer between the chambers is observed after shut-down. It is concluded that natural convection is not the main source of thermal overnight losses, however, it can be lowered thanks to the dampers. Heat conduction and convectional heat transfer at the surfaces also contribute to the decrease of thermal energy, which can be lowered by thicker insulation layers in the future...|$|E

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center {{supports}} short takeoff {{and vertical}} landing (STOVL) tests in its 9 - by 15 -Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel (9 x 15 LSWT). As {{part of a}} facility capability upgrade, a dynamic actuation system (DAS) was fabricated to enhance the STOVL testing capabilities. The DAS serves as the mechanical interface between the 9 x 15 LSWT test section structure and the STOVL model to be tested. It provides vertical and horizontal translation of the model in the test section and maintains the model attitude (pitch, yaw, and roll) during translation. It also integrates a piping system to supply the model with exhaust and hot air to simulate the inlet suction and nozzle exhausts, respectively. Hot gas ingestion studies have been performed with the facility ground plane installed. The DAS provides vertical (ascent and descent) translation speeds of up to 48 in. /s and horizontal translation speeds of up to 12 in. /s. Model pitch variations of +/- 7, roll variations of +/- 5, and yaw variations of 0 to 180 deg can be accommodated and are maintained within 0. 25 deg throughout the translation profile. The hot air supply, generated by the facility heaters and regulated by control valves, provides three separate temperature zones to the model for STOVL and hot gas ingestion testing. Channels along the supertube provide instrumentation paths from the model to the facility data system for data collection purposes. The DAS {{is supported by the}} 9 x 15 LSWT test section ceiling structure. A carriage that rides on two linear rails provides for horizontal translation of the system along the test section longitudinal axis. A vertical translation assembly, consisting of a cage and supertube, is secured to the carriage. The supertube traverses vertically through the cage on a set of linear rails. Both translation axes are hydraulically actuated and provide position and velocity profile control. The lower flange on the supertube serves as the model interface to the DAS. The supertube also serves as the exhaust path to the model and supports the hot <b>air</b> <b>piping</b> on its external surfaces. The DAS is currently being assembled at the 9 15 LSWT facility. Following assembly and installation, a series of checkouts will be performed to confirm the operation of the system...|$|E

This method substantially improves the collector efficiency by increasing the fluid velocity and enhancing the heat-transfer coefficient between the absorber plate and air.

5000|$|When {{one or more}} of the {{automatic}} sprinkler heads is triggered, it opens allowing the <b>air</b> in the <b>piping</b> to vent from that sprinkler. Each sprinkler operates independently, as its temperature rises above its triggering threshold. As the air pressure in the piping drops, the pressure differential across the dry pipe valve changes, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flow from sprinklers, needed to control the fire, is delayed until the air is vented from the sprinklers. In regions using NFPA 13 regulations, the time it takes water to reach the hydraulically remote sprinkler from the time that sprinkler is activated is limited to a maximum of 60 seconds. In industry practice, this is known as the [...] "Maximum Time of Water Delivery". The maximum time of water delivery may be required to be reduced, depending on the hazard classification of the area protected by the sprinkler system.|$|R

However, in 14 of the installations, it was observed that either the hot water flow meter or the chilled water flow meter was located so close to a bend, valve, or other obstruction in the line that substantial errors in the flow (and Btu) readings are likely. In five of the buildings, both the hot water and chilled water flow meters were located too close to obstructions. Only 10 buildings had both flow meters placed properly. Temperature sensors were generally placed properly, although {{it was not possible to}} locate five (of 58) sensors to verify proper placement, and two others were located in the <b>air</b> handler <b>piping</b> rather than in the main building chilled and hot water lines.

5000|$|Increased {{corrosion}} potential - Following operation or testing, dry-pipe sprinkler system piping is drained, but residual water collects in piping low spots, and moisture is also {{retained in the}} atmosphere within the piping. This moisture, coupled with the oxygen available in the compressed <b>air</b> in the <b>piping,</b> increases internal pipe corrosion, eventually leading to pin-hole leaks or other piping failures. The internal corrosion rate in wet pipe systems (in which the piping is constantly full of water) is much lower, {{as the amount of}} oxygen available for the corrosion process is lower. Corrosion can be combated by using copper or stainless steel pipe which is less susceptible to corrosion, or by using dry nitrogen gas to pressurize the system, rather than air. Nitrogen generators {{can be used as a}} permanent source of nitrogen gas, which is beneficial because dry pipe sprinkler systems require an uninterrupted supply of supervisory gas.

40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) to cool down the reactor core {{in case of an}} accident. Occasionally, air is entrained into the suction piping of ECCS causing voids that {{decrease}} pumping efficiency, and consequently damage the pumps. In an attempt to minimize the amount of voids entering the suction side of the pump in ECCS, a Void Recirculation System (VRS) experiment was conducted for a proof of concept purpose. While many studies have been oriented in studying two-component flow behavior in ECCS, none of them propose a solution to minimize air entrainment. As a consequence, there are no simulation models that use computational fluid dynamics to address gas entrainment solutions in ECCS. The objectives of this thesis are to (1) simulate and investigate two-component air-water flow in a VRS that minimizes the amount of <b>air</b> in <b>piping</b> systems, using RELAP 5 /MOD 3 as the computational tool, and (2) to validate the numerical results with respect to experimental results and observations. A one-dimensional model of the VRS was built in RELAP 5, in which eight different scenarios (replicating those from the VRS experiment) were simulated for a period of 150 seconds. Four Froude numbers of 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 3 and 1. 6 were evaluated in two different pipe configurations, and the experimental data obtained from the VRS experiment was used to validate the numerical results obtained from these simulations. It was concluded that air recirculation occurs indefinitely throughout the entire 150 seconds of the simulation for Froude numbers up to 1. 3; while for a Froude number of 1. 6, air recirculation occurs for approximately 100 seconds and ceases after 125 seconds of the simulation.
