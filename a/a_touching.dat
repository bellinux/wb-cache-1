5|$|It's <b>a</b> <b>touching,</b> believable, often funny but {{ultimately}} sad tale {{of how one}} class {{can take advantage of}} another, even in the guise of patronizing benevolence. Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and color, from the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor background to the stately rituals and autocratic entitlement of the well-to-do.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{composer}} Francesco Cavalli {{wrote the}} opera, L'Orione in 1653. The story {{is set on}} the Greek island of Delos and focuses on Diana's love for Orion {{as well as on}} her rival, Aurora. Diana shoots Orion only after being tricked by Apollo into thinking him a sea monster—she then laments his death and searches for Orion in the underworld until he is elevated to the heavens. Johann Christian Bach ('the English Bach') wrote an opera, Orion, or Diana Reveng'd, first presented at London's Haymarket Theatre in 1763. Orion, sung by a castrato, is in love with Candiope, the daughter of Oenopion, King of Arcadia but his arrogance has offended Diana. Diana's oracle forbids him to marry Candiope and foretells his glory and death. He bids <b>a</b> <b>touching</b> farewell to Candiope and marches off to his destiny. Diana allows him his victory and then kills him, offstage, with her arrow. In another aria, his mother Retrea (Queen of Thebes), laments his death but ultimately sees his elevation to the heavens. The 2002 opera Galileo Galilei by American composer Philip Glass includes an opera within an opera piece between Orion and Merope. The sunlight, which heals Orion's blindness, is an allegory of modern science. Philip Glass has also written a shorter work on Orion, as have Tōru Takemitsu, Kaija Saariaho, and John Casken. David Bedford's late-twentieth-century works are about the constellation rather than the mythical figure; he is an amateur astronomer.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>touch</b> is <b>an</b> inseparable part of {{the mutual}} contact between a nurse and a patient. The more a patient depends on the {{assistance}} of the others in common daily activities, the more a nurse uses physical contact in the care, not only in relation to the professional ortherapeutic acts, but also to the expression of compassion, sympathy, encouragement or calming a patient. Despite the fact that <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> is so important in patient care, it only receives a marginal attention. The goal of the thesis was to examine the reasons for and the obstacles to the application of <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> in nursing care, and if <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> belongs to the present nursing care. Research questions were set to achieve the goals:How do nurses perceive <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> in the present nursing care?How do patients perceive <b>a</b> nurse's <b>touch</b> in the treatment?Three hypotheses were formulated in dependence on the above set goals:H 1 :Nurses perceive <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> more as <b>a</b> {{part of the}} direct (physical) care than a therapeutic intervention. H 2 :Nurses rather use <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> as <b>an</b> unintentional method than as an intentional therapeutic intervention. H 3 :Nurses use <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> rather intuitively, not realizing the risk that <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> can be perceived negatively. The theoretical part of the thesis was elaborated on the base of literature sources. The empiric part was implemented on the base of a qualitative and quantitative research. The data for the qualitative research was gained by means of semi-structured interviews with ten patients. A questionnaire research for general nurses was used for the data collection in the quantitative research. On the base of the results the hypotheses were evaluated as follows:H 1 Nurses perceive <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> more as <b>a</b> part of the direct (physical) care than a therapeutic intervention unconfirmed. H 2 :Nurses rather use <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> as <b>an</b> unintentional method than as an intentional therapeutic intervention unconfirmed. H 3 :Nurses use <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> rather intuitively, not realizing the risk that <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> can be perceived negatively unconfirmed. It is obvious from the results we achieved in the research that <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> has been and will always be an inseparable part of the mutual relation between a nurse and a patient. The research has shown that nurses perceive <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> as <b>a</b> part of the direct care as well as a therapeutic intervention. And if nurses use <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> as <b>a</b> therapeutic intervention, they do it intentionally, mostly to build confidence, to calm a patient, to create the feeling of safety, certainty and understanding. More than a half of the nurses replied that they used <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> instinctively, not realizing that they are touching the patient, on the other hand, more than a half of the nurses replied that they cared about at what points a patient perceived <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> negatively. Although the nurses replied that <b>a</b> therapeutic <b>touch</b> was not time consuming, it is not applied frequently in the therapeutic care. The research has also shown that patients accept <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> within the care and they accept it resignedly. When nurses touch patients, the patients are glad if such <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> is accompanied by words. The interviews revealed that a nurse should not underestimate a handshake at the first contact, as patients perceive this act as a feeling of interest and creation of confidence. The research shows indisputably that <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> is <b>a</b> very important holistic nursing interventionin patient care. It has confirmed that although <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> and its perception is something so intimate, individual and indispensable in nursing care, it only receives a marginal attention. This thesis might serve as study material for numerous nurses, so that <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> is used as an effective intervention by a nurse that perceives a patient as a holistic being and has a sympathy for him/her in his/her uneasy life situation. This thesis might initialize a more extended research combining more research methods. An application of hidden observation for deeper understanding of the use of <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> in nursing care might be particularly interesting...|$|R

In contrast to this, Drum and Ella are more serious about the situation they are in. However, they are constantly supporting each other and provide comfort {{at the end of}} the novel. Ella is a strong leader, yet her respect for her teammates, especially Ninde, grows considerably during the book's events. One interesting literary device are the interludes between the chapters. They add to the book's depth, provide the readers with extra information and sometimes reveal events elsewhere. For instance, when the Sub is attacked by creatures, the interlude is part of the training session for creature attacks. All interludes are taken from Shade's computer archive.|$|E

The difficulties Hillel had to overcome to gain admittance to the school of Sh'maya and Abtalion, and the hardships he suffered while pursuing his aim, are told in <b>a</b> <b>touching</b> passage (Talmud, tractate Yoma 35b), the ultimate purpose of which is to show that poverty cannot be considered an obstacle to the study of Torah. Some time later, Hillel succeeded in settling a question concerning the sacrificial ritual in a manner that showed his superiority over the Benei Betheira (literally, sons of Betheira), who were at that time the heads of the Sanhedrin. On that occasion, it is narrated, they voluntarily resigned their position as Nasi (President) in favor of Hillel. After the resignation of the Benei Betheira, Hillel was recognized as the highest authority among the Pharisees (predecessors to Rabbinic Judaism). Hillel {{was the head of the}} great school, at first associated with Menahem the Essene, who might be the same Menahem the Essene as the one mentioned by Flavius Josephus in relation to King Herod, afterward with Shammai, Hillel's peer in the teaching of Jewish Law.|$|E

25|$|The {{dictionary}} had scarcely {{been completed}} when an opponent to its author arose in Dunash ben Labrat, {{who had come}} to Spain from Fez, Morocco, and who wrote a criticism on the work, which he prefaced by a eulogistic dedication to Hasdai. Dunash roused Menahem's enemies, who began to complain to Hasdai of Menahem's alleged wrongs against them. The slanders of his personal enemies likewise seem to have aroused Hasdai's anger against Menahem to such a pitch that the latter, at the command of the powerful statesman, suffered bodily violence, being cast out of his house on the Sabbath day, shamed, and imprisoned. In <b>a</b> <b>touching,</b> and at some points audacious letter to Hasdai (a valuable source from which most of this information has been taken) Menahem, who probably died shortly afterward, complained of the wrong done him and sharply criticized Hasdai. He seems to have made some impression on his patron. Menahem is said to have written another work in answer to the criticisms of Dunash, of which only an excerpt has survived, quoted by Rabbi Profiat Duran. Menahem's pupils also defended their teacher, and in response to Dunash's criticism wrote a detailed refutation which was marked by polemical acumen and exact grammatical knowledge, today preserved in the ducal library of Parma. Judah ben David Hayyuj, one of these three young scholars who so effectually defended their master, became the founder of scientific Hebrew grammar; another, Isaac ibn Gikatilla, was subsequently, {{as one of the most}} learned men of Lucena, the teacher of Jonah ibn Janah. Thus the most flourishing period of Hebrew philology, whose chief representatives were Hayyuj and ibn Janah, began with Menahem's work and teachings.|$|E
