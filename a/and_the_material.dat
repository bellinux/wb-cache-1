5|$|In March 2015 {{work began}} on a £12m upgrade to the flood defence scheme {{to upgrade the}} {{protection}} {{to cope with a}} 100-year flood. The scheme, which was due to be completed in December 2015, involves creating a flood storage basin {{to the north of the}} Castle Irwell student village. An area of 29 hectares will be excavated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> will be used to construct a 3 metre high embankment around the site.|$|E
5|$|Lehmann's {{work was}} {{continued}} and significantly expanded by the German chemist Daniel Vorländer, who {{from the beginning}} of 20th century until his retirement in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.|$|E
5|$|Some English {{government}} records {{describe his}} activities {{in relation to}} Ireland, and occasional chronicle entries from England and the English-speaking regions of what became south-eastern Scotland record other important details. Aside from the Chronicle of Melrose, the most significant of these sources are the works of Roger of Hoveden, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> preserved {{in the writings of}} John of Fordun and Walter Bower.|$|E

5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales fired unopposed {{until she}} began a port turn at 05:57, when Prinz Eugen took her under fire. After Hood {{exploded}} at 06:01, the Germans opened intense and accurate fire on Prince of Wales, with 15-inch, 8-inch and 5.9-inch guns. A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as Prince of Wales manoeuvred through {{the wreckage of}} Hood. At 06:02, a 15-inch shell struck the starboard side of the compass platform and killed {{the majority of the}} personnel there. The navigating officer was wounded, but Captain Leach was unhurt. Casualties were caused by the fragments from the shell's ballistic cap <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> it dislodged in its diagonal path through the compass platform. A 15-inch diving shell penetrated the ship's side below the armour belt amidships, failed to explode and came to rest in the wing compartments on the starboard side of the after boiler rooms. The shell was discovered and defused when the ship was docked at Rosyth.|$|E

5|$|The {{process by}} which {{electric}} current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies {{with that of the}} charged particles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.|$|E
5|$|Works more {{directly}} related to Ely were also used. The primary one of these works was Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester's Libellus, large parts of which were copied into the Liber Eliensis. Also incorporated into the Liber was an earlier Vita, or saints' life, on Æthelthryth, the founder and first abbess of Ely. A work on the benefactors of the abbey was also used, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> from three surviving cartularies. These documents were translated from their original Old English into Latin by the compiler. Another source, as related in the Liber itself, was a work about Hereward the Wake written by a brother monk known as Richard. Modern historians have identified it with the Gesta Herwardi known from a 13th-century manuscript. It is, however, unclear whether the compiler of the Liber used the exact text of the Gesta as it has come down to us, or a different, earlier manuscript.|$|E
5|$|The Material Defender {{is first}} sent to Deimos to obtain {{information}} about {{the location of a}} scientist named Dr. Sweitzer who has evidence of the PTMC's actions. He is then rescued in the Novak Corporate Prison on Phobos. After recovering the evidence, the Material Defender delivers it to PTMC President Suzuki in Seoul before leaving with his reward. When the Material Defender arrives at the Red Acropolis Research Station, the director tells him that the PTMC president has been killed and that the Red Acropolis Research Team are now accused of being terrorists, resulting in the destruction of the then-abandoned station. After a series of missions, the Material Defender and the Red Acropolis Research Team manage to develop an antivirus and convince the CED that they are not terrorists. The CED suggest to broadcast the antivirus through their strategic platform orbiting Earth, but the results are unsuccessful. The Material Defender is then sent to Venus, where Dravis has been tracked by the Red Acropolis. In the ensuing confrontation in his stronghold, Dravis is mortally wounded by the Guide-Bot's flares <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Material</b> Defender deactivates the virus, which disables all of the PTMC's robots. The game ends with the CED destroying the PTMC's orbital headquarters while the Material Defender returns to Earth.|$|E
