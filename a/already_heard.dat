5|$|In January 1939 John and Frances Baxter, {{a brother}} and sister who had befriended Jack and Helen Parsons, took Jack to the Church of Thelema in Winona Boulevard, Hollywood, where he {{witnessed}} the performance of The Gnostic Mass. Celebrants of the church had included Hollywood actor John Carradine and gay rights activist Harry Hay. Parsons was intrigued, having <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> of Thelema's founder and Outer Head of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), Aleister Crowley, after reading a copy of Crowley's text Konx om Pax (1907).|$|E

Hunter and Major Davis at his office at 6 a.m. as promised; he finally showed up at 8 a.m. By then Hunter and Davis had <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> rumors of the {{violence}} against the strikebreakers. When the three finally arrived at the mine, {{what remained of the}} operation was in flames, and they learned the mob had left three hours earlier.|$|E

25|$|At 08:00 {{the rebel}} {{officers}}' nominal superior, Maj. Kofuji, {{was told to}} inform the officers of the imperial command and order them {{to return to their}} units. However, Muranaka and Kōda had <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> of the command from Nakahashi. Believing the order to be a mistake, they went to see him. When they met Kofuji he only told them to come to 1st Division Headquarters. There they met Gen. Hori, who lied to them, telling them that no command had been issued. The relieved but skeptical officers left.|$|E
25|$|Ezekiel had <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> {{about the}} planned Confederate Memorial long before being {{contacted}} by the design committee, and had already conceived a design. Ezekiel lived in Italy, but {{had returned to the}} United States on May 24, 1910, for the dedication of his life-size bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson outside the Rotunda at the University of Virginia. He visited President William Howard Taft at the White House before traveling to the university, and it was while waiting to see Taft that the idea for the Confederate Memorial came to him.|$|E
25|$|The court sits in six, week-long {{sessions}} to hear cases {{on the merits}} each year. The term begins the week after Labor Day in September and ends in mid-June. All sessions are held in Richmond and generally fall six weeks apart, although the recess between the November and January sessions is longer to accommodate the intervening holidays. During each recess, the justices research the cases awaiting argument, draft and review opinions in cases <b>already</b> <b>heard,</b> consider petitions for appeal, and attend to administrative duties. Cases docketed for argument on the merits include those discretionary appeals for which a petition for appeal was granted, appeals of right for which no petition was necessary, and cases within the court's original jurisdiction.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{greatest}} problems faced by African countries that have high prevalence rates, is [...] "HIV fatigue".

50|$|Mark {{introduces}} Jesus {{without a}} history or a description, suggesting the intended reader <b>already</b> has <b>heard</b> of him. Mark, {{like all the}} Gospels, gives no physical description of Jesus, unlike the short previous description of John. Mark's readers are presumed to already know about the two of them.|$|R
25|$|Each hour of {{this day}} is the new {{suffering}} and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> in every word of our worship service – unique and incomparable both {{in the power of}} tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us {{to the foot of the}} cross of Christ erected on Golgotha, and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{kindness}} towards Mimì, Marcello tries to silence him, {{but she has}} <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> all. Her weeping and coughing reveal her presence, and Rodolfo hurries to her. Musetta's laughter is heard and Marcello goes {{to find out what}} has happened. Mimì tells Rodolfo that she is leaving him, and asks that they separate amicably (Mimì: Donde lieta uscì—"From here she happily left"); but their love for one another is too strong for the pair to part. As a compromise, they agree to remain together until the spring, when the world is coming to life again and no one feels truly alone. Meanwhile, Marcello has found Musetta, and the couple quarrel fiercely about Musetta's flirtatiousness: an antithetical counterpoint to the other pair's reconciliation (quartet: Mimì, Rodolfo, Musetta, Marcello: Addio dolce svegliare alla mattina!—"Goodbye, sweet awakening in the morning!").|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman {{guns from}} No.1 redoubt on Canrobert's hill fired on the Russians at around 06:00 – the Battle of Balaclava had begun. Lucan {{despatched}} Captain Charteris to inform Raglan that the redoubts were under attack. Charteris arrived at around 07:00, but {{those at the}} British headquarters had <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> {{the sound of the}} guns. Lucan himself rode quickly back towards Kadikoi to confer with Sir Colin Campbell, commander of the Balaclava defences. The two men agreed that this was not another Russian feint, but an attack in force with the intention of taking the British base. Campbell prepared his 93rd Highlanders to meet the enemy, whilst Lucan returned to the cavalry. Leaving the Light Brigade where it stood, Lucan led the Heavy Brigade towards the redoubts, hoping his presence might discourage any further Russian advance on Balaclava. Realizing his show of strength had little impact, however, Lucan led the Heavies back to their original position alongside the Light Brigade. The Ottoman forces were left to face the full force of the Russian assault almost alone.|$|E

60|$|As for Lord Antony and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, {{their very}} hearts seemed {{to stand still}} with horror at this {{gratuitous}} insult. One of them uttered an exclamation of appeal, the other one of warning, and instinctively both glanced hurriedly towards the door, whence a slow, drawly, not unpleasant voice had <b>already</b> been <b>heard.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1986 {{came the}} move that ended Rivers' {{longtime}} friendship with Johnny Carson, who had first hired {{her as a}} Tonight Show writer. The soon-to-launch Fox Television Network {{announced that it was}} giving her a late night talk show, The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers, making Rivers the first woman to have her own late night talk show on a major network. The new network planned to broadcast the show 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern Time, making her a Carson competitor. Carson learned of the show from Fox and not from Rivers. In the documentary, Johnny Carson: King of Late Night, Rivers said she only called Carson to discuss the matter after learning he may have <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> about it and that he immediately hung up on her. In the same interview, she said that she later came to believe that maybe she should have asked for his blessing before taking the job. Rivers was banned from appearing on the Tonight Show, a decision respected by Carson's first two successors Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien. After the release of his 2013 biography on Johnny Carson, Carson's attorney Henry Bushkin revealed that he never received a call from Rivers' husband Edgar concerning the move to Fox, contrary to what Edgar had told Rivers. Rivers did not appear on the Tonight Show again until February 17, 2014, when she made a brief appearance on new host Jimmy Fallon's first episode. On March 27, 2014, Rivers returned for an interview.|$|E
500|$|The semiquaver motifs in the alto {{recorders}} were <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> in {{the second}} and third bars of the obbligato accompaniment to the homophonic episode, but here they play in thirds. The other orchestral groups play pairs of detached quaver chords, with upper strings on the beat and oboes off the beat. The choir then rejoin the orchestra for the second of the three homophonic passages to the text [...] "und dein Gerichtigkeit wird vor dir hergehen". At fourteen bars in length, it is the longest and most complex of the three. The broad structure of the episode is a canon between the soprano and bass parts.|$|E
500|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{disclosure of}} the communications intercepted by the United States and Japan revealed {{a considerable amount of}} information about their intelligence systems and capabilities. National Security Agency director Lincoln D. Faurer commented: [...] "...as a result of the Korean Air Lines affair, you have <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> more about my business {{in the past two weeks}} than I would desire... For the most part this has not been a matter of unwelcome leaks. It is the result of a conscious, responsible decision to address an otherwise unbelievable horror." [...] Changes that the Soviets subsequently made to their codes and frequencies reduced the effectiveness of this monitoring by 60%.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2017, Freedom Fry {{followed}} up their single 'Shaky Ground' {{with a new}} single titled “Awake.” Prior to release, [...] "Awake" [...] had <b>already</b> been <b>heard</b> in several advertisements, television shows, and films, including the original Netflix series Love and the film “Baby Baby Baby” starring Adrianne Palicki with Jessica Alba, and William Shatner.|$|R
60|$|Sailors and gunners were hurrying in all directions, {{and orders}} {{were coming in}} rapid succession. At first the Russian ships had turned in one direction, now they were turning in another, and, later still, they separated.

60|$|<b>Already</b> I <b>heard</b> shouts {{above me}} which told that my pursuers were {{descending}} the hill.

I had shaken off my enemies.|$|R
500|$|One Mission (poem). A Theme {{under the}} Name [...] "Imperator" [...] (Одна Мысль (поэма) — Тема под названием «Император») (October / November 1867): {{begins as a}} poem until interlineations occur. Appeared in the same {{notebook}} as The Idiot, suggesting {{that it is an}} additional text to that novel. The protagonist has similar traits as Prince Myshkin. The main influence is Mikhail Semevsky's work about the life of Ivan VI from 1740 to 1764, a part of Russkaya Starina. Dostoyevsky may have <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> of it in Geneva, where he stayed between October and November 1867. One Mission was reworked by Grigory Danilevsky and included in Milovich, which appeared in 1879 in The Russian Messenger alongside The Brothers Karamazov.|$|E
500|$|In July 1945, {{after the}} Red Cross {{confirmed}} {{the deaths of}} the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the diary and a bundle of loose notes that she had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw {{for the first time the}} more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, [...] "For me it was a revelation... I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings... She had kept all these feelings to herself". Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published.|$|E
500|$|George {{decides to}} call Carol, but gets her {{answering}} machine. He leaves her an extremely long, obnoxious message, and {{is concerned that}} she will think he is an idiot. Jerry's friend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) tells George how something similar happened to her brother-in-law, {{who took care of}} the problem by secretly switching the tape. Jerry advises George to wait a few days for Carol to call back; George agrees, but continues to leave increasingly angry — and eventually almost hostile — messages on her machine. When he discovers she was out of town, he decides to go through with the plan of changing the tape. Frustrated by his inability to use an answering machine, George convinces Jerry to go with him. They decide to wait for Carol outside her apartment, and George will distract her while Jerry changes the tape. They succeed, but, just as they are about to leave Carol's apartment, she tells George that she had <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> the messages and found them funny, adding that she [...] "loves jokes like that." ...|$|E

500|$|Stuntman Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the {{recommendation}} of special make-up effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Before the producers contacted him, Mears had <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> about {{the production of a}} new Friday the 13th and had decided to start physical training so he could pursue the role. He was unaware that Stoddard and other industry professionals were suggesting him to the producers. The studio worried that Mears' pleasant demeanor might affect his ability to portray a menacing character, but Mears assured them he was suitable for the role. According to Mears, [...] "They were like, 'You're really nice...are you {{going to be able to}} switch over, right?' I was like, 'I cage fight..and I've got a lot of dad issues. So yeah.'". Mears said he related to [...] "Jason the victim" [...] when he was growing up, and he wanted to portray Jason as a victim in the film. To Mears, Jason represents people who were bullied in high schoolspecifically those with physical deformitiesfor being outcasts. Jason is unusual because he exacts his revenge on those trying to take over his territory at Crystal Lake.|$|E
500|$|Olinda's {{position}} was precarious. [...] "He lacked {{the character and}} skills to impose his authority, while the attempts he did make to take control were seen as presumptuous, a usurpation of a position belonging to the emperor alone." [...] The [...] "generation of politicians {{who had come to}} power in the 1830s, following upon the abdication of Pedro I, had learned from bitter experience the difficulties and dangers of government. By 1840 they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival." [...] The Liberals took the dispute over lowering the age of majority directly to the populace, inciting them to place pressure on the politicians. The Brazilian people supported lowering the age of majority and a popular song was heard in the streets: [...] "We want Pedro the Second,/ Although he is not of age;/ The nation excuses the law,/ and long live the majority!" [...] As emperor, Pedro II [...] "was the living symbol of the unity of the fatherland [...] This position gave him, in the eyes of public opinion, a higher authority than that of any regent." [...] The Conservatives weren’t opposed to the Liberal plan, and both (including the regent himself, who would inevitably lose his office) wished to end the regency. Olinda asked Pedro II what he thought about the issue of majority, and he simply answered, [...] "I have not thought about that," [...] and continued, [...] "I have <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> about it, but I have not given it any attention." ...|$|E
500|$|To get {{attention}} from club owners, Metallica recorded the Power Metal demo which featured [...] "Motorbreath" [...] {{in addition to}} the already-performed originals. The logo, displaying the band's name with the first and last letter drawn larger with sharp serifs and italicized, was designed by Hetfield. The No Life 'til Leather demo was recorded in July 1982, and it created a buzz in the underground tape trading circles. No Life 'til Leather featured a re-recorded version of [...] "Hit the Lights", which appeared on the second pressing of Metal Massacre, in addition to new songs such as [...] "Phantom Lord", [...] "Seek & Destroy", and [...] "Metal Militia". The recording and mastering was financed by Kenny Kane, owner of the punk label High Velocity, and distributed by Ulrich and his friend Pat Scott. Because of tensions with Mustaine, McGovney left the band in December. Ulrich was impressed by Cliff Burton's performance with Trauma at The Troubadour and offered to let him join the group. Burton joined on the condition that Metallica would relocate to the San Francisco area. Moving to El Cerrito in February 1983, the band stayed and rehearsed at Exodus manager Mark Whitaker's house, which they called the [...] "Metallica Mansion". Metallica intended to record its debut in Los Angeles on Slagel's independent label on an $8,000 budget. Slagel could not afford the record, and Ulrich contacted Jon Zazula, a New Jersey record store owner and promoter of heavy metal bands on the East Coast who had <b>already</b> <b>heard</b> No Life 'til Leather. Metallica rented a U-Haul truck and drove to New Jersey in late March, and upon arrival, allowed Zazula to sell copies of No Life 'til Leather to help him found Megaforce Records, because no label wanted to finance the album's recording.|$|E

5|$|This {{homophonic}} choral {{passage is}} followed by the first of three short four-bar orchestral ritornellos, with a texture that has <b>already</b> been <b>heard</b> very briefly in the bar when the chorus pause between the fugato and homophonic passages. As in the opening sinfonia, the instruments play in four distinct groups—alto recorders, oboes, upper strings and continuo—but the sparseness there is now replaced by a jubilant canzona-style flourish.|$|R
