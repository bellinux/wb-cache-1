5|$|Because of the immigrants’ {{loneliness}} {{for their}} homeland, Addams started hosting ethnic evenings at Hull House. This would include ethnic food, dancing, music, {{and maybe a}} short lecture on a topic of interest. Some of the themed evenings were Italian, Greek, German, Polish, etc. Ellen Gates Starr described one Italian evening as having the room packed full with people. One of the ladies who attended “recited a patriotic poem with great spirit” <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> moved by it.|$|E
5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E

Of them only Hwang-gung 황궁(黃穹) came forth to Mago 마고(麻姑) and begged her for forgiveness. He swore he would not rest until mankind could recover its pure nature. From her he obtained the Three Heavenly Heirlooms, and great knowledge. He then called together all the people of the earth, taught them agriculture, and gave each clan leader a Heavenly Heirloom and then sent them off in different directions to people the earth.|$|E
25|$|In May 1942, the 8th {{was without}} any aircraft, {{and the men}} of the {{squadron}} settled down to enjoy the rumor that eventually it would receive A-20 Havocs. Capt. Galusha, acting as Commander, obtained three A-20Cs from the 89th Squadron and proceeded to check out the crews on the A-20. Hopes were high that the squadron would be re-equipped <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> expecting action in the not-too distant future. Their expectations would soon turn to disillusionment as the planes did not arrive—with a negative impact to morale. The crews flew with the 89th in their two borrowed A-20s flying missions, but the unit remained without aircraft until March 1943. Despite this the 8th's crews distinguished themselves flying with the 89th Squadron.|$|E

The three scientists: Chamber, Clifton, and Pugovel, were named after friends of Bell's, [...] who were engineers. Much of the action was based in Muncie, Indiana. Bell picked this location {{because it was the}} hometown of his grandparents.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale {{was educated}} at Godolphin and Latymer School, an {{independent}} school for girls in Hammersmith, West London and {{was involved with}} the Orange Tree Youth Theatre. She is a twice winner of the WH Smith Young Writers Award for both fiction and poetry. She has described herself as a [...] "late bloomer": [...] "All of my friends were kissing boys and drinking cider way before me. I found it really depressing that we weren't making camp fires <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> doing grown-up stuff." [...] "I loathed being a teenager."

500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Sapochnik was also asked {{about how he}} went about {{creating}} a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying [...] "It wasn't hard.

Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Marketing Communication, Richard J. Varey used the product range {{as an example}} of a company capitalising on a form of product {{placement}} or [...] "stealth advertising", writing that [...] "Viewers don't realize that they are, in effect, watching an advertisement". Betty Driver said of the range's launch: [...] "Betty Turpin's hotpots have become something of an institution at the Rover's and she's very proud of her reputation for good, wholesome food. I think it is a lovely idea that people will be able to buy them in supermarkets now." [...] Driver discussed her astonishment at the general level of interest in her character's hotpots, disclosing: [...] "I was on a cruise on the QE2 a few weeks ago, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> asking me about it. Then one day, they served hot pot on the menu and everyone thought it was mine!" ...|$|E
500|$|Alesi {{attacked}} Briatore's role {{in preventing}} the drivers from abiding by the pact {{that was to}} see no overtaking {{in the first two}} chicanes and told the Italian and French media that some team principals threatened their drivers if they did not race. Nevertheless, he was relieved that the race passed without any major incident and said the reason why the majority of the drivers supported Michael Schumacher was that he [...] "behaved like a perfect leader". Villeneuve said to British television station ITV that he felt discussing a no overtaking pact at the race circuit was not the appropriate place: [...] "We are race car drivers, Because we signed contracts before the season <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> happy to be a race car driver and to earn millions of dollars. Because we knew a year ago {{that there would be a}} race at Monza and nobody complained." [...] FIA president Max Mosley stated that he disagreed with the pact and said that the drivers should have raised the concerns in the months leading up to the Grand Prix.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{a monster}} buddy for the lead monster emerged at an April 6, 1998 [...] "story summit" [...] in Burbank with {{employees}} from Disney and Pixar. A term coined by Lasseter, a [...] "story summit" [...] was a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in only two days. Such a character, the group agreed, would give the lead monster {{someone to talk to}} about his predicament. Development artist Ricky Nierva drew a concept sketch of a rounded, one-eyed monster as a concept for the character, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> generally receptive to it. Docter named the character Mike for the father of his friend Frank Oz, a director and Muppet performer. Jeff Pidgeon and Jason Katz story-boarded a test in which Mike helps Sulley choose a tie for work, and Mike Wazowski soon became a vital character in the film. Originally, Mike had no arms and had to use his legs as appendages; however, due to some technical difficulties, arms were soon added to him.|$|E

500|$|Up {{until the}} {{production}} of season ten in 1998, these six main voice actors were paid $30,000 per episode. In 1998, a salary dispute {{between them and the}} Fox Broadcasting Company arose, with the actors threatening to strike. Fox went as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but an agreement was soon made and their salaries were raised to $125,000 per episode. Groening expressed his sympathy for the actors in an issue of Mother Jones a while after the salary dispute had been settled. He told the magazine: [...] " [...] are incredibly talented, and they deserve a chance to be as rich and miserable as anyone else in Hollywood." [...] The show also made a change for the writers to become signatories to the Animation Guild. Most writers in animation belong to the guild, but The Simpsons as well as other animated shows on Fox were different. Scully commented that [...] "everyone expected a big fight with the studio" [...] and continued that [...] "it never materialized, because they conceded that prime-time animation was successful <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> benefiting." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the invasion, {{it is clear that the}} Persians held most advantages. Regardless of its actual size, it is clear that the Persians had brought an overwhelming number of troops and ships to Greece. The Persians had a unified command system, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> answerable to the king. They had a hugely efficient bureaucracy, which allowed them to undertake remarkable feats of planning. The Persian generals had significant experience of warfare over the 80 years in which the Persian empire had been established. Furthermore, the Persians excelled in the use of intelligence and diplomacy in warfare, as shown by their (nearly successful) attempts to divide-and-conquer the Greeks. The Greeks, by comparison, were fragmented, with only 30 or so city-states actively opposing the Persian invasion; even those were prone to quarrel with each other. They had little experience of large-scale warfare, being largely restricted to small-scale local warfare, and their commanders were chosen primarily on the basis of the political and social standing, rather than because of any experience or expertise. As Lazenby therefore asks: [...] "So why did the Persians fail?" ...|$|E
500|$|Mattea {{spent the}} {{entirety}} of 1996 off the charts before returning with Love Travels in 1997. Its lead single was [...] "455 Rocket", which charted at No.21, followed by the title track at No.39. Mattea noted that {{in the process of}} recording [...] "455 Rocket," [...] the band recorded multiple takes but chose to keep the first one because [...] "no one thought they were being recorded, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> just playing with abandon." [...] Musicians on this album included bassist Hutch Hutchinson, drummers Abe Laboriel Jr. and Jim Keltner, and guitarist Duke Levine; contributing backing vocalists included Kim Richey, Michael McDonald, Suzy Bogguss, Jonatha Brooke, and Mary Ann Kennedy. Lionel Cartwright wrote [...] "If That's What You Call Love", which also featured him on piano and background vocals, and Phil Keaggy played guitar on the closing track [...] "Beautiful Fool". Thom Owens of Allmusic stated that [...] "though the glossy production may put off some of her old country-folk fans, Love Travels is a typically tasteful and compelling record" [...] Bob Cannon of Entertainment Weekly praised the inclusion of Gillian Welch and Cheryl Wheeler songs, calling it [...] "her most mature and focused work yet." ...|$|E

500|$|Ortved—using {{interviews}} with writers Bob Kushell and Brent Forrester and Mirkin's assistant Charleen Easton—describes Mirkin as an [...] "outsider" [...] on the show, with the writing staff, at least initially, divided {{with respect to}} Mirkin's comedy and leadership style. Forrester described the latter as [...] "a little bit dictatorial". Mirkin conducted the show's writing sessions in one room, rather than splitting the writers into two groups, as later showrunners would do, and often worked late into the night. Some praised Mirkin's leadership, including Appel, who felt that [...] "the shows were great under him." [...] Others criticised him, including Kushell, who clashed with Mirkin over the episode [...] "A Star is Burns", a crossover with The Critic. In 2004, Mirkin stated that he [...] "really wasn't at all intimidat to join [...] crew", because he [...] "had worked with and written with" [...] many of his fellow writers previously and concluded that, [...] " [...] this show {{in a direction that}} is more personal to me. I did that, had a great time doing that, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> very receptive to that." [...] Mirkin's era and style of humor are popular amongst the show's fans.|$|E
500|$|With digital effects work {{running behind}} schedule, Zemeckis {{convinced}} Wes Takahashi, an animation supervisor from visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic, to help work on The Frighteners. [...] "The shots Zemeckis showed me were pretty remarkable," [...] Takahashi reflected, [...] "but {{there were still}} about 400 shots to do, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> kind of worried." [...] Takahashi was quickly drafted as a visual effects supervisor, and began looking at the schedule, {{trying to work out}} whether The Frighteners could be finished in time. [...] "There was no way we'd make the deadline. I figured out a concerted plan involving Jackson and Zemeckis to convince Universal it was worthy of asking for more money." [...] The executives at Universal proposed splitting some of the shots to visual effects companies in the United States, but Jackson, for whom the film was a chance to show New Zealand filmmaking could stand alongside Hollywood, convinced Universal otherwise. Instead, The Frighteners received an accelerated release date, four months earlier than planned, and an additional $6 million in financing, with fifteen digital animators and computer workstations (some were borrowed from Universal and other effects companies in the US). Andrew Adamson was hired as a digital effects supervisor.|$|E
500|$|Mary met {{her future}} husband during an air raid on Liverpool in 1940, when Jim was 38 years old, and had settled into what his friends thought was, [...] "a {{confirmed}} bachelorhood." [...] Mary had been too career-conscious to think of marriage and, {{at the age of}} 31 years, was thought of as a spinster. They met in June 1940, at 11 Scargreen Avenue, West Derby, the McCartney family home. Mary was staying with Jim's sister, Jin, {{because of the lack of}} accommodation in Liverpool at the time. As Mary sat quietly in an armchair, the air-raid sirens sounded at 9:30. At that time, the group moved to the Anderson shelter in the back garden to wait for the all-clear, but as there was an intensive bombing raid, the signal did not come <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> thus forced to sit in the cellar until dawn. Mary talked long enough with Jim to become romantically interested in him, and thought that he was [...] "utterly charming and uncomplicated," [...] as well as being entertained by his [...] "considerable good humour." [...] They took out a marriage licence at Liverpool Town Hall on 8 April 1941, and were married a week later at St. Swithin's Roman Catholic chapel in Gillmoss, West Derby, on 15 April 1941. They first lived at 10 Sunbury Road, Anfield, and then resided for a short time at 92 Broadway, Wallasey, during November 1942. Jim's job at Napiers was classified as war work, so the McCartneys were given a small, but temporary, prefab house at 3 Roach Avenue, Knowsley.|$|E
