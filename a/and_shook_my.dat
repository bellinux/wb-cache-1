60|$|When Tom {{was ready}} to go he stopped, with the door open, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> hand.|$|E
60|$|Again we paused. I {{looked up}} at her with an inextricable medley of {{emotions}} struggling together in my mind, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head.|$|E
60|$|Now came Oliver's turn. He {{nodded to}} Maqueda, who went {{white as a}} sheet, muttering some words to her that did not reach me. Then he turned <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> hand.|$|E
50|$|I {{will not}} eat <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> hand {{about at the}} same time.|$|R
60|$|Trinc. Now would I lay greatness aside, <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> heels, if I had but music.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} the solicitude which his face expressed, by conveying the same expression into <b>my</b> own, <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> head.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I said, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head {{as though}} the dead eyes could note. [...] "Whatever it is, I don't {{understand}} yet. Perhaps I shall later--if you'll let me come again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nares {{turned to}} me <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> hand. [...] "I began to think we should never see this day," [...] said he. [...] "I congratulate you, Mr. Dodd, on having pulled it through." ...|$|E
60|$|How were we to communicate? Did he by {{any chance}} suppose that I had learnt the finger alphabet? I touched my fingers <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head, {{as a means of}} dissipating his delusion, if it existed.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} I am dumbfounded. Then I {{think of the}} entries we made at the inn in the Urserenthal, {{and then in a}} flash I have the truth. I rap the desk smartly with <b>my</b> finger-tips <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> index-finger in my friend's face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bowser's {{very big}} and strong; [...] His voice is deep; his legs are long; [...] His bark scares some almost to death. [...] But {{as for me}} he wastes his breath; [...] I just roll up <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> spears [...] <b>And</b> Bowser {{is the one who}} fears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This, then, {{accounts}} for the pain I feel in it. But come," [...] said I, rising <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> limbs {{to make sure that}} no bones were broken; [...] "we have reason to be very thankful we have escaped so easily. I made sure that you were killed when I saw you flying through the air." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{stiffened}} {{myself to}} refuse, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head. Still she waited {{and looked at}} me. I tried to word my refusal, but wavered. I saw the glad light spring into her eyes and knew that I had lost. It was impossible to say no after that.|$|E
6000|$|... "'It is {{not worth}} your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head, she {{suddenly}} threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here {{before it is too}} late!' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{smiled again}} <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head, whereupon {{he went to}} work with the most gingerly and {{delicate}} touches, as if he were handling red-hot iron. At last he managed to tear a hole in the skin, into which he inserted his black nose, and greedily devoured the contents. Despite his caution, however, I noticed that Jacko kept scratching his hands pretty steadily for some time afterwards.|$|E
60|$|As we drew near, {{the stern}} look vanished, and he sprang {{forward with a}} glad smile to seize <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> hand. At the same moment Ivanka's black eyes seemed to blaze with delight, as she ran towards me, and clasped one of my legs. Little Dobri, bereft of speech, stood with legs and arms apart, and mouth and eyes wide open, gazing at me.|$|R
60|$|OEdip. What mean these exclamations on my name? I {{thank the}} gods, no secret {{thoughts}} reproach me: No: I dare challenge heaven to turn me outward, <b>And</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> soul quite empty in your sight. Then wonder not that I can bear unmoved These fixed regards, and silent threats of eyes. A generous fierceness dwells with innocence; And conscious virtue is allowed some pride.|$|R
60|$|This {{certainly}} had not a profitable appearance, <b>and</b> I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> {{head as if}} I would imply {{that it would be}} difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me, but I blushed {{to the roots}} of my hair <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head sheepishly. An awkward pause ensued; it looked as if we would have to proceed without grace, when Felix {{suddenly}} shut his eyes, bent his head, and said a very good grace without any appearance of embarrassment. We looked at him when it was over with an increase of respect.|$|E
6000|$|... "'With a heart,'" [...] I began; and failed. Some ghost within {{had risen}} in rebellion, sealed my tongue. It seemed to my irrational heart that I had--how shall I say it?--betrayed my [...] "stars," [...] betrayed Fanny, {{that she and}} they and I could never be of the same far, quiet company again. So the [...] "furious fancies" [...] were never shared. The blood ran out of my cheek; I stuck fast; <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head.|$|E
6000|$|And the Colonel, {{making the}} word double between English and our tongue, said, [...] "Yes, thou art truly Sikh"; {{and he called}} me an old devil-- jestingly, as one soldier may jest with another; and he said my Kurban Sahib was a liar as to his health (that was true, too), and at long last he stood up <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> hand, and bade me go and bring my Sahib safe again. My Sahib back again--aie me! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No diamond {{could have}} adorned it better," [...] Archie {{thought as he}} watched it shine there for a moment, <b>and</b> felt like <b>shaking</b> Steve for daring to pat the dark head with an {{encouraging}} [...] "All right. I'll be on hand and whisk you away while the rest are splitting their gloves. No fear of your breaking down. If you feel the least bit like it, though, just {{look at me and}} I'll glare at you <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> fist, since kindness upsets you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can {{say nothing}} more, lad?" [...] Sergeant Corney said to me, inquiringly, <b>and</b> I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head, for so great was the grief {{in my heart}} that just then I could make no reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "No doctor! no woman!" [...] said she; [...] "if {{my drink}} could not save me, {{what would a}} doctor's foolish pills and powders do? And a woman! If old Martha Denton, the witch, were alive, I {{would be glad to}} see her. But other women! Pah! Ah! Ai! Oh! Phew! Ah, Seppy, what a mercy it would be now if I could set to and blaspheme a bit, <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> fist at the sky! But I'm a Christian woman, Seppy,--a Christian woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|Horror darkened her marvellous radiance. Then {{her face}} became utterly blank with the {{tremendous}} effort to understand. Absolute silence reigned in the house. It {{seemed to me}} that everything had been said now that mattered in the world; and that the world itself had reached its ultimate stage, had reached its appointed end of an eternal, phantom-like silence. Suddenly Do√±a Rita raised a warning finger. I had heard nothing <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head; but she nodded hers and murmured excitedly, ...|$|E
60|$|We had {{not reached}} {{the house before}} Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine came hurrying out together. Running up to us with a haste and an {{excitement}} I had never seen in either of them, first one {{and then the other}} took Ruth into her arms and kissed her with much earnestness. Then they turned upon me <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> hands with hearty vigor, expressing, more by their looks and actions than their words, a triumphant approbation of what I had done.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, my word!' thought I to myself, 'the ladies {{have come}} on the stage, and now we may look to the plot to develop itself.' And I sighed <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head, knowing that {{the beauty of a}} woman is like the beauty of the {{lightning}} -- a destructive thing and a cause of desolation. By the time that I had finished my reflections both the Queens were on the thrones, for all this had happened in about six seconds. Once more the unseen trumpets blared out, and then the Court seated itself, and Queen Sorais motioned to us to do likewise.|$|E
60|$|I feel so piggish and rabbitish {{in eating}} {{you out of}} all your vegetables, that I'm afraid to speak lest it should turn out grunting, <b>and</b> to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> head for fear of feeling flappy at the ears.|$|R
60|$|The man's face changed, and {{he looked}} anxiously at me. I {{did not know what}} my wife had been saying, but I had seen by her manner that she had been {{threatening}} him, <b>and</b> I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> uplifted fist.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's what I'd like to do,' <b>and</b> I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> ears {{in a way}} such as I knew {{provoked}} him; 'but Mrs. Bunny {{says that}} colds are catching, and I wouldn't like to run the chances of taking yours.' ...|$|R
60|$|I went in, as usual, {{through the}} door between our two bedrooms, to bid Laura good-night {{before she went to}} sleep. In stooping over her to kiss her I saw the little book of Hartright's {{drawings}} half hidden under her pillow, just in the place where she used to hide her favourite toys when she was a child. I could not find it in my heart to say anything, but I pointed to the book <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> head. She reached both hands up to my cheeks, and drew my face down to hers till our lips met.|$|E
60|$|When I {{returned}} to the hotel Dick was looking for me. He carried me off up-stairs to a hall full of men. At one end were tables littered with papers, and here men were signing their name Dick explained that forest rangers were being paid and new ones hired. Then he introduced me officers of the service and the Chief. I knew {{by the way they}} looked at me that Dick had been talking. It made me so tongue-tied that I could not find my voice when the Chief spoke to me <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> hand warmly. He was a tall man, with a fine face and kind eyes and hair just touched with gray.|$|E
60|$|When Mr. Petersfield had finished, {{he folded}} up the will, came over <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> hand, and congratulated me formally, {{and said that}} he hoped to {{continue}} to act for me as his firm had done so many years for this estate. I laughed, and said that I thought I had sufficient confidence in him to intrust it to his care. He then asked me what I should wish in the matter. I said that at any rate I should wish nothing done until Miss Harmer's death, that she was not expected to live for a week, and that she must not be disturbed; but with that exception I gave him carte blanche.|$|E
6000|$|And now I {{wander in}} the woods [...] When summer gluts the golden bees, [...] Or in autumnal solitudes [...] Arise the leopard-coloured trees; [...] Or when along the wintry strands [...] The {{cormorants}} shiver on their rocks; [...] I wander on, and wave my hands, [...] <b>And</b> sing, <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> heavy locks. [...] The gray wolf knows me; by one ear [...] I lead along the woodland deer; [...] The hares run by me growing bold. [...] They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, [...] the beech leaves old.|$|R
60|$|Instead {{of taking}} offence, Sergeant Cuff seized <b>my</b> hand, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> it till <b>my</b> fingers ached again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was {{completely}} unprepared for this. I could only mutter <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> head vaguely. Afterwards I am perfectly aware I cut {{a very poor}} figure trying to extricate myself out of this difficulty. From that moment, however, the old nakhoda became taciturn. He was not very pleased, I fear, and evidently I had given him food for thought. Strangely enough, {{on the evening of}} that very day (which was my last in Patusan) I was once more confronted with the same question, with the unanswerable why of Jim's fate. And this brings me to the story of his love.|$|R
