40|$|AbstractThe Pre-import Inspection, Testing and Certification program {{became an}} {{important}} factor to get a market share in Iraq. Verification of Conformity (VoC) of products before shipment to Iraq was started in May 2011 by Iraqi government. The objectives of this program are; protection of consumers and environment, <b>assurance</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> transparency in commercial activities and releasing goods faster at Iraqi customs with the appropriate certificate of conformity. After several months of preparation, today this program is being executed actively for countries {{all over the world}} that wants to export in Iraq. In this study, an analysis of Iraq's new pre-import inspection, testing and certification program is tried to determine by A’WOT hybrid multi-criteria method. A’WOT is a combination of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).

40|$|ABSTRACT Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is a {{fruit tree}} {{resilient}} to adverse climatic conditions predominating in hot arid {{regions of the}} Middle East and North Africa. The date fruit contains numerous chemical components that possess high nutritional and medicinal values. Traditional propagation by offshoots is inefficient to satisfy current demands for date palm trees. Alternatively, micropropagation provides an efficient means for large-scale propagation of date palm cultivars. Both somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis, {{either directly or indirectly}} though the callus phase, have been demonstrated in date palm in vitro regeneration. Culture initiation commonly utilizes shoot-tip explants isolated from young offshoots. Recently, the immature inflorescences of adult trees were utilized as an alternative nondestructive source of explants. In addition {{to the nature of the}} explant used, successful plant regeneration depends on the cultivar, composition of the culture medium and physical status. Challenges of date palm micropropagation include long in vitro cycle, latent contamination, browning, somaclonal variation as well as ex vitro acclimatization and transplanting. A remarkable amount of research investigating these factors has led to optimized protocols for the micropropagation of numerous commercially important cultivars. This has encouraged the development of several international commercial tissue culture laboratories. Molecular characterization provides an <b>assurance</b> <b>of</b> genetic <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> regenerated plantlets, a key feature for commercial production. This article describes date palm micropropagation protocols and also discusses recent achievements with respect to somaclonal variation, molecular markers, cryopreservation and future prospects...|$|R

40|$|To gather {{reproducible}} measurement results, metrologists need {{a variety}} of competences. Yet, also other groups of staff in a manufacturing enterprise need competences in metrology in order to assure the appropriate specification of tolerances or sufficient consideration of inspectional requirements in production processes. Therefore, the strict focus of metrological qualification on staff preparing or performing the actual measurements is insufficient for the efficient <b>assurance</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> Additionally, {{on the one hand}} a demand-oriented qualification concept is needed to impart required fundamental knowledge on manufacturing metrology according to the specific needs of each user group. On the other hand, appropriate measures of knowledge management have to be applied in order to assure a proper application of the gathered knowledge and enhance mutual understanding for the requirements of other involved user groups. Thus, as amendment for user-specific measures of formal qualification, a concept has been developed to enable knowledge transfer among different groups and departments in an enterprise. By this holistic approach, the impact of measures of qualification can be increased and high product quality can be achieved as a common aim of all related groups of staff...|$|E
40|$|Since the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) {{came into}} force, Members have {{invested}} considerable efforts in adopting and promoting {{the use of}} measures intended to reduce conformity assessment (CA) related barriers to trade. Our knowledge {{of the impact of}} specific trade facilitating programmes in the CA field is limited so far, making empirical studies of their trade impact desirable. This study investigates the impact of Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDOC) on trade flows. As under SDOC regimes suppliers themselves provide written <b>assurance</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> to applicable technical regulations of a market, the costs of compliance are assumed to be smaller than for CA regimes requiring certification by third parties. The study focuses on three cases of SDOC introduction in the European Union covering eligible products from the medical devices, telecommunications equipment and machinery sectors. The paper explains the rationale for using SDOC, expected benefits and design characteristics of SDOC regimes. The quantitative analysis uses a gravity model and finds compelling evidence that the introduction of SDOC in the EU was a factor that influenced the evolution of import flows into EU markets positively. Intra-EU trade flows and imports from extra-EU OECD countries increased for SDOC-eligible radio and telecommunications equipment and low-risk medical devices, whereas the results for machinery are ambiguous. The most striking increases, visible in all three sectors, are found for exports to EU markets from non-OECD (developing) countries included in the sample. Analysis of the effect of SDOC for selected individual EU members furthermore suggest that the magnitude of effect depends {{on the nature of the}} CA regime that SDOC replaced. telecommunications, OECD, France, Italy, technical barriers to trade, certification, targets, United Kingdom, European Union, developing countries...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{perceived}} {{authority on the}} clinical behaviour and decisionmaking of midwives has received little research attention, {{largely due to the}} unavailability of a midwifery-specific measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> The current study investigated the factor structure of the social influence scale for midwifery (SISM), a recently developed measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> designed specifically for use within midwifery practice. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that a four-factor model <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> comprising distinct dimensions <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> client control, personal control and non-conformity offered an excellent fit to the data. It is concluded that, though the SIS-M was developed as a unitary measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> there is also compelling evidence that the SIS-M could be developed as a multi-dimensional measure of distinct, but related, conformity dimensions. The SIS-M therefore offers considerable potential as a research tool to gain novel insights into the <b>conformity</b> behaviour <b>of</b> midwives in the practice environment and the relationship of such behaviour to maternal and neonatal outcomes...|$|R

However, there are cases where the seller's liability is excluded despite the lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> the goods. First, pursuant to Art. 478 (3) of Serbian Law on Obligations an insignificant material defect of the goods {{should not be taken}} into account. In other words, minor difference in quantity or quality will not be taken into consideration where it is not material. In international trade, in principle, the seller is liable for minor defects of the goods. However, in practice seller's liability for immaterial lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> will be excluded on the basis of relevant trade usages and previous bussines dealings of the parties. Second, it is commonly accepted in international and domestic trade, as concretization of the principle of good faith, that the seller is not liable for any lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> goods if at the time of conclusion of a contract the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of such lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> Seller's liability for the lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> the goods is excluded when the following requirements are fulfilled. The first requirement is that the buyer had positive knowledge of the defects or that he could not have been unaware of their existence. It is considered that the buyer could not have been unaware of the non-conformity if he acted with gross negligence. Furthermore, buyer's knowledge of the lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> should exist at the time of conclusion of the contract.
