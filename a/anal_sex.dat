5|$|The {{available}} evidence {{does not indicate}} that circumcision provides HIV protection for heterosexual women. Data is lacking regarding the effect circumcision may have on the transmission rate of men who engage in <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> with a female partner. It is undetermined whether circumcision benefits {{men who have sex}} with men.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision {{may be used}} {{to treat}} {{pathological}} phimosis, refractory balanoposthitis and chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The World Health Organization promotes circumcision to prevent female-to-male HIV transmission in countries with high rates of HIV. The International Antiviral Society-USA also suggests circumcision be discussed with MSM who engage in primarily insertive <b>anal</b> <b>sex,</b> especially in areas where HIV is common.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and <b>anal</b> <b>sex.</b> Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{highlighted}} what {{he perceived}} as scenes in Red Rackham's Treasure which reflected common themes in The Adventures of Tintin. He {{pointed out that}} in being a stowaway aboard the ship, Calculus {{was one of many}} stowaways in the series, and that the treasure represented the theme of jewels and precious stones which also cropped up in The Broken Ear, Tintin in the Congo, and The Castafiore Emerald. He noted Tintin's misreading of the parchments and stated this was {{one of a number of}} calculation mistakes that the character makes in the series. He suggested that a scene in which the shark submarine pushes between Haddock's buttocks was a form of sexual innuendo referencing <b>anal</b> <b>sex,</b> highlighting similar innuendo in The Broken Ear and The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E
25|$|While <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> is {{commonly}} associated with male homosexuality, research shows that not all gay males engage in <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> {{and that it is}} not uncommon in heterosexual relationships. Types of <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> can also be a part of lesbian sexual practices. People may experience pleasure from <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> by stimulation of the anal nerve endings, and orgasm may be achieved through anal penetration– by indirect stimulation of the prostate in men, indirect stimulation of the clitoris or an area of the vagina (sometimes termed the G-spot) in women, and other sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve). However, people may also find <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> painful, sometimes extremely so, which may be primarily due to psychological factors in some cases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anal</b> <b>sex</b> or anal {{intercourse}} is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure. Other forms of <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> include fingering, {{the use of}} sex toys for anal penetration, oral sex performed on the anus (anilingus), and pegging. Although the term <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> most commonly means penile-anal penetration, sources sometimes use the term {{anal intercourse}} to refer exclusively to penile-anal penetration, and <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> to refer to any form of anal sexual activity, especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation.|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} forms of sexual activity, <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> {{participants}} risk contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs). <b>Anal</b> <b>sex</b> {{is considered a}} high-risk sexual practice because of {{the vulnerability of the}} anus and rectum. The anal and rectal tissues are delicate and do not provide lubrication like the vagina does, so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission, especially if a personal lubricant is not used. <b>Anal</b> <b>sex</b> without protection of a condom is considered the riskiest form of sexual activity, and therefore health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend safe sex practices for <b>anal</b> <b>sex.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pain during {{receptive}} <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> among gay men (or men {{who have}} sex with men) is formally known as anodyspareunia. In one study, 61% of gay or bisexual men said they experienced painful receptive <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> and that it was the most frequent sexual difficulty they had experienced. By contrast, 24% of gay or bisexual men stated that they always experienced some degree of pain during <b>anal</b> <b>sex,</b> and about 12% of gay men find it too painful to pursue receptive anal sex; it was concluded that the perception of <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> as painful is as likely to be psychologically or emotionally based as it is to be physically based. Factors predictive of pain during <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> include inadequate lubrication, feeling tense or anxious, lack of stimulation, as well as lack of social ease with being gay and being closeted. Research has found that psychological factors can in fact be the primary contributors to the experience of pain during anal intercourse and that adequate communication between sexual partners can prevent it, countering the notion that pain is always inevitable during <b>anal</b> <b>sex.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} lesbian sexual practices, <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> {{includes}} fingering, {{use of a}} dildo or other sex toys, or anilingus. Some lesbians do not like <b>anal</b> <b>sex,</b> and anilingus is less often practiced among female same-sex couples.|$|E

25|$|Historically, <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> {{has been}} {{commonly}} associated with male homosexuality. However, many gay men and {{men who have sex}} with men in general (those who identify as gay, bisexual, heterosexual or have not identified their sexual identity) do not engage in <b>anal</b> <b>sex.</b> Among men who have <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> with other men, the insertive partner may be referred to as the top and the one being penetrated may be referred to as the bottom. Those who enjoy either role may be referred to as versatile.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anal</b> <b>sex</b> is a {{prevalent}} {{theme in}} yaoi, as nearly all stories feature {{it in some}} way. The storyline where an uke is reluctant to have <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> with a seme {{is considered to be}} similar to the reader's reluctance to have sexual contact with someone for the first time. Zanghellini notes that illustrations of <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> almost always position the characters to face each other, rather than in the 'doggy style.' Zanghellini also notes that the uke rarely fellates the seme, but instead receives the sexual and romantic attentions of the seme.|$|E
25|$|Historically, <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> {{has been}} popularly {{associated}} with male homosexuality and MSM. However, many MSM do {{not engage in}} <b>anal</b> <b>sex,</b> and may engage in oral sex, frotting or mutual masturbation instead. Among men who have <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> with other men, the insertive partner may {{be referred to as}} the top, the one being penetrated may be referred to as the bottom, and those who enjoy either role may be referred to as versatile. Men who participate in receptive sexual activities may have greater risk of HIV infection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of rape changed. Changes to the {{definition of}} rape allowed for the possibility of a male being the victim of rape. The revised definition considered rape to include forced sexual contact in terms of vaginal, <b>anal,</b> or oral <b>sex.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The age {{of consent}} in Uganda is 18 years, for vaginal intercourse. [...] "Heterosexual sodomy" [...] (<b>anal</b> and/or oral <b>sex</b> with an opposite-sex partner) and all {{same-sex}} sexual conduct was illegal until January 2014 when President Museveni blocked the anti-gay law.|$|R
5000|$|Decriminalization of <b>anal</b> {{and oral}} <b>sex</b> in certain circumstances; bestiality - Section 377 (carnal {{intercourse}} against {{the order of}} nature) will be repealed and re-enacted in a modified form, such that <b>anal</b> and oral <b>sex,</b> if done in private between a consulting heterosexual couple aged 16 years old and above, {{will no longer be}} criminal offences. The offence of bestiality, also currently covered by s. 377, will be expanded to cover the scenario where a person is compelled by another person to perform bestiality without his or her consent. The new s 377 will be replaced by omitting [...] "unnatural sex" [...] to be replaced by [...] "Sex with a corpse" [...] or dead bodies which will be outlawed.|$|R
25|$|Reports {{regarding}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> among gay men and other {{men who have sex}} with men vary. A survey in The Advocate in 1994 indicated that 46% of gay men preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the receptive partner. Other sources suggest that roughly three-fourths of gay men have had <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> at one time or another, with an equal percentage participating as tops and bottoms. A 2012 NSSHB sex survey in the U.S. suggests high lifetime participation in <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> among gay men: 83.3% report ever taking part in <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> in the insertive position and 90% in the receptive position, even if only between a third and a quarter self-report very recent engagement in the practice, defined as 30 days or less.|$|E
25|$|Men {{who have}} sex with men may also prefer to engage in frot or other forms of mutual {{masturbation}} because they find it more pleasurable or more affectionate, to preserve technical virginity, or as safe sex alternatives to <b>anal</b> <b>sex,</b> while other frot advocates denounce <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> as degrading to the receptive partner and unnecessarily risky.|$|E
25|$|Strong {{views are}} often {{expressed}} about <b>anal</b> <b>sex.</b> It is controversial in various cultures, {{especially with regard}} to religious prohibitions. This is commonly due to prohibitions against <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> among males or teachings about the procreative purpose of sexual activity. It may be regarded as taboo or unnatural, and is a criminal offense in some countries, punishable by corporal or capital punishment. By contrast, people also regard <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> as a natural and valid form of sexual activity that may be as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions. They may regard it as an enhancing element of their sex lives or as their primary form of sexual activity.|$|E

25|$|Anal {{intercourse}} {{is sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for vaginal intercourse during menstruation. The likelihood of pregnancy occurring during <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> is greatly reduced, as <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening. Because of this, some couples practice anal intercourse as a form of contraception, often {{in the absence of a}} condom.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anal</b> <b>sex</b> can {{exacerbate}} hemorrhoids {{and therefore}} result in bleeding; in other cases, {{the formation of}} a hemorrhoid is attributed to <b>anal</b> <b>sex.</b> If bleeding occurs as a result of <b>anal</b> <b>sex,</b> it may also be because of a tear in the anal or rectal tissues (an anal fissure) or perforation (a hole) in the colon, the latter of which being a serious medical issue that should be remedied by immediate medical attention. Because of the rectum's lack of elasticity, the anal mucous membrane being thin, and small blood vessels being present directly beneath the mucous membrane, tiny tears and bleeding in the rectum usually result from penetrative <b>anal</b> <b>sex,</b> though the bleeding is usually minor and therefore usually not visible. By contrast to other anal sexual behaviors, anal fisting poses a more serious danger of damage due to the deliberate stretching of the anal and rectal tissues; anal fisting injuries include anal sphincter lacerations and rectal and sigmoid colon (rectosigmoid) perforation, which might result in death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anal</b> <b>sex</b> can expose its {{participants}} to two principal dangers: infections {{due to the}} high number of infectious microorganisms not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and rectum due to their fragility. Unprotected penile-anal penetration, colloquially known as barebacking, carries a higher risk of passing on sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs) because the anal sphincter is a delicate, easily torn tissue that can provide an entry for pathogens. The high concentration of white blood cells around the rectum, together with the risk of tearing and the colon's function to absorb fluid, are what place those who engage in <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> at high risk of STIs. Use of condoms, ample lubrication {{to reduce the risk of}} tearing, and safer sex practices in general, reduce the risk of STI transmission. However, a condom can break or otherwise come off during <b>anal</b> <b>sex,</b> and this is more likely to happen with <b>anal</b> <b>sex</b> than with other sex acts because of the tightness of the anal sphincters during friction.|$|E
50|$|The people {{involved}} in a threesome may have any combination of gender and sexual orientation. Each participant may engage in any type of sex act with {{one or both of}} the others, such as vaginal, <b>anal</b> or oral <b>sex</b> or mutual masturbation. One or more of the participants may engage in autoerotic sexual activity, such as masturbation, possibly without physical contact with the other participants. It is a matter of subjective definition whether participation of a third person without physical contact constitutes a threesome. This may relate to fetishes such as voyeurism or cuckolding. Lucky Pierre is slang for a person performing both receptive and insertive <b>anal</b> and/or vaginal <b>sex</b> simultaneously during a threesome, being positioned between the two partners.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} of the Lawrence decision, ten states—Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, Utah and Virginia—still banned consensual sodomy without respect to the sex of those involved, and four—Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri—prohibited {{same-sex}} couples from engaging in <b>anal</b> and oral <b>sex.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In modern German, {{the word}} [...] has no {{connotation}} of <b>anal</b> or oral <b>sex</b> and specifically refers to bestiality.
