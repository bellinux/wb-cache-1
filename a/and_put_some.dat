The torpedo had caused catastrophic damage and initially brought the ship to a dead stop, while near misses from bombs caused further damage <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> of the ship's defensive armament out of action.

25|$|By some staff blunder, Stockmayer's column left Montheries {{without a}} guide {{and missed the}} correct road. Instead of coming in behind Letort's troops, it emerged from the Dhuits Forest {{on the south side}} of Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. Spotting the danger, Letort evaded the trap and fell back toward Lignol. The Crown Prince led his 2nd and 4th Cavalry Regiments forward in attempt to cut the French off but {{supports}} arrived in time to help Letort pull back to the main French defense line near Voigny. An attempted Württemberger advance was stopped by Mortier's 20-gun battery. The Crown Prince decided not to engage the French Guard infantry and withdrew his troops to Lignol, until Gyulai's advance showed some progress and conducted an artillery duel until dark. The German gunners managed to blow up two ammunition wagons <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> French guns out of action. Platov's Cossacks declined to cooperate with the Württembergers.|$|E

25|$|The return {{fire from}} Fort Clark was ineffectual, either falling short or passing overhead, and no hits {{were made on}} the bombarding ships. Shortly after noon, the {{defenders}} ran low on ammunition, and about 12:25p.m. they ran out completely. At this point, they abandoned the fort, some fleeing to Fort Hatteras, while others took to boats. Col. Max Weber, commanding the Federal troops already on shore, noted this <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> men in to take possession, but the fleet did not know this and continued firing for another five minutes. It was during this interval of confusion that the landing force suffered its only casualty, {{one of the soldiers}} being seriously wounded in the hand by a shell fragment. Fortunately, some of the troops were able {{to get the attention of}} the gunners on the ships by waving a large American flag, and the bombardment stopped with no further harm done. Stringham and his captains then turned their attention to Fort Hatteras.|$|E
500|$|After {{receiving}} the go-ahead {{to work on}} the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter's house creating characters, crafting details for the story's milieu and discussing influences. The pair was particularly influenced by a Mad parody of Superman named [...] "Superduperman"; Moore said, [...] "We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees—dramatic, instead of comedic". Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take [...] "familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm"; the writer said his intention was to create [...] "a superhero Moby Dick; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density". The writer came up with the character names and descriptions, but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons. Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately, but rather [...] "did it at odd times [...] spend maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches." [...] Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because [...] "you just have to draw a hat. If you can draw a hat, then you've drawn Rorschach, you just draw kind of a shape for his face <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> black blobs on it and you're done." ...|$|E

Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: [...] "It is necessary to try <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government." [...] Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine Foreign Affairs in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because [...] "he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we should do it. ... I'm not intellectually convinced that one-man, one-vote is the best. We practise it because that's what the British bequeathed us and we haven't really found a need to challenge that."

500|$|In {{his review}} of Super Smash Bros., GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann called Samus one of the {{characters}} that made Nintendo [...] "what it is today." [...] Samus was ranked fifth on GameDaily's 2009 list of top characters in the Smash Bros. series, while IGN ranked her as the third-best character for Super Smash Bros. Her controversial portrayal in Metroid: Other M received mixed reactions. Unlike other Metroid games, where Samus took full advantage of weapons and abilities available, she deactivated most of them until Commander Adam Malkovich authorized their use, despite obvious uses for them. G4 TV considered the portrayal of Samus as [...] "sexist", stating that as she [...] "cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man" [...] and that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals. The A.V. Club echoed the misgivings about Samus's immaturity, petulant behavior, and misguided loyalty. According to GamePro, while the story and Samus' monologues did not compel them, [...] "it helped contextualize her entire existence" [...] which developed the character to [...] "an actual human being who's using the vastness of space to try <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> distance between herself and the past." [...] 1UP.com's Justin Hayward found the portrayal [...] "lifeless and boring" [...] and [...] "nonsensical". GamesRadar wrote that Other M painted Samus, widely considered a strong female lead character, as [...] "an unsure, insecure woman who desperately wants the approval of her former [...] commanding officer." [...] Game Informer listed her 1st on their list of the top ten [...] "dorks" [...] of 2010, citing her [...] "lame backstory" [...] in Other M.|$|E
500|$|New Zealand {{was engaged}} by the {{battleship}} [...] beginning at 5:08 during {{what came to}} be called the 'Run to the North', but she was not hit, although she was straddled several times. Beatty's ships maintained full speed to try <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then northeast to try and rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. At 5:40 they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his maneuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 6:35 Beatty was following Indomitable and [...] of the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. Twenty minutes later Scheer ordered another 180° turn which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course itself to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T and they badly damaged his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap in which he had sent them.|$|E
500|$|Heavy {{criticism}} was {{directed toward the}} script, dialogue, and cutscene length. McShea felt that the unskippable cutscenes and [...] "the overabundance of story in Other M were a negative deviation from Metroid tradition". Kollar states that they [...] "often run as long as 15 minutes, exhausting players with repetition of obvious plot points and overwrought dialogue as mature and interesting as a teenager’s diary". Justin Haywald of 1UP.com complained that as the game progresses [...] "instead of getting more {{of the things that}} work , you get more of the things you don't care about [...] ". Donlan notes that the plot is considered as [...] "the future's dumbest soap opera". Wolinsky echoes the misgivings about Samus' immaturity, petulant behavior, and misguided loyalty. Tae K. Kim of GamePro writes that while the story and Samus' monologues did not compel them, [...] "it helped contextualize her entire existence" [...] which developed the character to [...] "an actual human being who's using the vastness of space to try <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> distance between herself and the past". Contrarily, Haywald found the portrayal [...] "lifeless and boring" [...] and [...] "nonsensical". G4tv's Abbie Heppe was critical on Samus's portrayal; she wrote that Samus [...] "cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man", and found that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals. In Zero Punctuation, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw derided the game's story as a [...] "bloated, cancerous mass [...] turning [...] into a shrieking mimsy in a submissive relationship with a bellend in a fancy cap."

God answered: [...] "Is there a limit to the Lord's power?" [...] Moses gathered the 70 elders, and God came down in a cloud, spoke to Moses, and drew upon the spirit that was on Moses and put it upon the elders. When the spirit rested upon them, they spoke in ecstasy, but did not continue. Eldad and Medad had remained in camp, yet the spirit rested upon them, and they spoke in ecstasy in the camp.
