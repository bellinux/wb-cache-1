5|$|In 1880, Crane {{illustrated}} and Evans printed, The Baby's Bouquet: a Fresh Bunch of Old Rhymes and Tunes, {{which went}} on to sell {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies. The book shows influences ranging from the Pre-Raphaelites, Japanese art to the incipient arts and crafts movement. In 1889, Flora's Feast: A Masque of Flowers was published, featuring flowers represented as human figures, for which Evans used <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>eight</b> colour blocks.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>eight</b> males {{will be at}} a mating site, {{staying in}} close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E

50|$|The {{bolt pattern}} determines {{the number and}} {{position}} of the mounting holes to allow the wheel to be bolted to the hub. As the bolts are evenly spaced, the number of bolts determines the pattern. For example: smaller cars have three (Citroën 2CV, Renault 4, some Peugeot 106s and Citroën Saxos). Compact cars may have four bolts. Most United States passenger cars have five bolts. Pickup trucks, large SUVs, and armored vehicles may have <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> five, six, <b>eight,</b> or ten. It is not unheard of to find vehicles with even more, such as enormous coal mining transporters that may have twelve.|$|R
50|$|Symposia are an {{important}} part of the ICES work programme, not least because they foster the broadening of the diversity of scientists who participate in ICES activities. ICES welcomes proposals for stimulating symposia on topics that are fundamental to the science components of the ICES Strategic Plan including (a) understanding the physical, chemical, and biological functioning of marine ecosystems, (b) understanding and quantifying human impacts on marine ecosystems, including living marine resources, and (c) evaluating options for sustainable marine-related industries, particularly fishing and mariculture.

60|$|The minute {{two-armed}} glands on {{the valve}} were also {{affected by the}} solution; for they now contained several, sometimes <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> six or <b>eight,</b> almost spherical masses of translucent matter, tinged with yellow, which slowly changed their forms and positions. Such masses were never observed in these glands in their ordinary state. We may therefore infer that they serve for absorption. Whenever a little water is expelled from a bladder containing animal remains (by the means formerly specified, more especially by the generation of bubbles of air), it will fill the cavity in which the valve lies; and thus the glands {{will be able to}} utilise decayed matter which otherwise would have been wasted.|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and NADH dehydrogenase subunit I sequence variation among 29 {{populations of}} a widely ranging southwestern springsnail {Pyrgulopsis micrococcus) and 18 regional congeners. Cladistic analyses of these sequences depict P. micrococcus as a polyphyletic composite of five well-supported clades. Sequence divergences among these clades and subclades imply the possible occurrence of <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> seven or <b>eight</b> cryptic species {{in addition to}} P. micrococcus. Our finding that P. micrococcus contains multiple, genetically distinct and geographically restricted lineages suggests that diversification within this highly speciose aquatic genus has been structured {{in large part by}} the operation of terrestrial barriers to gene flow. However, these sequence data also indi-cate that recent dispersal among hydrographically separated areas has occurred within one of these lineages, which we attribute to passive transport on migratory waterbirds...|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} making {{charcoal}} demanded great skill and vast quantities of trees. During winter months, wood was cut and stacked. When colliers selected a site for the hearth, they stacked the wood into a conical shape by standing the sticks on end around a central chimney.

These men usually managed <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>eight</b> or nine hearths at one time. To keep the fires smoldering, fires were carefully controlled 24 hours a day for ten days to two weeks -the time needed to produce the charred wood or charcoal.|$|E

The manufacturing and transportation facilities of the South were not capable of this ambitious program, however.

If a man can read that sober, cautious statement and not be convinced, then assuredly his brain, is out of gear. Finally, ask yourself whether any religious manifestation in the world has had anything like the absolute proof which lies in this one. Cannot the orthodox see that instead of combating such a story, or talking nonsense about devils, they should hail that which is indeed the final answer to that materialism which is their really dangerous enemy. Even as I write, my eye falls upon a letter on my desk from an officer who had lost all faith in immortality and become an absolute materialist.

40|$|A longitudinal, {{community-based}} {{study of}} the epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) in children < 5 years old {{was carried out in}} a community of low socioeco-nomic level in Ibadan, Nigeria.

The most common symptoms were cough, nasal discharge, and fever, while the most common signs referable to the respiratory tract were abnormal breathing sounds, tachypnea, and chest retraction.

40|$|SummaryPatients with {{coronary}} artery disease {{and a history of}} stroke account for <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> one in <b>eight</b> of all patients with {{coronary artery}} disease, and they are at higher risk of ischaemic events than patients with ‘lone’ {{coronary artery disease}}. It is therefore tempting to increase the potency of antithrombotic treatment in this patient subset. However, these patients are also at greater risk of intracranial haemorrhage. In recent trials of new antithrombotic agents in acute coronary syndromes, patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease derived no clinical benefit from (and were even harmed by) the potent novel antithrombotic agents, with an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage. However, this risk {{did not appear to be}} uniform: it was higher in patients with a history of stroke than in those with a history of transient ischaemic attack, and appeared to be largely confined to the first year after stroke/transient ischaemic attack.
