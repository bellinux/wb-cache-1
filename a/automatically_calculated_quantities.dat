Although we need the power of a full programming language to specify strategies, we carefully distinguish between context-free and non-contextfree sublanguages of our strategy language.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{effective}} model, {{which is an}} extension of the usual linear sigma model, that contains a low energy multiplet for every hadronic particle type. These multiplets are a scalar nonet, a pseudoscalar nonet, a vector nonet, an axialvector nonet, a baryon octet and a baryon decuplet. Tree level baryon masses and possible two body decuplet decays are calculated. The baryon masses are generated through spontaneous symmetry breaking. The <b>calculated</b> <b>quantities</b> are used to determine the model parameters through a multiparametric minimalization process, which compares the <b>calculated</b> physical <b>quantities</b> with their experimental values.

40|$|Objective. To develop {{automatic}} {{visceral fat}} volume calculation software for computed tomography (CT) volume data and to evaluate its feasibility. Methods. A total of 24 sets of whole-body CT volume data and anthropometric measurements were obtained, with three sets {{for each of}} four BMI categories (under 20, 20 to 25, 25 to 30, and over 30) in both sexes. True visceral fat volumes were defined {{on the basis of}} manual segmentation of the whole-body CT volume data by an experienced radiologist. Software to <b>automatically</b> <b>calculate</b> visceral fat volumes was developed using a region segmentation technique based on morphological analysis with CT value threshold. <b>Automatically</b> <b>calculated</b> visceral fat volumes were evaluated in terms of the correlation coefficient with the true volumes and the error relative to the true volume. Results. Automatic visceral fat volume calculation results of all 24 data sets were obtained successfully and the average calculation time was 252. 7 seconds/case. The correlation coefficients between the true visceral fat volume and the <b>automatically</b> <b>calculated</b> visceral fat volume were over 0. 999. Conclusions. The newly developed software is feasible for calculating visceral fat volumes in a reasonable time and was proved to have high accuracy...|$|R
