5|$|Bupropion is metabolized in {{the liver}} by the {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzyme CYP2B6. It has several active metabolites: R,R-hydroxybupropion, S,S-hydroxybupropion, threo-hydrobupropion and erythro-hydrobupropion, which are further metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated through excretion into the urine. Both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act {{in the liver}} as potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes not only bupropion itself but also {{a variety of other}} drugs and biologically <b>active</b> <b>substances.</b> This mechanism creates the potential for a variety of drug interactions.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the nitrogen cycle. Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{historical records}} of herbs are found from the Sumerian civilisation, {{where hundreds of}} medicinal plants including opium are listed on clay tablets. The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt describes over 850 plant medicines, while Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in De materia medica, forming the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research makes use of ethnobotany to search for pharmacologically <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> in nature, and has in this way discovered hundreds of useful compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, digoxin, quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a composition {{consisting of a}} dendrimer provided with blocking agents and an <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> occluded in the dendrimer.

25|$|The <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> in tobacco, {{especially}} cigarettes, {{are administered}} by {{burning the leaves}} and inhaling the vaporized gas that results. This quickly and effectively delivers substances into the bloodstream by absorption through the alveoli in the lungs. The lungs contain some 300 million alveoli, which amounts to a surface area of over 70m2 (about {{the size of a}} tennis court). This method is not completely efficient as not all of the smoke will be inhaled, and some amount of the <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> will be lost in the process of combustion, pyrolysis. Pipe and Cigar smoke are not inhaled because of its high alkalinity, which are irritating to the trachea and lungs. However, because of its higher alkalinity (pH 8.5) compared to cigarette smoke (pH 5.3), non-ionized nicotine is more readily absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth. Nicotine absorption from cigar and pipe, however, is much less than that from cigarette smoke. Nicotine and cocaine activate similar patterns of neurons, which supports the existence of common substrates among these drugs.|$|E

An array of pharmacologically <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> is injected with the saliva of the tick, including anticoagulants, PGE2, prostacyclin, apyrase and in certain tick species antihistamines.

25|$|This chromatographic process {{relies on}} the {{property}} of biologically <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> to form stable, specific, and reversible complexes. The formation of these complexes involves the participation of common molecular forces such as the Van der Waals interaction, electrostatic interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and the hydrogen bond. An efficient, biospecific bond is formed by a simultaneous and concerted action of several of these forces in the complementary binding sites.|$|E
25|$|Many of the <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> {{in black}} tea do not develop at {{temperatures}} lower than 90°C (194°F). As a result, black {{tea in the}} West is usually steeped in water near its boiling point, at around 99°C (210°F). The most common fault when making black tea is to use water at too low a temperature. Since boiling point drops with increasing altitude, {{it is difficult to}} brew black tea properly in mountainous areas. Warming the tea pot before steeping is critical at any elevation.|$|E

25|$|In 1919, Weed and McKibben, {{biomedical}} {{researchers at}} Johns Hopkins Medical School, {{were the first}} ones to document the use and effect of osmotically <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> on brain mass. While studying transfer of salt solutions from blood to Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), they first noted that concentrated sodium chloride intravenous (IV) injection led to collapse of the thecal sac which prevented them from withdrawing CSF from the lumbar cistern. In order to further study the effect, they conducted lab experiments on anesthetized cats which underwent craniotomy. They observed changes to the convexity of cat's brain upon IV injection, specifically, they noted that Hypertonic Saline IV injection resulted in maximum shrinkage of the brain in 15-30 mins, while administration of hypotonic solutions resulted in protrusion and rupture of the brain tissue. By 1927, use of osmotic agents in IV delivery became official.|$|E
