40|$|The tuna {{industry}} in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) {{is one of the}} largest and most valuable fisheries in the world. Since the 1980 s, Pacific island countries have used licensing agreements with foreign fishing interests [...] known as <b>access</b> <b>agreements</b> [...] to earn tuna-related revenue and control the environmental impacts of fishing, with only minimal success. To date, there has been little work detailing the structure of <b>access</b> <b>agreements</b> and assessing how this structure relates to economic and environmental outcomes in the sector. This article helps to fill this gap by providing an overview of various access structures and a detailed empirical assessment of how these structures are applied in <b>access</b> <b>agreements</b> between Pacific island countries and the major foreign fishing interests active in the WCPO. This analysis is placed in the context of evolving regional fisheries management structures. The study reveals that while there is no uniform formula for <b>access</b> <b>agreements,</b> each structure is subject to distinct political, economic and environmental considerations that influence outcomes for Pacific island countries. As Pacific island countries develop the mechanism to allocate fishing rights under the new Vessel Day Scheme, drawing on their long history with <b>access</b> <b>agreements</b> will assist efforts to use access to achieve policy objectives. Improved transparency will enable Pacific island countries to identify successes and problems and adapt the Vessel Day Scheme allocation mechanisms accordingly.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{introduction}} of <b>access</b> <b>agreements</b> following {{the establishment of the}} Office for Fair Access (OFFA) has consolidated how English higher education institutions (HEIs) position themselves in the marketplace in relation to widening participation. However, the absence of a national bursary scheme has led to obfuscation rather than clarification {{from the perspective of the}} consumer. This paper analyses OFFA's 2008 monitoring report and a sample of twenty HEIs' original 2006 and revised or updated <b>access</b> <b>agreements</b> (2008) to draw conclusions about the impact of these agreements on notions of 'fair access' and widening participation. The authors conclude that, unsurprisingly in an increasingly market-driven system, institutions use <b>access</b> <b>agreements</b> primarily to promote enrolment to their own programmes rather than to promote system-wide objectives. As a consequence of this marketing focus, previous differences between pre- 1992 and post- 1992 institutions in relation to widening participation and fair access are perpetuated, leading to both confusion for consumers and an inequitable distribution of bursary and other support mechanisms for the poorest applicants to HE. </p...|$|R
