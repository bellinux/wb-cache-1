Additionally, 76% disapproved of the military action Hezbollah took in Israel, compared to 38% who disapproved of Israel's military action in Lebanon. A poll in August 2006 by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 68% of the 1,002 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> for the civilian casualties in Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War, compared to 31% who blamed Israel to some degree.

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{asteroid}} bodies, {{the asteroid belt}} also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.|$|E

Initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> to environmental benefits.

Furthermore, the Lahn-Dill-Kreis, the Mayen-Koblenz district, the Rhein-Lahn-Kreis and the Limburg-Weilburg district each have shares of the Westerwald.

It typically reaches 25 cm in length, but has been recorded up to about 70 cm.|$|R
5|$|Vertebrates {{including}} {{several species of}} frog put on warning displays; some of these species have poison glands. Among the mammals, deimatic displays are found in species with strong defences, such as in foul-smelling skunks and spiny porcupines. Such displays are often combined with warning coloration. Thus these displays in both frogs and mammals are <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> aposematic.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering {{in the air with}} rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E

5|$|Falling attendances {{due to the}} {{commercial}} nature of the district, and also a sense {{that there was some}} redundancy of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, caused the Manchester diocese to review the status of St John's and its parish in the 1920s. Following an internal review and a public consultation, in 1927 it was formally proposed that the two parishes should be merged as St Matthew's parish. The diocese preferred to retain St Matthew's and demolish St John's, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because the former was a more recent construction. This was a reversal of a proposal made in 1919, when the predominantly transient Roman Catholic population of the St Matthew's parish was given as a reason to merge it into St John's.|$|E
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode {{the meaning of the}} warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{study was}} {{published}} that examined genetic variation among five Indian equine breeds—the Manipuri, Marwari, Spiti, Bhutia, and Zanskari. Based on analysis of microsatellite DNA, the Manipuri {{was found to}} have the greatest genetic distance from the Marwari, and a much closer genetic distance to the other three breeds. The distance from the Marwari was not only genetic, but seen in physical characteristics, particularly height and environmental adaptability. The physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries: the Marwari horse is closely associated with the Arabian, while the four other breeds are thought to have descended <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> from the Tibetan pony. None of the breeds in the study were found to be closely genetically associated with the Thoroughbred.|$|E

50|$|Tehsil/tahsil and taluka {{and their}} {{variants}} {{are used as}} English words without further translation. Since these terms are unfamiliar to English speakers outside the subcontinent, the word county has sometimes been provided as a gloss, {{on the basis that}} a tehsil, like a county, is an administrative unit hierarchically above the local city, town, or village, but subordinate to a larger state or province. India and Pakistan have an intermediate level of hierarchy (or more than one, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>parts</b> of India): the district, also sometimes translated as county.

50|$|Pesquet's parrot is {{a highly}} {{specialised}} frugivore, feeding almost exclusively on a few species of figs. Flowers and nectar have also been reported. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>parts</b> of its range, it is seasonally nomadic {{in response to the}} availability of fruits. The bare part of the head is presumably an adaptation to avoid feather-matting from sticky fruits. Little is known about its breeding habits in the wild, but the two eggs are laid in a nest in a large, hollow tree. It is typically seen in pairs or groups up to 20 individuals. In flight it alternates between rapid flapping and short glides.|$|R
