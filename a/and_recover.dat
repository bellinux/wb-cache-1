Let S(t), I(t), and R(t) denote the percentages of susceptible, infected, <b>and</b> <b>recovered</b> internal computers at time t, respectively, then S(t)+I(t)+R(t)≡ 1.|$|R

5|$|A notable {{innovation}} {{initiated by}} a city or a region {{is the creation}} of mixed public-private enterprises for urban water supply that has begun in 1995 in Cartagena, followed by Barranquilla and other Northern and Central cities and towns. Another innovation is an association of community-based organizations (CBOs) providing water supply in rural and peri-urban areas in the departments of El Valle, Cauca and Risaralda in Southwestern Colombia. It began in the late 1990s {{with the assistance of the}} Universidad del Valle in Cali in order to protect <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> source watersheds and to strengthen the CBOs' capacity to administrate, operate and maintain their water systems.|$|E

5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss is an important component of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Leiter {{alert the}} Thunderball war room of their suspicions of Largo {{and join the}} crew of the American nuclear {{submarine}} Manta as the ransom deadline nears.

5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public awareness {{to the experience of}} war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on {{the way in which the}} experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E

They encounter the second fiend, Sei-ryu; they defeat him <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> half of the second sphere. Upon returning to Ryu-O, he reveals himself to be the guardian of {{the other half of}} the sphere, and the two halves form the Blue Sphere.|$|E
5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E

Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping {{to use it to}} make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was naïve to think that way.|$|E
