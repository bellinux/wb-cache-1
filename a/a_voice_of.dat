5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E
5|$|She met Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal in 1949, {{they married}} in December 1950; subsequently, they had five {{children}} together. In 1952, on his father's death, Chamorro's husband inherited the newspaper La Prensa. He took over publishing and under his direction, the paper became <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> opposition to the Somoza regime. Chamorro Cardenal was frequently jailed between 1952 and 1957 for {{the content of the}} paper and in 1957 led a revolt against Somoza. His actions resulted in his exile to Costa Rica, where Chamorro joined him after settling their children with his mother. Two years were spent in Costa Rica, with Pedro writing against the regime and immediately upon their return he was jailed again. Chamorro's life throughout the 1960s and 1970s was a repetitive cycle of reunions with either her husband or children. She followed him; if he was forced to leave, she left the children with family and traveled to be with him; if he was jailed, she was reunited with the children and visited him. Chamorro's earnings from a rental property that her mother had given her gave the couple a steady income. When her husband was assassinated on 10 January 1978, she took over control of the newspaper.|$|E

25|$|The former New York City Opera {{artist has}} built a European career {{in recent years by}} taking on bel canto roles that other sopranos don't want to sing, mainly because they can't. Miss Anderson is made of braver stuff. The title role of Bellini's opera, written for Giuditta Pasta in 1833, lies {{extraordinarily}} high and probably was tailored for that legendary diva's voice. Miss Anderson...attacked Beatrice's brilliantly curlicued music with authority and <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> piercing power....

25|$|Official American {{reactions}} to the situation were mixed. In Vientiane, American officials, the Project Hotfoot teams, and the Programs Evaluation Office did not choose a side. However, a shadow PEO of about 40 Americans was formed in Savannakhet to support Phoumi because he was an avowed anti-communist. He began broadcasting anti-Kong Le radio messages on 18 August. Also on 18 August 1960, <b>a</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> America broadcast {{announced that it would}} support the King of Laos in his choice. The next day, Radio Pathet Lao began broadcasting anti-Kong Le propaganda. Kong Le had his own leaflets airdropped over Savannakhet on 19 August.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the rallies {{converging}} on Ayala Avenue {{was characterized by}} the exhaustion of the peculiar crony capitalism that evolved under Marcos' long reign. Following the assassination of Ninoy Aquino nearly a century later in 1983, the downtown area, where the rallies often happened, {{was one of the}} many places of rallies and mass demonstrations that were the basis of the People Power Revolution against the dictatorship of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1986. It was that decade that witnessed the emergence of a so-called moderate opposition, with the Makati Business Club, against Marcos' ailing authoritarian regime. Established in 1980, the MBC, a union of executives from business entities operating in the district, was then <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> opposition to the dictatorship, {{and it was one of}} the leading organizers of what was then dubbed the Confetti Revolution, so-named due to the yellow confetti from torn phone directories thrown along Ayala Avenue from the buildings in the wide road, whenever the rallies would happen.|$|E
25|$|The {{training}} of the boys was rigorous. The regimen of one singing school in Rome (c. 1700) consisted of one hour of singing difficult and awkward pieces, one hour practising trills, one hour practising ornamented passaggi, one hour of singing exercises in their teacher's presence {{and in front of}} a mirror so as to avoid unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces, and one hour of literary study; all this, moreover, before lunch. After, half-an-hour would be devoted to musical theory, another to writing counterpoint, an hour copying down the same from dictation, and another hour of literary study. During the remainder of the day, the young castrati had to find time to practice their harpsichord playing, and to compose vocal music, either sacred or secular depending on their inclination. This demanding schedule meant that, if sufficiently talented, they were able to make a debut in their mid-teens with a perfect technique and <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match.|$|E

[...] "He {{proved to be}} the possessor of an agreeable high voice, which he used with much skill in Italian airs," [...] wrote New York Times music critic Olin Downes, [...] "including that of Rodolfo from Puccini's La Boheme and others from Verdi's Trovatore and Rigoletto." [...] In recital at New York's Steinway Hall on February 21, 1926, Calleia [...] "displayed <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> pleasant and attractive timbre" [...] in a program that included works by Scarlatti, Paisiello, Schumann, Gounod and Leoncavallo, as well as two of his own compositions.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year Władysław {{took part in}} {{the second phase of the}} Polish–Ottoman War, a consequence of the long series of struggles between Poland and the Ottomans over Moldavia. In 1621 Władysław was one of the Polish commanders at the Battle of Chocim; reportedly he was struck ill, but despite that he proved <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> reason, convincing other Polish commanders there to stay and fight. His advice was correct, and the battle eventually ended with a peace treaty that returned the status quo from before the Ottoman invasion. This peace treaty also gave Władysław an international reputation as a [...] "defender of Christian faith", and increased his popularity in the Commonwealth itself.|$|E

She wanted the track {{to be a source}} of empowerment for people without <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> their own. It also gave rise to her SING Campaign which aimed to raise funds and awareness for issues surrounding HIV/AIDS.
