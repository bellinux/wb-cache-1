They therefore {{use the same}} root for both the imperfect and the present subjunctive: que je finisse vs. je finissais.|$|E

25|$|From the 1990s {{until late}} in his career, Schell {{appeared}} in many German-language made-for-TV films, such as the 2003 film <b>Alles</b> Glück dieser Erde (All the Luck in the World) opposite Uschi Glas and in the television miniseries The Return of the Dancing Master (2004), {{which was based on}} Henning Mankell's novel.

25|$|The dynasty was now {{en route}} to become a world power. The concept of pietas austriacae (the divine duty to rule had {{originated}} with Rudolph I, but was reformulated by Frederick as AEIOU, <b>Alles</b> Erdreich ist Österreich untertan or Austriae est imperare orbi universo (Austria's destiny is to rule the world), which came to symbolise Austrian power. However, not all events proceeded smoothly for Frederick. The Austrian-Hungarian War (1477–1488) resulted in the Hungarian king, Matthias Corvinus setting himself up in Vienna in 1485 till his death in 1490. Frederick therefore found himself with an itinerant court, predominantly in the Upper Austrian capital of Linz.|$|E

Later, at 04:35, Oberst Eriksen received a message from the Norwegian minesweeper HNoMS Otra confirming that the intruding ships were German. The message had been sent to the naval base in Horten at 04:10, but the massive communications problems that severely hampered the efforts of the Norwegian military throughout the Norwegian Campaign had prevented it from reaching Oscarsborg in time.|$|E
25|$|The March 2013 {{edition of}} Premier Guitar {{featured}} {{a cover story}} written by Landman about a guitar modification he did on request of the magazine.

25|$|In 1988 {{she was one}} of {{the editors}} who was {{involved}} in setting up RIAS-TV where she presented the evening news program Abendschau and later the breakfast TV show Frühstückfernsehen. Several times during her career she took the risk to leave established shows for new productions where she had more influence, like her move from the well established heute journal to the heute nacht news show. Her daily lifestyle magazine Leute heute became very successful after it was at first less popular than expected and in 1995 the 2000th episode was shown. Ruge finished nearly every edition of her show Leute heute with the quote <b>Alles</b> wird gut (Everything will turn out fine) which became her trademark and which she also used for some of her book titles. In November 2006 Ruge announced to end her work for Leute heute on 3 February 2007 in order to have more time for her private life.|$|E
