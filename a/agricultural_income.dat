5|$|Records from 1801 {{show that}} at that time {{agriculture}} was {{the main component of}} Puddletown's economy, though cottage industry and artisan crafts were also an important element: 596 people in the parish were primarily employed in agriculture, with 221 employed in handicrafts, manufacture and trade. Cottage industry, often undertaken by women and children, was used to supplement <b>agricultural</b> <b>income,</b> though there were fewer opportunities for this after the French Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{key role}} women have in farming is to {{maintain}} ownership of the main sources of production in rural areas. In traditional China, women {{were not allowed to}} own land or property. Land was inherited through the sons, and if there was no son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less populated areas, women do more agricultural work than men because of shifting cultivation. In more populated areas, men do more work than women because extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement is high in the double-cropping rice area. Other types of work women perform in the countryside include pig and poultry rearing, spinning, weaving, basket-making, and other handicrafts. This type of work supplements <b>agricultural</b> <b>income.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{troubles}} {{were followed}} in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe {{during the following}} three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, {{about one-third of the}} population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into <b>agricultural</b> <b>income.</b> Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague {{throughout the rest of the}} 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.|$|E

Still, the number of Vermont dairy farms has declined more than 85% from the 11,206 dairy farms operating in 1947. In 2003 there were fewer than 1,500 dairy farms in the state; in 2006 there were 1,138; and in 2007 there were 1,087. The number of dairy farms has been diminishing by 10% annually.|$|E
500|$|A concern {{around the}} turn of the 20th century was that many {{woodworking}} facilities in Indiana would be forced to close due to dwindling timber supplies. [...] This wood was used by furniture makers and shipbuilders such as the Howard Shipyards. The timber industry was a major part of southern Indiana's <b>agricultural</b> <b>income,</b> but thousands of acres had been deforested. In response to the problem, the state of Indiana decided to establish a series of state forests to ensure the continued existence of timber for woodworking facilities, and to allow Indiana to maintain its ability to export hardwood.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effects of {{different}} exchange rate scenarios on projections for <b>agricultural</b> <b>incomes</b> and prices in a small highly export dependent region, NI. The modelling system used in the analysis is designed to capture {{the complexities of the}} relationship between exchange rates and <b>agricultural</b> prices and <b>incomes.</b> The system models not only the main agricultural sectors in NI but also the demand for and supply of agricultural commodities in the EU and beyond. This is important, given that NI is a price taker and the EU is the main export destination for its agricultural production. The analysis serves to underline the importance of exchange rates for the NI agricultural economy. When the euro is weak against sterling then <b>agricultural</b> sector <b>incomes</b> are substantially lower than when the euro is strong against sterling. Approximately, a one per cent weakening/strengthening of the euro against sterling is projected to reduce/increase aggregate net receipts in the dairy, beef and sheep sectors by one per cent. This means that exchange rate movements, which are outside the control of the agricultural community, have a dramatic affect on <b>agricultural</b> <b>incomes</b> in NI. This conclusion should be considered against the backdrop of a 28 % drop (approx.) {{in the value of the}} euro against the pound that has occurred since 1995. The impact of exchange rate movements on producer prices appears to be less pronounced. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the structure and}} construction of a social accounting matrix (SAM) for Pakistan for 2001 - 02. A SAM is an internally consistent extended set of national accounts that disaggregates value-added in each production activity into payments to various factors (e. g., land, labour, capital), and disaggregates household incomes and expenditures according to various household types. Because this Pakistan SAM is designed for analysis of the links between growth and rural poverty, agricultural activities, agricultural factors of production, and rural household accounts are more disaggregated than are those for urban activities and households. Rural household groups in the SAM are split according to three regions (Punjab, Sindh, and Other Pakistan) to capture the large differences {{in the structure of}} <b>agricultural</b> production and <b>incomes</b> across Pakistan. On average, household incomes in the SAM are 2. 1 times greater than household expenditures in the HIES Survey, reflecting the apparent substantial under-reporting of expenditures (particularly on services) and informal sector incomes in the HIES and other household surveys. <b>Agricultural</b> factor <b>incomes</b> as calculated in the SAM account for only 23 percent of total factor incomes in Pakistan, but 60 percent of total factor <b>incomes</b> for <b>agricultural</b> households. 91 percent of <b>agricultural</b> <b>incomes</b> derive from land, water, own-farm labour, or livestock; earnings of hired labour and (nonlivestock) agricultural capital account for only 9 percent of <b>agricultural</b> <b>incomes.</b> Incomes of large- and medium-farm rural households, calculated using land area cultivated, data from the Agricultural Census, and other data, are significantly higher than indicated in household surveys. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} major land use change {{processes}} over the 1990 – 2008 period in Abruzzo region (Central Italy) {{in relation to}} the characteristics of the soils and with particular regard to their capability for agricultural purposes, in order to highlight their implications on agricultural productivity. The relative changes in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>incomes</b> and land values were also estimated. To this end, we proposed an inventory approach as a flexible and feasible way for monitoring land use changes at multiple scales. As main outcomes, the shrinkage of agricultural lands and their internal changes (intensification vs. extensification processes) were highlighted. The shrinkage of agricultural lands was strictly related to: (a) reforestation process in mountain areas and less productive lands after land abandonment; and (b) urbanization on plains and more productive lands. Although the intensification process was demonstrated to {{have a positive effect on}} the overall regional <b>agricultural</b> <b>incomes,</b> especially on high quality soils, this was not adequate to compensate the economic loss due to the other land use changes, especially in marginal areas and low-to-medium quality soils.
