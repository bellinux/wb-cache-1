5|$|Zwingli's {{views on}} baptism were largely a {{response}} to Anabaptism, a movement which attacked the practice of infant baptism. He defended the baptism of children by describing it as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Christian's covenant with disciples and God just as God made a covenant with Abraham.|$|E
5|$|Roy Kilner (17 October 1890 â€“ 5 April 1928) was an English {{professional}} cricketer {{who played}} nine Test matches for England between 1924 and 1926. An all-rounder, {{he played for}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 1911 and 1927. In all first-class matches, he scored 14,707 runs {{at an average of}} 30.01 and took 1,003 wickets at an average of 18.45. Kilner scored 1,000 runs in a season ten times and took 100 wickets in a season five times. On four occasions, he completed the double: scoring 1,000 runs and taking 100 wickets in the same season, recognised as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quality all-rounder.|$|E
5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes are <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, {{can be more}} autonomous {{than those in the}} general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E

5|$|Both {{independent}} and dependent colony foundation can occur after mating. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns {{have been recorded}} with M. pilosula queens, where nests that tend to be closer together were more genetically {{related to each other}} in comparison to other nests further away. Independent colony foundation is closely associated with queens which engage in nuptial flight in areas far from their home colony, showing that dependent colony foundation mostly occurs if they mate near their nest. In some cases, queens could seek adoption into alien colonies if there are no suitable areas to find a nest or independent colony foundation cannot be carried out. Other queens could try and return to their home nest after nuptial flight, but they may end up in another nest near the nest they originally came from. In multiple-queen societies, the egg-laying queens are generally unrelated to one another, but one study showed that it is possible for multiple queens in the same colony to be genetically related to each other. Depending on the species, the number of individuals present in a colony can range from 50 to over 2,200 individuals. A colony with less than 100 workers is not considered a mature colony. M. dispar colonies have around 15 to 329 ants, M. nigrocincta have over 1,000, M. pyriformis have from 200 to over 1,400 and M. gulosa have nearly 1,600. A colony can last for a number of years. Foraging behaviour among smaller workers which never usually leave the nest can be <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> colony's impending demise.|$|E

25|$|Arginine {{is also a}} {{precursor}} for urea, ornithine, and agmatine; {{is necessary for the}} synthesis of creatine; and can also be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine), citrulline, and glutamate. The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as L-arginine is considered <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> healthy endothelium.|$|E
25|$|Parametric {{methods to}} infer HGT use {{characteristics}} of the genome sequence specific to particular species or clades, also called genomic signatures. If a fragment of the genome strongly deviates from the genomic signature, this is <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> potential horizontal transfer. For example, because bacterial GC content falls within a wide range (see Figure 2), GC content of a genome segment is a simple genomic signature. Commonly used genomic signatures include nucleotide composition, oligonucleotide frequencies, or structural features of the genome.|$|E

25|$|In both {{segmentation}} and paging, certain {{protected mode}} registers specify to the CPU what memory address it should allow a running program to access. Attempts to access other addresses trigger an interrupt which cause the CPU to re-enter supervisor mode, placing the kernel in charge. This {{is called a}} segmentation violation or Seg-V for short, and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation, {{and because it is}} usually <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> misbehaving program, the kernel generally resorts to terminating the offending program, and reports the error.|$|E
25|$|The three escallop shells upon a fess {{were taken}} from the armorial {{bearings}} of the La Trobe family and signify the La Trobe name. What is also important about the escallops is that they are <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pilgrim and the journey that an individual must undertake to achieve spiritual, {{or in the case of}} the university, intellectual enlightenment. It is the idea of the journey that is particularly significant within the university's arms, as evidenced by the escallop shell clasped by the eagle in the crest.|$|E
25|$|Psychosis as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{psychiatric}} {{disorder is}} {{a diagnosis of}} exclusion. That is, a new-onset episode of psychosis is not considered {{a symptom of a}} psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded. Medical and biological laboratory tests should exclude central nervous system diseases and injuries, diseases and injuries of other organs, psychoactive substances, and toxins as causes of symptoms of psychosis before any psychiatric illness can be diagnosed. In medical training, psychosis as a sign of illness is often compared to fever since both can have multiple causes that are not readily apparent.|$|E

Genital tuberculosis, often caused by direct genital contact with infected sputum, can also present as genital ulcer.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a close}} {{relationship}} between traffic analysis and cryptanalysis (commonly called codebreaking). Callsigns and addresses are frequently encrypted, requiring assistance in identifying them. Traffic volume can often be <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> addressee's importance, giving hints to pending objectives or movements to cryptanalysts.|$|R
25|$|An {{increase}} in lymphocyte concentration is usually <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> viral infection (in some rare case, leukemias are found through an abnormally raised lymphocyte count {{in an otherwise}} normal person). A high lymphocyte count with a low neutrophil count might be caused by lymphoma. Pertussis toxin (PTx) of Bordetella pertussis, formerly known as lymphocytosis-promoting factor, causes {{a decrease in the}} entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes, which can lead to a condition known as lymphocytosis, with a complete lymphocyte count of over 4000 per Î¼l in adults or over 8000 per Î¼l in children. This is unique in that many bacterial infections illustrate neutrophil-predominance instead.|$|E
25|$|The Ashanti {{government}} was built upon a sophisticated bureaucracy in Kumasi, with separate ministries {{to handle the}} state's affairs. Of particular note was Ashanti's Foreign Office based in Kumasi; despite its small size, it allowed the state to pursue complex negotiations with foreign powers. The Office was divided into departments to handle relations separately with the British, French, Dutch, and Arabs. Scholars of Ashanti history, such as Larry Yarak and Ivor Wilkes, disagree over {{the power of this}} sophisticated bureaucracy in comparison to the Asantahene, but agree that it was <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> highly developed government with a complex system of checks and balances.|$|E
25|$|Palynology is {{the study}} of {{contemporary}} and fossil palynomorphs, including pollen. Palynology is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant species, which vary under different climate conditions. Different groups of plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures, and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material, they resist decay. Changes in the type of pollen found in different layers of sediment in lakes, bogs, or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities. These changes are often <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> changing climate. As an example, palynological studies have been used to track changing vegetation patterns throughout the Quaternary glaciations and especially since the last glacial maximum.|$|E

50|$|The prejudices of the Ovambos {{towards the}} {{hospital}} had now lessened. For example, they allowed themselves to be carried to the hospital on stretchers. Earlier they had taken this as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inevitable death. Neither did they leave the hospital when someone died there.|$|R
30|$|Frequently, pes cavus may be <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{underlying}} neurological disorder, including {{spinal cord}} and peripheral nerve pathologies, such us spino-cerebellar ataxia and hereditary peripheral neuropathies. A previous retrospective analysis of patients undergoing pes cavus surgery [2] revealed that almost one-third of apparently idiopathic cases {{suffered from a}} neurological disease.|$|R
25|$|Grand Forks grew {{rapidly in}} its early years. Growth was spurred by waves of {{immigrants}} and Americans from the eastern portion of the country, the steamboat traffic on the river, and {{the coming of the}} railroad. The St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway (Great Northern Railway) reached Grand Forks in 1880 and the Northern Pacific Railway came in 1887. The first settlers of Grand Forks were farmers and working men, but merchants and professional people from Minneapolis and other cities soon populated the city. After the arrival of the railroad, old wood-frame buildings were quickly replaced with brick buildings. The Hotel Dacotah, the St. John's Block, and the Security Building - all five stories - dominated the community's skyline and were <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> growing city.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the {{government}} has fostered new information technology and business projects to attract new investment. The introduction of Burger King in TÃ³rshavn was widely publicized {{as a sign of}} the globalization of Faroese culture. It remains to be seen whether these projects will succeed in broadening the islands' economic base. The islands have one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, but this should not necessarily be taken as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recovering economy, as many young students move to Denmark and other countries after leaving high school. This leaves a largely middle-aged and elderly population that may lack the skills and knowledge to fill newly developed positions on the Faroes. Nonetheless, in 2008 the Faroes were able to make a $52 million loan to Iceland to help with that country's banking woes.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, it {{was assumed}} that extinct reptile groups were cold-blooded like modern reptiles. New {{research}} during the past decades has led to the conclusion that some groups, such as theropod dinosaurs and pterosaurs, were very likely warm-blooded. Whether perhaps plesiosaurs were warm-blooded as well, is difficult to determine. One of the indications of a high metabolism is the presence of fast-growing fibrolamellar bone. The pachyostosis with juvenile individuals makes it hard to establish whether plesiosaurs possessed such bone, though. However, it has been possible to check its occurrence with more basal members of the more inclusive group plesiosaurs belonged to, the Sauropterygia. A study in 2010 concluded that fibrolamellar bone was originally present with sauropterygians. A subsequent publication in 2013 found that the Nothosauridae lacked this bone type, but that basal Pistosauria possessed it, <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more elevated metabolism. It is thus more parsimonious to assume that the more derived pistosaurians, the plesiosaurs, also had a faster metabolism.|$|E
