5|$|Olaf's {{father is}} {{identifiable}} as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. Gofraid was a grandson of Ímar but no patronymic {{is given in}} the original sources. This may be because he was <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he was <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> a daughter of Ímar, which in either case would mean his legitimacy to rule {{in the eyes of}} his contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents. Ímar, possibly identical to Ivar the Boneless, was the founder of the Uí Ímair {{and was one of the}} earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in the New York area, Washington founded a company producing kerosene gas mantles. At this time, they lived in New Brighton on Staten Island, but his company, George Washington Lighting Company, was based in nearby Jersey City. This business was abandoned with the maturation of incandescent light bulb technology. Washington also had a camera company for a time. By {{the time of the}} 1900 US Census, Washington, recorded in the census as an inventor, was 29 years old and living in a rented house in Brooklyn with his 23-year-old wife, their three young children, his younger sister (age 25), three servants, and <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> two of the servants.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>child’s</b> ‘concept <b>of</b> pain’ {{refers to}} how they {{understand}} what pain actually is, what function pain serves, and what biological processes are thought to underpin it. We aimed to determine pediatric pain experts’ opinions of: (1) the importance and usefulness <b>of</b> assessing <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> concept <b>of</b> pain in clinical and/or research settings; (2) {{the usefulness of the}} content of items within currently published adult-targeted resources for assessing <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> concept <b>of</b> pain; and (3) important domains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> concept <b>of</b> pain to assess. Forty-nine pediatric pain experts (response rate = 75. 4 %) completed an online survey. Descriptive statistics and frequency of responses were analyzed. Experts from all included disciplines reported that assessing <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> concept <b>of</b> pain is important and useful both clinically and in a research setting (> 80 % reported very or extremely useful for each item). Experts considered that the content of 13 items from currently published adult-targeted resources was useful, but the wording was too complex for children aged 8 – 12 years. Experts considered that all seven of the proposed domains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> concept <b>of</b> pain was important to assess. The findings can be used to inform the development of an assessment tool for <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> concept <b>of</b> pain...|$|R
5|$|Amir {{was born}} as Tengkoe Amir Hamzah Pangeran Indra Poetera in Tanjung Pura, Langkat, North Sumatra, the {{youngest}} son of Vice Sultan Tengku Muhammad Adil and {{his third wife}} Tengku Mahjiwa. Through his father, he {{was related to the}} Sultan of Langkat, Machmud. Sources disagree over his date of birth. The date officially recognised by the Indonesian government is 28 February 1911, a date Amir used throughout his life. However, his elder brother Abdullah Hod states that the poet was born on 11 February 1911. Amir later took the name of his grandfather, Teungku Hamzah, as a second name; thus, he was referred to as Amir Hamzah. Though <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> nobility, he would often associate with non-nobles.|$|E

Roose blames Ramsay for losing Sansa Stark, who, as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> Eddard Stark, could have been used as a figure-head for the North. As such, Roose implies that he will disinherit Ramsay if he cannot retrieve her and his unborn child is a son.|$|E

5|$|Strabo {{married into}} equally illustrious families. He may have married a {{daughter}} of Quintus Aelius Tubero, allying himself with the more prestigious Aelian gens. Lucius Seius Tubero, who became suffect consul in AD 18, was probably his son. Strabo's last wife was Cosconia Gallita, sister of Servius Cornelius Lentulus Maluginensis (suffect consul in AD 10) and Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio (suffect consul in AD 2) and perhaps half-sister of Quintus Junius Blaesus (suffect consul in AD 10). Sejanus could have been <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> this marriage. He was later adopted into the Aelian gens by Gaius Aelius Gallus, and by Roman custom became known as Lucius Aelius Seianus or simply as Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|The clause's meaning {{with regard}} to <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> legal {{immigrants}} was tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898).

Subsequent decisions have applied the principle to the children of foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{religious}} imagery, the frescoes of the Donja Kamenica church {{also include}} eleven portraits of contemporary historical figures, separated into four compositions. Three of the compositions are uncaptioned, making {{the identification of}} the people practically impossible. The first composition is located in the cella and depicts two men preserved from the waist up, of which one holds a model of the church, and <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>of</b> which only the head is visible today. The second composition was painted on the upper west wall of the narthex and portrays a man, a woman, a boy and a girl, with the man also holding a model of the church, a common symbol of donorship. Art historian Dragana Frfulanović believes that the images of men holding models in both compositions depict the same person, the main donor. The third composition is in the cella and depicts two men: a monk and a priest.|$|E
5|$|Consumed with remorse, {{the king}} sought {{to rectify the}} {{situation}} by arranging a marriage between his brother's orphaned son and Andriamanelo's own sister (the orphan's aunt), Rafotsindrindramanjaka. He declared that the child from this union would, if female, be wed to his own son Ralambo; if male, he would become Ralambo's successor. A girl was born, and she was promised to Ralambo as his future wife with the stipulation that the child born of their union would rule after Ralambo. In this way Andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected the queens' decree by ensuring that <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> his brother's line (and his own) would rule after him. Because of this decree, Ralambo's first son by his second wife was passed over {{in the line of}} succession in favor of Andrianjaka, Ralambo's son by Rafotsindrindramanjaka. Andriamanelo was also reportedly the first to formally establish the andriana as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society. From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.|$|E
5|$|In Krishna charitas, Krishna is born to Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva of the Chandravanshi clan. Devaki's {{brother is}} a tyrant named Kamsa. At Devaki's wedding, {{according}} to Puranic legends, Kamsa is told by fortune tellers that <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> Devaki would kill him. Kamsa arranges to kill all of Devaki's children. When Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna and exchanges him. When Kamsa tries {{to kill the}} newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess Durga, warning him that his death has arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with Nanda and his wife Yasoda near modern-day Mathura. Two of Krishna's siblings also survive, namely Balarama and Subhadra, according to these legends. The day of birth of Krishna is celebrated as Krishna Janmashtami.|$|E
40|$|According to Hoffman's {{theory of}} moral internalisation, parents' victim-orientated {{disciplinary}} strategies may stimulate <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to take another's needs into account.
