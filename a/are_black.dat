60|$|My face confessing a {{surprised}} {{desire to have}} some friendly conversation with Waterloo Bridge, and my friend Pea being the most obliging of men, we put about, {{pulled out of the}} force of the stream, and in place of going at great speed with the tide, began to strive against it, close in shore again. Every colour but black seemed to have departed from the world. The air <b>was</b> <b>black,</b> the water <b>was</b> <b>black,</b> the barges and hulks <b>were</b> <b>black,</b> the piles <b>were</b> <b>black,</b> the buildings <b>were</b> <b>black,</b> the shadows <b>were</b> only a deeper shade of black upon a black ground. Here and there, a coal fire in an iron cresset blazed upon a wharf; but, one knew that it too had <b>been</b> <b>black</b> a little while ago, and would <b>be</b> <b>black</b> again soon. Uncomfortable rushes of water suggestive of gurgling and drowning, ghostly rattlings of iron chains, dismal clankings of discordant engines, formed the music that accompanied the dip of our oars and their rattling in the rowlocks. Even the noises had a black sound to me - as the trumpet sounded red to the blind man.|$|R

5|$|The irises of {{its eyes}} are red, its feet <b>are</b> <b>black,</b> and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye {{has a single}} {{incomplete}} row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid. Its beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the scaly portions of its legs are often streaked white with uric acid.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{works have}} been more sombre and melancholic in colour and mood, with the {{emphasis}} being on {{the darker side of}} life. As {{in the words of the}} artist -- I am into infinity.
