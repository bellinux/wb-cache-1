5|$|By {{the time}} it was re-formed as No.1 AFTS, the flying school <b>at</b> <b>Point</b> Cook had also been made {{responsible}} for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this role was transferred to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956. Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command in September 1953. On 28May 1958, No.1 AFTS relocated to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by deHavilland Vampire jet trainers, which required a runway longer than that <b>at</b> <b>Point</b> Cook. The school's place <b>at</b> <b>Point</b> Cook was taken by No.1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19December. By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for these roles upon induction into the service; navigators therefore went straight to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school. On 31December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the flight instruction component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No.1 BFTS (for basic training) and No.1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.|$|E
5|$|CFS {{was inaugurated}} <b>at</b> <b>Point</b> Cook, Victoria, in March 1913, and trained over 150 pilots of the Australian Flying Corps during World WarI. It was disbanded in December 1919, {{and the newly}} formed RAAF's No.1 Flying Training School took on its {{function}} in 1921. Re-formed under EATS <b>at</b> <b>Point</b> Cook in April 1940, CFS relocated to New South Wales the following month, based first at Camden, then at Tamworth from April 1942, and finally at Parkes from January 1944. It returned to Point Cook in September 1944. By the end of World WarII, the school had produced more than 3,600 instructors. It transferred to East Sale in November 1947.|$|E
