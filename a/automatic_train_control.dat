5|$|According {{to transit}} {{advocate}} Steve Munro, the SSE {{will be built}} to use only <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>control.</b> This would preclude the operation of T1 subway cars on the extension {{as it would be}} too expensive to convert T1 cars to ATC.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 and 2001, Flytoget {{experienced}} three derailments {{with empty}} trains at Gardermoen; one {{caused by the}} engineer falling asleep and two by the train passing a red light. No more such accidents occurred after <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> was installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains {{are designed to}} be controlled by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|E
5000|$|LRT3 will be {{equipped}} with the latest technologies including Communications-Based <b>Train</b> <b>Controls</b> (CBTC), <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Controls</b> (ATC), Passenger Information Display System (PIDS), fire protection system and closed-circuit television (CCTV) system.|$|R
2500|$|The safety {{equipment}} in the driver's cab features either a mechanical or electronic deadman's device, punctiform <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>controls</b> (now compliant with the new regulations with software version PZB 90), and train radio equipment with GSM-R communication. [...] Relatively recently computers were added for the electronic timetable EBuLa, {{as well as the}} automatic door locking at 0km/h (TB0), which has become a compulsory requirement for all locomotives in passenger service. [...] A few units have also been equipped with computers for the control system CIR-ELKE.|$|R
50|$|The {{core of the}} {{electric}} system is the 3-blade main transformer with oil-cooling. The control unit has 30 power notches, semi-automatic in operation. The settings are thyristor controlled and the thyristor voltage is regulated by phase cutting, which was a novelty for series locomotives in the GDR. All units are equipped with a catenery-current-controlled electric brake. The safety equipment in the driver's cab has an electronic deadman's brake (Sifa), “punctiform” <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>controls</b> (PZB 90), and train radio equipment with GSM-R communication. Relatively recently, computers were added for the electronic timetable EBuLa.|$|R
5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>control</b> (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} {{introduction}} of S Stock trains, the track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines by 65 per cent by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface railway is to be established in Hammersmith and an <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>control</b> (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s. The cross-London Crossrail line, planned to open in 2018, is expected to reduce crowding between Paddington and Whitechapel.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E
25|$|The Aerotrain is an {{automated}} people mover (APM) {{that connects the}} airside of KLIA Main Terminal Building (MTB) and the Satellite Building. Each 250-person capacity train can transport 3,000 passengers per hour in each direction at up to 56km/h (35mph). These three-car driverless trains run on elevated rail and under the taxiways. The journey takes under two minutes. The Aerotrain operates between three and five-minute intervals between terminal. <b>Automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>controls</b> manage {{the operation of the}} entire Aerotrain system, controlling the speeds, headways, stops and door openings in stations, and integrating functions that enhance the reliability and performance of the system.|$|R
30|$|Platform screen doors fully enclose the {{platform}} edge, and are synchronized {{to open and}} close with the vehicle doors to allow access and egress {{to and from the}} vehicle. It is in fact the consistent stopping accuracy provided by the <b>automatic</b> driverless <b>train</b> <b>control,</b> which allows for the safety benefits of platform doors. Emergency access doors, included in the panels between the automatic doors, allow additional access in case of emergency or failure.|$|R
50|$|The ETCS {{standard}} has {{listed a}} number of older <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Controls</b> (ATC) as Class B systems. While they are set to obsolescence, the older line side signal information can be read by using Specific Transmission Modules (STM) hardware and fed the Class B signal information to a new ETCS onboard safety control system for partial supervision. In practice an alternative transition scheme is used where an older ATC is rebased to use Eurobalises. This leverages {{the fact that a}} Eurobalise can transmit multiple information packets and the reserved national datagram (packet number 44) can encode the signal values from the old system in parallel with ETCS datagram packets. The older train-born ATC system is equipped with an additional Eurobalise reader that converts the datagram signals. This allows for a longer transitional period where the old ATC and Eurobalises are attached on the sleepers until all trains have a Eurobalise reader. The newer ETCS-compliant trains can be switched to an ETCS operation scheme by a software update of the onboard train computer.|$|R
5|$|Two tender {{locomotives}} {{were used}} to demonstrate the Angus <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>control</b> equipment; they had originally been West Midland Railway 2-4-0s numbers 103 and 104. They were on the WSMR from 17 December 1911 and used for a demonstration on 5 July 1912. On 4 November 1917 they were moved to Taunton, where they were stored until 1919. After being sold to the Bute Works Supply Company in 1920 they were sold on to the Cambrian Railways in 1921 as their numbers 10 and 1. They were absorbed into the Great Western Railway as 1328 and 1329.|$|E
5|$|The Delhi Metro uses cab {{signalling}} {{along with}} a centralised <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>control</b> system consisting of automatic operation, protection and signalling modules. A 380MHz digital trunked TETRA radio communication system from Motorola is used on all lines to carry both voice and data information. For Blue Line Siemens Transportation Systems has supplied the electronic interlocking Sicas, the operation control system Vicos OC 500 and the automation control system LZB 700 M. An integrated system comprising optical fibre cable, on-train radio, CCTV, and a centralised clock and public address system is used for telecommunication during train operations as well as emergencies. For Red and Yellow lines ALSTOM has supplied signalling system and for Green and Violet lines Bombardier Transportation has supplied CITYFLO 350 signalling system.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{found that}} Train 214 {{had come to}} a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it {{effectively}} invisible to the <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>control</b> system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum {{to make it to the}} next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision.|$|E
25|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Operation <b>controls</b> <b>trains</b> so that, between stations, {{they will}} move {{at the speed}} {{specified}} by the <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> protection and <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> supervision sub-systems. All Metro trains are manned by train operators who work the doors, make station announcements, and supervise the train. The train operator also can <b>control</b> whether the <b>train</b> operates in <b>automatic</b> mode or manual mode. From November 17, 1995 until January 6, 1996, Metro management required its employees to use the automatic mode at all times. During the Blizzard of 1996, however, there was a collision on January 6 that occurred when the ATS system failed to pick up proper instructions from the wayside communication system during a snowstorm, and defaulted to the highest speed. This speed would have been safe during dry weather, but because of ice or snow, trains required additional stopping distance, which was not provided for by the ATC system. From the June 2009 collision until 2015, Metrorail operators operated the trains exclusively in manual mode; the ATC system was restored to the Red Line in 2015. The <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> protection system still limits the maximum speed of every train that is in revenue service.|$|R
30|$|The {{transit system}} is {{motivated}} by electricity. In Beijing, compared with other industries, Beijing metro is on the top place on energy consumption. To reduce the energy consumption, {{it is necessary to}} optimize the train operation speed based on the traction curve. From the research above, some researchers have been working on the schedule optimization with consideration of environmental costs. Meanwhile, some technologies for train and network design such as regenerative breaking technology, energy-saving slope, and <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation and <b>control</b> system have been applied in the transit system.|$|R
50|$|Line 1 {{features}} an advanced signaling system, including an <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> protection system (ATPS) and automated signaling to <b>control</b> <b>train</b> movements. Siemens supplied the signalling and <b>train</b> <b>control</b> systems {{required for the}} project, while Thales supplied the communication systems. The network's signaling and <b>train</b> <b>control</b> systems are based on LZB 700M technology.|$|R
5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} found {{that after a}} June 17 replacement of a track circuit component at what became {{the site of the}} June 22 collision, the track circuit had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train. The struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead. Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit, it became invisible to the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) system. The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55mph. The operator of the striking train applied the emergency brake after the stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent the collision, which occurred at approximately 44mph.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rolling}} stock and Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} equipment were constructed in Japan, many parts were sourced from Europe. The trains were fitted with Stone Platt air-conditioning, Duwag bogies, Sig gangways, Scharfenberg couplers and Westinghouse brakes. Mitsubishi Electric's propulsion equipment was estimated to consume 50% less electricity than Hong Kong's existing MTR M-Train EMU. Its <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) signalling system was supplied by Westinghouse, capable of running at pre-programmed speeds and activated by the train driver. While theoretically possible to design for a fully driverless operation using this signalling technology, MRT Corporation (MRTC, now SMRT Corporation) decided against this option. The trainsets were assembled in Kobe, Japan, and then shipped to Singapore by Neptune Orient Lines. The first trainset was delivered to MRTC on 8 July 1986 at Bishan Depot, officiated by Yeo Ning Hong.|$|E
5|$|The Jæren Line opened as {{a narrow}} gauge railway between Stavanger and Egersund on 1 March 1878. The railway was {{extended}} from Egersund to Flekkefjord on 1 November 1904 as the Flekkefjord Line. On 21 December 1924, the Jæren Line's only branch opened, the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård. On 1 March 1944, the Jæren Line {{became part of}} the Sørland Line, when the line opened between Sira and Kristiansand and the Jæren Line was converted to standard gauge. The Sørland Line from Egersund to Stavanger was opened as electric on 3 June 1956. This resulted in Class 65 and Class 67 electric multiple units being used on local trains on the line. In 1960, the services were replaced by Class 68 units. The section from Stavanger to Sandnes became {{the first part of the}} Norwegian railway network, after the Ofoten Line, to centrally controlled. The centralized traffic control opened from Stavanger to Sandnes on 20 March 1964, and from Sandnes to Egersund on 7 July. The whole line received partial <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>control</b> on 31 December 1986.|$|E
2500|$|The trains {{were used}} as a {{test-bed}} for <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation, where <b>control</b> signals were picked up from the running rails, and all control of the moving train, apart from the initial command to start when leaving a station, was managed by a [...] "black box" [...] controller. The Woodford to Hainault section of the Central line was used for these tests, {{in preparation for the}} introduction of the system on the Victoria line when it opened. In 1986, three trains were converted back for manual operation, and a 3-car unit worked the peak-only Epping to Ongar shuttle service, until that line closed in 1994. One train still works as a track recording unit, while a second is in private ownership and has been used for railtours on the Underground.|$|R
50|$|The line {{is set to}} be {{the most}} modern in the network, using <b>automatic</b> <b>trains,</b> a Communications-based <b>train</b> <b>control</b> system like the one being {{installed}} on Line C, and Platform screen doors. The line is also expected to have the highest ridership figures when compared to the existing lines.|$|R
25|$|The {{signalling}} will be {{a mixture}} of ETCS 2 on the western branches from 2019, communication-based <b>train</b> <b>control</b> with <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation on the core and Abbey Wood branch (with a possible later upgrade to ETCS), and Automatic Warning System with Train Protection & Warning System on the Great Eastern Main Line.|$|R
5|$|On 1 September 1993, NSB {{launched}} the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, {{of which the}} main service ran from Steinkjer to Trondheim. The initial plans called to the continued use of the Class 92 rolling stock, but saw change in schedules and the upgrading platforms for NOK15 million. At the same time, the stations of Alstad, Langstein and Fleskhus were closed. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. After six months operation, the service had experienced a 40 percent growth in patronage. This was further increased {{with the opening of}} Trondheim Airport Station on 15 November 1994, which cost NOK24 million. The upgrades to the airport also included a new taxiway, which resulted in second Værnes Tunnel being built. A station was also established to serve Levanger Hospital on 20 December 1995. On 10 November 1994, the line received <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>control.</b> NSB was split up on 1 December 1996 and the ownership of the tracks and infrastructure was inherited by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the operation of trains was taken over by the new NSB. From 1994, Di6 and Di8 locomotives were introduced, but the Di6 proved unreliable and returned to the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the early}} safety {{concerns}} appeared to be well founded when the system experienced a number of train-control failures in its {{first few years of}} operation. As early as 1969, before revenue service began, several BART engineers identified safety problems with the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) system. The BART Board of Directors was dismissive of their concerns and retaliated by firing them. Less than a month after the system's opening, on October 2, 1972, an ATC failure caused a train to run off the end of the elevated track at the terminal Fremont station and crash to the ground, injuring four people. The “Fremont Flyer” led to a comprehensive redesign of the train controls and also resulted in multiple investigations being opened by the California State Senate, California Public Utilities Commission, and National Transportation Safety Board. Hearings by the state legislature in 1974 into financial mismanagement at BART forced the General Manager to resign in May 1974, and the entire Board of Directors was replaced the same year when the legislature passed legislation leading to the election of a new Board and the end of appointed members.|$|E
25|$|Line 3 Scarborough uses <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>control</b> (ATC), {{meaning it}} could be {{operated}} autonomously. However, for safety, each train has an operator on board who monitors the doors.|$|E
50|$|Siemens are {{currently}} modernising the signalling systems on the line, {{at a cost}} of $18 million which includes the use of Communications-based <b>train</b> <b>control</b> (CBTC) in order to improve the line's frequency and potentially open up the possibility of <b>automatic</b> <b>trains</b> in the future. The work is expected to be completed towards the end of 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Developed in Germany the {{historic}} short name Indusi {{was derived from}} German Induktive Zugsicherung ("inductive train protection"). Later generations of the system were named PZB highlighting that the PZB/Indusi system is a family of intermittent <b>train</b> <b>control</b> systems {{in comparison with the}} continuous <b>train</b> <b>control</b> systems including the German LZB (short from German , literally [...] "linear train influencing") that was introduced at the time. The term PZB is short from German , literally [...] "punctiform train influencing", translated as [...] "intermittent train protection" [...] or officially [...] "intermittent <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> running control" ...|$|R
50|$|Before launch, all new {{trainsets}} must undergo {{and pass}} compulsory testing, in this {{they are required}} to go 10,000 km without logging a single fault. The trainset will undergo testing for its <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> protection system (ATP), other components tested included the propulsion system, the brakes, air-conditioning, door operations, auxiliary power supply, suspension, <b>train</b> <b>control</b> and management system, couplers, and even the wipers.|$|R
25|$|Of {{the first}} batch of 300 locomotives, most were fitted with vacuum brakes and steam heating, {{and some of these}} were also fitted with GWR's <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) safety system.|$|E
25|$|Following the Slough rail {{accident}} in 1900 when five passengers were killed, improved {{vacuum braking systems}} were used on locomotives and passenger rolling stock and <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) was introduced in 1908.|$|E
25|$|The New Haven {{main line}} and New Canaan branch use <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Control,</b> or ATC, in {{conjunction}} with Cab Signals, a safety feature used in routing trains, keeping safe distances, and moderating train speeds.|$|E
30|$|As a {{component}} of technical equipment which ensures safe, punctual, fast, convenient, high-density, ceaseless operation of the train, signaling system {{plays an important role}} in rail transit system [1, 2, 3]. The signaling system consists of four subsystems: <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> supervision system (ATS), <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> protection subsystem (ATP), <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation (ATO), and computer-based interlocking subsystem (CI). The four subsystems form a closed-loop system via message switching network—automatic <b>train</b> <b>control</b> (ATC) that manages to combine ground-control and train-control, local control, and central control together. In order to facilitate safety in operation, an ATC system which integrates the functions of traffic control, operating adjustment, and automatic driving is constructed. The signaling system operates in modes of distributed management and centralized control. Distinguished from the distribution of section, the centralized signaling system is made up of controlling equipments in the center, station equipments, vehicle-based equipments, trackside equipments, and on-board equipments.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to this event, other commuter railroads made statements to reassure their passengers of {{the safety of their}} operations, and these responses provided some perspective on how other operators mitigate related risks. A spokesman for the nation's largest commuter rail operation, the Long Island Rail Road in New York, said that it had studied positive <b>train</b> <b>control,</b> but decided to stick with its [...] "automatic speed control system," [...] a form of cab signaling with <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> stop using technology that is more than 50 years old. The San Diego's Coaster commuter line also has an <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> stop system that a spokesman said will stop the train automatically if the engineer fails to stop at a red stop signal.|$|R
50|$|With the {{incorporation}} of these trains in 2015, the line will consist of 108 Nagoya cars, though from different series and refurbished to increase the uniformity among them. No long term plans have been made as to what rolling stock the line will use when it is modernised, however the line is being updated with Trainguard Communications-based <b>train</b> <b>control</b> to allow for <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation, meaning {{that it could be}} served by such trains.|$|R
