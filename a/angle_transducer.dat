A continuous mass flow-ype yield-ensing device equipped with load cells and a vibration-resistant <b>angle</b> <b>transducer</b> along with a differential global position-ing system (DGPS) was developed to collect spatially variable yield data in real-time.

40|$|Abstract: Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) {{has been}} used for two decades to {{determine}} the stiffness profile of soils. The application of this technique is currently evaluated for inspecting subsurface damage in concrete structures in the 100 kHz frequency range. Accurate measurements of phase velocity and attenuation require an appropriate source to efficiently generate wideband Rayleigh waves. This paper presents the design and testing procedure of a variable angle wedge transducer. The performance of this transducer is evaluated in terms of the peak amplitude and frequency of the transmitted signal, and it is compared with the performance of the fixed angle wedge transducer used so far. In mortar, the new design is slightly more efficient than the previous one. In other materials (steel and Plexiglas), it allows to generate Rayleigh waves, whereas the fixed <b>angle</b> <b>transducer</b> is completely inefficient. The newly designed transducer can thus be considered as a suitable source of Rayleigh waves {{for a wide range of}} materials. Further optimisation requires the wave path in the wedge to be minimized. Introduction: This paper presents the design and evaluation of a variable angle wedge transducer. This transducer is intended to be used to investigate subsurface defects in the concrete cover of civil structures. The testing technique is the Spectral Analysis o...|$|E

These capabilities can be improved by operating such transducers as phased array search units, consisting of many transducer elements. Each of the array elements is pulsed with the appropriate time delays, thus controlling the shape and the sound beam direction on a large scale. This study describes the design and optimization of a multi-mode T/R (transmit/receive) phased array search unit generating longitudinal, shear and subsurface longitudinal (’creeping’) waves. The elaborated design can be operated with 12 or 16 transducer elements generating multiple wave modes for certain inspection ranges.

A feedback based biasing system to improve the linearity of a class C power amplifier is designed. A class B amplifier with a gain of 20 dB and 20 MHz bandwidth at 900 MHz acts as the launching point for the design. The biasing and output network of the class B power amplifier is modified to produce a class C amplifier at conduction angles of 180 °, 162 °, 126 °, 90 °, and 54 °. A feedback based biasing system, which uses two matched and scaled down transistors, compares the DC current of a class B and a class C biased transistor. This comparison is used to control the biasing voltage of the amplifier. The performance for each class C amplifier is simulated with the proposed constant conduction angle biasing (CCAB) system.

Generally, bulk {{wave velocity}} is measured by Time-of-Flight (TOF) of pulse echo from back wall reflection; however, pulse-echo method {{cannot be applied to}} surface acoustic wave in a case that an edge does not exist in a close range. Even when we use through-transmission method, it is quite cumbersome to measure the accurate distance between transmitter and receiver; this problem is more critical when using contact <b>angle</b> <b>transducers.</b> This study proposes two new signal processing methods to measure laser-generated surface wave velocity. The laser was irradiated on the line-arrayed slit to generate tone-burst surface wave, and the propagated surface wave was received by a contact transducer. The first signal processing method uses the auto-correlation to calculate the time Δt that the wave takes to pass through the interval of slit, and then velocity is calculated using the equation: C=Δ, where d is the interval of the slit. The second method uses FFT to find out the main frequency of the wave, and then the velocity is calculated from the equation: C=f∙λ where f is main frequency of surface wave, is the wavelength of surface wave, where is identical to the interval of slit d. Experimental results show that the two signal processing methods provide almost same performance and the velocity of the laser-generated surface wave can be measured in a precise manner by using the proposed signal processing methods...|$|R
