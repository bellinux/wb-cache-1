5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

The 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland when Scotland and Wales refused to play their Five Nations away fixtures in Ireland. England played in Dublin in 1973 and were given a standing ovation lasting five minutes.

500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes.

500|$|Although {{a number}} of franchisees bought the Collectramatic, which {{had the support of}} Colonel Sanders from 1970 onwards, John Y.

I was mostly afraid these new fryers would break {{down in the middle of}} business." [...] Brown warned franchisees that they were in violation of their contract if they used the Collectramatic. Brown held his ground on the issue until he learned that his father, John Y. Brown Sr., who owned multiple KFC franchises, was successfully using the Collectramatic in every franchise he owned. [...] The issue was eventually resolved after Heublein purchased KFC, acquired Hartzog and nullified the contract. The Collectramatic has been an approved pressure fryer for KFC from 1972 onwards.|$|E

[...] Slezak also said that, [...] "the folks at 19 gave Kris the proper budget to kick off his video career – <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> finally know what the company did with the savings gleaned from hiring student filmmakers to helm Blake Lewis and Diana DeGarmo’s tragic first clips". James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the video looked better and more expensive that past-first videos by American Idol alumni under 19. Montgomery also compared the video's [...] "artfully color-saturated frames and great expanses" [...] to Snow Patrol's [...] "Run" [...] clip and the Madonna, Justin Timberlake, and Timbaland's [...] "4 Minutes", doing away with the [...] "narrative crutch most Idol champs' debuts lean on (see, for example, David Cook's 'Light On'), putting the focus squarely on Allen himself." [...] He also said that, [...] "while Allen's debut video isn't as flashy-dashy as Idol compatriot Adam Lambert's 'Time for Miracles,' it's just as good – mostly because, rather than rely on fiery explosions, 'Dying' plays it straight, showcasing Allen and his talents", and called it [...] "bold" [...] as Allen was never shown as the [...] "flashy type".|$|E

500|$|When {{the band}} {{completed}} writing and recording demos for the songs, the three headed to Los Angeles to record drum tracks at Chick Corea's Mad Hatter Studios in January 1999. Barker recorded {{the majority of}} his drum tracks in eight hours. The recording process for the album was completed over a period of four months, and production was handled at several production facilities in southern California, including Signature Sound and Studio West in San Diego, Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, and Conway Recording Studios and The Bomb Factory in Los Angeles. For Barker, the album was [...] "fueled by black coffee and Marlboro Lights"; he was hopeful for the album as the band were well-rehearsed and no time would be wasted. To record Enema of the State, Blink-182 turned to punk rock producer Jerry Finn, who previously worked on Green Day's breakthrough album, Dookie (1994). Hoppus and DeLonge were impressed with his work when they recorded [...] "Mutt" [...] for its placement on the American Pie soundtrack. Finn was harder on the trio to record better takes, and Hoppus credited Finn with knowing a great deal about punk rock music, but also helping the band establish a more pop-inspired sound. Finn came with an array of amps, effects and equipments; previously the band were forced to rent such equipment. Barker kept attempting to irritate Finn by sneaking in vibraslaps, which Finn hated. In addition, the band had so much fun with Finn that there were days when very little work was accomplished: [...] "Recording can get pretty monotonous, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> could laugh with Jerry," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "A pretty typical day would involve multiple takes for one part of one song, and then everyone would get naked and jump on Jerry." [...] The band chose [...] "never to work with anyone else again," [...] and Finn would produce their next three releases.|$|E

[...] This is further supported by the fact that after a meeting held in the evening before the flight, G. N. Bazhenov (the navigator on the flight) went to speak with E.

[...] Gasly claimed Heidfeld had placed him in a position to impact the wall following the later releasing his brake pedal.
