40|$|N 6 -Methyladenosine (m 6 A) is {{the most}} common mRNA modification; it occurs {{in a wide range of}} taxon and is {{associated}} with many key biological processes. High-throughput experiments have identified m 6 A-peaks and sites across the transcriptome, but studies of m 6 <b>A</b> <b>sites</b> at the transcriptome-wide scale are limited to a few species and tissue types. Therefore, the computational prediction of mRNA m 6 <b>A</b> <b>sites</b> has become <b>an</b> important strategy. In this study, we integrated multiple features of mRNA (flanking sequences, local secondary structure information, and relative position information) and trained a SVM classifier to predict m 6 <b>A</b> <b>sites</b> in mammalian mRNA sequences. Our method achieves ideal performance in both cross-validation tests and rigorous independent dataset tests. The server also provides a comprehensive database of predicted transcriptome-wide m 6 <b>A</b> <b>sites</b> and curated m 6 A-seq peaks from the literature for both human and mouse, and these can be queried and visualized in a genome browser. The RNAMethPre web server provides a user-friendly tool for the prediction and query of mRNA m 6 <b>A</b> <b>sites,</b> which is freely accessible for public use at [URL]...|$|R
