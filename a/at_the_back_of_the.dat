5|$|Jaw joint - The dentary (the {{lower jaw}} bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet {{to form the}} joint. In most gnathostomes, {{including}} early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw) and quadrate (a small bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper jaw).|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is {{long and}} low. The coronoid process, the frontmost of the three main processes (projections) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jawbone, is large and about {{as high as the}} condyloid process behind it. The angular process, below the condyloid, is fairly short and does not extend further backwards than the condyloid. There is no noticeable capsular process (a raising <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw that houses the root of the lower incisor).|$|E

5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of the back of the skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges on the inside of the nasal cavity and a ridge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1927 and the {{building}} was opened on June 1, 1928. The building became premier office space {{in the center of}} the city, serving as the home of major law firms among other tenants. In 1953, steel and concrete pen houses were built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building to house air conditioning equipment.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} phylogenetic analyses of the group, Gardiner (1983) recognized five characteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade: a bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull, the parasphenoid, is connected to another bone {{on the underside of the}} skull, the pterygoid; large openings called interpterygoid vacuities are present between the pterygoids; the stapes (a bone involved in hearing) is connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward; the cleithrum, a bone in the pectoral girdle, is thin; and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch. Additional features were given by Godfrey et al. (1987), including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull, small projections (uncinate processes) on the ribs, and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single iliac blade. These shared characteristics are called synapomorphies.|$|E
5|$|Japanese theatre styles {{have been}} applied to The Tempest. In 1988 and again in 1992 Yukio Ninagawa brought his version of The Tempest to the UK. It was staged as a {{rehearsal}} of a Noh drama, with a traditional Noh theatre <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage, but also using elements which were at odds with Noh conventions. In 1992, Minoru Fujita presented a Bunraku (Japanese puppet) version in Osaka and at the Tokyo Globe.|$|E

In A.donovani, there are two roots at the front (labial and lingual) and one at the back. There are no M3 of A.praeuniversitatis with preserved roots.|$|E
5|$|Magpies {{prefer to}} swoop <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight {{at all times}} can {{discourage}} the bird. A basic disguise such as sunglasses worn {{on the back of}} the head may fool the magpie as to where a person is looking. Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.|$|E

Baffled by the trick's success, Borden sneaks backstage to find Angier's secret, only to witness Angier drop through a trap door and plunge into a waiting water tank, where he drowns. Cutter stumbles upon the scene, and Borden is arrested.|$|E

5|$|The huge, vaulted lid of N. rajah, {{the largest}} in the genus, is another {{distinguishing}} characteristic of this species.
