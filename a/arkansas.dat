5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and <b>Arkansas,</b> which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while <b>Arkansas</b> subsidized private insurance. The new <b>Arkansas</b> and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in <b>Arkansas</b> and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Yale Law School, Clinton {{returned}} to <b>Arkansas</b> {{and became a}} law professor at the University of <b>Arkansas.</b> In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52percent to 48percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for <b>Arkansas</b> Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election, Clinton was elected.|$|E
5|$|After three {{consecutive}} victories {{to start the}} season, the Crimson Tide opened conference play against the <b>Arkansas</b> Razorbacks, and defeated them 38–14 at Bryant–Denny Stadium. Alabama scored first with a trick play on their opening possession. After driving to the <b>Arkansas</b> 37-yard line, Cade Foster lined up for a 54-yard field goal attempt. Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron received the snap as the holder, and proceeded to throw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Michael Williams to give the Crimson Tide a 7–0 lead. The Razorbacks tied the game at 7–7 {{late in the first}} quarter when Tyler Wilson threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Dennis Johnson. After an <b>Arkansas</b> goal line stand, Jeremy Shelley connected on a 20-yard field goal to give Alabama a 10–7 lead. On the ensuing <b>Arkansas</b> possession, the Crimson Tide scored when DeQuan Menzie intercepted a Wilson pass and returned it 25-yards for a touchdown to give Alabama a 17–7 lead at the half.|$|E

5|$|<b>Arkansas</b> again escorted {{a convoy}} to Scotland, {{returning}} to New York by 20 October. Thereafter, convoys {{were sent to}} North Africa, to support the invasion of North Africa. <b>Arkansas</b> covered her first such convoy, along with eight destroyers, on 3 November. She returned to New York on 11 December, where she went into dock for another overhaul. On 2 January 1943, <b>Arkansas</b> departed New York to conduct gunnery training in Chesapeake Bay. Back in New York by 30 January, the ship's crew prepared {{for a return to}} convoy escort duty. She escorted two convoys to Casablanca, between February and April, before returning to New York, for yet another period in drydock, which lasted until 26 May. <b>Arkansas</b> returned to duty as a training ship for midshipmen based at Norfolk. She resumed her convoy escort duties after four months, and on 8 October, she steamed to Bangor, Northern Ireland. She remained in Northern Ireland, through November, and departed on 1 December, bound for New York. After arriving on 12 December, <b>Arkansas</b> went into dock for more repairs, and then returned to Norfolk, on 27 December. The ship escorted another convoy bound for Ireland, on 19 January 1944, before returning to New York, on 13 February.

5|$|Ball State {{jumped out}} to an early lead via a Wenning to Snead touchdown, and led {{at the end of}} the first quarter 7–0. After the first quarter, due to Kennedy's ineffectiveness, Fredi Knighten took over at quarterback for <b>Arkansas</b> State, and in the second quarter, helped the team score 10 points while Ball State scored only 3 – at half time, the teams were tied at 10. <b>Arkansas</b> State made two field goals in the third quarter, thus {{entering}} the fourth with a six-point lead. However, Ball State scored via a field goal early in the quarter, and a touchdown with less than two minutes to play to retake the lead. <b>Arkansas</b> State promptly responded via a touchdown pass. Although Ball State was able to move the ball into field goal range as time waned, their field goal try was blocked, and ultimately <b>Arkansas</b> State held onto win the game, 23–20.|$|E
