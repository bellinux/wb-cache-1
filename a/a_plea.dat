2500|$|According to the 2009 book Criminal Evidence: Principles and Cases by Thomas J. Gardner and Terry M. Anderson, [...] "The Alford plea is not {{mandatory}} for states, but most states have adopted it. State judges, however, {{are generally not}} obligated to accept <b>an</b> Alford <b>plea.</b> Most judges do accept it because the sentence given {{is the same as}} the sentence for <b>a</b> regular guilty <b>plea</b> under the state sentencing guidelines." [...] Criminal Evidence explained the application of the Alford plea in U.S. states, [...] "Most state courts hold that <b>an</b> Alford <b>plea</b> is the 'functional equivalent' of <b>a</b> regular <b>plea</b> of guilty. Therefore, a defendant who enters <b>a</b> guilty <b>plea,</b> whether <b>an</b> Alford <b>plea</b> or <b>a</b> regular guilty <b>plea,</b> has lost almost all rights to appeal. Most courts hold that the only issues applicable are the voluntary and intelligent nature of the plea and the jurisdiction of the court." ...|$|R
