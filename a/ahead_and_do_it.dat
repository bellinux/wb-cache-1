60|$|As soon as {{possible}} after the Prince had determined upon this march, he made his preparations, and set out. He took with him a few courtiers, and {{a large body of}} miners, rock-splitters, bridge-builders, and workmen of that class, whose services would, very probably, be needed. Besides these, he had an officer whose duty it was to point out the direct course to be taken, and another who was to draw a map of the march, showing the towns, mountains, and the various places it passed through. There were no compasses in those days, but the course-marker had an instrument which he would set in a proper direction by means of the stars, and then he could march by it all day. Besides these persons, Prince Hassak selected from the schools of his city five boys and five girls, and took them with him.

5000|$|Piper's {{characterization}} {{was rooted}} {{in the notion of}} the self-reliant man: a man {{able to take care of}} himself and both willing and able to tackle any situation which might arise. This is perfectly exemplified in a bit of dialogue found in his short story [...] "Oomphel in the Sky" [...] (1960):"He actually knows what has to be <b>done</b> <b>and</b> how to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> he's going right <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> without holding a dozen conferences and round-table discussions and giving everybody a fair and equal chance to foul things up for him."As a result, his yarns tend towards the heroic, and the conflict is usually driven externally.|$|R
5000|$|He {{is remembered}} for having worked [...] "rough" [...] and [...] "loose", in {{animation}} terms, {{with a focus}} on feeling, action, and the character's personality rather than detail, structure, or formal draftsmanship. Fellow animator Fred Moore is quoted as having said of Ferguson, [...] "He doesn't know that you can't raise the eyebrows above the head circle, so he goes <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> it gives a great effect." [...] Animator Shamus Culhane remembered Ferguson as having produced a high volume of work- about 18 feet a week as opposed to the more average ten at the Disney Studios at the time.

5000|$|In 1961, Corman {{announced}} he would make Masque from a script by Charles Beaumont to be produced for his Filmgroup Company. However, he later said was reluctant to make it because it had several elements similar to The Seventh Seal (1957), and Corman was worried people would say he was stealing from Bergman.

The origins of Congregation Beth Israel are unclear. One belief is that within the families of AAC was a group that wanted the house so {{the congregation}} could expand, while others did not want to undertake ownership, and the people who formed CBI just went <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> Then, in a conciliation, the rest of AAC followed.

5000|$|Charles B. Griffith {{had made}} a popular film for Roger Cormans New World Pictures called Eat My Dust! (1976). Corman wanted Griffith to make a follow up called Car Wars using stunt footage from five old New World films. Griffith wrote a script which he later called Wham Bam, Merci, Madame, which he says Corman rejected. However {{a few years later}} he {{reactivated}} the project.He called again and offered me a lot more money than he ever had before. I guess I got flattered, <b>and</b> I went <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> He had Max Apple in Texas go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> write a script around all the wrecks and chases. But Max wasnt allowed to see the footage. It was too expensive to rent a Movieola and send Max prints or anything else, so he had only vague descriptions written down on what the stunts were—and nothing worked. So I made a lot of changes in it, and that made Roger angry. He tried to cut it just to the action of the old pictures, but he couldnt, because he needed all the distribution rights. Then he cut all the motivations and all the character development. It was a mess, a jumbled mess!Apple later described the experience: [...] "They wanted four or five crashes, of which they already had the footage. It was more bricklaying than writing.|$|R
5000|$|The group flew to Geneva, Switzerland {{in order}} to feature Collins in the video.

Emphasizing the difference between Collins and the rappers, his motions are noticeably calmer and less vivid than Bone's.|$|E
5000|$|Sklansky {{attended}} the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania {{for a year}} before leaving to become a professional gambler. He briefly took on {{a job as an}} actuary before embarking into poker. While on the job, he discovered a faster way to do some of the calculations and took that discovery to his boss. The boss told him he could go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> that way if he wanted but wouldn’t pass on the information to the other workers. [...] "In other words, I knew something no one else knew, but I got no recognition for it," [...] Sklansky is quoted as saying in Al Alvarez's 1983 work The Biggest Game in Town. [...] "In poker, if you're better than anyone else, you make immediate money.

5000|$|Berglund {{sometimes}} courted controversy {{with his}} re-touching of orchestral parts; {{as he said}} in a Gramophone interview in October 1978, [...] "Sibelius was a superb orchestrator, but right up to the very end he made strange dynamics which I find I have to change. In the Second Symphony you don't have to alter so much, but funnily enough there is a lot that needs altering in the Seventh Symphony ... My attitude was [...] "" [...] which in German means roughly 'be true to the work'. But you see, the composers didn't always know; they could have given it more thought. Bruckner, when things were suggested to him by Lowe and Schalk (who were certainly not stupid) told them to go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Maybe he was weak and should have argued sometimes a little bit more, {{but on the other hand}} many of their suggestions are fine." [...] And his passionate approach to the score brought him admiration from fellow Finns, Jukka-Pekka Saraste and Osmo Vänskä, as well as from one of the finest Sibelians, Sir Simon Rattle.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to.

5000|$|On its British {{release in}} 1942, Thunder Rock {{received}} mixed reviews, with critics eager {{to compare the}} screen version to the stage play, not always to the former's advantage. The Glasgow Herald review was typical, almost appearing to damn the film with faint praise by stating: [...] "Though scarcely so good as the play, the film {{is by no means}} ineffective or undistinguished. Michael Redgrave, Barbara Mullen <b>and</b> others <b>do</b> well." [...] The reviewer for The Manchester Guardian had also seen both, though not to the detriment of his regard for the film: [...] "Robert Ardrey's 'Thunder Rock', still the best new play of the war, has been faithfully translated to the screen. ... The result is a really intelligent film, more moving in parts than anything this country's studios have produced before and more interesting technically than anything since Citizen Kane." [...] Of the reviews that examined the film in its own right, C. A. Lejeune wrote in her long enthusiastic review for The Observer: [...] "I like the unselfconscious courage of a film that knows what <b>it</b> should <b>do</b> <b>and</b> goes <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> I like a piece that doesn't give a hang whether it's popular or unpopular. I like its frank speech, so distinct from that mumbo jumbo of the average refined, pie-faced British picture." ...|$|R

Later that evening John, the valet, and his fiancée Christine, the cook, sit with Miss Julie. Miss Julie flirts with John, who eventually admits he has loved her since boyhood. On the following day John and Miss Julie discuss how they will spend their lives together, and John expresses his desire to go to Lake Como to make his living running a hotel. When Miss Julie admits she has no money of her own to finance such an undertaking, John demands she somehow find some, so Miss Julie steals money from the Count. Meanwhile, Christine discovers John's intentions and threatens to quit her job with the Count. The lovers prepare to escape, but Miss Julie demands to take her canary with her. Angered, John kills the bird. She grabs his razor and threatens to slit her wrists, and he suggests she go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> The Count rings for John, and he leaves, as Julie goes slowly into the garden and follows his suggestion.|$|E
5000|$|I feel Aleister Crowley is a {{misunderstood}} {{genius of}} the 20th century.

I don't agree with everything but I find a lot of it relevant and it's those things that people attacked him on, so he was misunderstood....I'm not trying to interest anyone in Aleister Crowley any more than I am in Charles Dickens. All it was, was that at a particular time he was expounding a theory of self-liberation, which is something which is so important. He was like an eye to the world, into the forthcoming situation. My studies have been quite intensive, but I don't particularly want to go into it because it's a personal thing and isn't in relation to anything apart from the fact that I've employed his system in my own day to day life....The thing is {{to come to terms with}} one's free will, discover one's place and what one is, and from that you can go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and not spend your whole life suppressed and frustrated.

5000|$|Klavierstück XI {{is famous}} for its mobile, or {{polyvalent}} structure. The mobile structure and graphic layout of the piece resembles that of Morton Feldman's Intermission 6 for 1 or 2 pianos of 1953, in which 15 fragments are distributed on a single page of music with the instruction: [...] "Composition begins with any sound and proceeds to the any other" [...] In the same year, Earle Brown had composed Twenty-five Pages for 1-25 pianists, in which the pages are to be arranged in a sequence chosen by the performer(s), and each page may be performed either side up and events within each two-line system may be read as either treble or bass clef ( [...] ; [...] ). When David Tudor, who at the time was preparing a version of Feldman's piece, was in Cologne in 1955, Stockhausen asked him, [...] "What if I wrote a piece where you could decide where you wanted to go on the page?" [...] I said I knew someone who was already doing one, and he said, [...] "In that case I shall not compose it". So I retracted, and said it was just an idea my friend was thinking about, and told him he mustn’t consider any other composer but should go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> anyway, and that led to Klavierstück No 11. Apart from the layout on the page, Feldman's piece has nothing in common with Stockhausen's composition.

40|$|Currently {{there are}} six {{candidate}} strategies for freeing the refereed research literature: (1) Authors paying journal publishers for publisher-supplied online-offprints. (2) Asking journals to give away their contents online for free and boycotting those that do not. (3) Library consortial support (e. g. SPARC) for lower-priced journals. (4) Delayed journal give-aways [...] 6 -to- 12 + months after publication. (5) Giving up established journals and peer review altogether, in favour of self-archived preprints and post-hoc, ad-lib commentary. (6) Self-archiving all preprints and postprints. (1) - (5) all require waiting for policy changes and, even once these are available, all require a needless sacrifice {{on the part of}} authors. With (1) the sacrifice is the needless author offprint expense, with (2) it is the author's right to submit to their preferred journals, with (3) it is (as before) the author's potential impact on those potential users who cannot afford even the lowered access tolls, with (4) it is the impact of the all-important first 6 - 12 months after publication, and with (5) the sacrifice is the quality of the literature itself. Only (6) asks researchers for no sacrifices at all, and no waiting for any change in journal policy or price.
