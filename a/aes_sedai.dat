5|$|Egwene {{begins to}} expose the Black Ajah among the rebels, {{requiring}} every sister to re-swear her allegiances. Fifty sisters are exposed and executed, while twenty are able to escape. Taking advantage of the weakened White Tower defenses following the Seanchan raid, the rebels prepare an immediate attack. Just before the attack is mounted, the Tower <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> announce that Elaida was captured in the Seanchan raid, {{and that they would}} have Egwene as their leader, the Amyrlin Seat. The rebels return and they begin rebuilding the Tower.|$|E
5|$|The second main plot thread follows Egwene al'Vere, {{leader of}} the rebel faction of <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai.</b> After her capture by the White Tower in the {{previous}} book, Egwene works to undermine Elaida a'Roihan's rule and mend the strife it is causing in the White Tower. She is initially granted freedom of the tower as novice, but after publicly denouncing Elaida, Elaida names her a follower of the Dark One, and orders her imprisonment. When Elaida fails to prove her accusation, Egwene is released.|$|E
5|$|When the Seanchan {{attack the}} White Tower, its {{fractured}} state prevents an effective defense. Many <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> are captured or killed until Egwene, leading {{a group of}} novices, succeeds in driving them off. Siuan Sanche, Gawyn Trakand, and Gareth Bryne mount a rescue of Egwene. They find her so exhausted that she cannot protest when they extract her against her orders. After awakening in the camp, she argues {{that they may have}} ruined her chances to gain credit in the Tower for the defeat of the Seanchan.|$|E
5|$|As Rand's story begins, he is {{restoring}} {{order in}} the nation of Arad Doman while searching for Graendal, one of the Dark One's favored servants known as the Forsaken. The <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> work with Rand to interrogate Semirhage, another Forsaken captured {{at the end of}} Knife of Dreams. After being freed by her allies, Semirhage is given a Domination Band, an item used to control male channelers, and locks it around Rand's neck. She and Black Ajah sister Elza Penfell use it to make him torture and attempt to kill his lover, Min Farshaw. Unable to channel, he reaches out and inexplicably accesses the True Power, a different power normally only granted by the Dark One, using it to free himself and kill Semirhage and Elza. After this, he resolves to make himself harder and emotionless. He banishes his adviser Cadsuane Melaidhrin for not securing the Domination Band, promising to kill her if he sees her face again.|$|E
5|$|The Gathering Storm follows many plot threads but {{focuses on}} two characters, Rand al'Thor and Egwene al'Vere. While it follows al'Thor's {{attempts}} to unite and rally the world's forces for the Last Battle, it also addresses his struggle with his sanity, {{caused by the}} corruption of his mind {{from the use of}} the male half of the One Power. The unification of the White Tower, the headquarters of the female users of the One Power known as <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai,</b> is addressed from al'Vere's perspective, as well as the exposure of the Black Ajah, a secretive and opposing faction within the story. While the stories of other main characters such as Perrin Aybara and Mat Cauthon are briefly touched upon, they have little bearing on the main plot line. Some main characters such as Elayne Trakand and Lan Mandragoran do not appear at all, but are referred to.|$|E
25|$|Egwene is captive in the White Tower, but holds {{contact with}} the rebel <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> through Tel'aran'rhiod. Despite harsh disciplining she spreads rumors and doubt in the White Tower about Elaida's {{suitability}} as Amyrlin. Both the rebels and the White Tower send <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> to the Black Tower to bond Asha'man (the rebels as an offer from Rand to counter the number of <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> bonded to Asha'man).|$|E
25|$|The modern <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> {{operate as}} self-appointed {{guardians of the}} One Power and are often viewed as above local and {{national}} politics. They view themselves as the rightful owners of all angreal and arbiters of {{anything to do with}} the One Power. They operate as advisers to kings and queens and are shown deference by most. Some nations, however, have banned channeling and view <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> as suspect, if not outright evil. <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> search the world for females with the inherent ability to channel, or the ability to be taught to channel, and bring any they find to the Tower. Untrained channelers can be a danger to themselves and others, often resulting in accidental deaths. Channelers of a certain age that have survived without Tower training are often derisively referred to as wilders by <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai.</b> Wilders often experience blocks: an inability to access the One Power except through specific rituals or in specific situations. In many instances these wilders have no idea they are channeling or accessing the One Power at all. With training and time, blocks can often be overcome and the wilder can channel at will. Foreign lands outside the Aes Sedai's purview often handle channeling and channelers quite differently from <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> custom and tend to distrust their assumed authority. <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> consider them wilders as well, and not entirely without reason. Most foreign channeling traditions have more specific and more limited understanding of the One Power than do <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai.</b> Additionally, most of these traditions trace their origins back to offshoots of the original <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> split off after the Breaking of the World. The <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai,</b> however, can trace their history well back within the Age of Legends.|$|E
25|$|The Two Rivers men, Cairhienin, Aiel and Winged Guards are {{to charge}} {{down into the}} valley after an attack of wolves, with Perrin at their head. The Salidar <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> and Wise Ones are to stay up on the ridge. However, when fighting, Perrin sees some Salidar <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> fighting.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the pro-Rand armies are {{situated}} {{on a ridge}} around Dumai's Wells. The Shaido have betrayed the <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> and have surrounded a group of wagons on which the <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> {{are situated}}, and are trying unsuccessfully to overwhelm its defenders to kidnap Rand al'Thor for themselves when the Pro Rand forces arrive.|$|E
25|$|The prequel novel New Spring {{takes place}} during the Aiel War and depicts the {{discovery}} by certain <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> that the Dragon has been Reborn.|$|E
25|$|Only siswai'aman and Maidens of the Spear {{were brought}} {{along for the}} battle. The other Aiel (besides the Wise Ones) dared not fight <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai.</b>|$|E
25|$|The deposed Queen of Andor, Morgase Trakand, goes to Amadicia for aid in {{returning}} to the throne; but is taken captive by the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, Pedron Niall. In response to amnesty on male channelers by Rand al'Thor, Mazrim Taim swears allegiance to him, and is assigned to train Asha'man at the Black Tower. Rand is diplomatically courted by both the rebel <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> in Salidar, who send an envoy to Caemlyn, and the <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> of the White Tower, who send an envoy to Cairhien. In Emond's Field, Perrin Aybara goes to Caemlyn to join Rand.|$|E
25|$|The series proper commences {{almost twenty}} years later in the Two Rivers, a near-forgotten {{district}} of the country of Andor. An <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai,</b> Moiraine, and her Warder Lan, arrive {{in the village of}} Emond's Field, secretly aware that servants of the Dark One are searching for a young man living in the area. Moiraine is unable to determine which of three youths (Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, or Perrin Aybara) is the Dragon Reborn, and leads all three of them from the Two Rivers, along with their friend Egwene al'Vere. Nynaeve al'Meara, the village wise-woman, later joins them. Gleeman Thom Merrilin also travels with the group. The first novel depicts their flight from various agents of the Shadow and their attempts to reach the <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> city of Tar Valon. Thereafter the protagonists are frequently split into different groups and pursue different missions toward the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. As they struggle to unite the various kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to lose their autonomy; by the zealots styling themselves 'the Children of the Light', who do not believe in the prophecies; and by the Seanchan, the descendants of a long-lost colony of Artur Hawkwing's empire. The <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> also become divided {{on how to deal with}} the Dragon Reborn.|$|E
25|$|The 200 Asha'man {{create a}} dome of Air around the wagons, {{to keep the}} {{remaining}} Shaido Aiel out. Some Asha'man are holding 23 Tower <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> hostage. Some of Rand's allies are inside the dome; Perrin and Loial are two such. The rest of his allies (e.g. several Wise Ones, Rhuarc) are outside of the dome, still fighting. The shield cannot be raised to admit his allies without letting the Shaido in.|$|E
25|$|In the series' mythology, a deity {{known as}} the Creator made the {{universe}} and the Wheel of Time, which governs all of existence. The Wheel has seven spokes, each representing an 'age' or phase of history, and rotates {{under the influence of}} the One Power, which flows from the True Source composed of male and female halves (saidin and saidar). Humans who can use this power are called 'channelers'; the principal organization thereof in the books are the <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> or 'Servants of All'.|$|E
25|$|A Wheel of Time {{computer}} game {{was released in}} 1999. Over {{the course of the}} game, a lone <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> must track down a robber following an assault on the White Tower, and prevent the Dark One from being released prematurely. She eventually learns of and executes a long-forgotten ritual at Shayol Ghul to ensure the Dark Lord remains sealed within the prison. While Robert Jordan was consulted {{in the creation of the}} game, he did not write the storyline himself and the game is not considered canon.|$|E
25|$|In the Age of Legends (approximately three {{thousand}} {{years before the}} first book takes place), {{both male and female}} channelers were collectively known as <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> and used the One Power together to great effect. During the successful attempt to seal the bore in The Dark One's prison, the male half of the One Power (saidin) was corrupted by Shai'tan (aka the Dark Lord, the Dark One). Through continued exposure to this taint, male channelers go insane and ultimately die. The Breaking of the World, marking the end of the Age of Legends (a time of great upheaval and strife including physical disruption of the geography of the world) was instigated by male channelers driven mad by Shai'tan's curse. Since that time, strength in the Power has generally lessened, and knowledge of weaves and abilities—including the ability to create angreal and cuendillar—have been lost.|$|E
25|$|The Forsaken are the 13 most {{powerful}} channelers that {{went over to}} the Dark One in the age of legends, often commanding the armies of the shadow in the battles against the light. They were all sealed in Shayol Ghul, the location of the Bore during Lews Therin Telamon's sealing of the prison, where they did not age for over 3000 years due to its warping of time, save for those very close to the surface.They were each among the strongest channelers of their time, with Ishamael, the strongest, being rumored to equal Lews Therin in power. They also retained extensive knowledge of technology and weaves from their time that far outclass the current world's knowledge and subsequently, they are formidable creatures, viewing most modern <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> as laughably weak. In competition with each other for the Dark One's favor, the Forsaken distrust and fight each other as much as anyone else. The Forsaken refer to themselves as the Chosen. Though there may have been more in the Age of Legends, these are the only known Forsaken in this Age: Ishamael/Moridin, Lanfear/Cyndane, Moghedien, Graendal/Hessalam, Mesaana, Aginor/Osan'gar, Asmodean, Balthamel/Aran'gar, Be'lal, Rahvin, Sammael, Semirhage, Demandred, M'Hael (recent). All the Forsaken, particularly Semirhage, are widely feared by most, with their names being used to scare children into being good.|$|E
2500|$|After the battle, {{the nine}} Salidar <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> {{come over to}} congratulate Rand. However, Rand is angered that the Salidar <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> disobeyed his orders in {{bringing}} more than the allotted number of sisters, offers them the choice of being treated like the Tower <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai,</b> kept prisoner by the Asha'man or swearing an oath of fealty to him. [...] After Mazrim Taim adds, [...] "Kneel and swear to the Lord Dragon, or you will be knelt," [...] the Salidar <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> kneel and swear.|$|E
2500|$|Wrongly {{thinking}} the Salidar <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> few and cowed, Rand sends Mat Cauthon to retrieve Elayne Trakand {{and win the}} allegiance of the rebel <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai.</b> Mat discovers that Egwene al'Vere has been named the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai; and when she sends Nynaeve al'Meara and Elayne to Ebou Dar in Altara {{to search for a}} ter'angreal called the [...] "Bowl of the Winds" [...] to break the Dark One's control of the climate, Mat goes with them. Shortly after Perrin joins him, Rand is secretly kidnapped by Elaida's <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai,</b> who torture him en route to Tar Valon. Learning of the kidnapping, Perrin leads Rand's followers to the climactic Battle of Dumai's Wells. [...] At the end of the battle, the rebel <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> are forced to swear fealty to the Dragon Reborn while the surviving White Tower <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> remain captives.|$|E

2500|$|When {{three of}} the Tower <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> {{shielding}} Rand leave to join the battle (leaving only 3 instead of the usual, and needed, 6 <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> guarding him to maintain his shield), Rand manages {{to break through the}} shield thanks to Lews Therin Telamon's help, reaching saidin and breaking out of the chest in which he was trapped. He stills all {{three of the}} <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> shielding him in the rush to break free. Rand finds Min beneath pieces of the exploded chest, but she is unharmed. He cuts her bonds and leads her out into the battle. [...] Rand then continues knocking unconscious and shielding more Tower <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> from within their lines, weakening their defence against the Shaido and their Wise Ones. As he is using saidin they are unable to detect him. Gawyn Trakand rides up, and wants to take Min away, but she refuses. She tells Gawyn that his sister Elayne Trakand loves Rand; Gawyn, believing rumors that say Rand killed his mother, swears that he will see Rand die one day before wheeling away and retreating with his Younglings.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the first book, fear of another Breaking of the World and the dangers posed by saidin's {{corruption}} are so great that—while increasingly rare—male channelers are now a source of nightmares and terror to most people. The original symbol of the Aes Sedai—a circle separated into black and white halves by a sinuous line symbolizing both halves of the One Power—has been replaced by the Flame of Tar Valon, consisting only of the white half of the original symbol. The male half of the symbol, known as the dragon's fang, is used as a symbol of evil and a curse—often carved onto the doors of those accused of conspiring with the Dark Lord (known as Darkfriends). The term <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> – used as a name, title and honorific – refers almost exclusively to female channelers, most often specifically referring to members of an exclusive society headquartered in the White Tower in Tar Valon. Divided into several factions identified by color, known as Ajahs, the <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> present a unified face to the world but often experience great internal conflict. They refer to each other as [...] "sisters" [...] but maintain a rigid hierarchy of authority determined by custom and strength in the One Power.|$|E
2500|$|One Ajah, the Red, {{is devoted}} to hunting down any and all male channelers and {{stripping}} them of their abilities (known as gentling). Removing a female's ability to access the One Power is known as stilling. The greatest form of White Tower punishment, <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> avoid even looking at the stilled as the mere idea of being separated from the One Power (the source of their elite status, {{as well as the}} experience of channeling) is so distasteful. Those who have been stilled, gentled or [...] "burned out" [...] experience deep depression and most often eventually die, wasting away in apathy.|$|E
2500|$|The Creator had imprisoned its antithesis, Shai'tan (often called 'the Dark One'), {{but due to}} an <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> experiment, Shai'tan's {{influence}} is mistakenly loosed into the world. Thereafter he is the story's principal antagonist, promising power and immortality to those who aid his total freedom (known as 'Darkfriends'). A century after the initial breach of the Dark One's prison, open warfare occurs between {{the forces of the}} Dark One and those of the Light, until the chieftain Lews Therin Telamon, known as the Dragon, leads a force of channelers and soldiers to reseal the prison; whereupon the Dark One inflicts a malediction that drives male channelers of the One Power insane. Thus affected, the male channelers create earthquakes and tsunamis altering numerous landscapes in an event that comes to be called [...] "The Breaking of the World." [...] Lews Therin himself kills his friends and family, and is known afterwards as [...] "Kinslayer." [...] Given a moment of sanity by Ishamael, chief among the Dark One's servants, Lews Therin commits suicide. In the aftermath, the women <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> re-organize society, and nullify male access to the Power. [...] Two subsequent events are important to the novels' principal story: the [...] "Trolloc Wars", in which servants of the Dark One foment a continuous war for several hundred years; and the [...] "War of the Hundred Years", a devastating civil war succeeding the fall of a continent-spanning empire ruled by the [...] "High King", Artur Hawkwing. When the novels begin, most people live in a technology and culture roughly comparable to that of Europe's 1450 to 1600 (with the difference that women are socially equal to men in most societies, and superior in some), in fear of a prophecy that the Dark One will break from his prison and the Dragon will be reborn to face him.|$|E
50|$|Among <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> in the novels, some <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai,</b> {{primarily}} the Red Ajah, believe that male <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> sheltering in stedding (which slowed their insanity) exacerbated the Breaking. Others, {{primarily the}} Blue Ajah, hold that the Breaking might have destroyed the world entirely had all male <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> gone insane {{at the same}} time. Female <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> of the time foresaw the Rebirth of the Dragon, and undertook several wonders (the Eye of the World, the Stone of Tear, Callandor, etc.) to provide him with what he needed.|$|E
5000|$|After the battle, {{the nine}} Salidar <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> {{come over to}} congratulate Rand.

50|$|The current <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> are {{the most}} visible {{organized}} group of channelers; led by the Amyrlin Seat, they are a female-only organization due to the (former) taint on saidin. The <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> headquarters, the White Tower, is on the island city of Tar Valon. <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> see themselves as the guardians or caretakers of the civilized world, {{and serve as a}} neutral, altruistic party (almost theocratic, though the <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> are not and have never been a religious order) in the socio-political climate of the series' main continent.|$|E
50|$|On {{the eastern}} {{continent}} of Robert Jordan’s world, the remaining female <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> eventually reorganized {{themselves on the}} island of Tar Valon, where, {{with the assistance of the}} Ogier, they built the White Tower. The <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> there became a monastic order, educated through years of hard training. Their elected leader held the title Amyrlin Seat and became as powerful as any government. Any man with the ability to channel was 'gentled' (i.e. severed from the Power). The common people of Jordan’s series fear the <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai,</b> knowing that they channeled the same power that had caused the Breaking of the World. As a result, <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> have often been the focus of mistrust and even hatred. To make themselves more trustworthy, <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> employed the Oath Rod and developed the Warders.|$|E
50|$|Egwene is captive in the White Tower, but holds {{contact with}} the rebel <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> through Tel'aran'rhiod.

50|$|Setalle Anan is {{the innkeeper}} of the Wandering Woman in Ebou Dar. Setalle is hazel-eyed {{and has a}} little grey in her hair. She has an air of command, not unlike that seen in <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai.</b> In fact, in Knife of Dreams and later books she {{acknowledges}} to having been <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai.</b> She also hints at having been stilled (or possibly having burnt herself out). Not much else is known about her history. Mat Cauthon thinks {{that she is not}} Ebou Dari. An <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai,</b> Joline Maza, recognizes her voice in book 9 as something from her past, so that is more evidence that she was once <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai.</b>|$|E
50|$|The modern <b>Aes</b> <b>Sedai</b> {{operate as}} self-appointed {{guardians of the}} One Power and are often viewed as above local and {{national}} politics.

50|$|Traditionally, every sister chooses an Ajah {{immediately}} after being raised beyond {{the rank of}} Accepted.
