We compared adaptation across 1) non-amputee subjects using joint <b>angle,</b> <b>joint</b> torque, and myoelectric control interfaces, and 2) amputee subjects using myoelectric control interfaces with residual and intact limbs (five total control interface conditions). We measured trial-by-trial adaptation to self-generated errors and random perturbations during a virtual, single degree-of-freedom task with two levels of feedback uncertainty, and evaluated adaptation by fitting a hierarchical Kalman filter model. We have two main results. First, adaptation to random perturbations was similar across all control interfaces, whereas adaptation to self-generated errors differed. These patterns matched predictions of our model, which was fit to each control interface by changing the process noise parameter that represented system variability. Second, in amputee subjects, we found similar adaptation rates and error levels between residual and intact limbs.

We examined whether flexibility can be increased through enlarging the <b>joint</b> <b>angle</b> range during practice in a manual obstacle-avoidance target-pointing task. To establish differences in flexibility we partitioned the variability in <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> over repetitions in variability within (GEV) and variability outside the solution space (NGEV). More GEV than NGEV reflects flexibility; when the ratio of the GEV and NGEV is higher, flexibility is higher. The pretest and posttest consisted of 30 repetitions of manual pointing to a target while moving over a 10 cm high obstacle. To enlarge the <b>joint</b> <b>angle</b> range during practice participants performed 600 target-pointing movements while moving over obstacles of different heights (5 – 9 cm, 11 – 15 cm). The results indicated that practicing movements over obstacles of different heights led participants to use enlarged range of <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> compared to the range of <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> used in movements over the 10 cm obstacle in the pretest. However, for each individual obstacle neither <b>joint</b> <b>angle</b> variance nor flexibility were higher during practice. We also did not find more flexibility after practice.

The potential influences of learning effects and the task used that could underlie the results obtained are discussed.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Analysis of {{vibration}} transmission and reflection in beam-like engineering structures requires better predictive models {{in order to}} further optimize structural behavior. Various studies have used flexural and longitudinal structural wave motion to model the vibrational response of angled junctions in beam-like structures, in order to better understand the transmission and reflection properties. This study considers a model of variable <b>angle</b> <b>joint</b> which joins two semi-infinite rectangular cross-section beams. In a novel approach, the model allows for the joint to expand in size as the angle between the two beams is increased. Thus, making the model a good representative in wide range of angles. Predicted results are compared to an existing model of a joint between two semi-infinite beams where the joint was modeled as a fixed inertia regardless of the angle between the beams, thus limiting its physical representation, especially at the extremes of angle. Results from experimentation were also compared to the modeling, which is in good agreement for the range of angles investigated. Optimum angles for minimum vibrational power transmission are identified in terms of the frequency of the incoming flexural or longitudinal wave.
