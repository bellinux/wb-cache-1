(plug adaptors and block adaptors) Plug adaptors are rated for 232/240 bar, and can only be used with valves which are designed to accept them.

40|$|Abstract. Software {{adaptation}} aims at generating software pieces called <b>adaptors</b> {{to compensate}} interface and behavioural mismatch between components or services.

This is not satisfactory when the systems may evolve, with components entering or leaving it at any time, e. g., for pervasive computing.

For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an <b>adaptor</b> that contains no logic circuitry may be used: the hardware in the USB keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port. These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a microcontroller to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.|$|E
5|$|Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, {{and some}} DNAs are transported through the pore {{complexes}} {{in a process}} mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use <b>adaptor</b> proteins. Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, {{as well as other}} small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus.

5|$|The {{receptor}} for AtPep1 {{has been}} identified as a 170KDa LRR-RLK and has been named AtPEPR1. AtPep1 is active at 0.1 nano-molar (nM) concentrations and the receptor saturates at 1nM. An analysis {{of the structure of the}} AtPEPR1 receptor has shown that it is a member of the LRR XI subfamily of LRR-RLKs in A. thaliana which includes the receptor for another peptide hormone CLAVATA3. Transforming tobacco cell cultures with AtPEPR1 allowed them to respond to AtPep1 in an alkalisation assay, whereas normal tobacco did not show such a response. BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1) is an LRR-RLK found in A. thaliana, which has been proposed to function as an <b>adaptor</b> protein that is required for the proper functioning of other RLKs.

40|$|<b>Adaptors</b> are {{component}} proteins of junctional complexes in all epithelia, {{including the}} seminiferous epithelium of the mammalian testis. They recruit other regulatory and structural proteins {{to the site}} of both anchoring junctions (such as cell-cell actin-based adherens junctions [AJs], e. g., ectoplasmic specialization [ES] and tubulobulbar complex, which are both testis-specific cell-cell actin-based AJ types, and cell-cell intermediate filament-based desmosome-like junctions) and tight junctions (TJ). Furthermore, <b>adaptors</b> per se can be substrates and/or activators of kinases or phosphatases. As such, the integrity of cell junctions and the regulation of junction dynamics during spermatogenesis rely on <b>adaptors</b> for their ability to recruit and link different junctional components to the same site and to tether transmembrane proteins at both anchoring and TJ sites to the underlying cytoskeletons, such as the actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. These protein-protein interactions are possible because <b>adaptors</b> are composed of conserved protein binding domains, which allow them to link to more than one structural or signaling protein, recruiting multiprotein complexes to the same site. Herein, we provide a timely review of <b>adaptors</b> recently found at the sites of AJ (e. g., ES) and TJ. In addition, several in vivo models {{that can be used to}} delineate the function of <b>adaptors</b> in the testis are described, and the role of <b>adaptors</b> in regulating junction dynamics pertinent to spermatogenesis is discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

For example, beta-arrestin bound to β2-adrenoreceptors acts as an <b>adaptor</b> for binding with clathrin, and with the beta-subunit of AP2 (clathrin <b>adaptor</b> molecules); thus, the arrestin here acts as a scaffold assembling the components needed for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of β2-adrenoreceptors.|$|E

However, there are few, if any, global assessments of adaptation taking place across cities. This study develops and applies a framework to track urban climate change adaptation policy using municipal adaptation reporting. From 401 local governments globally in urban areas with > 1. m people, we find that only 61 cities (15 %) report any adaptation initiatives, and 73 cities (18 %) report on planning towards adaptation policy. We classified cities based on their adaptation reporting as extensive <b>adaptors,</b> moderate <b>adaptors,</b> early stage <b>adaptors,</b> and non-reporting. With few exceptions, extensive <b>adaptors</b> are large cities located in high-income countries in North America, Europe, and Oceania, and are adapting {{to a variety of}} expected impacts. Moderate <b>adaptors</b> usually address general disaster risk reduction rather than specific impacts, and are located in a mix of developed and developing countries.
