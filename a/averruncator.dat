50|$|An <b>averruncator</b> {{is a form}} of long shears used in {{arboriculture}} for averruncating or pruning off {{the higher}} branches of trees, etc.|$|E
50|$|An <b>averruncator</b> has a {{compound}} blade {{attached to a}} handle between five and eight feet long. The blades are closed with a rope and pulley, and they are opened with a spring.|$|E
5000|$|Secateurs have short {{handles and}} are {{operated}} with one hand. [...] A spring between the handles causes the jaws to open again after closing. When not in use, the jaws may be held closed by a safety catch or by a loop holding the handles together. Some types {{are designed for}} right-handed or left-handed use only, and some incorporate a rotating handle to reduce friction and minimize hand stress during repetitive use. There are also longer versions called telescopic pruners, which are adjustable for long-reach and operate {{by means of a}} rod system inside of a telescoping pole between the handles and the blades. An early version of these was known as an <b>averruncator.</b>|$|E
