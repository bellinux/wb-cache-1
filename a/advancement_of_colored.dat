40|$|Women <b>of</b> <b>color</b> {{are already}} {{severely}} underrepresented in legal academia; as enrollment drops and legal institutions constrict further, {{race and gender}} disparities will likely continue to grow. Yet, as many deans and associate deans, {{most of whom are}} white, step down from leadership positions during these tumultuous times in legal education, opportunities have arisen for women <b>of</b> <b>color</b> to fill those roles in record numbers. However, there are individual and structural barriers preventing access to the leadership level. Significant hurdles have long prevented women <b>of</b> <b>color</b> from entering law teaching. Thus, this Article provides evidence to support the thesis that ongoing changes in legal education will likely continue to create barriers both to entry and <b>advancement</b> for women <b>of</b> <b>color</b> law faculty members and those who aspire to join legal academia. This Article draws from quantitative and qualitative analyses of data drawn from the Diversity in Legal Academia (DLA) project, a landmark mixed-method study of law faculty diversity, which utilizes an intersectional lens to focus on the experiences <b>of</b> women <b>of</b> <b>color</b> in legal academia while also incorporating those of white men, white women, and men <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> Empirical findings reveal that structural barriers (i. e., outright discrimination) as well as more indirect obstacles prevent women <b>of</b> <b>color</b> from joining legal academia in meaningful numbers and also preclude women <b>of</b> <b>color</b> who are already legal academics from taking on leadership positions. Law school administrators and policy makers should work against these structural and individual barriers to increase and improve faculty diversity at all levels. Greater diversity in legal academia generally, and leadership in particular, will not only provide greater opportunities for particular law faculty members, but will also {{have a positive effect on}} law students, legal education, legal academia, and the legal profession overall...|$|R
