2500|$|According to Mordechai Eliyahu, {{former chief}} Rabbi of Israel, {{his meeting with}} Schneerson [...] "covered all {{sections}} of the Torah" [...] Eliyahu said [...] "The Rebbe jumped effortlessly from one Talmudic tractate to another, {{and from there to}} Kabbalah and then to Jewish law... It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> finished studying these very topics from the holy books. The whole Torah was an open book in front of him".|$|E
2500|$|... "having {{dismounted}} {{from his}} horse in an unguarded moment, [...] was espied and {{singled out by}} an old lady of Amazonian proportions, just from the wash tub, who, wiping her hands and mouth on her apron as she approached, seized him around the neck with the hug of a bruin, and bestowed upon him half a dozen kisses that were heard by nearly every man in the command, and when at length she relaxed her hold the Colonel looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> come out a vapor bath".|$|E
2500|$|Baruch's grave {{became the}} subject of later legends. According to a Muslim {{tradition}} reported by sources including Petachiah of Ratisbon, an Arabian king once ordered it to be opened; but all who touched it fell dead. The king thereupon commanded the Jews to open it; and they, after preparing themselves by a three days' fast, succeeded without a mishap. Baruch's body was found intact in a marble coffin, and appeared <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> died. The king ordered that it should be transported to another place; but, after having dragged the coffin a little distance, the horses and camels were unable to move it another inch. The king, greatly excited by these wonders, went with his retinue to Muhammad to ask his advice. Arrived at Mecca, his doubts of the truth of the teachings of Islam greatly increased, and he and his courtiers finally accepted Judaism. The king then built a [...] "bet ha-midrash" [...] on the spot from which he had been unable to move Baruch's body; and this academy served for a long time as a place of pilgrimage.|$|E

6000|$|... 'The {{same idea}} {{struck me that}} {{occurred}} to Hampton,' Danvers said, 'but I suppose it was fancy. It sounded to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already paid, to some extent, the debt he spoke of, or <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no doubt whatever that he should {{do so in the}} future.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Quranic and hadith traditions such as Sahih Bukhari {{as well as}} tafsir {{have given}} an oral {{depiction}} of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the Night Journey, when {{he is supposed to}} have been taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of this say that [...] "Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion". Others say his face was flushed as if he just had a bath ("a reddish man with many freckles on his face <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> come from a bath"). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as [...] "a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary". However, other narrations give variations in the color. Salim ibn Abd-Allah reports from his father Abdullah ibn Umar that the prophet [...] "did not say that Jesus was of red complexion", rather he was [...] "a man of brown complexion and lank hair". In contrast Abd Allah ibn Abbas says that Jesus was of [...] "moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, NBC {{executive}} Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran {{the idea}} of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted {{he did not want}} to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know he felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. [...] "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,” Leno said. “You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I don’t want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who’s better?' and nasty things back and forth in the press. So right now, here it is—Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!" ...|$|E
