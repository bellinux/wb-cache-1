40|$|A global {{study of}} the {{vertical}} structures of the clouds of tropical mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) {{has been carried out}} with data from the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar. Tropical MCSs are found to be dominated by cloud-top heights greater than 10 km. Secondary cloud layers sometimes occur in MCSs, but outside their primary raining cores. The secondary layers have tops at 6 [...] 8 and 1 [...] 3 km. High-topped clouds extend outward from raining cores of MCSs to form <b>anvil</b> <b>clouds.</b> Closest to the raining cores, the anvils tend to have broader distributions of reflectivity at all levels, with the modal values at higher reflectivity in their lower levels. Portions of <b>anvil</b> <b>clouds</b> far away from the raining core are thin and have narrow frequency distributions of reflectivity at all levels with overall weaker values. This difference likely reflects ice particle fallout and therefore cloud age. Reflectivity histograms of MCS <b>anvil</b> <b>clouds</b> vary little across the tropics, except that (i) in continental MCS anvils, broader distributions of reflectivity occur at the uppermost levels in the portions closest to active raining areas; (ii) the frequency of occurrence of stronger reflectivity in the upper part of anvils decreases faster with increasing distance in continental MCSs; and (iii) narrower-peaked ridges are prominent in reflectivity histograms of thick <b>anvil</b> <b>clouds</b> close to the raining areas of connected MCSs (superclusters).

50|$|All Space Shuttle {{missions}} {{were launched}} from Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The weather criteria used for launch included, {{but were not}} limited to: precipitation, temperatures, cloud cover, lightning forecast, wind, and humidity. The Shuttle was not launched under conditions where {{it could have been}} struck by lightning. Aircraft are often struck by lightning with no adverse effects because the electricity of the strike is dissipated through its conductive structure and the aircraft is not electrically grounded. Like most jet airliners, the Shuttle was mainly constructed of conductive aluminum, which would normally shield and protect the internal systems. However, upon liftoff the Shuttle sent out a long exhaust plume as it ascended, and this plume could have triggered lightning by providing a current path to ground. The NASA Anvil Rule for a Shuttle launch stated that an <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> could not appear within a distance of 10 nautical miles. The Shuttle Launch Weather Officer monitored conditions until the final decision to scrub a launch was announced. In addition, the weather conditions had to be acceptable at one of the Transatlantic Abort Landing sites (one of several Space Shuttle abort modes) to launch as well as the solid rocket booster recovery area. While the Shuttle might have safely endured a lightning strike, a similar strike caused problems on Apollo 12, so for safety NASA chose not to launch the Shuttle if lightning was possible (NPR8715.5).|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is described}} for testing the simulation of tropical convective clouds by models through comparison with observations of clouds and precipitation from Earth-orbiting satellites. Clouds {{are divided into}} categories that represent convective cores, moderately thick anvil clouds and thin high clouds, and fractional abundances of these clouds are computed {{as a function of}} rain rate. A three dimensional model is forced with steady forcing characteristic of tropical Pacific convective regions, and the model clouds are compared with satellite observations for the same regions. The model produces a good simulation {{of the relationship between the}} precipitation rate and optically thick cold clouds that represent convective cores. The data show large abundances of <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> with a strong dependence on rain rate, but the model produces too little <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> by a factor of about four and with a very weak dependence on rain rate. The observations show probability density functions for OLR and albedo with maxima that correspond to extended upper-level cold clouds, whereas the model does not. The sensitivity of the <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> simulation to model parameters is explored using a two-dimensional model. Both cloud physical parameters and mean wind shear effects are investigated. The simulation of <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> can be improved while maintaining a good simulation of optically thick cloud by adjusting the cloud physics parameters in the model to produce more ice cloud and less liquid water cloud. ...|$|E
40|$|Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LLCC) are {{designed}} to prevent space launch vehicles from flight through environments conducive to natural or triggered lightning and are used for all U. S. government and commercial launches at government and civilian ranges. They are maintained by a committee known as the NASA/USAF Lightning Advisory Panel (LAP). The previous LLCC for <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud,</b> meant to avoid triggered lightning, {{have been shown to}} be overly restrictive. Some of these rules have had such high safety margins that they prohibited flight under conditions that are now thought to be safe 90 % of the time, leading to costly launch delays and scrubs. The LLCC for anvil clouds was upgraded in the summer of 2005 to incorporate results from the Airborne Field Mill (ABFM) experiment at the Eastern Range (ER). Numerous combinations of parameters were considered to develop the best correlation of operational weather observations to in-cloud electric fields capable of rocket triggered lightning in anvil clouds. The Volume Averaged Height Integrated Radar Reflectivity (VAHIRR) was the best metric found. Dr. Harry Koons of Aerospace Corporation conducted a risk analysis of the VAHIRR product. The results indicated that the LLCC based on the VAHIRR product would pose a negligible risk of flying through hazardous electric fields. Based on these findings, the Kennedy Space Center Weather Office is considering seeking funding for development of an automated VAHIRR algorithm for the new ER 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) RadTec 431250 weather radar and Weather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler (WSR- 88 D) radars. Before developing an automated algorithm, the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) was tasked to determine the frequency with which VAHIRR would have allowed a launch to safely proceed during weather conditions otherwise deemed "red" by the Launch Weather Officer. To do this, the AMU manually calculated VAHIRR values based on candidate cases from past launches with known <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> LLCC violations. An automated algorithm may be developed if the analyses from past launches show VAHIRR would have provided a significant cost benefit by allowing a launch to proceed. The 45 WS at the ER and 30 th Weather Squadron (30 WS) at the Western Range provided the AMU with launch weather summaries from past launches that were impacted by LLCC. The 45 WS provided summaries from 14 launch attempts and the 30 WS fkom 5. The launch attempts occurred between December 2001 and June 2007. These summaries helped the AMU determine when the LLCC were "red" due to <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud.</b> The AMU collected WSR- 88 D radar reflectivity, cloud-to-ground lightning strikes, soundings and satellite imagery. The AMU used step-by-step instructions for calculating VAHIRR manually as provided by the 45 WS. These instructions were used for all of the candidate cases when <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> caused an LLCC violation identified in the launch weather summaries. The AMU evaluated several software programs capable of visualizing radar data so that VAHIRR could be calculated and chose GR 2 Analyst from Gibson Ridge Software, LLC. Data availability and lack of detail from some launch weather summaries permitted analysis of six launch attempts from the ER and none from the WR. The AMU did not take into account whether or not other weather LCC violations were occurring at the same time as the <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> LLCC since the goal of this task was to determine how often VAHIRR provided relief to the <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> LLCC at any time during several previous launch attempts. Therefore, in the statistics presented in this report, it is possible that even though VAHIRR provided relief to the <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> LLCC, other weather LCC could have been violated not permitting the launch to proceed. The results of this cost-benefit analysis indicated VAHIRR provided relief from the <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> LLCC between about 15 % and 18 % of the time for varying 5 -minute time periods based on summaries fkom six launch attempts and would have allowed launch to proceed that were otherwise "NO GO" due to the <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> LLCC if the T- 0 time occurred during the <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> LLCC violations...|$|E

For all 8 regions, the convective clusters become deeper, while they become wider {{and tend to}} be composed of multiple rainy cores. Among 8 regions, convective clusters at the same scale over EP and AT tend to have less but wider rainy cores than those at WP, MA and IO, while those over AF, IO, MA and AM tend to have higher cloud top than those over ocean. For convective clusters less than 300 km wide over AF and MA, the rainy cores pump more ice mass of larger particles to the mid- and upper troposphere in strong updrafts. The total <b>anvil</b> <b>clouds</b> detrained from convection counts for 0. 4 to 0. 8 of the cluster horizontal scale, 0. 2 to 0. 6 of the cluster cross section volume, and 0. 05 to 0. 20 of the cluster ice mass, depending on the cluster scales and height.

Optically thick cold clouds accompany the precipitation burst, which is followed by the development of spreading upper level <b>anvil</b> <b>clouds</b> and an increase in upper tropospheric humidity over a broader region than that occupied by the precipitation anomalies. The temporal separation between the convective event and the development of <b>anvil</b> <b>clouds</b> is about 3 hours.

40|$|General {{circulation}} models {{show that}} as the surface temperature increases, the convective anvil clouds shrink. By analyzing radiativeâ€“convective equilibrium simulations, we show that this behavior is rooted in basic energetic and thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere: As the climate warms, the clouds rise and remain at nearly the same temperature, but {{find themselves in a}} more stable atmosphere; this enhanced stability reduces the convective outflow in the upper troposphere and decreases the <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> fraction. By warming the troposphere and increasing the upper-tropospheric stability, the clustering of deep convection also reduces the convective outflow and the <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> fraction. When clouds are radiatively active, this robust coupling between temperature, high clouds, and circulation exerts a positive feedback on convective aggregation and favors the maintenance of strongly aggregated atmospheric states at high temperatures. This stability iris mechanism likely contributes to the narrowing of rainy areas as the climate warms. Whether or not it influences climate sensitivity requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Using {{satellite}} cloud {{data from}} the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and collocated precipitation rates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), it is shown that rain rate {{is closely related to}} the amount of very thick high cloud, which is a better proxy for precipitation than outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). It is also shown that thin high cloud, which has a positive net radiative effect on the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy balance, is nearly twice as abundant in the west Pacific compared to the east Pacific. For a given rain rate, <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> is also more abundant in the west Pacific. The ensemble of all high clouds in the east Pacific induces considerably more TOA radiative cooling compared to the west Pacific, primarily because of more high, thin cloud in the west Pacific. High clouds are also systematically colder in the west Pacific by about 5 K. The authors examine whether the <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> temperature is better predicted by low-level equivalent potential temperature (E), or by the peak in upper-level convergence associated with radiative cooling in clear skies. The temperature in the upper troposphere where E is the same as that at the lifting conden-sation level (LCL) seems to influence the temperatures of the coldest, thickest clouds, but has no simple relation to <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud.</b> It is shown instead that a linear relationship exists between the median anvil cloud-top temperature and the temperature at the peak in clear-sky convergence.

30|$|The {{simulation}} results, {{as revealed}} by composite radar reflectivity, {{are shown in}} Fig.Â  1. To validate the model-simulated cloud properties, a radar reflectivity-based cloud classification algorithm is developed following the work of Steiner et al. (1995) and Feng et al. (2011). This algorithm classified the convective system into a convective core (CC), stratiform rain (SR), non-precipitating transitional <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> (ACtrans), and <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> (AC) from NEXRAD radar reflectivity observations (Fig.Â  2). FiguresÂ  1 and 2 suggests that the 2 M representation of warm rain (WDM 6) helps the model reproduce a better forecast of the MCS {{in terms of the}} cloud coverage and components, compared with the forecast from the experiment with a 1 M scheme (WSM 6). Moreover, further evaluations (see details in Lin 2014) indicated that: with a full 2 M scheme (MORR), the model produces the best simulations with the proper convection life cycle and quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF). Since the major difference between the MORR and WDM 6 is the representation of ice species, the importance of including 2 M representation of ice hydrometeors is evident. In the following section, we compare the model simulation and aircraft observations of ice properties to confirm whether WRF simulation with MORR indeed improves the prediction of ice properties.|$|E

Interacting with dynamics at {{a wide range of}} spatial and temporal scales, they can become organized internally and form structured cells, transporting momentum vertically and laterally. To quantify small-scale structures inside cirrus and anvils, we study view-dependence of the cloud-induced radiance from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) using channels near CO 2 absorption line. The analysis of tropical eight-year (30 degS- 30 degN, 2003 - 2010) data suggests that AIRS east-views observe 10 % more <b>anvil</b> <b>clouds</b> than westviews during day (13 : 30 LST), whereas east-views and westviews observe equally amount of clouds at midnight (1 : 30 LST). For entire tropical averages, AIRS oblique views observe more anvils than the nadir views, while the opposite is true for deep convective clouds. The dominance of cloudiness in the east-view cannot be explained by AIRS sampling and cloud microphysical differences. Tilted and banded anvil structures from convective scale to mesoscale are likely the cause of the observed view-dependent cloudiness, and gravity wave-cloud interaction is a plausible explanation for the observed structures.

40|$|L indzen et al. (2001, {{hereafter}} LCH) presentobservational analysis {{suggesting that}} the areacoverage of anvil clouds associated with tropicalconvection is less extensive when sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are higher. This conclusion {{is based on a}} negative correlation between the fractional area coverage by high clouds and the average SST un-der the clouds. LCH observe this correlation in about 20 months of Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) radiance data for the oceanic regions in the do-main between 30 Â°Sâ€“ 30 Â°N and 130 Â°Eâ€“ 170 Â°W. LCH then used this correlation to hypothesize that increased SST leads to reduced area of <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> associated with convective cores in the Tropics. They then concluded that reduced <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> would give rise to a negative feedback through reduced upper-tropospheric water vapor and diminished greenhouse effect. We have obtained the cloud data from LCH and have investigated the geographical patterns of cloud fraction variation that are associated with variations in the cloud-weighted SST. These patterns show that the changes in cloud-weighted SST for clouds with emission temperatures less than 260 K are dominated by cloud variations in subtropical latitudes. These variations are geographically separated from the varia-tions in the deepest convective clouds (those with emission temperatures less than 220 K), which occur only near the equator where surface temperatures are highest. LCH assume that the coldest clouds are rep-resentative of the convective cores that feed anvil clouds. In this article we show that the deep convec-tive cores are separated by more than 1000 km from the clouds that are associated with most of the varia-tion in cloud-weighted SST. The explanation for the correspondence between cloud-weighted SST and cloud area is thus a shift in the latitude or longitude of the cloudiness and not a change in the relation be-tween deep convective and associated tropical <b>anvil</b> <b>cloud</b> amounts. These latitude and longitude shifts are associated with meteorological forcing and not with SST forcing. Much of the meteorological forcing seems to originate in the extratropics and is probably unrelated to tropical SSTs.

Due to the intensely sheared environment in which mammatus form, aviators are strongly cautioned to avoid cumulonimbus with mammatus as they indicate convectively induced turbulence.

From the IRIS data {{it has been observed}} that these optically thin cirrus clouds prevail extensively over the ''warm pool'' region of the equatorial western Pacific surrounding Indonesia.

It is deduced that dense cold <b>anvil</b> <b>clouds</b> associated with deep convection spread extensively and are responsible for the formation of the thin cirrus. This is supported by the observation that the coverage of the dense <b>anvil</b> <b>clouds</b> is an order of magnitude less than that of the thin cirrus. Observations made by the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) reveal that the ''warm pool'' region constitutes a local maximum in net input of radiative energy.

The shuttle landed at Kennedy Space Center 16 days later at 10:48 EDT on 31 July 2009.|$|R
