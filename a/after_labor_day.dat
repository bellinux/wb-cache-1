He faced one opponent in the Democratic primary on August 26: lifelong Republican and Washington, D.C. resident H. Brooke Paige, who simultaneously ran against Democratic incumbent William Sorrell in the Democratic primary election for Vermont Attorney General. Paige was also unsuccessful in that effort, losing by 80% to 20%.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, Willkie {{returned}} to New York. When {{he went to}} the movies, he received a standing ovation, as he did when he went to see the play Life With Father. He resigned from C on July 8, 1940, confident that even if he lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until <b>after</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day,</b> Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the NFL made {{allowance}} {{for an open}} weekend between the Conference Championship games and the Super Bowl. However, there wasn't one scheduled for 2001, due to the NFL's decision beginning in the 1999 season to move the opening week of games to the weekend <b>after</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day.</b> Because {{the date of the}} Super Bowl had been set through 2003, the bye week prior to the Super Bowl would not return until 2004.|$|E

A survey found that 70% of all tourism business comes directly from Michigan residents, and the Michigan Hotel, Motel, & Resort Association claimed that the shorter summer in between school years cut into the annual tourism season in the state.|$|R

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Friday, December 21, 1990, Schmalz had a seizure and collapsed working at his desk at The New York Times. By February, his doctors had determined Schmalz had AIDS. His T cell count was just two and he had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a brain disease that is often fatal within months. He told his editors about his illness and took a health leave for about seven months. He responded well to AZT and returned to The New York Times just <b>after</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day</b> in 1991. He decided to cover the 1992 presidential campaign.|$|E
25|$|The court sits in six, week-long {{sessions}} to hear cases {{on the merits}} each year. The term begins the week <b>after</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day</b> in September and ends in mid-June. All sessions are held in Richmond and generally fall six weeks apart, although the recess between the November and January sessions is longer to accommodate the intervening holidays. During each recess, the justices research the cases awaiting argument, draft and review opinions in cases already heard, consider petitions for appeal, and attend to administrative duties. Cases docketed for argument on the merits include those discretionary appeals for which a petition for appeal was granted, appeals of right for which no petition was necessary, and cases within the court's original jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The Super Bowl is {{currently}} {{played on the}} first Sunday in February. This {{is due to the}} NFL current schedule which consists of the opening weekend of the season being held immediately <b>after</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day</b> (the first Monday in September), the 17-week regular season (where teams each play 16 games and have one bye), the first three rounds of the playoffs, and the Super Bowl two weeks after the two Conference Championship Games. This schedule has been in effect since Super Bowl XXXVIII in February 2004. The date of the Super Bowl can thus be determined from the date of the preceding Labor Day. For example, Labor Day in 2015 occurred on September 7; therefore the next Super Bowl was scheduled exactly five months later on February 7, 2016.|$|E
5000|$|<b>After</b> the Great <b>Labor</b> <b>Day</b> Hurricane {{destroyed}} {{sections of}} the Overseas Railroad on September 3, 1935, the State of Florida bought the remnants for $640,000 and proceeded to construct road bridges {{on top of the}} railroad trestles.

50|$|In 2009, Bistineau and Caney Lakes {{were again}} engulfed by the {{non-native}} giant salvinia fern, which chokes {{up the water}} and reduces its level. The salvinia appeared in the late 1990s at Toledo Bend Reservoir near Many in Sabine Parish. Other vegetation, such as water hyacinths, have clogged the lake over the years. State officials, citing inadequate funding, have thus far been unable to resolve the problem, which impairs boating activities and detracts from the scenic beauty. The water level of Bistineau will be lowered <b>after</b> the <b>Labor</b> <b>Day</b> weekend in another effort to combat the salvinia. Such drawdowns have been undertaken many times in recent years but with exceptions.|$|R
25|$|Originally, {{the game}} {{took place in}} early to mid-January. For Super Bowl I {{there was only one}} round of playoffs: the pre-merger NFL and AFL Championship Games. The {{addition}} of two playoff rounds (first in 1967 and then in 1978), an increase in regular season games from 14 to 16 (1978), and the establishment of one bye-week per team (1990) have caused the Super Bowl to be played later. Partially offsetting these season-lengthening effects, simultaneous with the addition of two regular season games in 1978, the season was started earlier. Prior to 1978 the season started as late as September 21. Now, since Labor Day is always the first Monday of September, September 13 is the latest possible date for the first full Sunday set of games (Since 2002, the regular season has started with the Kickoff Game on the Thursday <b>after</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day).</b>|$|E

25|$|The National Football League (NFL) {{regular season}} begins the weekend <b>after</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day</b> in early September and ends in December or early January. It {{consists}} of 256 games, where each team (32 total) plays 16 games during a 17-week period. Since 2012, the NFL schedule generally has games {{in one of}} five time slots during the week. A game played on Thursday night, kicking off at 8:25 PM (ET). The majority of games are played on Sunday, most kicking off at 1:00 PM (ET), some late afternoon games starting at 4:05 or 4:25 PM (ET). Additionally, one Sunday night game is played every week at 8:30 PM (ET). One Monday night game then starts at 8:30 PM (ET) every week {{with the exception of}} the first week of the regular season, in which two Monday night games are played back-to-back (the second game always occurring on the West coast), as well as the last week of the season, in which no Monday night game is held. In addition to these regularly scheduled games, there are occasionally games at other times, such as a Saturday afternoon or evening, or the annual Thanksgiving Day games in which three games are played. During the final week of the regular season, all games are held on Sunday.|$|E
5000|$|The key was {{the site}} of a salt {{manufacturing}} operation in the 1820s & 1830s.

25|$|The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and {{subsequent}} Great Depression were particularly {{hard on the}} Florida East Coast Railway (FEC). The railroad declared bankruptcy and was in receivership by September 1931, just 18 years after Henry Morrison Flagler’s death. Bus service began to be substituted for trains on the branches in 1932, and the Key West Extension was abandoned <b>after</b> the <b>Labor</b> <b>Day</b> Hurricane of 1935. However, streamliners terminating in Miami nevertheless plied the rails between 1939 and 1968, including such famous trains as The Champion and The Florida Special jointly operated with the Atlantic Coast Line. Adding to the woes was the Cuban embargo, thus reducing {{a significant portion of}} FEC's revenue.|$|R
