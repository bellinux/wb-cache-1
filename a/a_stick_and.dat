His disability prevented his playing many children's games and he devoted himself instead to mathematics.|$|E

25|$|During this period, Frank Epperston started {{marketing}} frozen ice on <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> {{formed the}} Popsicle Corporation. Six months after Popsicle received its patent in August 1924, Good Humor sued Popsicle Corporation, and by October 1925 the parties {{settled out of}} court. Popsicle agreed to pay Good Humor a licence fee to manufacture what was called frozen suckers from ice and sherbet products. Good Humor reserved the right to manufacture these products from ice cream, frozen custard, and the like.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} Frazier started working, {{his left arm}} was seriously injured while he was running from the family's 300 pound hog. One day Frazier poked the hog with <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> ran away. The gate to the pigpen was open, however, and the hog chased him. Frazier fell and hit his left arm on a brick. His arm was torn badly, but as the family could not afford a doctor, the arm had to heal on its own. Joe {{was never able to}} keep it fully {{straight}} again.|$|E
25|$|Manser created {{notebooks}} {{that were}} richly illustrated with drawings, notes, and 10,000 photographs during his six-year stay from 1984 to 1990 with the Penan people. Some of his sketches include cicada wing patterns, how {{to carry a}} gibbon with <b>a</b> <b>stick,</b> <b>and</b> how drill holes on a blowpipe. These notebooks were later published by Christoph Merian Verlag press in Basel. Manser also created audio recordings of oral histories told by Penan elders and translated them. He claimed that the Penan people were never argumentative or violent during his time with the Penan tribe.|$|E

Edmund and some of his army, however, have spotted some of the Witch's army in the distance, and are not as {{unprepared}} for the charge as the Witch might have expected. The Witch and her army finally charge forward just as Aslan is preparing to lead the restored statues and freed prisoners from her castle.|$|E
25|$|During electoral {{campaign}} of 1923 Chicharro {{was considered a}} favourite. It is not clear to what extent he ruined his chances himself: during one of electoral meetings in the very city of Burriana he was challenged by a local workers’ leader. Chicharro resolved to <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> engaged in a brawl, resulting in his victim treated in hospital for head wounds and an administrative action taken against the assailant. Diario de Castellón, the newspaper he founded and owned, failed to mobilize enough support and produced merely significant financial losses. Eventually Chicharro and an albista counter-candidate recorded almost the same score; the latter was declared victorious following behind-the-scene dealings.|$|E
25|$|However, Acharya {{remained}} in London for sometime, lodging at Bipin Pal's boarding house. He attended along with Savarkar, Iyer and other ex-residents {{of the house}} a meeting of Indians called by the Aga Khan to demonstrate their loyalty to the empire and offer condolences to the Wyllie family, where they opposed the unanimous acceptance of a resolution of condemnation against Dhingra. In a scuffle that ensued between Savarkar and a London barrister {{by the name of}} Palmer, Acharya is known to have come to Savarkar's aid, hitting Palmer with <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> apparently not shooting Palmer with his revolver only under indications from Savarkar not to do so.|$|E

25|$|On February 22, 2008, {{six members}} of a group calling {{themselves}} Barbarians assaulted 19-year-old Mathieu Roumi in the same Paris suburb of Bagneux where Halimi was kidnapped. For two hours the attackers tortured the young man. One shoved cigarette butts into his mouth, another took issue with Roumi's Jewish origin (paternal), grabbed correction fluid and scrawled sale juif ("dirty Jew") and sale PD ("dirty faggot") on his forehead. When the issue of his sexual orientation arose, one of them placed a condom on the tip of <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> shoved it in Roumi's mouth. The six men proceeded to scream at him and threaten that he would die the way Halimi did. The men were all arrested.|$|E
25|$|A {{primitive}} tourniquet can be {{made from}} <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> a rope (or leather belt). The rope is made into a loop that fits over the damaged limb and the stick is inserted through the loop. The loop is tightened by twisting the stick. The primitive device may stem the flow of blood but side-effects such as soft tissue damage and nerve damage may occur due to the application of unknown, uncontrollable and excessively high pressures and pressure gradients. It is well established by evidence in the clinical literature that higher tourniquet pressures are associated with higher probabilities of tourniquet-related injuries. Modern pneumatic tourniquet systems are microcomputer-based, allowing more accurate and automatic pressure control and many important safety features to minimize the risk of patient injury. Recent trends toward personalized care has increased patient safety by allowing perioperative staff to measure and select a personalized tourniquet pressure based on the patient’s Limb Occlusion Pressure, and select and apply a personalized tourniquet cuff that can adapt the shape of the tourniquet cuff {{to a wide range of}} non-cylindrical limb shapes.|$|E

500|$|Both Yokoyama and Satou {{noted the}} [...] "Japanese-ness" [...] of the anime during the panel {{discussion}} following the main showing at the Scotland Loves Animation festival. [...] Yokoyama {{had originally been}} concerned that foreign audiences would not fully understand and appreciate the work, but {{the reaction of the}} audience at the Glasgow showing alleviated his concerns. [...] According to Yokoyama and Satou, elements of the story that exhibited strong elements of Japanese culture included the watermelon eating scene, the part where Gin hits young Hotaru over the head with <b>a</b> <b>stick,</b> <b>and</b> the scene where young Hotaru gets scared at night when she sees the face of a yōkai in the patterns of the wood panels on the ceiling.|$|E
500|$|Tactics {{used by a}} defensemen include body {{positioning}} and checking. Checking {{is attempting}} to dispossess the opposition of the ball through body or stick contact. A check may include a [...] "poke check", where a defensemen thrusts his crosse at the top hand or crosse of the opponent in possession of the ball (similar to a billiards shot), or a [...] "slap check", where a player applies a short, two-handed slap to the hand or crosse of the opponent in possession of the ball. A [...] "body check" [...] is allowed {{as long as the}} ball is in possession or a loose ball is within five yards of the opposing player and the contact is made to the front or side of the torso of the opposing player. Defensemen preferably remain in a position relative to their offensive counterpart known as [...] "topside", which generally means <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> body position that forces a ball carrier to go another direction, usually away from the goal.|$|E
500|$|Foraging {{takes place}} on the ground, or less {{commonly}} in trees or shrubs. Most commonly the grey currawong probes the ground for prey, but sometimes chases more mobile animals. It has been recorded removing insects from parked cars, as well as employing the zirkeln method, where it inserts its bill in a crack or under a rock and uses it to lever open a wider space to hunt prey. In one case, a bird was observed holding bark off the branch of a eucalypt and levering open gaps every [...] with its bill. The grey currawong usually swallows prey whole, although one bird was observed impaling a rodent on <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> eating parts of it, {{in the manner of}} a butcherbird. A field study on road ecology in southwestern Australia revealed that the grey currawong is unusual in inhabiting cleared areas adjacent to roads. However, it was not recorded feeding on roadkill, and moves away from the area in breeding season. It was also commonly hit and killed by vehicles.|$|E

500|$|A {{scientist}} {{studying the}} Kaiju. Day stated: [...] "Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide {{a little bit}} of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with <b>a</b> <b>stick,</b> <b>and</b> he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." [...] Trek Buccino portrays Geiszler as a child.|$|E

Dr. Claire Rusbridge expressed her incredulity: [...] "If you took <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> you beat a dog to create this pain that you could get from Syringomyelia, you'd be prosecuted, but there's nothing to stop you from breeding a dog that can be painful." ...|$|E
