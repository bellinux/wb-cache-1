In this paper with uncertainty concerning the length of individual life the real consequences of exchange rate management depend on the precise time pattern of the <b>accompanying</b> <b>policies.</b> We look at a stylized example of disinflation by means of exchange rate targetting with an initial overvalued currency and a delayed <b>accompanying</b> absorbtion <b>policy.</b> The result will be an intergenerational redistribution of welfare whereby spending rises during the initial period and falls during later periods, while the external debt rises in all periods. ...|$|R

40|$|Consider a data holder, {{such as a}} {{hospital}} or a bank, that has a privately held collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder wants to share {{a version of the}} data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of <b>accompanying</b> <b>policies</b> for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k- 1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k-anonymity unless <b>accompanying</b> <b>policies</b> are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, µ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection...|$|R

In this paper, we treat the POMDP model parameters as additional hidden state in a larger “model-uncertainty ” POMDP, and develop an approximate algorithm for planning in the induced ‘model-uncertainty ” POMDP. This approximation, coupled with model-directed queries, allows the planner to actively learn the true underlying POMDP and the <b>accompanying</b> <b>policy.</b> We demonstrate our approach on several POMDP problems...|$|E

40|$|In many African countries, {{decentralization}} {{has long}} been viewed {{as a means for}} improving local service delivery. Yet, despite various decentralization initiatives, poor service delivery continues to be problematic in two of Kenya's largest cities, Nairobi and Mombasa. Despite various governance reforms to enhance Kenya's decentralization process, backed up by constitutional provisions and legislation, this study highlights that a proliferation of actors with overlapping mandates, opaque development frameworks, and intra- and inter-party politics remain major obstacles to providing critical services in these two cities. It is concluded that the effective decentralization of service delivery in cities cannot occur without key <b>accompanying</b> <b>policies,</b> including the devolution of resources and amicable inter-governmental relations...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the correct {{experiment}} to evaluate {{the effects of a}} fiscal adjustment is the simulation of a multi year fiscal plan rather than of individual fiscal shocks. Simulation of fiscal plans adopted by 16 OECD countries over a 30 -year period supports the hypothesis that the effects of consolidations depend on their design. Fiscal adjustments based upon spending cuts are much less costly, in terms of output losses, than tax-based ones and have especially low output costs when they consist of permanent rather than stop and go changes in taxes and spending. The difference between tax-based and spending-based adjustments appears not to be explained by <b>accompanying</b> <b>policies,</b> including monetary policy.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a simple heterogeneous-agent model with {{incomplete}} markets {{to explain the}} prevalence of a large low-productivity, informal sector in developing countries. In our model, the provision of public infrastructure creates a productivity premium for formalization, which increases with infrastructure quality. Our model breaks the symmetry of equilibria and offers endogenous differentiation of rich and poor countries' behavior. While the model supports multiple stable equilibria in `rich' countries {{with varying degrees of}} formalization, including full formalization, it indicates an absence of equilibrium with full formalization in `poorer' countries. If legislative intolerance alone suffices to jolt a rich country into the equilibrium with complete formalization, <b>accompanying</b> <b>policies</b> may be required in poor countries to first provide the conditions for existence of such equilibrium.

In this paper the system dynamics model has been verified by a case study using historical data from subsidy scheme and <b>accompanying</b> <b>policy</b> measures in Latvia. The results indicate that the model is valid. Simulation results show that national energy efficiency goals cannot be met by 2016 and the absence of major consumer-oriented policy tools slows down the diffusion process of energy efficiency projects.

40|$|Policy {{fields are}} usually defined by {{conventional}} usage {{rather than by}} systematic analysis. This paper experiments with a methodology of boundary analysis that builds inductively through the aggregation of "topics" and policy instruments. Using the case of shipping policy, we develop a list of 473 topics drawn from several bibliographical and policy sources. These are then aggregated into 135 categories with <b>accompanying</b> <b>policy</b> instruments. While the methodology has obvious limitations, the experiment and case study demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to systematically estimate the complete possible contents of a policy field. The approach shows sufficient promise to warrant refinements and broader applications to a wide variety of estimation problems. It also makes a modest contribution to the study of policy instruments, which has tended to get stuck at the "classification" stage without much detailed empirical analysis of how and when instrument categories actually apply. ...|$|E

Recently, an encompassing safety concept has become popular in the Netherlands.
