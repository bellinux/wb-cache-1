5|$|Parker's murder led to {{increased}} racial tensions in Peterborough. At his former school, three Asian pupils were suspended {{for an attack}} on an Afro-Caribbean pupil; a relative of the victim then attacked an Asian teacher. A number of taxi firms stopped work early {{in the days after}} the attack in fear of reprisals. In November 2001 Home Secretary David Blunkett banned all marches in Peterborough for three months as it was feared violence would be caused by the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> and National Front who both sought to hold protests on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone {{continued}} {{his association with}} members of Trotskyite group Socialist Action, with the group's leader John Ross became his most important adviser, teaching him about economics. Investing in an advanced £25,000 computer, he and Ross used the machine to undertake complex economic analysis, {{on the basis of}} which they began publishing the Socialist Economic Bulletin in 1990. Two other members of the group, Redmond O'Neill and Simon Fletcher, also became trusted advisers. When Socialist Action founded a campaign group, the Anti-Racist Alliance, Livingstone came to be closely associated with it. They campaigned on the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence {{and the rise of the}} far right British National Party, but were disadvantaged by an ongoing rivalry with the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{roots of}} Blood & Honour {{go back to}} 1977 in the United Kingdom, when the white {{nationalist}} National Front (NF) founded the Rock Against Communism (RAC) movement {{in response to the}} <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League's</b> Rock Against Racism campaign. By 1980, a new version of Skrewdriver—by then a white power skinhead band—relaunched the RAC movement. Ian Stuart Donaldson, Skrewdriver's singer, was a founder of Blood & Honour and one of its prominent leaders until his death in 1993. With the aid of the NF, the White Noise Club (WNC) organised concerts under the RAC name, and the RAC movement grew throughout 1983 and 1984.|$|R
5000|$|Thousands {{of people}} {{took part in}} AFA {{mobilisation}}s such as the Remembrance Day demonstrations in 1986 and 1987, and a mobilisation against a Blood and Honour gig, [...] "the Main Event", in May 1989. In 1988, AFA formed a musical arm, Cable Street Beat (named after the Battle of Cable Street, a 1936 confrontation between fascists and anti-fascists), on similar principles to the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League’s</b> Rock Against Racism. Cable Street Beat launched a magazine, Cable Street Beat Review, in early 1989. Among the artists who performed for early Cable Street Beat events were Blaggers ITA, Angelic Upstarts, Attila the Stockbroker, The Men They Couldn't Hang, Forgotten Sons and Blyth Power.|$|R
5000|$|Tradition {{formed in}} Brent, North West London in 1976, {{initially}} as Special Brew. The original line-up comprised Chris [...] "Buff Head" [...] Henry (bass guitar), Paul [...] "Echo" [...] Thompson (keyboards, vocals), Tony [...] "Drummie" [...] Matthews (drums), Michael Johnson (guitar), and Grace Reed (vocals). Reed and Johnson left {{early in the}} band's history, {{to be replaced by}} Les McNeil and Paul Dawkins (bass). In 1977 the band signed to Venture Records, and released early singles including [...] "Moving On", [...] "Rastafari", and [...] "Summertime". They were also one of the headline acts on the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League's</b> 'Rock Against Racism' tour. In 1978 they released a discomix 12-inch single of [...] "Why Why". The band built a reputation through their live performances, backing singers such as Alton Ellis, Delroy Wilson, Honey Boy, and Culture, and were also utilized as a studio band by producer David Tyrone. They won the Best Single award from Echoes in 1978 for [...] "Breezin'", and they signed a short-lived deal with RCA Records the same year. Dawkins left to pursue a solo career in 1979 and was replaced by Shakeel Khan. As members continued to leave the band, the swansong 1982 album Spirit of Ecstasy relied heavily on Thompson's keyboard-playing. McNeil also pursued a solo career.|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Tatchell was {{involved}} in campaigns against the National Front and the British National Party. He campaigned with Rock Against Racism and the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clough was {{a lifelong}} socialist, often {{appearing}} on miners' picket lines, donating large sums to trade union causes, {{and being the}} chairman of the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League.</b> On two occasions, he was approached by the Labour Party to stand as a parliamentary candidate in general elections, but he declined in order to continue his managerial career in football.|$|E
25|$|Pearce formed Death in June in 1981 in England, {{along with}} Patrick Leagas and Tony Wakeford. Pearce and Wakeford had been {{members of the}} {{political}} punk band Crisis, which formed in 1977. Crisis had gained a substantial following in the UK punk subculture. Crisis performed at rallies for The Right to Work, Rock Against Racism, and the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Seydlitz was {{a leader}} in the forming under Soviet {{supervision}} of an <b>anti-Nazi</b> organization, the <b>League</b> of German Officers and was made a member of the National Committee for a Free Germany. He was condemned by many of his fellow generals for his collaboration with the Soviet Union. He was sentenced to death in absentia by Hitler's government. His idea of creating an anti-Nazi force of some 40,000 German POWs to be airlifted into Germany was never seriously considered, while in Germany his family was taken into Sippenhaft, detention for the crimes of a family member. Seydlitz was ultimately exploited by both Soviet and German propaganda: he was used by the former in broadcasts and literature to encourage German soldiers to surrender, while the latter cultivated the idea of [...] "Seydlitz troops" [...] (Seydlitztruppen). His role in Soviet propaganda was largely equivalent to that of Andrey Vlasov in Nazi propaganda.|$|R
25|$|The Manningham Riot {{occurred}} between 10 and 12 June 1995, in Manningham and the 2001 Bradford race riots began on 7 July 2001 {{as a result}} of tension between ethnic minority communities and the city's white majority, stoked by the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> and the National Front. There were 297 arrests; 187 people charged with riot, 45 with violent disorder leading to 200 jail sentences totalling 604 years.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Rushmore {{became a}} key {{witness in the}} House Un-American Activities Committee's {{hearings}} in Washington, D.C., {{the first of two}} investigations of the film industry, the purpose being to assess communist infiltration of Hollywood through groups like the Hollywood <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> and labor unions and the extent of communist propaganda that made it into films. The investigations were motivated by the domestic activities of the brothers Gerhart and Hanns Eisler, both communist refugees from Europe living in America during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Several racist skirmishes {{occurred}} in the town, including visiting football supporters from Stoke City F.C. who deliberately walked through multi-racial areas of the town {{before and after the}} match. Attacks followed, initially from Stoke City fans, and then more serious retaliatory attacks and petrol bomb throwing from local male Bangladeshi groups. Following this, on 5 May 2001, there was a day of mounting tension and run-ins between racist and anti-racist groups in the town. Up to fifty National Front supporters, mainly from Birmingham and London arrived in the town, clashing with members of the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> and local Asian groups. Five hundred police were deployed, and the events received extensive media coverage.|$|E
25|$|In April and May 1994 {{the band}} first {{performed}} songs from The Holy Bible at concerts in Thailand and Portugal {{and at a}} benefit concert for the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> at Brockwell Park, London. In June, they played the Glastonbury Festival. In July and August, without Richey Edwards, they played T in the Park in Scotland, the Alte Wartesaal in Cologne, the Parkpop Festival in The Hague and the Reading Festival. During September, October and December there was a headline tour of the UK and Ireland and two tours in mainland Europe with Suede and Therapy?. In December, three nights at the London Astoria ended with the band smashing up their equipment and the venue's lighting rig, causing £26,000 worth of damage.|$|E
25|$|Over the decades, the SWP has founded several front (in Trotskyist terms, {{a united}} front) organisations which {{have sought to}} exert direct {{influence}} over issues {{of interest to the}} wider left, such as the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> in the late 1970s (now Unite Against Fascism) and from 2001, the Stop the War Coalition. It also formed an alliance with George Galloway and Respect; this alignment's eventual dissolution in 2007 caused an internal crisis in the SWP. A more serious internal crisis emerged at the beginning of 2013 over allegations of rape and sexual assault made against a leading (now former) member of the party. The SWP's handling of these accusations against the individual, known as Comrade Delta, led to a significant decline in the party's membership.|$|E
500|$|Cagney {{also became}} {{involved}} in political causes, and in 1936, agreed to sponsor the Hollywood <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League.</b> [...] Unknown to Cagney, the League {{was in fact a}} front organization for the Communist International (Comintern), which sought to enlist support for the Soviet Union and its foreign policies.|$|E
500|$|Protesters {{from the}} local area against the link road scheme were joined by large numbers of anti-road campaigners from around the UK and beyond, {{attracted}} by the availability of free housing along the route. These experienced protesters, {{who had participated in}} earlier events such as the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> riots in Welling, gave impetus to the campaign. The new arrivals used the skills they had developed during prior protests to construct [...] "defences", blocking the original entrances to the houses and creating new routes directly between them.|$|E
500|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, Parker {{became an}} {{increasingly}} vocal advocate of causes like {{civil liberties and}} civil rights, and a frequent critic of those in authority. She reported on the Loyalist cause in Spain for the Communist magazine The New Masses in 1937. At the behest of Otto Katz, a covert Soviet Comintern agent and operative of German Communist Party agent Willi Muenzenberg, Parker helped to found the Hollywood <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> in 1936 (which was suspected by the FBI of being a Communist Party front). The Hollywood Anti-Nazi League's membership eventually grew to some 4,000 strong. Its often wealthy members' contributions (probably not intended to support Communism) were, {{in the words of}} David Caute, [...] "able to contribute as much to [...] Party funds as the whole American working class".|$|E
500|$|The Clash's {{music was}} often charged with left-wing ideological sentiments. Strummer, in particular, was a {{committed}} socialist. The Clash are credited with pioneering the advocacy of radical politics in punk rock, and were dubbed the [...] "Thinking Man's Yobs" [...] by NME. Like many early punk bands, the Clash protested against monarchy and aristocracy; however, {{unlike many of}} their peers, they rejected nihilism. Instead, they found solidarity {{with a number of}} contemporary liberation movements and were involved with such groups as the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League.</b> On 30 April 1978, the Clash played the Rock Against Racism concert in London's Victoria Park for a crowd of 50–100,000 people; Strummer wore a T-shirt identifying two left-wing revolutionary groups: the words [...] "Brigade [...] Rosse"—Italy's Red Brigades—appeared alongside the insignia of West Germany's Red Army Faction.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{election}} as BNP leader, Griffin {{was invited to}} participate in debates at several universities. In November 2002, the Cambridge Union Society invited him {{to take part in a}} debate the following January. Titled [...] "This house believes that Islam is a threat to the west", the resolution was controversial; alongside more moderate speakers, one of those invited was Abu Hamza al-Masri, a fundamentalist Muslim cleric. Some participants threatened to withdraw, and several official bodies criticised the invitations. The two had met earlier in the year, in a debate chaired by Rod Liddle, then editor of BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He was also invited by the Cambridge Forum to a debate on extremism in December 2002, with Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik. The venue was changed twice after protests from property owners, but the threat of a violent confrontation between the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> and BNP supporters forced the president of the Cambridge Forum, Chris Paley, to cancel the event. Paley called the decision an [...] "own goal" [...] for the values of free speech, and Öpik criticised it, emphasising his belief in [...] "people's right to make their own decisions in a democracy".|$|E
500|$|Whale's career {{went into}} sharp decline {{following}} {{the release of}} his next film, The Road Back (1937). The sequel to Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, which Universal had filmed in 1930, the novel and film follow the lives of several young German men who have returned from the trenches of World War I and their struggles to re-integrate into society. The Los Angeles consul for Nazi Germany, George Gyssling, learned that the film was in production. He protested to PCA enforcer Joseph Breen, arguing that the film gave an [...] "untrue and distorted picture of the German people". Gyssling eventually met Whale, but nothing came of it. Gyssling then sent letters {{to members of the}} cast, threatening that their participation in the film might lead to difficulties in obtaining German filming permits for them and for anyone associated in a film with them. While the low volume of business conducted by Universal in Germany made such threats largely hollow, the State Department, under pressure from the Hollywood <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> and the Screen Actors Guild, stepped in and the German government backed down. Whale's original cut of the film was given generally positive reviews, but sometime between preview screenings and the film's general release, Rogers capitulated to the Germans, ordering that cuts be made and additional scenes be shot and inserted. Whale was furious, and the altered film was banned in Germany anyway. The Germans were successful in persuading China, Greece, Italy and Switzerland to ban the film as well.|$|E
2500|$|In response, Peter Hain stated: [...] "That {{the special}} branch had a file on me dating back 40 {{years ago to}} anti-apartheid and <b>anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> activist days is hardly revelatory. That these files were still active for at least 10 years while I was an MP {{certainly}} is and raises fundamental questions about parliamentary sovereignty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The anti-fascist activist Gerry Gable {{referred}} to the BNP as a [...] "Nazi organisation", while the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> published leaflets describing the BNP as the [...] "British Nazi Party". Copsey suggested that while the BNP under Tyndall {{could be described as}} [...] "Neo-Nazi", it was not [...] "crudely mimetic" [...] of the original German Nazism. Davey characterised the BNP as a [...] "populist ethno-nationalist" [...] party.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933 after {{completing}} The Old Dark House, Stuart {{was one of}} the first stars to work toward an actors’ union and was one of thirty-nine new Class A members of the Screen Actors Guild, of which she was a founding member. In June, 1936, she helped Paul Muni, Franchot Tone, Ernst Lubitsch, and Oscar Hammerstein II form the Hollywood <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League.</b> [...] That same year she and writer Dorothy Parker helped create the League to Support the Spanish Civil War Orphans.|$|E
2500|$|... }} Their songs tackled social decay, unemployment, racism, police brutality, {{political}} and social repression, and militarism in detail. Strummer was involved with the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> and Rock Against Racism campaigns. He later also gave his support to the Rock Against the Rich series of concerts organised by the anarchist organisation Class War. The Clash's London Calling album was voted best album of the 1980s by Rolling Stone magazine (although it was released in late 1979 in the UK; it was released in 1980 in the USA).|$|E
2500|$|After his {{retirement}} from boxing, Henry Cooper maintained a public profile with {{appearances in the}} BBC quiz show A Question of Sport and various advertisements, most famously in those for Brut aftershave. Although generally a traditionalist, Cooper was officially the co-founder of the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League,</b> a largely left-wing campaign focused on far-right groups which opposed immigration. [...] He was also a frequent guest at charity fund-raising events. He appeared as boxer John Gully in the 1975 film Royal Flash and in his latter years featured {{in a series of}} UK public service announcements urging vulnerable groups to go to their doctors for vaccination against influenza called Get your Jab in First! ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{campaign}} {{in which the}} SWP had a significant role at this time was the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> (ANL), and viewed as a [...] "front" [...] for the organisation by commentators and historians. The National Front (NF) grew during the 1970s, and in the May 1976 local elections the party polled 15,340 votes in Leicester and large votes elsewhere. They were even more visible on the streets through graffiti, racist attacks and street protests. A key turning point came when, on 13 August 1977, thousands of anti-fascists, later joined by large numbers of local black youths, attempted to stop the NF from marching through Lewisham.|$|E
2500|$|After the Representation of the People Act 1985 {{raised the}} electoral deposit to £500, the BNP adopted {{a policy of}} [...] "very limited involvement" [...] in elections. It abstained in the 1987 general election, and stood only 13 {{candidates}} in the 1992 general election. At the 1993 local elections the BNP gained one council seat—won by Derek Beackon in the East London district of Millwall—after a campaign that played to local whites who were angry at the perceived preferential treatment received by Bangladeshi migrants in social housing. However, following an anti-BNP campaign launched by local religious groups and the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League,</b> it lost this seat during the 1994 local elections. In the 1997 general election, it contested 55 seats and gained an average 1.4% of the vote.|$|E

He was knocked unconscious and died the next day in hospital. Police brutality was never proven to be a contributory factor in his death, but it was claimed that he had fallen to a blow from a rubberised police radio belonging to the Met's now disbanded Special Patrol Group. In 2010, a police report was disclosed that stated that it was likely a Metropolitan Police officer [...] "struck the fatal blow" [...] and attributed [...] "grave suspicion" [...] to one unnamed officer, who it says may also have been involved in a cover-up along with two colleagues.|$|E
2500|$|The British National Party {{was founded}} in 1982 {{following}} a split within the far right National Front (NF) two years before. The NF had organised marches {{in an attempt to}} raise its profile, which sometimes led to violent clashes with political opponents such as the <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League.</b> After a poor showing at the 1979 general election, internal factional division heightened within the NF. This culminated in chairman John Tyndall leaving the party in 1980, and founding the New National Front (NNF), which became the BNP two years later. According to Spearhead, a magazine produced by Tyndall, the split within the NF was initially intended to be temporary. [...] Members of Tyndall's NNF wished to modernise and break with fascism, blaming the old NF for its lack of popular appeal.|$|E
2500|$|The Lovestoneites {{organized}} among New York area {{white collar}} workers. In Local 12644, a directly affiliated AFL local in New York, the Lovestoneites led the Progressive faction, which competed for control {{with the official}} Communists and the [...] "conservatives". The Progressive ticket won control of the groups executive board in a landslide in 1935. However, when the local affiliated with the CIO United Office and Professional Workers of America, the UOPWA leadership became dominated by official Communists. In October 1938 Anne Gould, editor of the Progressive Office Worker was suspended by the leadership. She took 500 members of UOPWA Local 16 out and joined the AFLs Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants Union. The office workers involved were principally employees of ILGWU, the Workmens Circle, [...] the League for Industrial Democracy, Union Health Center, Labor Committee for Palestine, the Non-Sectarian <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League,</b> and the Workmens Sick and Death Benefit Fund.|$|E
2500|$|After the Representation of the People Act 1985 {{raised the}} cost of a candidate's electoral deposit to £500, the BNP adopted a policy of [...] "very limited involvement" [...] in elections. The party {{leadership}} also recognised that the rhetoric on restricting immigration then embraced by the Conservative Party government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was likely to reduce their chances of success. Believing that a campaign would threaten the party's financial security, it officially abstained in the 1987 general election. In the 1992 general election the party stood 13 candidates. At the 1993 local elections, the BNP gained one council seat—won by Derek Beackon in the East London town of Millwall—after a campaign that targeted the anger of local whites over the perceived preferential treatment received by Bangladeshi migrants in social housing.

2500|$|However, her {{conscience}} {{would not}} let her simply abandon causes she believed in. Caspary would continue to sign petitions, contribute money, write to congressmen and keep up her memberships in the Hollywood <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League,</b> the League of American Writers. She also taught classes in writing screenplays to raise funds to bring refugee writers to America. [...] In June 1941, Germany attacked Russia, and Hollywood Benefits for Russian war relief drew huge crowds. [...] During this time Caspary started tinkering with a murder mystery, but instead of producing an original story for the screen she was encouraged {{to turn it into}} a novel. [...] It was finished by October, and to get some perspective she went to work on a story about a night plane to Chungking for Paramount Studios. [...] When the United States declared war on Germany and Japan in early December, that story was canceled, and Caspary asked to be laid off and returned happily to her murder mystery. During Christmas 1941, she typed [...] "The end" [...] on the last page of Laura.|$|E
2500|$|At the hearings, Rushmore {{testified against}} Edward G. Robinson, Charles Chaplin, Clifford Odets and Dalton Trumbo as {{potential}} or real communists: [...] "the Daily Worker regarded Charles Chaplin and Edward G. Robinson {{as what we}} call in the newspaper business 'sacred cows,' people you trust favorably. I don't {{know whether or not}} [...] is a Communist, but for ten years he has been joining front organizations and is still doing it." [...] Unknown to the public at large, since 1943 the US Army Signal Intelligence Service was decrypting Soviet intelligence traffic through the Venona project, which revealed that most Soviet agents operated east of the Mississippi. While Soviet agents like Otto Katz operated propaganda fronts like the Hollywood <b>Anti-Nazi</b> <b>League</b> in the 1930s, Venona failed to reveal any Soviet agent working in Hollywood directly involved with espionage or sabotage, though members and former members of the CPUSA did work in the film industry, many of whom would be blacklisted by the major studios. The public's unawareness of Venona enabled Rushmore to exaggerate the threat of communists in Hollywood. But at the HUAC hearings, Rushmore did correctly identify Gerhart Eisler, ostensibly an anti-Nazi refugee from Germany, as the probable Soviet leader of the CPUSA. The opening of the Soviet archives decades later showed that Eisler, a Comintern agent, used his political authority to make Earl Browder the American [...] "leader" [...] of the CPUSA during a mid-1930s leadership dispute.|$|E
