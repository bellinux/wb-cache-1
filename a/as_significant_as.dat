5|$|Although not <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> <b>as</b> {{deforestation}} and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs {{and other}} species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E
5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> <b>as</b> the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many {{elements}} from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band Drive-By Truckers, and the , have done much {{in recent years to}} make country rock a major part of Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the Normans conquered England in 1066, the town of Southampton {{occupied}} a rectangular area overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to the north and east. Southampton at this time was a relatively large town, but not <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> <b>as</b> in the later medieval period. The Normans built a castle within the town on the site of a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification.|$|E

The lacanian contribution is presented as the epistemological criticism to psychoanalysis. The work of Lacan is a re-thinking of Freud´s discoverings in linguistic terms, <b>as</b> <b>significants,</b> <b>as</b> forms, as language. Psychoanalysis is studied {{in the light of the}} structural model, in order to give to the study of the unconscious its proper place in the human sciences...|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} goods {{produced}} indigenously, {{it was estimated}} that due to the inability of traditional suppliers to deliver manufactured goods because of trade embargoes and shipping shortages up to 400 new articles were produced in Australian factories {{as a result of the}} war. This was not an insignificant number, although the transformation of the Australian economy as a result of World War I was by no means <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> <b>as</b> that which occurred during World War II. The expansion of the steel industry that occurred during this time laid the foundation for future industrialisation.|$|E

5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> <b>as</b> the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E

5|$|Banquo is in a {{third of}} the play's scenes, as both a human and a ghost. <b>As</b> <b>significant</b> <b>as</b> he is to the plot, he has fewer lines than the {{relatively}} insignificant Ross, a Scottish nobleman who survives the play. In the second scene of the play, King Duncan describes the manner in which Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, and Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, bravely led his army against invaders, fighting side by side. In the next scene, Banquo and Macbeth, returning from the battle together, encounter the Three Witches, who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and then king. Banquo, sceptical of the witches, challenges them to predict his own future, and they foretell that Banquo will never himself take the throne, but will beget a line of kings. Banquo remains sceptical after the encounter, wondering aloud if evil can ever speak the truth. He warns Macbeth that evil will offer men a small, hopeful truth only to catch them in a deadly trap.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1984, Michael {{and other}} members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi {{commercial}} overseen by executive Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor. Dusenberry recounted the episode in his memoir, Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a global reach of more than 20 countries and would provide financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, none were <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> <b>as</b> his deals with Pepsi, which later signed other music stars such as Britney Spears and Beyoncé to promote its products.|$|E
5|$|Southampton Castle {{was first}} {{constructed}} in the late 11th century, at some point after the Norman conquest of England. Southampton at this time was a relatively large town, but not <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> <b>as</b> in the later medieval period. The royal castle was erected within the existing town {{on the site of}} a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification. The town of Southampton was protected by water on most sides, surrounded by protective ditches and banks, and the castle was built on rising ground in the north-west corner of the town, overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. The initial castle was a timber motte and bailey design, with a motte 45 feet (14 metres) across; {{at least some of the}} bailey walls were rebuilt in stone during the first half of the 12th century. The wealthiest parts of Southampton were in the west of the town, just to the south of the castle, with some of the poorest districts just beyond the castle to the north-east. The castle was positioned so as to adjoin the town's quays.|$|E
25|$|The Lake–Peterson House is architecturally {{significant}} on {{a statewide}} scale, {{being one of}} Illinois finest examples of Gothic Revival architecture. Indeed, the 1974 Illinois Historic Sites Survey cited the house <b>as</b> architecturally <b>significant,</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> {{in the area of}} industry because of its prominent owners. The Lake–Peterson House displays nearly all elements described by architectural historian John Blumenson as embodying the Victorian Gothic style as opposed to later or earlier manifestations of the style. The Lake–Peterson House is listed as a local landmark by the city of Rockford. On June 25, 1980 the house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, included as a contributing property to the listing was the carriage house.|$|R
