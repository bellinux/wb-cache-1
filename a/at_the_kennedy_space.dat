5|$|The Shuttle fleet {{lost two}} orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by {{building}} the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter {{to replace the}} second loss. NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on July 21, 2011.

5|$|For {{missions}} beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA {{has been}} directed to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During a speech <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E
