5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully learns that she, but not Mulder, is being given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> her worth at the FBI, and—paired with a new partner—she investigates a crime scene photographer with an uncanny knack for arriving {{just in time to}} see his victims' final moments. What she does not expect, however, is for Death to play a role himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} idea behind Slackers first occurred in 1990. Along with some friends, Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias {{went to a}} Don Henley concert, and began thinking about owning their own music store. At the time, the two were undergraduate students, and decided to focus their studies on business management and becoming entrepreneurs. Slackers CDs and Games was officially founded in 1993, by Jellinek and Zacharias, in Columbia, Missouri. Jellinek and Zacharias opened the store after graduating from Saint Louis University, using only their own collection of 1,500 music CDs. The name originated from their generation being considered slackers before being given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> otherwise. Although business was slow at first, with the store sometimes only making US$30 in a day, business eventually increased. After 2years {{they were able to}} open a second location in O'Fallon, Illinois. As of 2009, there are 10 locations in the states of Missouri and Illinois, eight of which are in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, and two of which are in Mid-Missouri.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{discovering}} her pregnancy, Quinn convinces Finn {{that he is}} the father, {{despite the}} fact that they never actually had a sexual encounter. Quinn claims that due to his premature ejaculation problem, and during their time in a hot-tub, Finn had ejaculated in the tub and Quinn had received the sperm. The real father is Finn's best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who offers to support Quinn and the baby, but is rejected for his irresponsibility. Quinn decides to have the baby adopted, and agrees to give it to Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), who is faking a pregnancy. When news of her pregnancy is revealed to the school, Quinn is cut from the cheerleading squad and her popularity declines. Her parents evict her, and Quinn moves in with Finn and his mother. She begins to reconsider having the baby adopted, and gives Puck <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself, but he is not reliable so she returns to her plan of giving the baby to Terri. Quinn blackmails Sue into letting her rejoin the Cheerios, but ultimately decides against it, preferring to remain with the glee club, where she feels accepted. Finn learns the truth about the baby's paternity from Rachel, and breaks up with Quinn. Puck again offers to support her, but she turns him down and tells him that she wants to handle the pregnancy by herself. She moves in with Puck's family, but after forming a friendship with fellow New Directions member Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Quinn lives with her family instead. She gives birth to a daughter, named Beth by Puck, who is adopted by Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline and Rachel's biological mother.|$|E
25|$|That season, Smith {{broke his}} ankle in training, {{and missed the}} {{majority}} of the season. However, by the time he made his return to first team action, manager Jim Magilton had left the club and been replaced by Roy Keane. Smith featured heavily in Keane's early games as Ipswich manager, with the former Manchester United midfielder opting to give some of the club's younger talent – such as Connor Wickham and Smith – <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> themselves.|$|E
25|$|Wigan later made a third for the player, {{a revised}} figure of £700,000. Again the Burnley board turned down this offer and no further bids {{were made by}} the Latics. In his final game of his first spell at Burnley he scored what is {{possibly}} the best goal of his Burnley career leathering in a stunning free kick from 35 yards in a local derby against Preston North End. Eventually a successful bid of £1.25 million was made by Birmingham City and Blake once again had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself in the top league.|$|E

50|$|Given {{the level}} of interest, the {{selection}} committee, which consists {{of members of the}} PFF and Geo TV Network, had their work cut out for them. Over a hundred matches were held in all the locations in varying degrees of heat and weather conditions. Each player was given <b>an</b> ample <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> themselves through these matches, which revealed their ability to perform in real-time, tense situations.|$|R
25|$|Aging Gonzaga {{gradually}} {{became more and}} more dissatisfied with his work, that of producing ephemeral follies that rarely lasted longer than a single theatrical season. He suffered depression, feeling that his life was spent in vain, and begged his patrons to offer him <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself in architecture and leave a tangible trace of his talent. He applied to all available vacancies and architectural contests, and was always rejected. By 1827, when emperor Nicholas awarded him an honorary title of court architect Gonzaga was already too old for practical construction. Nestor Kukolnik suggested that earlier, in 1810s, Gonzaga designed and built Yusupov's private theatre in Arkhangelskoye Estate, but his attribution was later discarded.|$|E
25|$|In almost 18months, he {{had played}} a total of only 937.5minutes of {{competitive}} rugby union, but was nonetheless given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his fitness for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. Initially Wilkinson was {{left out of the}} 44-strong squad which was announced by Clive Woodward on 11 April 2005. However, on 8 May Woodward announced he had added the fly-half to the squad after Wilkinson had proved he was injury-free and fit. Wilkinson made his first international appearance since the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final on 23 May at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff as the Lions played Argentina. Wilkinson, {{along with the rest of}} the team, played poorly, but kicked a conversion and six penalties; he salvaged a 25–25 draw with the last kick of the game.|$|E
25|$|Like its siblings, the Elite was run in {{numerous}} formulae, with particular success at Le Mans and the Nürburgring. Elites won their class six {{times at the}} 24 hour Le Mans race {{as well as two}} Index of Thermal Efficiency wins. Les Leston, driving DAD10, and Graham Warner, driving LOV1, were noted UK Elite racers. In 1961, David Hobbs fitted a Hobbs Mecha-Matic 4-speed automatic transmission to an Elite, and became almost unbeatable in two years' racing – he won 15 times from 18 starts. New South Wales driver Leo Geoghegan won the 1960 Australian GT Championship at the wheel of a Lotus Elite. After winning Index of Thermal Efficiency prize, Lotus decided to go for an outright win at Le Mans in 1960. They built a one off Elite, called the LX, with a 1,964 cc FPF engine, larger wheels, and other modifications. In testing, it proved capable of going 174mph. Unfortunately, the lead driver withdrew the night before the race, so the car did not have <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> itself.|$|E

25|$|Manchester United's team {{selection}} {{was dominated by}} the need to save several players for the Champions League final against Bayern Munich four days later. Midfielders Roy Keane and Paul Scholes were suspended for the Champions League final, so they were paired in central midfield for the FA Cup final as the swansong for their season; their deputy for the Champions League final, Nicky Butt, was left out of the matchday squad entirely to guard him against injury. Top scorer Dwight Yorke was dropped to the bench for a similar reason, while first-choice centre-back Jaap Stam was named among the substitutes to give him <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his fitness after an Achilles tendon injury. Denis Irwin missed the match due to suspension after being sent off against Liverpool in the Premier League on 5 May and was replaced in the starting line-up by Phil Neville. Several players, including Scholes, David Beckham and Gary Neville, were suffering from a flu virus in the lead-up to the game, and were still suffering the effects on matchday, but were all deemed fit enough to play. Henning Berg was injured.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the lockout which took away much of the 2011 NBA offseason and {{shortened}} the league's schedule considerably, the Warriors made a push to acquire restricted free agent DeAndre Jordan, who would have automatically taken over as the starting center for Golden State. Biedriņš might have been a logical amnesty candidate under the provisions of the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement, but the Warriors instead chose to amnesty Charlie Bell while retaining Biedriņš. The Warriors' push to acquire Jordan fell through when the Los Angeles Clippers matched the Warriors' offer sheet to Jordan, so they instead signed free agent center Kwame Brown. Biedriņš won the starting job to begin the year before being sidelined for three games with an ankle injury. When Brown was lost for the season with a torn pectoralis major muscle in the third of those games, Biedriņš once again took over as starter, where he remained until his continued ineffectiveness prompted first-year coach Mark Jackson to insert Ekpe Udoh in as starter. A March 13 trade which shipped Udoh, Brown and Monta Ellis to the Milwaukee Bucks for Stephen Jackson and the out-for-the-season Andrew Bogut thrust Biedriņš back into the starting lineup, where he remained until Jackson decided to give rookie Jeremy Tyler <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself at the beginning of April. For the season, Biedriņš averaged 15.7 minutes (lowest since his second year in the league), 1.7 points, 3.7 rebounds, 0.3 assists (all career lows), 1.0 blocks and 0.5 steals while shooting 60.9% from the floor and 11.1% from the free throw line (admittedly with the small sample size of one make in nine free throw attempts).|$|E
25|$|Having {{overcome}} initial {{reservations about}} leaving {{his wife and}} newly-born son, Hobbs accepted the invitation but throughout the voyage to Australia was severely affected by sea-sickness, a condition which was to afflict him throughout his life. To allow him to recover from his illness upon arrival in Australia, Hobbs missed {{the first two games}} of the tour, but once recovered, he played in only two of the remaining four fixtures before the Test series began. Hobbs later expressed the belief that the MCC captain, Arthur Jones was instrumental in his omission from the team as he did not rate Hobbs a good player. He also believed that Jones did not give him <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself. But Hobbs failed with the bat on his two appearances and was subsequently left out of the team for the first Test match. Even when Jones was taken ill before the game started, George Gunn, {{not a member of the}} touring team but present in Australia, was preferred to Hobbs and scored a century in the game. However, England lost the game and the performance of the amateur wicketkeeper and makeshift opening batsman Dick Young was singled out as detrimental to the team. Following effective batting performances by Hobbs in two matches after the Test, Frederick Fane, the stand-in England captain, chose Hobbs to open the batting in the second Test. He made his Test debut on 1 January 1908 at Melbourne. He went in to bat on the second day after Australia had scored 266; in 182 minutes, he scored 83 runs in his first innings and although he batted more slowly than usual, critics praised his defence. Eventually, England needed 282 to win. Hobbs and Fane added 54 for the first wicket; before Hobbs fell for 28 but England went on to win the match by one wicket.|$|E

500|$|In the film's first direct-to-video sequel [...] (1998), Nala {{appears in}} a less {{prominent}} role as Queen of the Pride Lands and mother of Kiara, the spirited daughter of her and Simba. Nala observes that Kiara, of whom Simba is very protective, has inherited her father's rebellious personality and love of adventure. When Kiara befriends Zira's son Kovu, a young lion from an exiled pride of Scar's followers known as the Outsiders, Nala is much more tolerant of their relationship than Simba, and convinces him to offer Kovu <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself trustworthy.At {{the end of the}} film, Nala gains Kovu as her son-in-law after he marries Kiara.

The expectation from the home crowd had made him so nervous that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet. However, {{it turned out to be}} a revelatory experience for Bolt, as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves. As a member of the Jamaican sprint relay team, he also took two silver medals and set national junior records in the 4×100 metres and 4×400 metres relay, running times of 39.15 s and 3:04.06 minutes respectively.|$|E

In an uncertain and changing world, choice is an experimental activity whether on is seeking to try novel products or make a novel impression in competing for status.
