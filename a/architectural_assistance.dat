50|$|The current brick cathedral {{was started}} {{in the middle of}} the 16th century by Can. Mr. Alonso of Rock with the <b>architectural</b> <b>assistance</b> of Simón Bolívar, fifth {{grandfather}} of the Liberator of South America. Despite the region's earthquakes, the solid construction has resisted deterioration. It has a vaulted ceiling of five simple but sturdy arches. While the dome they support resembles an orange skin or star, a seashell shape emphasized the altar area. At the center of the high altar, a silver niche highlights the ancient holy painting. The 16th-century artist carved the local mahogany by hand. An ornate silver baldaquin covers the high altar, steps and Sacrarium.|$|E
40|$|Especially in {{the context}} of product lines, an {{explicit}} and complete description of important relationships between features in a domain model offers multiple benefits. Examples are a more correct and complete domain model, <b>assistance</b> for <b>architectural</b> decisions, and <b>assistance</b> during the instantiation of family members. This thesis classifies non-domain specific relationships and gives guidelines how to make them explicit and how to use them {{to improve the quality of}} the domain model. The focus of the guidelines is on product line specific aspects. Nevertheless, some of the guidelines can also be applied to single system development. The guidelines are designed to be applied to textual documents (like in the FAST approach), but can as well be used to inspect graphical representations of a domain model (like in the PuLSE approach). We recommend some representations, which support the use of the guidelines...|$|R
40|$|I am {{especially}} {{indebted to}} Dr. Richard Cleary for {{his contribution to}} this project. Dr. Cleary recommended that I examine the Parade of Homes, and as I researched the topic he offered directional questions, comments, and advice. My second reader, Dr. Christopher Long also provided guidance during the writing stage, and Dr. Monica Penick offered her assistance as a thorough and informed reader. Nancy Sparrow and Donna Coates in the Alexander <b>Architectural</b> Archive offered <b>assistance</b> and advice willingly. Thank you also to Beth Dodd and Dan Orozco in the Architecture and Planning Library. I am fortunate to {{have a group of}} supportive colleagues and friends at the University of Texas at Austin. Laura McGuire patiently gave me advice and always provided a model in her own work. Kelso Wyeth cheered me on and reassured me during stressful times. Most of all, I would like to thank Kathryn Pierce, whose support, humor, and input kept me positive at all stages of this project. iii Merchandising the Postwar Model House at the Parade of Home...|$|R
