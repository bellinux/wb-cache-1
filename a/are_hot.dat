50|$|Conversely, {{participants}} in televised batsu games are often criticized as faking their distress, because the humor lies {{only in their}} reaction to the punishment and therefore the punishment need not exist. An oft-discussed example of this <b>is</b> the <b>hot</b> water baths—the participants claim that the water <b>is</b> extremely <b>hot,</b> {{but it does not}} need to <b>be</b> <b>hot</b> for the participants to provide a funny reaction. As such, participants will often try to convince the viewers that the water <b>is</b> <b>hot</b> through various means (having an audience member stick his hand in the water, for example, or breaking character by saying that the water <b>is</b> <b>hotter</b> than it <b>was</b> during rehearsal). Generally speaking, the punishments are real rather than faked (the water <b>is</b> <b>hot,</b> the wasabi <b>is</b> spicy), but they are maintained at a level of preventing injuries.|$|R

5|$|Summers <b>are</b> <b>hot</b> and humid; {{during this}} season, highs {{average in the}} upper80s °F (lower30s °C) and lows average in the upper60s °F (lower20s °C). The {{combination}} of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area. While hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall, they have often weakened {{by the time they}} reach Stephens City, partly due to the city's far inland location.|$|E
5|$|There are {{types of}} planets {{that do not}} exist in the Solar System: super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of {{volatiles}} and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet. There <b>are</b> <b>hot</b> Jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become chthonian planets, which are the leftover cores. Another possible type of planet is carbon planets, which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Gamma Circini is {{a binary}} star 450light-years away, whose {{components}} need a telescope of 150mm to be seen, {{as they are}} only 0.8 arcseconds apart. The brighter component is a bluish Be star of spectral type B5IV+ and magnitude 4.51, while the dimmer component is a yellow star of magnitude 5.5. They orbit each other every 180 years. Delta Circini is also a multiple star whose components have magnitudes of 5.1 and 13.4 and orbit around a common centre of gravity every 3.9 days. The brighter component is a close eclipsing binary (specifically, a rotating ellipsoidal variable), with a minor dip of magnitude (0.1). Both <b>are</b> <b>hot</b> blue stars of spectral types O7III-V and O9.5V, respectively, and are estimated to have around 22 and 12 times the Sun's mass. Over 3600light-years away, this system would outshine Venus at magnitude −4.8 if it were 32light-years (10parsecs) distant. The two main components are separated by 50 arcseconds, resolvable {{to the naked eye}} for individuals with good vision and easily discernible with a telescope.|$|E

5|$|To the west, in Gujarat, diverse climate {{conditions}} obtain. The winters are mild, pleasant, and dry with average daytime temperatures around 29°C (84°F) and nights around 12°C (54°F) with virtually full sun and clear nights. Summers <b>are</b> <b>hot</b> and dry with daytime temperatures around 41°C (106°F) and nights no lower than 29°C (84°F). In {{the weeks before}} the monsoon temperatures {{are similar to the}} above, but high humidity makes the air more uncomfortable. Relief comes with the monsoon. Temperatures are around 35°C (95°F) but humidity is very high; nights are around 27°C (81°F). Most of the rainfall occurs in this season, and the rain can cause severe floods. The sun is often occluded during the monsoon season.|$|E
5|$|Moncton has a {{warm summer}} {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range {{a few degrees}} below the freezing point. Major snowfalls can result from nor'easter ocean storms moving up {{the east coast of}} North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20–30cm (8–12in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably {{over the course of the}} last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by late May. Summers <b>are</b> <b>hot</b> and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30°C (86°F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).|$|E
5|$|TY Pyxidis is an {{eclipsing binary}} star whose {{apparent}} magnitude ranges from 6.85 to 7.5 over 3.2 days. The two components are both of spectral type G5IV with a diameter 2.2 times, and mass 1.2 {{times that of the}} Sun, and revolve around each other every 3.2 days. The system is classified as a RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a binary system with prominent starspot activity, and lies 184 ± 5 light-years away. The system emits X-rays, and analysing the emission curve over time led researchers to conclude that there was a loop of material arcing between the two stars. RZ Pyxidis is another eclipsing binary system, made up of two young stars less than 200,000 years old. Both <b>are</b> <b>hot</b> blue-white stars of spectral type B7V and are around 2.5 {{times the size of the}} Sun. One is around five times as luminous as the Sun and the other around four times as luminous. The system is classified as a Beta Lyrae variable, the apparent magnitude varying from 8.83 to 9.72 over 0.66 days. XX Pyxidis is one of the more-studied members of a class of stars known as Delta Scuti variables—short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. Astronomers made more sense of its pulsations when it became clear that it is also a binary star system. The main star is a white main sequence star of spectral type A4V that is around 1.85 ± 0.05 times as massive as the Sun. Its companion is most likely a red dwarf of spectral type M3V, around 0.3 times as massive as the Sun. The two are very close—possibly only 3 times the diameter of the Sun between them—and orbit each other every 1.15 days. The brighter star is deformed into an egg shape.|$|E

5|$|Virgin queens {{and males}} appear in colonies during January, before their nuptial flight. 20 females or fewer {{are found in}} a single colony, while males are much more common. The nuptial flight begins at {{different}} times for each species; they have been recorded in mid-summer to autumn (January to early April), {{but there is one}} case of a nuptial flight occurring from May to July. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight <b>are</b> <b>hot</b> stormy days with windspeeds of 30km/h (18mi/h) and temperatures reaching 30°C (86°F), and elevations of 91 metres (300ft). Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly, although as many as four queens may leave the nest at the same time. Species are both polygynous and polyandrous, with queens mating with one to ten males. Polygynous and polyandrous societies can occur in a single nest, but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily polyandrous. For example, nearly 80% of tested M. pilosula colonies are polygynous while M. pyriformis colonies are mostly polyandrous. Nuptial flight takes place during the morning and can last until late afternoon. When the alates leave the nest, most species launch themselves into the air from trees and shrubs, although others launch themselves off the ground. Queens discharge a glandular secretion from the tergal gland, which males are strongly attracted to. As many as 1,000 alates will gather to mate. A queen was once found to have five or six males attempting to copulate with her. The queen is unable to bear the weight of the large number of males trying to mate with her, and will drop to the ground, with the ants dispersing later on. M. pulchra queens are ergatoid and cannot fly; the males meet the queen out in an open area away from the nest and mate, and these queens do not return to their nest after mating.|$|E
