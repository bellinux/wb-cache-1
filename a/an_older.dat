40|$|Background: This study {{presents}} an alternative assessment method for establishing {{the demand for}} <b>an</b> <b>old</b> age home among <b>a</b> community-dwelling <b>older</b> population. The instrument, called 'orientation towards admission into <b>an</b> <b>old</b> age home', represents {{the intensity of the}} need for admission as expressed by older people themselves. Therefore it is indicative of the 'subjective demand'. Methods: Using a longitudinal design (1993 - 98), the study tests whether a stronger orientation towards admission into <b>an</b> <b>old</b> age home leads to use of <b>an</b> <b>old</b> age home. This assessment method is compared with another method of assessing 'subjective demand', that is by those who have applied for and are waiting for admission. Additionally, the method is compared with an 'objective' indicator of demand, that is, the level of physical impairments and age of the elderly person. Results: Results show that the subjective demand as measured by the 'orientation toward admission into <b>an</b> <b>old</b> age home' is indeed related to actual use of <b>an</b> <b>old</b> age home. The subjective demand as measured by being on a waiting list is not significantly related to the use of <b>an</b> <b>old</b> age home. The level of physical impairments (the objective demand) and age are sometimes, but not always, significantly related to the use of <b>an</b> <b>old</b> age home. Conclusion: The instrument 'orientation' provides us with a valuable instrument in assessing 'subjective demand' for <b>an</b> <b>old</b> age home among community-dwelling older people. ...|$|R
