30|$|The Japanese {{archipelago}} has {{a unique}} combination of geologic, geomorphic, and climatic features (e.g., recent geology, complex geomorphology, and frequently heavy rain; Oguchi et al. 2001), and as a result, groundwater resources are mainly contained in Quaternary aquifer systems hosted by Tertiary geological units (Machida et al. 2008). Both megacities and smaller Japanese cities are located on Quaternary aquifer systems (e.g., Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Aomori); therefore, the utilization of low-enthalpy shallow geothermal energy systems must focus on Quaternary aquifer systems. In particular, in cold and snowy regions (e.g., Aomori), the implementation of <b>aquifer</b> thermal <b>storage</b> in the summer season has been a requirement {{to meet the demand}} of underground heat extraction for heating rooms and melting snow in the winter season. However, <b>aquifer</b> thermal <b>storage</b> may promote microbial activity and organic matter decomposition in groundwater (Bonte et al. 2013; Jesußek et al. 2013); therefore, redox-related chemical reactions in groundwater may change or increase. Changes in electron donor (e.g., organic carbon, Fe 2 +, H 2 S, H 2) concentrations may change oxidation–reduction potential in groundwater (e.g., Pedersen 2012). To this end, the monitoring and understanding of oxidation–reduction potential in these aquifer systems are crucial before the implementation of <b>aquifer</b> thermal <b>storage.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Salt caverns {{are usually}} {{much smaller than}} {{depleted}} gas reservoir and <b>aquifer</b> <b>storage</b> facilities. [...] A salt cavern facility may occupy only one one-hundredth of the area taken up by a depleted gas reservoir facility. Consequently, salt caverns cannot hold the large volumes of gas necessary to meet base load storage requirements. [...] Deliverability from salt caverns is, however, much higher than for either aquifers or depleted reservoirs. This allows the gas stored in a salt cavern to be withdrawn and replenished more readily and quickly. This quick cycle-time is useful in emergency situations or during short periods of unexpected demand surges.|$|E

Saline aquifers {{have been used for}} storage of chemical waste in a few cases. The main advantage of saline aquifers is their large potential storage volume and their common occurrence. The major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them, especially compared to oil fields. To keep the cost of storage acceptable, the geophysical exploration may be limited, resulting in larger uncertainty about the aquifer structure. Unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds, no side product will offset the storage cost.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of a comprehensive}} thermal impact study on an <b>aquifer</b> thermal energy <b>storage</b> (ATES) system in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. The study involved monitoring of the thermal impact and modeling of the three-dimensional temperature evolution of the <b>storage</b> <b>aquifer</b> and over- and underlying units. Special {{attention was paid to}} non-uniformity of the background temperature, which varies laterally and vertically in the aquifer. Two models were applied with different levels of detail regarding initial conditions and heterogeneity of hydraulic and thermal properties: a fine-scale heterogeneity model which construed the lateral and vertical temperature distribution more realistically, and a simplified model which represented the aquifer system with {{only a limited number of}} homogeneous layers. Fine-scale heterogeneity was shown to be important to accurately model the ATES-impacted vertical temperature distribution and the maximum and minimum temperatures in the <b>storage</b> <b>aquifer,</b> and the spatial extent of the thermal plumes.

40|$|AbstractCharacterization of the CO 2 leakage {{pathways}} {{from the}} storage formations into overlying formations is required. We present a flow and pressure test {{to locate and}} characterize the leaks. The flow test {{is based on the}} injection (or production) of water into (or from) a <b>storage</b> <b>aquifer</b> at a constant rate. The pressure is measured at one or several monitoring wells in an <b>aquifer</b> overlying the <b>storage</b> <b>aquifer,</b> which is separated by an aquitard. The objective of the test is to locate and characterize any leakage through the separating aquitard. We present an inverse procedure to obtain the leakage pathway transmissibility and location, based on the pressure measurements in the presence of noise. A single monitoring well allows good determination of the leak magnitude but provides limited constraints on location. Adding a second monitoring well provides two-dimensional location of the leak location in the presence of noise/uncertainty in pressure measurements. It seems plausible that the use of multiple monitoring wells could enable cost-effective and sensitive detection of leakage over a large area. Unlike seismic imaging which only detects leakage when CO 2 penetrates the leak, these methods are able to test for leaks before CO 2 injection, or during injection but before the CO 2 plume reaches the leak...|$|R
