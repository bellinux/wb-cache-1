We show that a securities price system is arbitrage free if and only if there exists a numeraire and an equivalent probability measure for which the normalized (by the numeraire) price processes of traded securities are supermartingales. Also, the tightest arbitrage bounds that can be inferred on the price of a contingent claim without knowing agents'preferences are equal to its largest and smallest expected normalized payoff with respect to the supermartingale measures. In the case where the underlying security price follows a diffusion process and where short selling is possible but costly, we derive partial differential equations that must be satisfied by the arbitrage bounds on derivative securities prices, and we determine optimal hedging strategies. We compute the arbitrage bounds on common securities numerically for several values of the borrowing and short-selling costs and show that they can be quite sharp...|$|E
40|$|Autocorrelation {{in stock}} returns is one {{important}} {{measure of the}} efficiency of securities markets pricing. Autocorrelation {{may be a sign}} of genuine pricing inefficiency: partial price adjustment (PPA), in which trades occur at prices that do not fully reflect the available information. However, autocorrelation may also arise from three other sources: bid-ask bounce (BAB), nonsynchronous trading (NT), and time-varying risk premia (TVRP). TVRP is not an indication of inefficient pricing. It can arise in a securities market equilibrium because the equilibrium returns of the available investments change over time; in particular, the presence of TVRP is entirely compatible with the absence of <b>arbitrage</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> markets. Anderson, Eom, Hahn and Park (2006) provide methods for identifying a portion of the autcorrelation that can only be attributable to PPA and TVRP. This paper provides bounds on TVRP, {{as a function of the}} return period, the time horizon over which the autocorrelations are calculated, and the variability of risk premia. We find that the impact of TVRP is negligible in the empirical setting in Anderson, Eom, Hahn and Park (2006), but could be significant in other settings, requiring correction in estimates and hypothesis tests...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a substantive {{connection between the}} infinitesimal generator of the semigroup of pricing operators and conditions required for absence of <b>arbitrage</b> <b>in</b> <b>security</b> prices. The practical importance of recognizing the semigroup properties is illustrated by considering the implications for empirical tests of discounted dividend models of stock prices. The convention in these empirical studies is to invoke some ad hoc method to detrend price-dividend data {{in order to achieve}} the statistical property of covariance stationarity. However, considering properties of the semigroup of arbitrage free pricing operators reveals that covariance stationarity alone is an insufficient statistical requirement. Under appropriate assumptions, further conditions on the underlying probability distributions must be satisfied to ensure absence of arbitrage requirements...|$|R

Under the null hypothesis that the aggregate cumulative dividend-price process follows a geometric Brownian motion, a closed form related to the inter-temporal marginal rate of substitution is derived and empirically evaluated.

The paper concludes with empirical tests for the martingale property of the performance measure. * The {{authors would like to thank}} Edward Fang and Jeff Oxman for invaluable research assistance...|$|R
40|$|Threshold autoregressive {{models in}} which the process is {{piecewise}} linear in the threshold space have received much attention in recent years. In this paper, we use predictive residuals to construct a test statistic to detect threshold nonlinearity in a vector time series and propose a procedure for building a multivariate threshold model. The thresholds and the model are selected jointly based on the Akaike information criterion. The finite-sample performance of the proposed test is studied by simulation. The modeling procedure is then used to study <b>arbitrage</b> <b>in</b> <b>security</b> markets and results in a threshold cointegration between logarithms of future contracts and spot prices of a security after adjusting for the cost-of-carrying the contracts. In this particular application, thresholds are determined {{in part by the}} transaction costs. We also apply the proposed procedure to U.

40|$|We derive the {{implications}} from {{the absence of}} <b>arbitrage</b> <b>in</b> dynamic <b>securities</b> market with bi-ask spreads. The absence of arbitrage {{is equivalent to the}} existence of at least an equivalent probability measure that transforms some process between the bid and the ask price processes of traded securities into a martingale. These martingale measures can be interpreted as possible linear pricing rules and can be used to determine the investment opportunities available in such an economy. The minimum cost at which a contingent claim can be obtained through securities trading is its largest expected value with respect to the martingale measures...|$|R

40|$|<b>In</b> {{traditional}} models, <b>arbitrage</b> <b>in</b> a given <b>security</b> {{is performed}} by {{a large number of}} diversified investors taking small positions against its mispricing. <b>In</b> reality, however, <b>arbitrage</b> is conducted by {{a relatively small number of}} highly specialized investors who take large positions using other people's money.

50|$|<b>Arbitrage</b> {{transactions}} <b>in</b> modern <b>securities</b> markets involve {{fairly low}} day-to-day risks, but can face extremely high risk in rare situations, particularly financial crises, {{and can lead}} to bankruptcy. Formally, arbitrage transactions have negative skew - prices can get a small amount closer (but often no closer than 0), while they can get very far apart. The day-to-day risks are generally small because the transactions involve small differences in price, so an execution failure will generally cause a small loss (unless the trade is very big or the price moves rapidly). The rare case risks are extremely high because these small price differences are converted to large profits via leverage (borrowed money), and in the rare event of a large price move, this may yield a large loss.|$|R
50|$|In 1930 Walter Laband, a German-educated banker, joined W&Co. with {{responsibility}} for foreign offices acquired from Colbin & Co. in London and Amsterdam. The company's primary activity is <b>arbitrage</b> <b>in</b> foreign <b>securities.</b> Two years later, the failure of Hilson & Neuberger brought Edwin Hilson, Milton Steinbach (Klingenstein’s brother-in-law) and George Jones to W&Co. Hilson was a self-made man, whose formal education reportedly ended when he was expelled from Exeter at age 16 for adolescent high jinks. He sold cigars to western Pennsylvania coal miners (like Maurice, Hilson's {{father was in the}} cigar-manufacturing business), was drafted into the army during World War I, and returned to Wall Street. A friend from Exeter introduced him to Harry Neuberger, who put up the money to start Hilson & Neuberger. Another friend of Hilson from P.S. 6 in New York was Sidney Weinberg, who became head of Goldman Sachs. Steinbach was a product of Andover and Yale; Jones was Hilson’s assistant. During that year the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) bottomed at 41, down 89% from the 1929 high of 381. NYSE volume declined to 425 million shares, from 1.1 billion in 1929 and 810 million in 1930. The value of a seat on the NYSE fell to $68,000, from $550,000 in 1929. The U.S. unemployment rate in 1933 reached 25%. In 1933, Roosevelt proclaimed a bank holiday and embargoed gold; Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 (the “truth <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> law”). W&Co. moved its funds into Treasury bills before the bank holiday. The following year, Alfred Kleinbaum joined W&Co; the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was established by Congress under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, risk <b>arbitrage</b> was common. <b>In</b> {{this form}} of speculation, one trades a {{security}} that is clearly undervalued or overvalued, when it is seen that the wrong valuation {{is about to be}} corrected by events. The standard example is the stock of a company, undervalued in the stock market, which is about to be the object of a takeover bid; the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company, giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price - if the merger goes through as predicted. Traditionally, <b>arbitrage</b> transactions <b>in</b> the <b>securities</b> markets involve high speed, high volume and low risk. At some moment a price difference exists, and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists (that is, before the other arbitrageurs act). When the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months, as above, it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage. One way of reducing the risk is through the illegal use of inside information, and <b>in</b> fact risk <b>arbitrage</b> with regard to leveraged buyouts was associated with some of the famous financial scandals of the 1980s such as those involving Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky.|$|R

The probability of a merger failing is a decreasing function of market returns in the last two months, indicating that deals are more likely to fail following market downturns.
