5|$|While {{talking to}} the camera, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reveal that Jim was offered an {{entrepreneurial}} sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because {{it would not be}} good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting will happen to the Halperts in a long time.|$|E

Ferrero wants to invest in 40.000 MT of fair trade cocoa till 2020.|$|E

Several residents, who were present at the auction along with tenant advocacy group Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, wept with joy when the auctioneer announced no bids had been registered. John Crotty of Workforce Housing Advisors told the New York Times that his group intends to renovate the distressed building and work with tenants to recognize its importance. The group’s investors <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> steady, secure returns than in making money quickly. Some money for renovations will be provided by New York City’s department of Housing Preservation and Development, and the Housing Development Corporation.

500|$|The song [...] "The Diamond Sea" [...] {{is notable}} for its 19:35 duration. Moore {{explained}} {{the length of}} some of the album's songs: [...] "We all have different aesthetics as to how songs should work. I generally push for a lot of abandon while some people in the group <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> truncating things. If I was the leader as much as people say I am, every song would be 20 minutes long". The unlisted ninth track, officially called [...] "Becuz Coda", was originally part of the song [...] "Becuz", but the record label felt they needed to cut the seven-and-a-half-minute track to make the album's opening more accessible. The album was produced by Sonic Youth and John Siket, who also engineered the band's previous two albums. Audio mixing took place at Greene Street Studios in New York City in June 1995.|$|E
500|$|While Jones is {{credited}} with writing the screenplay, the shooting script was actually a collaborative effort that featured contributions from Henson, George Lucas, Laura Phillips, and Elaine May.

I always felt it fell between two stories, Jim wanted it to be one thing and I wanted it to be about something else." [...] Jones has said his version of the script was [...] "about the world, and about people who <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> manipulating the world than actually baring themselves at all."

After Andrews' death, Aaron {{tries to take}} charge but the prisoners refute his authority. Ripley tells him several times that the Weyland-Yutani company does not care about him or any other employee, and <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> acquiring the Aliens. Aaron refuses to send the rescue ship away {{because he wants to}} see his family again. He helps Ripley with the bio-scan she performs on herself on the crashed spacecraft, and they discover that she has been impregnated with an Alien chestburster. Weyland-Yutani immediately informs the prison that a rescue ship will arrive in several hours to pick her up, and Aaron concludes that the corporation only wants the Aliens. When the prisoners decide to lure the alien into the molten lead, he calls them crazy and locks himself in his office. Michael Bishop lands with his team and tries to convince Ripley to leave with him; Aaron hits him with a large metal rod, nearly ripping his ear off, and is shot dead by Bishop's team.|$|E
500|$|Yuri on Ice has {{highlighted}} homophobia {{in figure}} skating and other areas; the seventh episode features a flashback {{in which a}} younger Victor performs in a costume based on those worn by openly-gay figure skater Johnny Weir, who was subject to homophobic comments throughout his career. Weir {{said in an interview}} with The Geekiary, [...] "I think all positive imagery of LGBT themes in sport are good. Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world are conservative and more business minded. I think many of them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if Yuri on Ice will be able to change the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but I am of the school of thought that every little bit helps". The series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event; something which has not yet occurred in actual competition. Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning LGBT rights.|$|E
500|$|After his {{retirement}} as department head Inglis served as Vice-Provost of King's College from 1943 to 1947. [...] He received a knighthood in the 1945 King's Birthday Honours, and in 1946 was appointed {{as chair of}} the committee charged with advising the Minister of War Transport on railway modernisation. [...] Inglis continued to develop his theories on teaching engineering and wrote in the Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1947 on the teaching of engineering mathematics: [...] "Mathematics [...] though it must be sound and incisive as far as goes, need not be of that artistic and exalted quality which calls for the mentality of the real mathematician. [...] It can be termed mathematics of the tin-opening variety, and in contrast to real mathematicians, engineers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the contents of the tin than in the elegance of the tin-opener employed". [...] He published the textbook Applied Mechanics for Engineers in 1951, following which he spent three months as a visiting professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. [...] His wife, Lady Eleanor Inglis, died on 1 April 1952, and Charles died eighteen days later at Southwold, Suffolk. [...] The Cambridge University Engineering Department's Inglis Building is named in his honour. [...] Inglis has been described as the greatest teacher of engineering of his time.|$|E

40|$|Our {{research}} {{focused on}} the vocational interests correlated with the Dark Triad traits (i. e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism). By understanding how these traits facilitate the structuring of one’s environment, we hypothesized that psychopaths will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> realistic and practical careers, narcissists will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> artistic, enterprising, and social careers, and Machiavellians will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> avoiding careers that involve caring for others. In two cross-sectional studies (N = 424; N = 274), we provide general support for these hypotheses. Overall, our study showed those high on the Dark Triad traits may structure their social environment through idealized career preferences. We also show that sex differences in career preferences might be a function, in part of, individual differences in the Dark Triad traits...|$|R
500|$|Noman spoke over Radio San'a, {{offering}} {{reconciliation and}} inviting [...] "all tribes of all persuasions" [...] {{to meet with}} him the following week at Khamir, 50 miles north of San'a, to achieve [...] "the one thing which we all prize over anything else: peace for the nation." [...] In order to convince al-Badr to come the conference, Noman announced that he personally would head the republican delegation at Khamir, and that Sallal would stay in San'a. Al-Badr and his ranking chiefs did not attend the conference, but a handful of pro-royalist sheiks were present. The conference named a committee of five tribal and four religious leaders who were charged with seeking out the [...] "beguiled brothers", al-Badr and his friends. Noman's effort, including a private promise to reach a withdrawal of Egyptian troops, was backed by Nasser. Radio Cairo hailed the Khamir conference as the [...] "dawn of a new era." [...] Sallal called the talks [...] "a complete success", while al-Badr stated that [...] "It is essential that the conflict which has devastated our beloved country be brought to an end by peaceful negotiations between the Yemeni people themselves." [...] However, by early June, when Noman said that Egypt's 50,000 troops would have {{to be replaced by a}} joint royalist-republican [...] peace force, the Nasserites lost interest in the deal. After Noman flew to Cairo to protest directly to Nasser, Sallal threw seven civilian [...] Cabinet ministers into jail. Noman resigned, saying [...] "It is obvious that Sallal and his cronies <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> war than [...] peace". Sallal soon named a new Cabinet to replace Noman's, with 13 military men and two civilians.|$|E
