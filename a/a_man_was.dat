5|$|Queen Christina of Sweden's {{tendency}} to dress as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> well known during her time, and excused {{because of her}} noble birth. She was brought up as a male and there was speculation {{at the time that}} she was a hermaphrodite. Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage, she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women.|$|E

5|$|A CNN film crew, {{who were}} there on a routine check for a {{possible}} Falun Gong protest, observed a man sitting down on the pavement northeast of the Monument to the People's Heroes at {{the centre of the}} square. He proceeded to pour gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze. Police officers quickly congregated on the scene and extinguished the flames. Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>was</b> detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E
5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. It {{is difficult to}} detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E

5|$|As {{the game}} begins, American tourist George Stobbart {{witnesses}} {{a terrorist attack}} at a café in Paris, during which a clown steals an old man's briefcase and detonates a bomb. Soon after, George meets Nicole Collard, a journalist who is photographing the scene. George investigates the area to help Nicole gather information about the attack. He finds the clown's discarded nose, a tissue covered in theatrical greasepaint, {{and a piece of}} fabric from the clown's jacket in the sewers around the cafe and learns that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> seen escaping with a briefcase. After Nicole discovers the address of a costume shop inside the clown nose, George learns from that shop's owner that the nose and theatrical greasepaint had been purchased by a man named Khan.|$|E
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In Okaloosa County, up to 1,267 {{residents}} {{lost power}} during the storm. Most {{of the residents}} had their power restored within a few hours; however, due to continuing wind damage, scattered power outages, affecting up to 500 homes at a time, occurred throughout the county. Throughout the county, roughly $25,000 was sustained in flood losses. A second fatality occurred after <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> knocked off his ship near the coast of Bay County. Rescuers managed to reach him but during the rescue, he fell off the life raft and was lost. The search was later called off as he was presumed dead.|$|E
6000|$|Then Lord Rufford began. [...] "These kind {{of things}} are {{sometimes}} deuced hard upon <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> Of course if <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> saint or a philosopher or a Joseph he wouldn't get into such scrapes,--and perhaps every <b>man</b> ought to <b>be</b> something of that sort.

5|$|Intense rainbands {{produced}} gusty {{winds and}} heavy precipitation totaling to 5.90 in (150mm) in Martinique, causing street flooding and inundating homes. Roughly 5,000 residences lost {{power at the}} height of the storm, though the outages were brief and confined to the southeast of the island. A large landslide occurred in the capital of Fort-de-France due to excessive soil saturation, prompting some 40 families to evacuate the area. Across the city, deep flood waters affected 29 houses; <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> electrocuted and killed by an exposed wire in his flooded home.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April 1922, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{assaulted}} {{while walking}} down Coventry Street around 6.00am. He fell unconscious after the attack, and {{was rushed to}} Charing Cross Hospital, where he {{was found to have}} been stabbed in the neck by a thin tube. After another man was attacked a few hours later in a similar manner, followed by a third victim in the evening, an urban legend spread that a vampire was stalking Coventry Street. No further incidents occurred and the attacker was never convicted.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E

5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E
5|$|The {{subway station}} at Porter is, at 105 feet below ground level, the deepest in the MBTA system. Porter's unusual depth {{is due to}} the MBTA's {{decision}} to build the station in bedrock rather than soft clay, saving time and money in the construction process. Passengers reach Red Line platforms via a series of escalators, stairs totalling 199 steps, or a set of elevators. The longest single span of the escalators is 143feet, the longest in the MBTA system. In 2005, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> killed when his sweatshirt tangled {{in the bottom of the}} escalator.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav {{remained}} well offshore, the difference in pressure between it and a high pressure area over the central United States caused strong winds in areas of New Jersey on September 11. Wind gusts ranged from 35–45mph (55–70km/h), with stronger winds reported near the coast. A maximum wind gust of 60mph (100km/h) was reported at Keansburg. The strong winds downed trees and power lines throughout {{the eastern half of}} the state, damaging homes and blocking streets. At least 14,000 homes in the vicinity of Burlington and Ocean Counties were left without power. In West Windsor Township, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> killed when the upper section of a concrete wall he was working on blew over and crushed him. The other death occurred in West Amwell Township, where a tree limb fell on two elderly women, killing one and injuring the other. Elsewhere, while there were reports of trees falling on vehicles, no other serious injuries or deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|Field {{punishment}} (FP) {{had replaced}} flogging (abolished {{at home in}} 1868 and on active service in 1881, although still used in military prisons until 1907). FP No.1 (in which the man was shackled to fixed object, e.g. a large wheel) was awarded to 60,210 cases, equivalent to one man in 50 (although in practice there were many repeat offenders). FP No.1 could be very unpleasant depending on the weather, was abhorred by some as barbaric, and in some units was ritualised (e.g. by locking {{a man in a}} shed and throwing the handcuffs in with him); there were also cases of Australian troops releasing British troops whom they found tied up, although in other units it was regarded as a necessary sanction for serious offences. FP No.2 meant that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> shackled but not fixed in place.|$|E
5|$|Flooding also {{occurred}} in Cuba. Hundreds were evacuated {{their homes in}} four different provinces in Cuba, including 400peasant families in Oriente Province. Near Santiago de Cuba, 25houses were swept away after the Bayamo River overflowed. In the same area, {{a woman and her}} four sons drowned due to the swollen river. Additionally, a body of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> recovered near Santa Cruz del Sur. Hundreds of livestock drowned, and telephone and telegraph services were disrupted in many areas. Losses in Cuba were estimated to have reached $100,000. Ella had a role in the Cuban Revolution as the government troops of Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar stayed in their barracks during the storm while the rebels made progress under cover of Ella. Later, when the guerrillas heard about Hurricane Fifi on the radio, Che Guevara taught his illiterate comrades that entities like tropical cyclones are named in alphabetical order.|$|E
