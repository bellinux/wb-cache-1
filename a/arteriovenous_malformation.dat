25|$|Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc {{syndrome}}, {{also known}} as Wyburn-Mason syndrome, is a rare congential <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> of the brain, retina or facial nevi.

When the syndrome affects the brain, people can experience severe headaches, seizures, acute stroke, meningism and progressive neurological deficits due to acute or chronic ischaemia caused by arteriovenous shunting.|$|E
40|$|Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is characterised by the {{development}} of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> -enlarged shunts allowing arterial flow to bypass capillaries and enter directly into veins. HHT is caused by mutations in ALK 1 or Endoglin; however, the majority of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> are idiopathic and arise spontaneously. Idiopathic <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> differ from those due to loss of ALK 1 both in terms of location and disease progression. Furthermore, while <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> in HHT and Alk 1 knockout models have decreased NOTCH signalling, some idiopathic <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> have increased NOTCH signalling. The pathogenesis of these lesions also differs, with loss of ALK 1 causing expansion of the shunt through proliferation, and NOTCH gain-of-function inducing initial shunt enlargement by cellular hypertrophy. Hence, we propose that idiopathic <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> are distinct from those of HHT. In this review, we explore the role of ALK 1 -NOTCH interactions in {{the development}} of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> and examine a possible role of two signalling pathways downstream of ALK 1, TMEM 100 and IDs, in the development of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> in HHT.

40|$|A {{role for}} the Notch {{signalling}} pathway {{in the formation of}} <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> during development has been suggested. However, whether Notch signalling is involved in brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> in humans remains unclear. Here, we performed immunohistochemistry on surgically resected brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> and found that, compared with control brain vascular tissue, Notch- 1 signalling was activated in smooth muscle and endothelial cells of the lesional tissue. Western blotting showed an activated form of Notch- 1 in brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations,</b> irrespective of clinical presentation and with or without preoperative embolization, but not in normal cerebral vessels from controls. In addition, the Notch- 1 ligands Jagged- 1 and Delta-like- 4 and the downstream Notch- 1 target Hes- 1 were increased in abundance and activated in human brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations.</b> Finally, increased angiogenesis was found in adult rats treated with a Notch- 1 activator. Our findings suggest that activation of Notch- 1 signalling is a phenotypic feature of brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations,</b> and that activation of Notch- 1 in normal vasculature induces a pro-angiogenic state, which may {{contribute to the development of}} vascular malformations...|$|R

25|$|The {{ophthalmic}} {{features of}} the Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome occur as retinal <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> (AVMs). There are three categories of AVMs that are categorized depending on {{the severity of the}} malformation. The first category consists of the patient having small lesions that usually are asymptomatic. The second category, more severe than the first, is when the patient’s malformation is missing a connecting capillary. The missing capillary is meant to serve as a link between an artery and a vein; without it, edemas, hemorrhages, and visual impairments can result. Category three, the most severe, occurs when the patient’s malformations are so severe that the dilated vessels cause no distinction between artery and vein. When the symptoms are this severe, the patient has a significantly increased risk of developing vision loss. Since the retinal lesions categorized vary from large vascular malformations that affect a majority of the retina to malformations that are barely visible, the lesions cause a wide range of symptoms including decrease in visual sharpness, proptosis, pupillary defects, optic degeneration and visual field defects. The most common type of visual field impairment due to AVMs is homonymous hemianopia. Homonymous hemianopia typically presents unilaterally, but bilateral cases have been reported as well.|$|E

500|$|SCI {{can also}} be of a nontraumatic origin. Nontraumatic lesions cause {{anywhere}} from 30 to 80% of all SCI; the percentage varies by locale, influenced by efforts to prevent trauma. Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries. [...] In developed countries, {{the most common cause}} of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases, followed by tumors; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as HIV and tuberculosis. SCI may occur in intervertebral disc disease, and spinal cord vascular disease. Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord, and intervertebral disks can herniate. Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels, as in <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation,</b> or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord. When systemic blood pressure drops, blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced, potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord. Congenital conditions and tumors that compress the cord can also cause SCI, as can vertebral spondylosis and ischemia. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the spinal cord, as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, herpes zoster or herpes simplex, meningitis, myelitis, and syphilis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: Pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> cause {{progressive}} cyanosis {{in children}} after cavopulmonary anastomosis {{and may be}} due to abnormal angiogenesis. We determined the microvessel density, a marker of angiogenesis, in the lungs of children after cavopulmonary anastomosis. Methods: Lung biopsy specimens were obtained from 8 children after cavopulmonary anastomosis and from 4 control patients. Three of the 8 children undergoing cavopulmonary anastomosis had clinical and angiographic evidence of pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations,</b> whereas the other 5 were free of symptoms. Routine histologic and immunohistologic stains were performed with a primary antibody to von Willebrand factor. Microvessel staining for von Willebrand factor was determined for 10 fields (200 ×) per patient. Results: Patients with and without pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> after cavopulmonary anastomosis demonstrated significantly increased microvessel density compared with control subjects (32. 7 ± 2. 8 vs 9. 3 ± 4. 6, P =. 02, and 31. 5 ± 15. 7 vs 9. 3 ± 4. 6, P =. 01, respectively). There was no difference in microvessel density in children with and without clinically apparent pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> after cavopulmonary anastomosis (P =. 9). The children with pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> had numerous greatly dilated vessels that were absent in the asymptomatic children after cavopulmonary anastomosis. Conclusions: After cavopulmonary anastomosis, pulmonary microvessel density is increased {{even in the absence of}} clinically apparent pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations,</b> supporting the presence of a constant angiogenic stimulus. Children with clinically apparent pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> possess large numbers of greatly dilated pulmonary microvessels, which are absent in asymptomatic children after cavopulmonary anastomosis.
