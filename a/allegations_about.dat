5|$|Also in August 2014, 4chan was {{involved}} in the Gamergate controversy, which began with unsubstantiated <b>allegations</b> <b>about</b> indie game developer Zoë Quinn from an ex-boyfriend, followed by false allegations from anonymous Internet users. The allegations were followed by a harassment campaign against several women in the video game industry, organized by 4chan users.|$|E
5|$|Boyer and the University Press' {{credibility}} {{was severely}} damaged. In 2000 the University referred all questions to university lawyers who investigated {{some of the}} <b>allegations</b> <b>about</b> Boyer's work. Later that year the Press removed the book from their catalog. The book has been discredited as a fraud and a hoax that cannot be relied on.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice {{completed}} {{the investigation into}} Jowers' claims but did not find evidence to support <b>allegations</b> <b>about</b> conspiracy. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented. A sister of Jowers {{admitted that he had}} fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story, and she in turn corroborated his story in order to get some money to pay her income tax.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's former {{personal}} assistant Fred Seaman (who was earlier convicted for and admitted stealing from Lennon's personal belongings) has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced the counterculture views {{which he had}} helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with conservatism and was supportive of Ronald Reagan, though whether he had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed. Some commentators noted that Seaman's claims have low credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released a book with dubious <b>allegations</b> <b>about</b> Lennon which had largely been ignored.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan also faced {{difficulties}} {{on policy}} issues. Factional cracks {{began to appear}} in Labor and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in a bind. The uranium was seen as a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on safety grounds was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but he was seen as lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named It's Grossly Improper would soon be released, containing embarrassing <b>allegations</b> <b>about</b> Dunstan's private life.|$|E
50|$|The Duke asked Pope Pius V for help, or {{at least}} a public blessing to the city: he {{receiving}} nothing but a firm reprimand for not having prosecuted enough the city's Jews, well deserving God's wrath toward the city.

25|$|COL Oran K. Henderson – 11th Infantry Brigade commander, {{who ordered}} {{the attack and}} flew in a {{helicopter}} over Mỹ Lai during it. After Hugh Thompson immediately reported multiple killings of civilians, Henderson started the cover-up by dismissing <b>allegation</b> <b>about</b> the massacre and reporting to the superiors that indeed 20 people from My Lai died by accident. Was accused of alleged cover-up and false swearing by the Army; charges were dropped.|$|R
5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world {{on behalf of all}} Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic <b>allegations</b> <b>about</b> anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{established}} {{procedure for}} removing an English king. Adam Orleton, the Bishop of Hereford, {{made a series}} of public <b>allegations</b> <b>about</b> Edward's conduct as king, and in January 1327 a parliament convened at Westminster at which the question of Edward's future was raised; Edward refused to attend the gathering. Parliament, initially ambivalent, responded to the London crowds that called for Prince Edward to take the throne. On 12 January the leading barons and clergy agreed that Edward II should be removed and replaced by his son. The following day it was presented to an assembly of the barons, where it was argued that Edward's weak leadership and personal faults had led the kingdom into disaster, and that he was incompetent to lead the country.|$|E

5000|$|Contemporaneously {{with his}} trial for Mafia association, Andreotti was tried in Perugia with Sicilian Mafia boss Gaetano Badalamenti, Massimo Carminati, {{and others on}} charges of {{complicity}} {{in the murder of}} journalist Mino Pecorelli. The case was circumstantial and based on the word of Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta, who had not originally mentioned the <b>allegation</b> <b>about</b> Andreotti when interviewed by Giovanni Falcone and had recanted it {{by the time of the}} trial.|$|R
50|$|Contrary {{to what is}} {{sometimes}} alleged, no eyewitness source refers to Crusaders killing Eastern Christians in Jerusalem, and early Eastern Christian sources (Matthew of Edessa, Anna Comnena, Michael the Syrian, etc.) make no such <b>allegation</b> <b>about</b> the Crusaders in Jerusalem. According to the Syriac Chronicle, all the Christians had already been expelled from Jerusalem before the Crusaders arrived. Presumably {{this would have been}} done by the Fatimid governor to prevent their possible collusion with the Crusaders.|$|R
5000|$|Asked to be specific, Goldfarb named Rashid Khalidi, a Columbia University {{professor}} who once held a fundraiser for Obama, but then refused to cite anyone else.

But he leaves it hanging, refusing to disown or retract the charge. This is pure McCarthyism. And it is the rotten core of McCain." ...|$|R

[...] Colombia is the third-largest recipient of US foreign aid, and, if the allegations are established, it could heighten pressure to reduce or redirect that aid because Montoya has been a favorite of the Pentagon and an important partner in the U.S.-funded counterinsurgency strategy called Plan Colombia.|$|R

50|$|False {{allegations}} against Jeremy Clarkson, a British TV celebrity, and David Beckham were {{published on the}} Popbitch messageboards by its users. This led to legal action against the site's owners. The messageboard was closed and reopened with board members as editors. The editors {{have the ability to}} modify or delete anything libellous or 'not pop or bitch', and the board also employs automatic censors that prevent the names of certain celebrities from appearing. Despite these precautions Popbitch was once again in the news after being successfully sued by Max Beesley in March 2008 over an <b>allegation</b> <b>about</b> his personal life.|$|R

At the sentencing hearing on 23 July the DPP refused the defences application for an adjournment and denied that the newly discovered evidence was relevant.

5000|$|The Supreme Court went on {{to state}} that: [...] "In order that the people may feel assured {{that there is an}} {{effective}} check against misuse or abuse of powers by the members of the armed forces it is necessary that a complaint containing an <b>allegation</b> <b>about</b> misuse or abuse of the powers conferred under the Central Act should be thoroughly inquired into and, it is found that there is substance in the allegation, the victim should be suitably compensated by the State and the requisite sanction under Section 6 of the Central Act should be granted for institution of prosecution and/or a civil suit or other proceedings against the person/persons responsible for such violation." ...|$|R
50|$|There {{have also}} been {{allegations}} that Krahe {{was involved in the}} disappearance and presumed murder of Griffith, New South Wales anti-drugs campaigner Donald Mackay, in 1977, although the <b>allegation</b> <b>about</b> the Mackay killing was made by notorious Melbourne criminal James Frederick Bazley. Bazley is himself widely believed to have been paid to kill Mackay by infamous Griffith Mafia figure and drug dealer Robert Trimbole. Author John Jiggens claims Fred Krahe was responsible for dispensing, through his Fairfax Media newspaper connections, the rumour that Mackay had not been murdered, but instead ran away with a woman who was not his wife. Jiggens is also a strong proponent of the theory that Krahe murdered Mackay with Keith Kelly, and that Bazley was a patsy.|$|R
