25|$|Document Object Model (DOM) is an API {{that allows}} for {{navigation}} of the entire document {{as if it were}} a tree of node objects representing the document's contents. <b>A</b> <b>DOM</b> document can be created by a parser, or can be generated manually by users (with limitations). Data types in DOM nodes are abstract; implementations provide their own programming language-specific bindings. DOM implementations tend to be memory intensive, as they generally require the entire document to be loaded into memory and constructed as a tree of objects before access is allowed.|$|E
25|$|From this event, Jaggar {{assumes a}} {{hereditary}} {{right to be}} the leader of Heldon and embarks on a violent crusade for genetic purity, drawing a massive following, staging outdoor rallies and raising an army personally loyal to him. He is elected to the Council and stages a coup d'état when he forces the Council to admit to treason and a Zind plot against Heldon. Confirming his suspicions, the Universalist member of the Council turns out to be <b>a</b> <b>Dom.</b> Feric summarily executes him with the Great Truncheon. Jaggar coerces the Council into granting him complete executive power and then has them shot. Immediately after assuming power Jaggar puts down an imminent coup by Stopa, who has been corrupted by the fleshly pleasures of Zind.|$|E

2500|$|XML {{data binding}} is the binding of XML {{documents}} to {{a hierarchy of}} custom and strongly typed objects, {{in contrast to the}} generic objects created by <b>a</b> <b>DOM</b> parser. This approach simplifies code development, and in many cases allows problems to be identified at compile time rather than run-time. It is suitable for applications where the document structure is known and fixed at the time the application is written. Example data binding systems include the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB), XML Serialization in [...]NET Framework. and XML serialization in gSOAP.|$|E
2500|$|The first Raja to be baptized was Ola Adobala who {{was brought}} up under Portuguese education, {{traditionally}} the ninth in the pedigree of the Rajas and baptized {{during the reign of}} Peter II of Portugal [...] while present-day traditional celebrations place his baptism at 1650 instead. In addition, Portuguese sources mention <b>a</b> <b>Dom</b> Constantino between 1625-1661, which implies that Adobala may not be the first in the line of Catholic monarchs of Larantuka. Other monarch names mentioned are Dom Luis (1675) and Dom Domingos Viera (1702) The Dominican Order was vital in the spread of Catholicism in the area until their later replacement in the 19th century.|$|E
