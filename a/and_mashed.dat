25|$|The {{process begins}} by {{harvesting}} the plants, which can weigh 40kg each, extracting the piña, or heart, by {{cutting off the}} plant's leaves and roots. The piñas are then cooked for about three days, often in pit ovens, which are earthen mounds over pits of hot rocks. This underground roasting gives mezcal its intense and distinctive smoky flavor. They are then crushed <b>and</b> <b>mashed</b> (traditionally by a stone wheel turned by a horse) and then left to ferment in large vats or barrels with water added.|$|E
25|$|Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg {{replacer}} and Ener-G egg replacer, {{are available}} for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu <b>and</b> <b>mashed</b> potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.|$|E

25|$|Manipuri cuisine is {{represented}} by the cuisine of the Meitei people who form the majority population in the central plain. Meitei food are simple, tasty, organic and healthy. Rice with local seasonal vegetables and fish form the main diet. Most of the dishes are cooked like vegetable stew, flavored with either fermented fish called ngari, or dried and smoked fish. The most popular manipuri dish is the iromba; it's a preparation of boiled <b>and</b> <b>mashed</b> vegetables, often including potatoes or beans, mixed with chilli and roasted fermented fish. Another popular dish is the savory cake called Paknam, made of a base of lentil flour stuffed with various ingredients such as banana inflorescence, mushrooms, fish, vegetables etc., and baked covered in turmeric leaves. Along with spicy dishes, a mild side dish of steamed or boiled sweet vegetables are often served in the daily meals. The manipuri salad dish called singju, made of finely julienned cabbage, green papaya, and other vegetables, and garnished with local herbs, toasted sesame powder and lentil flour is extremely popular locally, and often found sold in small street side vendors. Singju is often served with bora which are fritters of various kinds, and also kanghou, or oil fried spicy veggies. Cooked and fermented soybean is a popular condiment in all manipuri kitchens.|$|E

500|$|Following the pie {{attack on}} the archbishop, two of Allan Spear's colleagues invited Anita Bryant to come to St. Paul to {{overturn}} their three-year-old gay rights ordinance, and announced Save Our Children would be opening a branch there. Local activists did not think much of their chances; a local gay political group invited gays and lesbians in Miami to live in Minneapolis—St. Paul. In an act representing Bryant's diminished national public profile, in October 1977 Bryant {{and her husband were}} in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing an upcoming concert at a press conference when Thom Higgins, an activist affiliated with organizers in Minneapolis, walked up to her in front of cameras <b>and</b> <b>mashed</b> a strawberry rhubarb pie in her face.

500|$|The Marines, {{especially}} Latham, taught Reckless battlefield {{survival skills}} such as how not to become entangled in barbed wire and to lie down when under fire. She learned to run for a bunker upon hearing the cry, [...] "incoming!" [...] The platoon called it her [...] "hoof training" [...] and [...] "hoof camp". The horse was initially kept in a pasture near the encampment. Reckless had a gentle disposition and soon developed such a rapport with the troops that she was allowed to freely roam about the camp and entered tents at will, sometimes sleeping inside with the troops, and even lying down next to Latham's warm tent stove on cold nights. She was fond {{of a wide variety}} of foodstuffs, entertaining the platoon by eating scrambled eggs and drinking Coca-Cola and beer. Food could not be left unattended around her. She was known to eat bacon, buttered toast, chocolate bars, hard candy, shredded wheat, peanut butter sandwiches <b>and</b> <b>mashed</b> potatoes. However, Mitchell advised the platoon that she not be given more than two bottles of Coke a day. [...] Her tastes were not confined to foodstuffs; she once ate her horse blanket, and on another occasion ate $30 worth of Latham's winning poker chips.|$|E

40|$|Background: In recent decades, {{biological}} {{properties of}} biosurfactants, particularly glycolipids, including antimicrobial, antifungal, and anti-cellular effects have been projected in many research studies. The unique advantages of these compounds {{in terms of}} production and environment made them important as antimicrobial agents [...] Objectives: This study aims to evaluate probable antibacterial and antifungal properties of MR 01 <b>and</b> <b>MASH</b> 1 biosurfactants against several specified microorganisms [...] Materials and Methods: In this article antibacterial activities of two rhamnolipid mixtures of MR 01 <b>and</b> <b>MASH</b> 1 were studied. MR 01 <b>and</b> <b>MASH</b> 1 are glycolipid-type biosurfactants that are being produced by two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MR 01 <b>and</b> <b>MASH</b> 1, respectively. Antibacterial effects of two biosurfactants were assessed by disc diffusion test method and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) [...] Results: They exhibit not only excellent surface activity but also remarkable inhibitory effect against Gram-positive bacteria. According to results, although none of two biosurfactants showed significant effects on Gram negative bacteria growth inhibition, both assessing methods confirmed the growth inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria by MR 01 <b>and</b> <b>MASH</b> 1 biosurfactants [...] Conclusions: According to results of this study, MR 01 <b>and</b> <b>MASH</b> 1 biosurfactants had antimicrobial efficacy against Gram positive bacterial groups. This effect is comparable to antibiotics and therefore the future use of these biosurfactants as broad spectrum antibiotics is highly promising. These features of biosurfactants (BS) should broaden its applications in new advanced technologies. Future studies will be performed on characterization and isolation of biologically active fraction of the rhamnolipid biosurfactant produced by P. aeruginosa strains. This bioactive compound may be evaluated as a potent antimicrobial agent to be applied against a panel of pathogenic micro-organisms including a few multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical pathogenic isolates such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other MDR pathogenic strains...|$|R
