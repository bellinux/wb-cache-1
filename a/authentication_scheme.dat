40|$|Abstract—Dictionary {{attacks are}} the best known threats on the password-based <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes.</b> Based on Reverse Turing Test (RTT), some usable and {{scalable}} <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> are proposed to defeat online dictionary attacks mounted by automated programs. However {{it is found that}} these <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> are vulnerable to various online dictionary attacks. In this paper, a practical decision function is presented, based on which RTT <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> are constructed and shown to be secure against all the known online dictionary attacks. After formally modeling of the adversary, the static and dynamic security of the <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> are proved formally...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: At present, the {{proposed}} <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> {{can be classified}} into three categories. The first category is the watermarking <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> in which the watermark is independent of the multimedia content. The second category is the signature-based <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> in which the signature is generated by the mul-timedia content and is not embedded into the multimedia content. The third category is the content-based watermarking <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> in which the watermark is generated by the multimedia content. However, there exists the security question in the above-mentioned three categories of the <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes.</b> In this pa-per, a novel concept that is called ”authentication set ” is {{used to analyze the}} security of the <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> in detail. Several novel concepts on the authentication set are defined, which are called ”Cover Authentication Set”, ”Attack Authentication Set”, ”Watermark-based Authentication Set ” or ”Signature-based Authentication Set”, ”Verified Authentication Set ” and ”Malicious-attack Authentication Set”. According to the relation among the aforementioned sets, the security of the <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> is exploited. Furthermore, a conclusion is drawn according to the analysis result. At the same time the principle that guides the design of the more secure <b>authentication</b> <b>schemes</b> is presented. Finally, as an example, a novel authentication design method based on multi-feature watermarks is proposed according to the design principle. The experimental results prove the validity of the design method and the significance of the guide principle...|$|R

2500|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} {{is vulnerable to}} a man-in-the-middle attack when used without authentication {{to the same extent}} as any classical protocol, since no known principle of quantum mechanics can distinguish friend from foe. As in the classical case, Alice and Bob cannot authenticate each other and establish a secure connection without some means of verifying each other's identities (such as an initial shared secret). If Alice and Bob have an initial shared secret then they can use an unconditionally secure <b>authentication</b> <b>scheme</b> (such as Carter-Wegman,) along with quantum {{key distribution}} to exponentially expand this key, using a small amount of the new key to authenticate the next session. Several methods to create this initial shared secret have been proposed, for example using a 3rd party or chaos theory. Nevertheless, only [...] "almost strongly universal" [...] family of hash functions can be used for unconditionally secure authentication.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} vulnerability {{is present}} in the last step in the <b>authentication</b> <b>scheme</b> when TLS / SSL are not used: the redirect-URL from the Identity Provider to the Relying Party. The problem with this redirect is the fact that anyone who can obtain this URL (e.g. by sniffing the wire) can replay it and get logged into the site as the victim user. Some of the Identity Providers use nonces (number used once) to allow a user to log into the site once and fail all the consecutive attempts. The nonce solution works if the user is the first one to use the URL. However a fast attacker who is sniffing the wire can obtain the URL and immediately reset a user's TCP connection (as an attacker is sniffing the wire and knows the required TCP sequence numbers) and then execute the replay attack as described above. Thus nonces only protect against passive attackers but cannot prevent active attackers from executing the replay attack. [...] Use of TLS/SSL in the authentication process eliminates this risk.|$|E

The Zuhua Shao proposed a new scheme to overcome the drawbacks of existing schemes, but it has some vulnerabilities. This scheme relies only on key server for certificate generation.
