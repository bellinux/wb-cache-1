Their antifungal activities against four kinds of phytopathogens were evaluated using the radial growth assay and {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} procedure. The fungicidal assessment revealed that the synthesized starch derivatives had superior antifungal activity compared with starch. Especially, the inhibitory indices of triphenylphosphonium <b>acetyl</b> starch <b>chloride</b> against these four kinds of plant pathogens were higher than 70 % at 1. 0 mg/mL. The results indicated that quaternary phosphonium groups should be high-efficiency antifungal function groups, and meanwhile longer alkyl chain lengths or the stronger electron-withdrawing groups were responsible for enhanced antifungal versatility and efficacy. The cytotoxicity of starch and starch derivatives bearing quaternary phosphonium salts was evaluated in vitro on HEK- 293 T cells. As novel quaternary phosphoniuni functionalized starch derivatives could be prepared efficiently and exhibited superduper antifungal activity, this synthetic strategy might provide an effective way and notion to prepare novel antifungal biomaterials.
