5|$|The {{large and}} {{damaging}} tsunami that was generated {{was out of}} proportion relative {{to the size of}} the event, based on its short-period body wave magnitude. The Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency assigned a magnitude of 6.8, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a similar value of 6.1 (both body wave magnitude) that were calculated from short-period seismic waves (1–2 seconds in the case of the USGS). The USGS then presented <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> magnitude of 7.2 that was calculated from 5–100-second surface waves, and Harvard University subsequently revealed that <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> magnitude of 7.7 had been resolved based on even longer 150-second surface waves.|$|E
