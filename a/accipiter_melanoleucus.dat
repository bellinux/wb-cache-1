25|$|There are 2 {{subspecies}} of {{the black}} sparrowhawks: <b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus</b> melanoleucus, which was named by A. Smith in 1830, and <b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus</b> temminckii, which was named by Hartlaub in 1855. As described in the next section, the 2 subspecies occur in different regions of Africa and both belong to the genus Accipiter in the family Accipitridae along with other well-known members such as hawks and eagles, {{all of which are}} part of the Falconiformes order.|$|E
25|$|The black {{sparrowhawk}} (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus),</b> sometimes {{known as}} the black goshawk or great sparrowhawk, is the largest African member of the genus Accipiter. It occurs mainly in forests and non-desert areas south of the Sahara, particularly where there are large trees suitable for nesting; favored habitat includes suburban and human-altered landscapes. It preys predominantly on birds of moderate size, such as pigeons and doves, in suburban areas.|$|E

50|$|Within the Accipiter genus, the {{northern}} goshawk seems {{to belong to}} a superspecies with other larger goshawks from different portions of the world. Meyer's goshawk, found in the South Pacific, has been posited as the most likely to be most close related living cousin to {{the northern}} goshawk, the somewhat puzzling gap in their respective ranges explained by other Palearctic raptors such as Bonelli's eagles (Aquila fasciata) and short-toed eagles (Circaetus gallicus) that have extant isolated tropical island populations and were probably part of the same southwest Pacific radiation that led to the Meyer's goshawk. A presumably older radiation of this group occurred in Africa, where it led to both the Henst's goshawk of Madagascar and the black sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus)</b> of the mainland. While the Henst's goshawk quite resembles the northern goshawks, the black sparrowhawk is superficially described as a “sparrowhawk” due to its relatively much longer and finer legs than those of typical goshawks but overall its size and plumage (especially that of juveniles) is much more goshawk than sparrowhawk-like.|$|E
5000|$|Verreaux's eagle {{are easily}} {{capable of taking}} diverse prey but this is {{infrequent}} in areas with healthy rock hyrax populations. Cases where more diverse food is brought to the nest are usually either considered to be areas where rock hyrax populations have declined or areas where eagles occupy home ranges which included non-rocky habitat such as savanna, which are described by Valerie Gargett as “poor food areas” due to their lack of hyrax. [...] In such areas, about 80% of prey is mammalian. Verreaux's eagles that are less specialized have diets and hunting capacities {{that are similar to}} those of the golden eagle, although the latter species often subsists on hares, rabbits, ground squirrels or grouse for about half or two-thirds of its diet, a portion still comprised by rock hyrax in the Verreaux's. Other prey types recorded have included small (mainly juvenile) antelopes, hares, rabbits, meerkats (Suricata suricatta), other mongooses, monkeys, squirrels, cane rats, bushbabies and lambs (Ovis aries) and kids (Capra aegagrus hircus). Francolin (Francolinus ssp.) and guineafowl (Numina ssp.) as well as waterfowl, herons, egrets, bustards, pigeons, crows (Corvus ssp.), doves, chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and a great sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus)</b> have been the recorded avian prey. In Tanzania, out of a sample size of 41 from 26 nests, 53.7% of remains were of hyraxes, 29.3% of francolins, guineafowl and chickens, 12.2% of antelopes, 2.4% of hares and rabbits and 2.4% of mongoose. Tortoises made up 145 of 5748 from 73 sites (2.5%) in South Africa. Rarely, snakes and lizards may also be taken and even termites have been eaten by this species.|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Range {{shifts and}} {{expansions}} {{have been recorded}} {{in a number of}} species and it is expected that as climate change proceeds it will result in more species joining this trend. A major concern with these shifts is the suitability of the receiving novel environments, for example, if these areas experience different climatic conditions or prey phenology. One way to evaluate how expanding populations adapt to the environment is through evaluating their breeding patterns. In southern Africa, the Black sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus)</b> originally existed in Botswana, Mozambique, North Eastern and South Eastern South Africa and Zimbabwe...|$|E
40|$|As {{human populations}} have {{increased}} globally, so too has {{the transformation of}} natural landscapes into more urban areas. Within Africa, population growth rates and urbanization rates are amongst {{the highest in the}} world, but the impacts of these processes on Africa's wildlife are largely un-explored. In this study, we focus on a recently established population of black sparrowhawks <b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus</b> in Cape Town, South Africa. Using long-term data (16 years), we investigate the relationship between the timing of breeding and breeding performance along an urban-rural habitat gradient. We found no evidence for a direct effect of urbanization on either timing of breeding or breeding performance. However, we did find some evidence for a differential seasonal decline in breeding performance dependent on the levels of urbanization. Thus, higher productivity was found in more urbanized habitats earlier in the season, but {{towards the end of the}} breeding season, birds in less urbanized habitats performed better. Our study represents one of the first to examine avian productivity in relation to urbanization in Africa, and also represents one of the first studies to suggest that seasonal declines in productivity may differ according to levels of urbanization. These results have considerable implications for potential changes in phenology or productivity for the regions' avifauna as African urbanization continues...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} {{has different}} effects on species and communities, depending on {{a suite of}} life-history and population traits: some species are more vulnerable {{to the effects of}} fragmentation than others. Contrasting responses suggest there are particular species' attributes that make an organism more or less susceptible to the effects of fragmentation. Much research has focused on identifying which of these traits are the most useful indicators of a species' fragmentation-linked extinction risk. For example, body size, rarity, ecological specialization, matrix use, range size and turnover rate have all been linked with species extinction risk. Few studies have, however, attempted to explore the traits that predispose raptors to vulnerability from fragmentation. In this study, I compare the responses of two near-sympatric raptors (the Black Harrier Circus maurus and the Black Sparrowhawk <b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus)</b> to habitat fragmentation. On a broader scale, I use a simple model of susceptibility to fragmentation effects, and a sample of hawks (Accipiter spp) and harriers (Circus spp) in the family Accipitridae, to predict which species attributes are most likely to produce a negative response to habitat fragmentation. I then compare these predictions with the current global threat status of each species to test whether the model can predict threat status with acceptable accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Multiple-brooding (raising {{more than}} one brood of young in quick succession) occurs {{infrequently}} in raptors and is generally restricted to either smaller species with shorter nesting periods, co-operative breeders or species capable of capitalizing on conditions of prolonged food abundance whenever they occur. This paper presents the first recorded cases of multiplebrooding in the Black Sparrowhawk <b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus</b> from two distinct locales in South Africa. In the Western Cape (Cape Peninsula), four attempts to multiple-brood were recorded in four different years, involving three distinct pairs of birds, and in KwaZulu–Natal (Eshowe), three distinct pairs of Sparrowhawks successfully multiple-brooded on several occasions over a 5 -year study period. These results establish the Black Sparrowhawk as {{one of only two}} relatively large, monogamous raptor species, and the only specialist bird-eating raptor, in which multiple-brooding has been recorded with any frequency. The species’ capacity to thrive in human-modified environments (i. e. alien plantations) and particularly to exploit associated foraging opportunities (e. g. high densities of doves and pigeons in suburban areas) may, at least partly, account for the instances of multiple-brooding reported here. We suggest that biologists be more vigilant for cases of multiple-brooding in raptors, as it is possible that this trait is more common than originally thought and has previously been overlooked...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that genes coding for melanin based colouration may have pleiotropic properties, in particular conveying raised immune function. Thus adaptive function of polymorphism {{may be associated with}} parasite resistance. The black sparrowhawk <b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus</b> is a polymorphic raptor with two morphs. Over most of its range the light morph is commonest, however within the recently colonised Western Cape of South Africa the dark morph predominates. The species breeds in winter throughout South Africa, however unlike {{in the rest of the}} species ’ South African range, the Western Cape experiences a winter rainfall regime, where arthropod vectors which transmit haematozoan parasites may be more abundant. We hypothesise that the higher frequency of dark morph birds in this region may be due to their improved parasite resistance, which enables them to cope with higher parasite pressure. If so, we predict that dark morph black sparrowhawks would have lower parasite burdens than light morph birds. Within our population the prevalence of the two most common haematozoan parasites was high, with 72 % of adults infected with Haemoproteus nisi and 59 % of adults infected with Leucocytozoon toddi. We found no difference in prevalence for either parasite between adult morphs, or between chicks of different parental morphs. However, within adults infected with H. nisi, infection intensity was significantly higher in light morphs than dark morphs. This suggests that dark morphs have lower parasite loads than light morphs due to resistance rather than morph-specific habitat exploitation. Greater resistance to Haemoproteus parasites ma...|$|E
40|$|As {{trends in}} {{urbanisation}} continue globally, {{there is a}} growing need to understand the impacts of urban development on wildlife. Whilst urban impacts on patterns of diversity and abundance of species have been well-studied, there remains a distinct lack of understanding around the impacts on ecological interactions. Different species have different levels of tolerance to urban disturbance, some species even appear to thrive in urban areas and make use of human-subsidised resources; but the physiological costs and trade-offs faced by urban-dwelling species are poorly understood. Given that their range in South Africa has only recently expanded into the human-dominated landscapes of the Western Cape, the Black Sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus)</b> provides an excellent opportunity to explore some of these questions. In this study we explored how urbanisation may affect the health of this raptor on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. If the health of this species is negatively influenced by levels of urbanisation, this might be driven by differences in diet and prey availability across the urban spectrum. Thus, we explored this potential mechanism by examining diet composition and assessing prey abundance within different territories and habitat types. The health of nestling Black Sparrowhawks was evaluated through their immune response (Heterophil/Lymphocyte ratio in white blood cell counts), body condition (based on morphometric measurements) and blood parasite infection (presence and abundance of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon). Trends in diet composition along a gradient of urban cover were determined through the analysis of prey remains collected in the immediate nest surroundings and differences in prey abundance were determined through point counts in different habitat types...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} diet of {{breeding}} Black Sparrowhawks (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus)</b> on the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. Macro-remains of prey {{were collected from}} below and around the vicinity of nests throughout the breeding seasons of 2012 and 2013. These prey items were then identified down to species where possible {{through the use of}} a museum reference collection. In both years 85. 9 % of the individual remains were those of Columbidae, which corresponds with the only other diet study on Black Sparrowhawks. Redeyed Doves were the most common prey species, accounting for around 35 % of the diet’s biomass and 45 % of the prey items. Helmeted Guineafowl were also an important component of the diet for certain nests, making up on average 26. 4 % biomass of the diet. I found very little difference in diet between the different stages of breeding (pre-lay, incubation and nestling), despite the fact that females only contribute significantly during the nestling state and are considerably larger than the males. I also found little difference in the diet composition between pairs which bred either earlier or later in the year, despite productivity being significantly higher for earlier breeding pairs. However, a crude analysis of the overall diet per month revealed increased diet breadth in the early lay months as opposed to the later months. This was a result of fluctuations in the presence of Laughing Doves, Feral Pigeons and Helmeted Guineafowl, probably driven by those species breeding behaviour. Lastly, I also found no difference in the diet composition between pairs with either pure or mixed plumage morph compositions in this polymorphic species. This study provides further evidence to the claim that Black Sparrowhawks on the Cape Peninsula are benefiting from man-altered environments that provide perfect habitat for suitable prey...|$|E
40|$|Describing spatial {{patterns}} of phenotypic traits can {{be important for}} evolutionary and ecological studies. However, traditional approaches, such as fieldwork, can be time-consuming and expensive. Information technologies, such as Internet search engines, could facilitate the collection of these data. Google Images is one such technology that might offer an opportunity to rapidly collect information on spatial {{patterns of}} phenotypic traits. We investigated the use of Google Images in extracting data on geographical variation in phenotypic traits visible from photographs. We compared the distribution of visual traits obtained from Google Images with four previous studies: colour morphs of black bear (Ursus americanus); colouration and spottiness in barn owl (Tyto alba); colour morphs of black sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus)</b> {{and the distribution of}} hooded (Corvus corone) and carrion crows (Corvus cornix) across their European hybrid zone. Additionally, we develop and present a web application (Morphic), which facilitates the human data capture process of this method. We found good agreement between fieldwork data and Google Images data across all studies. Indeed, there was strong agreement between the data obtained from the original study and from the Google Images method for the colour morphs of black bear (R- 2 = 80 %) and for two barn owl plumage traits (R- 2 = 64 % and 53 %). Our approach also successfully matched the clinal variation of black sparrowhawks morphs across South Africa. Our method also gave a good agreement between the distribution of hooded and carrion crows (with 86 % placed on the correct side of the hybrid zone line). Our results suggest that this method can work well for visible traits of common and widespread species that are objective, binary, and easy to see irrespective of angle. The Google Images method is cost-effective and rapid and can be used with some confidence when investigating patterns of geographical variation, as well as a range of other applications. In many cases, it could therefore supplement or replace fieldwork...|$|E
40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) is a multigene family known {{to be the most}} variable gene group in vertebrates in terms of allelic diversity and gene number. Pathogen mediated selection is thought to be the major driving force behind the unusually high levels of MHC polymorphism in natural populations. In this study the relationship between MHC class I diversity and blood parasite infection intensity is explored in a population of black sparrowhawks (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>melanoleucus).</b> The species is of particular ecological and evolutionary interest as black sparrowhawks display a discrete polymorphism in plumage pattern across its range, occurring as a light and dark morph. It is well established in birds that carotenoïd and melanin-based pigmentation patterns are often associated with parasite resistance. In this study, functional variation at the peptide binding region (PBR) of MHC class I loci is investigated to explain individual variation in blood parasite infection in black sparrowhawks. Using DNA sequence data together with individual estimates of blood parasite load (for Haemoproteus nisi and Leucocytozoon toddi); the study tested the relationship between (i) allelic diversity and individual parasite load and (ii) specific alleles and individual parasite load using a Generalized Linear Model framework. Seven different, putatively functional, MHC class I alleles were identified. Number of alleles per individual ranged from one to three in individuals infected with H. nisi, whereas individuals infected with L. toddi had either two or three different alleles. A significant positive association was found between H. nisi infection intensity and MHC allele Acme_BF 2 * 03. No significant association was found between L. toddi infection intensity and a specific allele. The results reported support the role of pathogen mediated selection of genetic variation at evolutionary relevant MHC genes through rare allele advantage. By characterizing the variation at MHC class I loci and testing for a relationship with parasitemia, it is now possible to elucidate the mechanisms and significance of MHC molecular adaptation in the black sparrowhawk...|$|E
