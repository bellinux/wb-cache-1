40|$|Under the {{standard}} approach to UR discovery (Chomsky and Halle 1968; Kenstowicz and Kisseberth 1977), {{it is assumed}} that whenever possible, surface contrasts should be derived in a lawful way from underlying distinctions. In other words, if a surface contrast ([A] vs. [B]) can be distinguished using an underlying difference (/A / vs. /B/), this is preferable to using some other technique, such as marking all B’s with a diacritic (/A / vs. /A/+[A→B]) or using one UR (/A/) and listing all B’s as lexical exceptions. In its most extreme version, this bias has lead some analysts to posit abstract, underspecified <b>archiphonemes</b> to avoid listing exceptions. In this paper, I argue against this use of underspecification. I propose a more restrictive model of UR discovery, which cannot use underspecified <b>archiphonemes,</b> but relies instead on exceptions. I discuss two separate but related changes in the history of Lakhota which are unexpected under an underspecification account, but which are predicted by an exception-based analysis. 1 Introduction: two approaches to three-way contrasts It is a fundamental tenet of generative phonology that speakers learn words by setting up underlying forms that preserve as many of their contrastive phonological properties as possible.

30|$|The {{studies on}} the G 2 P often {{alternate}} between the term phone [8, 24] and the term phoneme [2], without any clarification on the perspective followed. We justify our option to adopt the term phoneme mainly, because the procedure to convert the letter into the sound brings us information that derives from {{the structure of the}} language (such as both left and right context which implies the choice of a single unit excluding all other units available in the language). The phoneme that corresponds to the grapheme is well accepted as a class to which may group all allophonic realizations able in EP (which could include all the multi pronunciations). We also considered that the phoneme conversion corresponds to the EP-standard.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Identificar o perfil de aquisição dos arquifonemas /N, L, S, R/ em posição de coda medial e final no Português Brasileiro em estudo {{transversal}} e longitudinal. MÉTODOS: Foram coletadas e analisadas do ponto de vista fonológico, amostras de fala de 170 crianças entre um ano e dois meses e três anos e oito meses de idade (estudo transversal), e de uma criança, G., acompanhada de um ano, um mês e vinte e dois dias até três anos, quatro meses e vinte e sete dias de idade (estudo longitudinal). RESULTADOS: No perfil transversal os dados obtidos mostraram a emergência precoce da sílaba travada (aos um ano e dois meses), com a aquisição completada aos três anos e oito meses. Os fonemas em coda final tenderam a emergir antes dos fonemas em coda medial, com poucas exceções. Os /L/ e o /N/ foram os primeiros sons nessa posição. Em seguida, observou-se a aquisição de /S/ e, por último, a de /R/. No panorama longitudinal a coda também emergiu cedo, coincidentemente ao um ano e dois meses, porém estava adquirida seis meses antes do que foi observado nos dados transversais, aos três anos e oito meses. A sílaba emergente continha o /N/ ao invés do /L/, como nos dados transversais. O /L/ foi o segundo fonema em coda, enquanto o /S/ continuou sendo mais precoce do que /R/, sendo esses dois fonemas os últimos segmentos a emergir como travamento silábico. Em todos os casos, os fonemas em coda final emergiram antes da coda medial, semelhante aos resultados transversais. CONCLUSÃO: A aquisição da coda mostrou padrões semelhantes, independente do tipo de estudo - longitudinal ou transversal. PURPOSE: To {{identify the}} acquisition {{profiles of the}} <b>archiphonemes</b> /N, L, S, R/ in medial and final coda position in Brazilian Portuguese in transversal and longitudinal studies. METHODS: Speech samples of 170 children with ages between one year and two months and three years and eight months (transversal study), as well as speech samples of a child, G., monitored from one year, one month and twenty two days to three years, four months and twenty seven days (longitudinal study), were collected and phonologically analyzed. RESULTS: In the transversal profile, data showed the early emergence of the blocked syllable (at one year and two months), and completion of the acquisition at three years and eight months. The phonemes in final coda tended to emerge before the ones in medial coda, with rare exceptions. The /L/ and the /N/ <b>archiphonemes</b> {{were the first to}} emerge in this position. After that, it was observed the /L/ acquisition, and, finally, the /R/ acquisition. In the longitudinal study, the coda also emerged early, coincidentally when the child was one year and two months old; however, it was acquired six months before what it was observed in the transversal data, at three years and eight months. The emerging syllable contained the /N/ rather than the /L/, as observed in the transversal data. The /L/ was the second phoneme in coda, while the /S/ was still earlier than the /R/, and these two phonemes were the last segments to emerge as a syllabic block. In all cases, the phonemes in final coda emerged before those in medial coda, similarly to the transversal results. CONCLUSION: The acquisition of the final coda showed similar profiles, regardless the type of study - longitudinal or transversal...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} a {{reconstruction of the}} development of the Germanic stress and syllabification system (as reflected in Gothic and Proto-Nordic) up to the completion of the quantity shift in Late Old Swedish. By means of current prosodic theory it is established that a domain of two moras wordinitially is present at all stages of development, in Gothic, Old English and Proto-Nordic as well as in Modem Swedish. It is argued that this domain is the linguistic instantiation of word minimality, referred to as the bimoraic condition. The bimoraic condition is interpreted over different prosodic categories - the prosodic word, the foot and finally the main-stress syllable - at different language stages. This development reflects the transition from a quantity system permitting light and overlong syllables to a system where the main-stress syllable is obligatorily heavy. Various prosodically conditioned changes and processes take place in the early Germanic dialects. New explanations are proposed for several of them in terms of prosodic theory. The vowel/glide alternation (Sievers’s law) in Gothic is derived from regular syllabification of the <b>archiphonemes</b> III and /U/. Syncope in Proto-Nordic (corresponding to high vowel deletion in Old English) is analysed as mora-deletion in metrically weak positions. Vowel shortening and nasal loss are also analyzed as mora-deletion following destressing under stress clash. The long-standing problem of delayed syncope (in Proto-Nordic) or absence of syncope (in Old English) in light stems is explained as a minimal word effect. The deletion rule in the so called second syncope period in Proto-Nordic is a case of vowel deletion (not mora-deletion). The patterning known as vowel balance is analyzed as the result of interaction between the general trend of reduction {{and the development of a}} particular balance prosody. In balance prosody one main-stress position (a unipositional foot) dominates two light syllables. This prosody is directly reflected as level stress on the surface. Rules that relate directly to the metrical configuration of balance are vowel strengthening (läsa > läså ’to read’), and vowel levelling (läså > låså). The latter rule is rendered as parametrized projection of features onto the stress unit, and the vowel patterns of vowel levelling are thereby given a principled description. Finally, the quantity shift in Old Swedish is discussed in detail. Balance - argued to be a Scandinavian innovation - is shown to be directly linked to the quantity shift. The loss of balance necessarily leads to the implementation of the quantity shift. Moreover, it is argued that the particular Central Scandinavian lengthening pattern involving both vowel and consonant lengthening (in roughly complementary contexts) is due to the (former) presence of balance. Finally, the theory predicts that the Modem Swedish quantity system emerging after the quantity shift depends on distinctive consonant quantity, rather than distinctive vowel quantity...|$|R
