The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened, mostly paralleling the railroad instead of following section lines, except for through Oronoque and Jennings. US-83 was a gravel road from Selden to the NortonPhillips county line, east of which the highway remained a dirt road until it was graveled in 1937. The highway was relocated straight through Jennings and to <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>with</b> fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938; that same year, the highway was paved with a bituminous surface along the US-36 concurrency. US-83 was paved from the US-36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940. The highway was paved from Selden to Dresden by 1945 and from Dresden to US-36 west of Norton in 1948. US-383 {{was assigned to the}} entire length of the K-383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945.|$|E

25|$|For every {{feasible}} set S in the antimatroid, {{and every}} element x of S, one {{may find a}} path subset of S for which x is an endpoint: to do so, remove {{one at a time}} elements other than x until no such removal leaves a feasible subset. Therefore, each feasible set in an antimatroid is the union of its path subsets. If S is not a path, each subset in this union is a proper subset of S. But, if S is itself <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>with</b> endpoint x, each proper subset of S that belongs to the antimatroid excludes x. Therefore, the paths of an antimatroid are exactly the sets that do not equal the unions of their proper subsets in the antimatroid. Equivalently, a given family of sets P forms the set of paths of an antimatroid if and only if, for each S in P, the union of subsets of S in P has one fewer element than S itself. If so, F itself is the family of unions of subsets of P.|$|E

25|$|For {{the second}} part, {{consider}} a shortest path P (there {{may be more}} than one) from source to u with at most i edges. Let v be the last vertex before u on this path. Then, the part of the path from source to v is a shortest path from source to v with at most i-1 edges, since if it were not, then there must be some strictly shorter path from source to v with at most i-1 edges, and we could then append the edge uv to this path to obtain <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>with</b> at most i edges that is strictly shorter than P -- a contradiction. By inductive assumption, v.distance after i−1 iterations is at most the length of this path from source to v. Therefore, uv.weight + v.distance is at most the length of P. In the ith iteration, u.distance gets compared with uv.weight + v.distance, and is set equal to it if uv.weight + v.distance was smaller. Therefore, after i iterations, u.distance is at most the length of P, i.e., the length of the shortest path from source to u that uses at most i edges.|$|E
