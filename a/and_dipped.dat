5|$|None of {{them knew}} {{the color of the}} sky. Their eyes glanced level, and were {{fastened}} upon the waves that swept toward them. These waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea. The horizon narrowed and widened, <b>and</b> <b>dipped</b> and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.|$|E

5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet <b>and</b> <b>dipped</b> into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{ceremony}} began, King Edward VIII, present {{in his capacity}} as king of Canada, inspected the guard of honour, was introduced to the honoured guests, and spent approximately half an hour speaking with veterans in the crowd. Two Royal Air Force and two French Air Force squadrons flew over the monument <b>and</b> <b>dipped</b> their wings in salute. The ceremony itself began with prayers from chaplains representing the Church of England, the United Church of Canada, and the Roman Catholic Church. Ernest Lapointe, Canadian Minister of Justice, spoke first, followed by Edward VIII who, in both French and English, thanked France for its generosity and assured those assembled that Canada would never forget its war missing and dead. The King then pulled the Royal Union Flag from the central figure of Canada Bereft and the military band played the Last Post. The ceremony was one of the King's few official duties before he abdicated the throne. The pilgrimage continued, and most participants toured Ypres before being taken to London to be hosted by the British Legion. One-third of the pilgrims left from London for Canada on 1 August, while the majority returned to France as guests of the government for another week of touring before going home.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, David E. Hone and Thomas R. Holtz {{pointed out}} that (like other theropods) {{there was no reason}} to believe that the forelimbs of Baryonyx were able to pronate, and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for {{locomotion}} may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but if this was the norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. They suggested that the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or to reach some kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded <b>and</b> <b>dipped</b> in water rather than submerging themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations.|$|E
50|$|Another way of {{representing}} strike <b>and</b> <b>dip</b> is by <b>dip</b> <b>and</b> <b>dip</b> direction. The dip direction is the azimuth {{of the direction}} the dip as projected to the horizontal (like the trend of a linear feature in trend and plunge measurements), which is 90° off the strike angle. For example, a bed dipping 30° to the South, would have an East-West strike (and would be written 090°/30° S using strike <b>and</b> <b>dip),</b> but would be written as 30/180 using the <b>dip</b> <b>and</b> <b>dip</b> direction method.|$|R

25|$|The {{details of}} the {{struggle}} are explicit in the Bibliotheca: realizing {{that he could not}} defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew Iolaus for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by Athena) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. The Hydra's one immortal head was cut off with a golden sword given to Heracles by Athena. Heracles placed the headstill alive and writhingunder a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius, <b>and</b> <b>dipped</b> his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood.

25|$|This statue to {{the right}} speaks well for the {{equality}} of gender in ancient Egypt that a private lady could have a sculpture made for herself. The heavy tripartite wig frames the broad face and passes behind the ears, thus giving the impression of forcing them forward. They are large {{in keeping with the}} ancient Egyptian ideal of beauty; the same ideal required small breasts, and also in this respect the sculpture is no exception. Whereas the natural curve of the eyebrows dips towards the root of the nose, the artificial eyebrows in low relief are absolutely straight above the inner corners of the eyes, a feature which places the bust early in Dynasty XII. Around 1900 B.C. these artificial eyebrows, too, began to follow the natural curve <b>and</b> <b>dipped</b> toward the nose.|$|E

His European debut resulted in a victory at the Miners Day Meeting in Velenje. He ran at his first Diamond League race soon after and his personal best time of 8:11.31 minutes (for fifth at the Meeting Areva in Paris) ranked him thirteenth in the world that year, marking him out as one of Kenya's emerging talents. He won at the Barcelona Meeting and fifth at the DN Galan Diamond League. In his senior debut for Kenya, at the age of eighteen, he came fourth behind an Ethiopian trio in the steeplechase at the 2011 All-Africa Games.|$|E
500|$|The Wujing Zongyao records {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} gunpowder weapons such as incendiary projectiles, smoke bombs, fire arrows, and grenades.

40|$|Oceania Rivers are {{hotspots}} of high DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) <b>and</b> <b>DIP</b> (dissolved inorganic phosphorus) transport. However, {{the effects}} of hydrologic controls and land use alternation on the temporal variations of DIN <b>and</b> <b>DIP</b> are rarely documented. In this study, we monitored the nitrate and phosphate concentrations from three headwater catchments with different cultivation gradients at a 3 -day interval. This sampling scheme was supplemented with a 3 -h interval monitoring during typhoon periods. The {{results showed that the}} DIN <b>and</b> <b>DIP</b> yields in the pristine, moderately cultivated, and intensively cultivated watersheds were 7. 52 / 0. 31, 31. 17 / 0. 30, and 40. 96 / 0. 52 kg ha&minus; 1 yr&minus; 1 , respectively. The high DIN yields are comparable to the intensively and extensively disturbed large rivers around the world. These N yields may be due to a high level of nitrogen deposition, rainfall-runoff, and fertilizer application. The importance of event sampling was indicated by the contribution of the three typhoons to the annual DIN <b>and</b> <b>DIP</b> fluxes, which were 30 % and 60 %, respectively. Both DIN <b>and</b> <b>DIP</b> fluxes significantly increased as the cultivation gradient increased. The DIN <b>and</b> <b>DIP</b> ratio varied from 54 to 230 depending on the decrease of the cultivation gradient. This value is higher than the global mean of ~ 18. Thus, we speculate that nitrogen saturation occurs in the headwater catchments of Oceania Rivers. The results obtained provide fundamental clues of DIN <b>and</b> <b>DIP</b> yield of Oceania Rivers, which are helpful in understanding the impact of human disturbance on headwater watersheds...|$|R

Principal photography for The Quick and the Dead lasted from November 21, 1993 to February 27, 1994. Locations included Old Tucson Studios in Arizona and Mescal, 40 miles southeast of Tucson. Production was briefly halted at times over weather problems. Thell Reed, who was hired as the gun coach and weapons master, worked with the cast through over three months of training. To age Cort's Colt 1851 Navy Revolver and the other guns used, Reed experimented with simple measures.

500|$|At least 89 {{species of}} rodent, mostly Hystricomorpha such as guinea pigs, agoutis and capybaras, are eaten by humans; in 1985, {{there were at}} least 42 {{different}} societies in which people eat rats. Guinea pigs were first raised for food around 2500 B.C. and by 1500 B.C. had become the main source of meat for the Inca Empire. Dormice were raised by the Romans in special pots called [...] "gliraria", or in large outdoor enclosures, where they were fattened on walnuts, chestnuts, and acorns. The dormice were also caught from the wild in autumn when they were fattest, and either roasted <b>and</b> <b>dipped</b> into honey or baked while stuffed with a mixture of pork, pine nuts, and other flavorings. Researchers found that in Amazonia, where large mammals were scarce, pacas and common agoutis accounted for around 40 percent of the annual game taken by the indigenous people, but in forested areas where larger mammals were abundant, these rodents constituted only about 3 percent of the take.|$|E
500|$|Since {{at least}} 1938, Jefferis had been {{toying with the}} idea of a {{demolition}} or anti-tank weapon that would be ideal for irregular warfare. It would work by having an explosive charge deform so that it had a substantial area of intimate contact with the surface of the target. Then, when detonated, the effect of the explosion would be focused on a small area and would rupture an armoured plate much thicker than would otherwise be the case. Sappers call such a device a [...] "poultice" [...] or [...] "squash head" [...] charge. Jefferis enlisted Drs Bauer and Schulman of the Colloid Science Department of Cambridge University, they experimented with lengths of bicycle inner tube filled with plasticine to represent the explosive. These were fitted with wooden handles <b>and</b> <b>dipped</b> in rubber solution to make them sticky. In experiments, these prototypes proved difficult to aim and only by chance did any stick to the metal bins used to represent tanks.|$|E
