5|$|Stephen Morris {{has said}} that even without Curtis's suicide, it was {{unlikely}} that Joy Division would have endured as they were. The members of Joy Division had made a pact long before Curtis's death that, should any member leave, the remaining members would change the name of the group. Eventually renaming themselves New Order, the band was reborn as a three-piece with Sumner assuming vocal duties; the group later recruited Morris's girlfriend Gillian Gilbert to round out the line-up as keyboardist and second guitarist. Starting as a member of punk group The Inadequates, Gilbert had become friends with the band's members and had played guitar at <b>a</b> <b>Joy</b> Division performance when Curtis had been unable to play.|$|E

When Paul wants {{to pull out of}} the deal, he is taken to the bush and beaten up. Paul escapes and falls down a cliff, badly {{breaking}} his leg. While Paul recovers in hospital, his leg becomes infected and is amputated. Paul's sister, Lucy, encourages him to make a proper home for himself in Erinsborough and he moves into Number 22. Paul begins a relationship with Izzy and his estranged daughter Elle moves in.

5|$|Roman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers {{regarded}} Christian ethics as {{closer to}} the virtue ethics of Aristotle than Kant's ethics. He presented virtue ethics as freedom for excellence, which regards freedom as acting in accordance with nature to develop one's virtues. Initially, this requires following rules—but the intention is that the agent develop virtuously, and regard acting morally as <b>a</b> <b>joy.</b> This is in contrast with freedom of indifference, which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant. On this view, freedom is set against nature: free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions. There is no development or progress in an agent's virtue, merely the forming of habit. This is closer to Kant's view of ethics, because Kant's conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by their emotions, and is set in contrast with Pinckaer's conception of Christian ethics.|$|E

25|$|Among Sephardi Jews, prayers {{known as}} Selichot (forgiveness) are recited before the regular morning service (these {{are the same}} prayers recited before Rosh Hashanah). In the {{different}} prayers of this day, Syrian Jews pray in the same maqam (melody) as on the high holidays. In Amsterdam {{and in a few}} places in England, America, and elsewhere, the shofar is also sounded in connection with the processions.

Because Hoshanah Rabbah is also linked to the high holidays as well as being <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> filled day some Hasidic communities such as Satmar have the custom of having Birchat Cohanim/Priestly Blessing recited during the Mussaf service.

25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E
25|$|The great England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans was on {{his fourth}} tour of Australia, having visited before in 1946-47, 1950–51 and 1954-55. He was chosen in part for his batting, having made centuries against the West Indies and India, but his loud and {{enthusiastic}} wicketkeeping was <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> to watch and considered {{by far the best}} in the world. When he returned to England in 1959 he missed three stumpings in fifteen minutes against India and retired from Test cricket as he no longer met his own exacting standards, but his record number of dismissals in Test cricket remained unbeaten for eighteen years. The Marylebone Cricket Club preferred to rotate their reserve wicket-keepers and in 1958-59 it was the turn of the reserve Surrey keeper Roy Swetman. He was by far the shortest man in the team and looked only 17, but was in fact 25. Although a good man behind the stumps and a decent lower order batsman he was not Evans and lost his England place in 1960. In 1956 England had out-fielded and out-caught Australia and they were still a strong fielding team. Colin Cowdrey would be the first slip fielder to take 100 Test catches, Peter May and Tom Graveney were good slips and Ted Dexter an athletic cover. Fred Trueman was a good close field and Tony Lock was considered the greatest backward short leg in the world and one of the safest pair of hands in cricket. Peter Richardson, Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey were good all round fielders, though the latter two were slowing {{down at the end of}} their careers.|$|E
