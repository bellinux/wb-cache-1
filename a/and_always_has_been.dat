500|$|According to Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, the {{cancellation}} of the wide release {{was a response to}} the refusal of cinema chains to screen the film, not the hackers' threats, and that Sony would seek other ways to distribute the film. Sony released a statement saying that the company [...] "is <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> strongly committed to the First Amendment ... Free expression should never be suppressed by threats and extortion." ...|$|E
500|$|Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{gave the}} song a mixed review, {{calling it a}} [...] "campy piano flare-up", but criticizing French Montana's appearance, calling it [...] "as inexplicable as the song itself." [...] Marah Eakin of The A.V. Club {{described}} it as [...] "EDM-aping". She further stated that the song [...] "seems perfect for the album, rather than just thrown in {{to stay with the}} times." [...] Channing Freeman from Sputnikmusic praised Cyrus' vocals, writing, [...] "the chorus is so good, with a pulsing beat that allows Miley plenty of room to show off her voice (which is <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> lovely)" [...] although criticized the lyrics.|$|E

A low-built heroon or shrine memorial to an unknown local hero survived intact; the contents are in the museum. [...] Numerous tombs have been excavated outside the walls.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the one-year}} {{anniversary of the}} attack, it was {{reported}} that a number of survivors were accusing San Bernardino County of cutting off support for them. This included a lack of access to counseling or antidepressant medication, the injured attempting to get surgeries approved and physical therapy covered, a lack of assistance in dealing with a complex compensation workers' program, and health insurers refusing to cover injuries because they occurred during an act of workplace violence. A county spokesman denied the accusations and said, [...] "The county is, <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been,</b> committed to ensuring our employees get all the care they need." ...|$|E
2500|$|According {{to events}} that played out and stance {{taken by the}} Indian army, Operation Brasstacks was only an {{exercise}} and {{not supposed to be}} a provocative one. The media, particularly the western media, was involved after this and intense diplomatic manoeuvres followed preventing any further escalation in hostilities. On multiple occasions, General Sunderji maintained that: [...] "This was, is <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a training exercise. I can't answer why there have been misperceptions about it in some quarters." [...] India repeatedly charged Pakistan with its continuing scientific research on atomic bombs, which Pakistan sharply continued to reject the claims. A few days later, Dr. A.Q. Khan also rejected any statements issued regarding the atomic bomb development and since said [...] "his comments were taken out of context." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morgan (played by Armie Hammer) - He {{is the son}} of The Devil, and Sam's (alleged) {{paternal}} half brother. He first {{appears in}} [...] "The Favorite", where the Devil bails him out of jail using Sam's lottery winnings. He was arrested for stealing a limousine. He drives a silver Maserati, which was a gift from his ex. Morgan is very self-centered and lazy telling Sam that he has no qualms in fighting Sam to the death for The Devil's right hand seat and would wait for him to mess up to get his dad's favor. Since The Devil feels that Morgan is unmotivated, he orders Sam to take Morgan on a reap in the hopes that Sam's good work ethics rub off. While Morgan is <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the Devil's favorite of the 2 sons so far introduced (Sam and Morgan) he is growing increasingly unsure of the situation, because while Morgan behaves as the Devil would like, he has little to no desire to work. [...] Sam, in contrast, though he regularly complains and defies the Devil, always [...] "gets the job done." [...] In [...] "The Good Soil," [...] he attempts to bribe Sam with money into capturing a soul and giving him the credit. He takes back his money after Sam turns in the dodgeball vessel with a corpse and later in the episode captures the soul himself with the vessel. In [...] "The Home Stretch", The Devil challenges Sam and Morgan to a contest, in which whoever returned the soul back to Hell would become his right-hand man. When Sam accidentally wins the contest, The Devil takes everything from Morgan, and he swears revenge against Sam. In a rage, Morgan pulls a gun on Sam, but is killed by Nina and other surrounding demons, and sent straight to Hell. The Devil has stated that he is repeatedly crying out Sam's name whilst being tortured.|$|E

2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been.</b> I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E
