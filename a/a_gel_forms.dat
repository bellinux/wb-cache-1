50|$|Pregelatinized starch may {{be added}} to {{increase}} the rate of starch gelatinization. One method of pregelatinization starts by heating a mixture of starch and water until <b>a</b> <b>gel</b> <b>forms.</b> The gel may be placed on a heated roll in a thin layer in order to dry it. Once all the water has been removed, a starch cake is left on the roll. The cake is then scraped off and pulverized to form a powder. When the pregelatinized starch powder is subjected to water, <b>a</b> <b>gel</b> <b>forms.</b> The pregelatinized starch increases water adsorption. This in turn increases the batter viscosity and helps retain the entrapped air while the batter is prepared and as it starts to bake. The gel is not as strong has {{it would be if}} a normal starch was mixed with water and heated. However, the combination of pregelatinized starch and starch in the wheat flour create an acceptable gel together. Typically corn starch is used, however a variety of other starches also work.|$|E
50|$|Nickel citrate {{complexes}} {{are found}} in leaves of some nickel accumulating plant species in New Caledonia such as Pycnandra acuminata. Citrate complexes include NiHcit, NiHcit23−, Nicit−, Nicit24−, and Ni2H2cit24−. (ordered from low to high pH). Also there is Ni4H4cit35−. Nickel citrate is important in nickel plating.

40|$|Alginate {{is a type}} of {{polysaccharide}} {{that occurs}} naturally in all brown algae as a skeletal component of their cell walls. Alginate is used in food because it is a powerful thickening, stabilizing, and gel-forming agent. Some foods that may include alginate are ice cream, fruit-fi lled snacks, salad dressings, pudding, onion rings, and even the pimento strips that are stuffed into green olives. Most alginate used in foods {{is in the form of}} sodium alginate. In order to form a gel, sodium alginate needs to come into contact with divalent ions such as calcium (Ca 2 +). As soon as sodium alginate (Figure 1) is added to a solution of calcium chloride, <b>a</b> <b>gel</b> <b>forms</b> as the sodium ions (Na+) are exchanged with calcium ions (Ca 2 +) and the polymers become crosslinked (Figure 2). The calcium ions are able to crosslink the alginate polymers because they can form two bonds, as opposed to monovalent ions such as sodium, which can only form one bond. The longer the alginate is in contact with the calcium chloride solution, the more rigid the gel will become, as more crosslinks are formed. Also, depending on the concentration of calcium ions, the gels are either thermoreversible (low concentrations) or not (high concentrations) ...|$|E

40|$|Desmin is a 50, 000 -mol wt {{protein that}} is enriched along with 100 -/ ~ {{filaments}} in chicken gizzard {{that has been}} extracted with 1 M KI. Although 1 M KI removes most of the actin from gizzard, {{a small fraction of}} this protein remains persistently insoluble, along with desmin. The solubility properties of this actin are the same as for desmin: they are both insoluble in high salt concentrations, but are solubilized at low pH or by agents that dissociate hydrophobic bonds. Desmin may be purified by repeated cycles of solubilization by 1 M acetic acid and subsequent precipitation by neutralization to pH 4. During this process, a constant nonstoichiometric ratio of actin to desmin is attained. Gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 34 in the presence of 0. 5 % Sarkosyl NL- 97 reveals nonmonomeric fractions of actin and desmin that comigrate through the column. Gel filtration on Bio-Gel P 300 in the presence of 1 M acetic acid reveals that the majority of desmin is monomeric under these conditions.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{investigation of a}} model clay dispersion in 1 - 1 salt solutions by varying the particle volume fraction and ionic strength {{as well as the}} charge distribution on the clay platelets. The platelets are modeled as discs with charged sites distributed on a hexagonal lattice. The edge sites can be positively charged while the remaining sites are negative giving rise to a strong charge anisotropy. Simulations are carried out using a Monte Carlo method in the canonical ensemble. The interactions between the platelet sites are described with a screened Coulomb potential plus a short range repulsive potential. Simulations show a complex phase behavior. When the charge anisotropy is strong, i. e. all edge sites are positively charged, a fluid phase dominated by repulsion is found at low volume fraction and ionic strength. When increasing the latter an attractive liquid phase forms. At these volume fractions the platelets aggregate in an ''Overlapping Coins'' configuration. With increasing volume fraction the dispersion becomes unstable and the pressure goes through a van der Waals loop. A liquid crystalline phase, Smectic B, forms in the thermodynamically unstable region. On {{the other side of the}} van der Waals loop a stable gel phase is found. A phase separation between a fluid and a gel is thus predicted. The threshold value of the volume fraction at which the phase separation occurs is found to increase with the salt concentration. The gel structure is a mixture of ''Overlapping Coins'' and ''House of Cards'' configurations. When the charge anisotropy is intermediate, no phase separation occurs. Instead, <b>a</b> <b>gel</b> <b>forms</b> from a sol of clusters of individual particles randomly oriented that progressively grow with the volume fraction.
