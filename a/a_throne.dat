5|$|The keep {{was inside}} the inner bailey and {{contained}} the king's accommodation. It had two rooms: an antechamber and an audience room. While Allen Brown interpreted the audience room as the king's chamber, historian Liddiard believes it is probably <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> room. <b>A</b> <b>throne</b> room emphasises the political importance of the castle. In England there is nothing similar to Château Gaillard's keep, but there are buildings with a similar design in France in the 12th and 13th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Adrienne {{visits the}} nearly 110-year-old Malcolm Wyrmshadow (Douglas Seale), {{who had been}} Carno's {{apprentice}} as a young boy. Malcolm reveals that Carno met his demise after his last wife, Marie (Traci Clauson), discovered he was a murderer. Marie conspired with her lover, Gaston (Jeff Rector), to kill Carno by sabotaging the equipment for his most infamous and dangerous escapology trick, in which Carno dons a burning hood and escapes from bonds on <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> underneath a swinging axe. The sabotage leaves Carno horribly burned and disfigured, but he survives and viciously attacks Marie and Gaston. After killing Marie by beheading her, Carno is killed by Gaston, who then succumbs to his own wounds.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} Adventure, {{the player}} reaches an island called Maxwell's Island with a hall {{belonging}} to Maxwell on it. The player finds Maxwell trapped in <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> encircled by short stone pillars. The player is at first unable to free him, but finds a keyhole, {{as well as a}} key nearby. The player sets Maxwell free, but he turns into a skeleton and disintegrates as soon as he stands up. The ghostly arms from the trailer then grab the player and ensnare them in the throne. An epilogue implies that the player will take on a villainous role similar to Maxwell's using newfound powers given by the throne, but will nonetheless be trapped forever.|$|E
5|$|From 1881 on, Pedro II's health began failing. He {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} public affairs as time passed. Weary of being tied to <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> which he doubted would survive his death, he persevered out of duty {{and because there}} seemed no immediate alternative. Nor did his daughter and heir, Isabel, exhibit a desire to assume the crown. Both, however, were overwhelmingly beloved by the Brazilian people, who still supported the monarchy. The indifference towards the Imperial system by the Emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to grow more audacious and to eventually launch the coup that overthrew the Empire.|$|E

5|$|Karan Mahal (Public Audience Hall) {{was built}} by Karan Singh in c.1680 to mark his victory over the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most exquisite palaces built with gardens, which displays the aesthetic sensibilities of the royalty of Rajasthan. It has stained glass windows and intricately carved balconies built in stone and wood fluted columns. Later Rajas, Anup Singh and Surat Singh, also added lot of glitter to this palace with inlaid polychrome glass, intricate mirror patterns, and red and gold paint.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of a colossal head at Tres Zapotes {{in the nineteenth century}} spurred the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture by Matthew Stirling in 1938. Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán were re-carved from massive stone thrones. An additional monument, at Takalik Abaj in Guatemala, is <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> that may have been carved from a colossal head. This is the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.|$|E

The occupier of the tomb is not known with certainty, he is called {{the lord of the}} goats by archaeologists due to the existence of <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> decorated with bronze goat heads in the tomb. A silver cup that has the name of king Immeya inscribed was found in the tomb making that king the most likely owner of the burial.|$|E

During his time in Gaul Wilfrid was exposed to a higher level of ceremony than that practised in Northumbria, one example of which is that he was carried to his consecration ceremony on <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> supported by nine bishops.|$|E

5|$|An icon of Saints Marina and Jovan Vladimir, dated 1711, {{is part of}} the iconostasis of the Monastery of StNaum near Ohrid {{in western}} Macedonia. The icon's {{position}} on the iconostasis indicates that Vladimir was an important figure of local veneration. He was often depicted in the company of Saints Clement and Naum in Macedonian churches. A number of 18th-century painters from central and southern Albania painted the saint in churches of the region, especially in the area of Moscopole. A portable icon of the saint was created in 1739 at the Ardenica Monastery in southwestern Albania. It depicts him seated on <b>a</b> <b>throne,</b> surrounded by twelve panels showing scenes of his life and miracles. Saint Jovan Vladimir is represented on frescos in three monasteries of Mount Athos: Hilandar, Zograf, and Philotheou; and three Bulgarian monasteries: Rila, Troyan, and Lozen.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Ross Williamson cites a {{tale about}} St. Collen, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the summit of the Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is made of glass so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart from the summit of the Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, Spain gave Louisiana back to France in {{exchange}} for the promise of <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> in central Italy. Although the agreement was signed on October 1, 1800, it did not go into effect until 1802. The following year, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the United States. Many of the Spaniards who had moved to the colony left for Texas, Florida, or other Spanish-held lands. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions in the documents were ambiguous and contradictory. Even when both territories had been under Spanish control, there was disagreement on where the border should be. In 1793, the King of Spain decided that {{there was no need to}} move the boundary from Natchitoches to the Sabine River, as had been recommended by some Frenchmen.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{imposing}} palaces {{were built}} in the main Mycenaean centers of the mainland. The earliest palace structures were megaron-type buildings, such as the Menelaion in Sparta, Lakonia. Palaces proper are datable from c. 1400 BC, when Cyclopean fortifications were erected at Mycenae and nearby Tiryns. Additional palaces {{were built in}} Midea and Pylos in Peloponnese, Athens, Eleusis, Thebes and Orchomenos in Central Greece and Iolcos, in Thessaly, the latter being the northernmost Mycenaean center. Knossos in Crete became also a Mycenaean center, where the former Minoan complex underwent a number of adjustments, including the addition of <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> room. These centers were based on a rigid network of bureaucracy where administrative competencies were classified into various sections and offices according to specialization of work and trades. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax (Linear B: wa-na-ka) in Mycenaean Greek terms. All powers were vested in him, as the main landlord and spiritual and military leader. At the same time he was an entrepreneur and trader and was aided by a network of high officials.|$|E

5|$|The holy hill {{is drawn}} in the {{backdrop}} with four faces painted with different colors – the east face is in crystal white color, the south face is yellow, {{the west is}} in red color and the north has green color. The palace has four sides and eight corners with its lower and upper tiers adorned with jewels. The courtyard with four enclosures is said to represent four kinds of conduct. The walls are built with bricks, balconies have been bejewelled with religious symbols. The ambience {{is shown in the}} form of wishing trees, fountains of the water of life, rain bows in five colors with cloud formations and light emanating from lotus flowers. The palace is also shown with <b>a</b> <b>throne</b> with eight corners fully and curiously bejewelled.
