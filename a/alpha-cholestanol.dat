40|$|P>The cyp 125 gene of Rhodococcus jostii RHA 1 was {{previously}} {{found to be}} highly upregulated during growth on cholesterol and the orthologue in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (rv 3545 c) has been implicated in pathogenesis. Here we show that cyp 125 is essential for R. jostii RHA 1 to grow on 3 -hydroxysterols such as cholesterol, but not on 3 -oxo sterol derivatives, and that CYP 125 performs an obligate first step in cholesterol degradation. The involvement of cyp 125 in sterol side-chain degradation was confirmed by disrupting the homologous gene in Rhodococcus rhodochrous RG 32, a strain that selectively degrades the cholesterol side-chain. The RG 32 Omega cyp 125 mutant failed to transform the side-chain of cholesterol, but degraded that of 5 -cholestene- 26 -oic acid- 3 beta-ol, a cholesterol catabolite. Spectral analysis revealed that while purified ferric CYP 125 (RHA 1) was < 10 % in the low-spin state, cholesterol (K(D) app = 0. 20 +/- 0. 08 mu M), 5 <b>alpha-cholestanol</b> (K(D) app = 0. 15 +/- 0. 03 mu M) and 4 -cholestene- 3 -one (K(D) app = 0. 20 +/- 0. 03 mu M) further reduced the low spin character of the haem iron consistent with substrate binding. Our data indicate that CYP 125 is involved in steroid C 26 -carboxylic acid formation, catalysing the oxidation of C 26 either to the corresponding carboxylic acid or to an intermediate state...|$|E
