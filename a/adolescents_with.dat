5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and <b>adolescents</b> <b>with</b> intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and <b>adolescents</b> <b>with</b> {{many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured children and adolescents need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to reveal the role of SIT (Social Interaction Technology) in promoting social competence in <b>adolescent</b> <b>with</b> visual impairments since the phenomena of social interaction technology have a very broad impact, especially in adolescent, since orientation toward peers and immersion in friendship plays a major roles in adolescent's life (Brown, 1989; 1990; Coleman, 1980). With the presence of technology such as mobile phones, emails, facebook and twitter, the means for fostering friendship become more widespread. Research in typically developed adolescent showed that SITs are used as a tool to maintain relationships and as a tool to socialize, especially for girls (Jennings & Wartella, 2004; Lenhart, Rainie & Lewis, 2001). We expected that SIT have the same means in improving social competencies in <b>adolescent</b> <b>with</b> blindness since <b>adolescent</b> <b>with</b> blindness may experience problems in relating with others and may influence their psychosocial development (Kef, I 999;Sacks & Wolfe, 2006).

40|$|M. Ed. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} study was to conduct Narrative Therapy <b>with</b> an <b>adolescent</b> <b>with</b> cerebral palsy and a cognitive disability, to determine his experience of the disability. The study was motivated {{by the fact that}} no research has been conducted in South Africa on therapy <b>with</b> <b>adolescents</b> living <b>with</b> cerebral palsy and cognitive disability. The reason being that it was believed that a client needs to have the cognitive ability for therapeutic change to occur. Recent international research has proved that therapy can be successful with clients with cognitive disabilities, if the approach or techniques are on the client’s cognitive developmental level. The goal of the study was firstly to give a voice to a seventeen-year-old <b>adolescent</b> <b>with</b> cerebral palsy and a cognitive disability to tell his story. Secondly, to determine what internal resources he has to help him cope with the disability. Lastly, to make recommendations for other therapists who want to conduct therapy <b>with</b> <b>adolescents</b> living <b>with</b> disabilities. A qualitative research approach with a single case study as research design from a selected sample was used. A qualitative approach is useful in studies where the meaning individuals give to there experience are investigated. The focus is on a seventeen-year-old <b>adolescent</b> <b>with</b> cerebral palsy and a cognitive disability and his experience of the disability. The researcher as therapist uses Narrative Therapy to describe and document the adolescent’s experience. Data was gathered through a variety of techniques (interviews, Narrative therapy sessions, observations and therapeutic letters), which enhanced the reliability of the study. The researcher was also the therapist who conducted Narrative Therapy and she had the opportunity to explore and describe the adolescent’s experience. From the data, certain themes and sub-themes were identified that highlighted aspects of living with a disability. Me. H. Krig...|$|R
