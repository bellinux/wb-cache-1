40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a system that {{automatically}} extracts the pros <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> from online reviews. Although many approaches {{have been developed for}} extracting opinions from text, our focus here is on extracting the reasons of the opinions, which may themselves be in the form of either fact or opinion. Leveraging online review sites with author-generated pros <b>and</b> <b>cons,</b> we propose a system for aligning the pros <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> to their sentences in review texts. A maximum entropy model is then trained on the resulting labeled set to subsequently extract pros <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> from online review sites that do not explicitly provide them. Our experimental results show that our resulting system identifies pros <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> with 66 % precision and 76 % recall. ...|$|R
5000|$|This core {{construct}} [...] "reflects the individual's relative weighing of {{the pros}} <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> of changing". Decision making was conceptualized by Janis and Mann as a [...] "decisional balance sheet" [...] of comparative potential gains and losses. Decisional balance measures, the pros <b>and</b> the <b>cons,</b> have become critical constructs in the transtheoretical model. The pros <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> combine {{to form a}} decisional [...] "balance sheet" [...] of comparative potential gains and losses. The balance between the pros <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> varies depending on which stage of change the individual is in.|$|R

Raspe probably met Hieronymus von Münchhausen while studying at the University of Göttingen, and may even {{have been invited to}} dine with him at the mansion at Bodenwerder. Raspe's later career mixed writing and scientific scholarship with theft and swindling; when the German police issued advertisements for his arrest in 1775, he fled continental Europe and settled in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} been {{supported}} by editorials in newspapers, including The New York Times, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, and the Minneapolis Star Tribune, arguing that the existing system discourages voter turnout and leaves emphasis on only a few states and a few issues, while a popular election would equalize voting power. Others have argued against it, including the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. An article by Pierre S. du Pont, IV, a former governor of Delaware, in the opinion section of The Wall Street Journal has called the project an urban power grab that would shift politics entirely to urban issues in high population states and allow lower caliber candidates to run. A collection of readings pro <b>and</b> <b>con</b> has been assembled by the League of Women Voters.|$|E

40|$|A {{face seal}} model is analyzed, {{taking into account}} both {{diametral}} tilt <b>and</b> <b>coning</b> of the primary seal ring.

Seal performance like axial force, tilting moment, axial and angular stiffness, and leakage are analyzed. It is found that interaction between diametral tilt <b>and</b> <b>coning</b> strongly affects seal performance...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The Transtheoretical Model of {{behavior}} change (TTM) postulates that behavior {{change is a}} process involving progress through five distinct stages of change (SOC). One of the key components for progress to a later stage is decisional balance (pros <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> of changing to the target behavior). The goal {{of the present study}} is to test the two dimensions of decisional balance as postulated in the TTM in the context of exercising behavior. METHODS: The analyses are based on data from an online survey of 266 freshman students at the University of Zurich; participants self-reported their frequency of exercising and their weighing of the importance of 49 pros <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> of exercising. RESULTS: The results indicate that a two-dimensional solution of decisional balance is insufficient. The analysis of pros <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> of exercising yielded a seven-factor solution with in part different progressions through the SOC. CONCLUSIONS: With the subdivision into different pros <b>and</b> <b>cons,</b> intervention programs can be developed that better match the needs of participants in terms of fostering and decreasing the most important pros <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> of exercising...|$|R

50|$|Euchaetes egle, the {{milkweed}} tussock caterpillar or milkweed tiger moth, is a moth in {{the family}} Erebidae. It is a common mid- through late-summer feeder on milkweeds and dogbane. Like most species in this family, it has chemical defenses it acquires from its host plants, in this case, cardiac glycosides (Weller et al., 1999). These are retained in adults and deter bats, and presumably other predators, from feeding on them (Hristov <b>and</b> <b>Conner</b> 2005). Only very high cardiac glycoside concentrations deterred bats, however (Hristov <b>and</b> <b>Conner</b> 2005). Adults indicate their unpalatability with clicks from their tymbal organs (Simmons <b>and</b> <b>Conner</b> 1996).|$|R

25|$|Despite {{heavy rain}} during October, ground and aerial {{reconnaissance}} missions indicated {{the presence of}} a sizable NVA force south of the Ben Hai River between Gio Linh <b>and</b> <b>Con</b> Thien. On 23 October the brigade task force, composed of three companies of the dismounted 1st Battalion, 61st Infantry attacked north from A-3 <b>and</b> <b>Con</b> Thien into the DMZ and then eastward along the Ben Hai River toward the 2d ARVN Regiment and Company H, 9th Marines which had earlier trapped an NVA force killing 112. As the task force continued eastward during the 24th, through Kinh Mon, Tan Mon, and An Xa along an abandoned railroad, Company A engaged an NVA platoon, killing seven. At 08:30 on 25 October, Company A encountered an NVA battalion in well-fortified bunkers, while Company B came under heavy small arms and mortar fire. By 10:30 the engaged companies had linked up, and while Company A attacked to the northeast against the enemy's flank, Company B assaulted and overran the enemy position, capturing one 82mm mortar, two 60mm mortars, and two 0.50-caliber machine guns. Both companies, later reinforced by Company B, 77th Armor, remained in contact until 18:00 killing 231 NVA for the loss of 4 KIA and 24 wounded.|$|E
