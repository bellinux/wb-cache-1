25|$|The area {{is part of}} the Serengeti {{ecosystem}} and, to the northwest, adjoins the SNP and is contiguous {{with the}} southern Serengeti plains. These plains also extend to the north into the unprotected Loliondo division and are kept open to wildlife through transhumance pastoralism practiced by the Maasai. The south and west of the area are volcanic highlands, including the famous Ngorongoro Crater and the lesser known Empakaa Crateri. The southern and eastern boundaries are approximately defined by the rim of the East African Rift wall, which also prevents <b>animal</b> <b>migration</b> in these directions.|$|E

Aside from South Pass, which is at the southernmost tip of the range, no roads cross the mountains until Union Pass, (9,210ft / 2,807 m) at the northern terminus of the range. There are many passes between tall peaks across the continental divide, which runs through the entire range.|$|E

25|$|The {{section of}} freeway between CR 525 and Drift Road (Exit 41) in Watchung was {{completed}} in 1974. The section from Drift Road to Route 24 (Exit 48) in Springfield Township was delayed because of environmental impacts to the Watchung Reservation. In order to mitigate opposition to the original plan, that was shifted closer to {{the northern edge of}} the Reservation, which required extensive cuts into the Second Watchung Mountain. Extra land was added to the Nikesite Road overpass and a separate land bridge was built to allow for <b>animal</b> <b>migration.</b> The road was also designed to use a narrower right-of-way with no median strip and just a Jersey barrier dividing the highway, to minimize the amount rock to be removed.

25|$|The book is {{in three}} sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, {{including}} <b>animal</b> <b>migration</b> and the homing of pigeons, and on animal precognition, including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of {{dogs and cats}} that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes {{for half an hour}} or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when {{she was on her way}} home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly significant statistically. Sheldrake performed 12 further tests, in which the dog's owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines. Sheldrake also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} meta{{population}}s was defined in 1969 as [...] "a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize". Metapopulation ecology is another statistical {{approach that is}} often used in conservation research. Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality, and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms. <b>Animal</b> <b>migration</b> is set apart from other kinds of movement; because, it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat. Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved {{an expansion of the}} range as plant populations expanded from one area to another. There is a larger taxonomy of movement, such as commuting, foraging, territorial behaviour, stasis, and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration; because, it involves the one way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population.|$|E

40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>migrations</b> {{span the}} globe, {{involving}} immense numbers of individuals {{from a wide}} range of taxa. Migrants transport nutrients, energy, and other organisms as they forage and are preyed upon throughout their journeys. These highly predictable, pulsed movements across large spatial scales render migration a potentially powerful yet underappreciated dimension of biodiversity that is intimately embedded within resident communities. We review examples from across the animal kingdom to distill fundamental processes by which migratory animals influence communities and ecosystems, demonstrating that they can uniquely alter energy flow, food-web topology and stability, trophic cascades, and the structure of metacommunities. Given the potential for migration to alter ecological networks worldwide, we suggest an integrative framework through which community dynamics and ecosystem functioning may explicitly consider <b>animal</b> <b>migrations.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>migrations</b> are as {{familiar}} as geese in the sky on a fall afternoon and as mysterious as the peregrinations of sea turtles across {{thousands of miles of}} open ocean. This article discusses the distinguishing attributes of <b>animal</b> <b>migrations,</b> why they are important to biodiversity conservation, and the legal challenges posed by migration conservation. In particular, the article focuses on those aspects of migration conservation that existing law, dominated by imperiled species protection, fails to address. It consequently suggests law reforms that would better conserve <b>animal</b> <b>migrations.</b> A step toward serious legal efforts to protect the process and function of migration would represent significant broadening of the current framework for biodiversity protection policy. This article begins by describing <b>animal</b> <b>migrations</b> and explaining the common threats that raise conservation concerns. Any successful strategy for protecting migration will need to address habitat destruction, human-created obstacles, overexploitation (i. e., hunting and fishing), and climate change. The article examines the four key legal elements of a conservation strategy. The first is the establishment of differential thresholds of action responsive to different abundance goals for a migration. Second is transboundary coordination, which may involve international or interstate agreements, depending on the scale of the migration. Third is the protection of migration connectivity. Effective connectivity requires designation of corridors. Within the corridors, legal activity should concentrate on acquisition of habitat as well as activity-based regulation of habitat-disturbing practices. Fourth is controlling commercial and recreational harvests of migrating animals or the species on which the migrations rely. Finally, the article presents a theoretical model that tailors a place-based legal response to both migratory population abundance and the ecological importance of habitat. Application of the model would result in variable levels of legal protection to minimize unnecessary costs and optimize the benefit of conservation efforts. Existing attempts to conserve migrations using variable levels of protection compose a mixed record from which we extract lessons...|$|R

In this study, intra-annual changes in population parameters were used to study migratory behaviors of humpback whales off central California in 2011 / 2012. Data were compared with a historic dataset from 2004 / 2005. Parameters measured included sex ratio, pregnancy rate, mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequencies and mean δ 13 C and δ 15 N values. Weighted moving averages of the sex ratio were moderately effective at revealing deviations from expected values. Progesterone assays successfully determined pregnancy in humpbacks and revealed a previously undocumented intra-annual decrease in pregnancy rate in 2011. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequencies indicated greater prevalence of haplotypes associated with British Columbia and Washington late in the year; however, the origin of these animals was unclear. Stable isotope ratios proved ineffective for measuring a fasting effect in humpbacks early in the year. The effectiveness of these parameters for investigating migratory behaviors varied, but used in conjunction with traditional methods of study, they may help create a broader understanding of <b>animal</b> <b>migrations...</b>|$|R
