The variation of electrical conductivity near the earth’s surface is mainly due to the variations of 222 Rn and its short-lived daughter nuclei. The diurnal and vertical variations of <b>atmospheric</b> electrical <b>conductivity,</b> radon and its progeny concentrations were studied at Mysore city, Karnataka State, India. Radon concentration varies from 3. 70 Bq m- 3 to 19. 40 Bq m- 3 with a geometric mean of 10. 80 Bq. m- 3. Ion-pair production rate varies between 1. 48 to 5. 11 ion –pairs cm– 3 s– 1 over a day. The positive and negative conductivity value varies from 2. 44 to 5. 31 × 10 – 14 – 1 m– 1 with a geometric mean of 3. 31 × 10 – 14 – 1 m– 1 and 2. 41 to 5. 06 × 10 – 14 – 1 m- 1 with a geometric mean of 3. 31 × 10 – 14 – 1 m– 1 respectively. The stable atmosphere during night helps more accumulation of radon near the ground surface and hence the <b>atmospheric</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> was maximum during early morning hours. A good correlation between electrical conductivity and ion production rate due to radon and its progeny concentrations is observed with a correlation coefficient of 0. 87.

50|$|J. C. McLennan, {{director}} of the physics laboratory at U of T from 1906 to 1932, undertook studies in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conductivity</b> and cathode rays, but in 1912 {{was inspired by the}} work of Bohr, to conduct research into atomic spectroscopy. He, along with G. M. Shrum, constructed the first machine for the liquification of helium in North America, which was used for cryogenic studies of metals and solid gases. Research into colloid physics in the twenties and thirties by E. F. Burton and his students led to the construction of the first electron microscope in North America. Geophysics research was also undertaken at the U of T at this time by L. Gilchrist. At McGill, L.V. King studied mathematical physics while D.A. Keys and A.S. Eve conducted research into geophysics and J.S Marshall into atmospheric physics. McGill also established the first theoretical physics group at a Canadian university. At the University of Alberta, R.W. Boyle became the first professor of physics in 1912 and conducted research into ultrasound while F. Allen established the physics department at the University of Manitoba and bent his efforts towards the physics of physiology. At the University of Saskatchewan, E. L. Harrington was the first physics department head from 1924 to 1956, during which time that institution developed expertise in upper atmospheric research, begun by B.W. Currie in 1932. From 1935 to 1945, Gerhard Herzberg studied atomic and molecular physics there. Physics began at Queen's with the work of A.L.Clark and nuclear research was conducted there by J.A. Gray, B.W. Sargent, A.T. Stewart and others. H.L. Bronson, department head at Dalhousie was active in physics research from 1910 to 1956.|$|E

The electric field and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conductivity</b> were measured during ascent and for a 4 -hour float period at 37 -km altitude. Termination of the flight occurred near a thunderstorm line in west Texas. The perturbing influence of the thunderstorms on the electric field was observed at least 100 km from the storm line.

40|$|The {{short-lived}} radon daughters (218 Po, 214 Pb, 214 Bi and 214 Po) {{are natural}} tracers in the troposphere, in particular near the ground surface. They are electrically charged particles and are chemically reactive. As {{soon as they}} are formed they get attached to the aerosol particles of the atmosphere. The behavior of radon daughters {{is similar to that}} of aerosols with respect to their growth, transport and removal processes in the atmosphere. The electrical conductivity of the atmosphere is mainly due to the presence of highly mobile ions. Galactic cosmic rays are the main source of ionization in the planetary boundary layer; however, near the surface of the earth, ions are produced mainly by decays of natural radioactive gases emanating from the soil surface and by radiations emitted directly from the surface. Hence the electrical conductivity of air near the surface of the earth is mainly due to radiations emitted by 222 Rn, 218 Po, 214 Pb, 214 Bi and 214 Po, and depends on aerosol concentrations and meteorological parameters. In the present work the diurnal and seasonal variations of radon and its progeny concentrations are studied using Low Level Radon Detection System and Airflow Meter respectively. <b>Atmospheric</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> of both positive and negative polarities is measured using a Gerdien Condenser. All the measurements were carried out simultaneously at one location in Mysore city (12 °N, 76 °E), India. The diurnal variation of <b>atmospheric</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> was found to be similar to that of ion pair production rate estimated from radon and its progeny concentrations with a maximum in the early morning hours and minimum during day time. The annual average concentrations of 222 Rn, 218 Po, 214 Pb, and 214 Po at the study location were found to be 21. 46, 10. 88, 1. 78 and 1. 80 Bq m− 3 respectively. The annual average values of positive and negative <b>atmospheric</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> were found to be 18. 1 and 16. 6 f S m− 1 respectively.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is presented and described that unifies the complex influence of several factors on {{spatial and temporal}} variation of lightning incidence.

The theory reconciles several large scale studies of lightning incidence previously misinterpreted or considered contradictory. The model predicts additional strong effects on variations in lightning incidence, but only small effects on the morphology and rate of thunderstorm development...|$|R

Also estimated from the model is the reduction in conductivity for assumed aerosol levels. It is seen that for an increase of ambient aerosols by threefold the percent reduction in conductivity is 7 % and it is 10 % for all increase by sixfold. Thus, the variations in the measured ground level conductivity {{can be used to}} examine the atmospheric pollution, if any. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The electrical conductivity of the atmosphere also shows similar variations. The vertical variation shows a decrease of conductivity with increase in height.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>atmospheric</b> {{electrical}} <b>conductivity</b> is mainly due to the presence of small ions. Near the surface of the earth, radon and its daughter products predominantly produce small ions. In the presence of aerosol particles, the small ion concentration is reduced due to attachment of small ions to aerosol particles which decreases mobility and conductivity in the atmosphere. The ion pair production rate is estimated from the measured radon and its progeny concentrations and correlated with electrical conductivity of the atmosphere. Measurement of concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), SO 2, and NO 2 of air was also carried out.

40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation for the stepped leader {{path in the}} earth atmosphere has been developed to study the influence of atmospheric parameters on the lightning behavior. This model {{has been based on}} the assumption that the leader path follows approximately the gradient of the electric potential (Takagiet al., 1986; Mendes et al., 1996). A perfectly conductor ground surface and a curl-free electric field assumption has been considered (Anderson and Freier, 1969). The influence of the charge configuration (amount of charge and locations, obeying either the dipole model or the continuity current model) and the variations of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conductivity</b> (considered according to isotropic model and non-isotropic model, under some adopted profile functions) were studied. The results of simulations showed that different behaviors in the lightning path were reached. In consequence, for instance, different percentages of positive cloud-to-ground flashes in comparison to the total CG flashes were obtained and the occurrence of the long length lightning with safety risk implication was also confirmed. The importance of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conductivity</b> and space charge in the troposphere on the lightning path were also investigated and discussed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe <b>atmospheric</b> {{electrical}} <b>conductivity</b> {{measured by}} the Permittivity, Wave and Altimetry (PWA) subsystem on board the Huygens probe, during the landing mission on Titan, has been modeled in the present work. Previous modeling studies showed a Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) peak of conductivity at a higher altitude and a quantitative overestimation in the altitude range 0 – 100 km compared to that observed by the PWA instrument. Recently the PWA data was revisited and provided new constraints on the conductivity at altitudes 100 – 180 km. Because the aerosols in the atmosphere are known to alter the electron concentration, using a detailed distribution of the aerosols at all altitudes, the electron conductivity has been calculated in the altitude range 0 – 180 km. By using a variable range of photoemission threshold for the aerosols, the present model is able to reasonably predict the altitude at which the GCR peak of conductivity occurs and to meet the new constraints for the conductivity profile...|$|R

The median values of concentration are 9. 70 Bq m(- 3) and 2. 84 Bq m(- 3) respectively, for radon and its progeny, during the observation period. Ionization rates in the atmosphere are derived for the same period. It is found that, the ionization rate exhibits a median value of 5. 48 ion-pairs cm(- 3) s(- 1). The diurnal and seasonal variations in the concentrations of radon and its progeny, and the ionization rate due to radioactivity are found to exhibit correlation with relative humidity, and anti-correlation with temperature.

40|$|The {{evidence}} for {{interactions between the}} ionosphere and troposphere is reviewed {{as a first step}} in establishing the role of electrical coupling between two regions. Upward processes appear to include the transfer of energy through gravity waves, or through the transmittance of VLF radio waves induced by lightning. In each case, the excitation of the upper atmosphere by tropospheric sources can stimulate feedback processes returning to the troposphere. Downward coupling involves changes in the global and local electrical structure of the atmosphere, and is often induced by solar activity. These effects are more direct and may possibly bypass the stratosphere. The responses in the atmospheric circuit to local changes are nearly instantaneous, and therefore are looked on with promise for possible influences on weather systems. Emerging experimental evidence indicates that atmospheric electric fields, especially at high latitudes and in the upper atmosphere, are responsive to solar and geomagnetic phenomena. Corpuscular radiations are known to strongly enhance the local <b>atmospheric</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> and ionizations at stratospheric and mesospheric altitudes. Theories postulate that the electric field perturbations regulated by solar activity may be responsibile for the observed statistical correlations between solar activity and thunderstorms...|$|R
40|$|Giant planets that {{reside in}} close {{proximity}} to their host stars are subject to extreme irradiation, which gives rise to thermal ionization of trace alkali metals in their atmospheres. On objects where the <b>atmospheric</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> is substantial, the global circulation couples to the background magnetic field, inducing supplementary fields and altering the nature of the flow. To date, a number of authors have considered the influence of a spin-pole aligned dipole magnetic field on the dynamical state of a weakly ionized atmosphere and found that magnetic breaking may lead to significantly slower winds than predicted within a purely hydrodynamical framework. Here, we consider the effect of a tilted dipole magnetic field on the circulation and demonstrate that in addition to regulating wind velocities, an oblique field generates stationary non-axisymmetric structures that adhere to the geometry of the magnetic pole. Using a kinematic perturbative approach, we derive a closed-form solution for the perturbed circulation and show that the fractional distortion of zonal jets scales as the product of the field obliquity and the Elsässer number. The results obtained herein suggest that on planets with oblique magnetic fields, advective shifts of dayside hotspots may have substantial latitudinal components. This prediction may be tested observationally using the eclipse mapping technique...|$|R

Seasonally averaged values of the total as well as polar conductivity are much higher during the monsoon than pre-monsoon season. Surprisingly, however, the concentration of small ions are less and those of large and intermediate ions are more during the monsoon than pre-monsoon season. The diurnal variations observed during the pre-monsoon season show that the nighttime small ion concentrations are about {{an order of magnitude}} higher than their daytime values. On the contrary, the daytime concentrations of the intermediate and large ions are much higher than those of their nighttime values. No such diurnal variations in ion concentrations are observed in monsoon season. Also examined are the variations in ion concentrations of different categories with distance from the coastline in different seasons and the ion-concentration changes associated with the precipitation of various types that occurred over ORV Sagarkanya.
