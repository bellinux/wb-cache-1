40|$|This article explores some of {{the legal}} and {{religious}} aspects of marriage <b>and</b> <b>divorce</b> in England <b>and</b> Wales and America.

In other words, there should be no religious involvement of any kind at the formation or demise of a legally regulated relationship such as marriage. This article further suggests that the state and the law should not facilitate or promote religiosity in marriage or divorce, nor should religious marriages should have any legal force. Instead of continuing to encourage religiosity in marriage <b>and</b> <b>divorce,</b> Law should instead look to ways of strengthening the secularisation of marriage <b>and</b> <b>divorce...</b>|$|R
