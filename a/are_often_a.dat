5|$|In some {{countries}} bathhouses {{are prohibited from}} selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license {{may be required to}} submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>a</b> pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do notor cannotregulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people {{more likely to engage in}} unsafe sex. Sex clubs with no private areas potentially find it easier to regulate consumption of drugs on their premises.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of Tourette's focuses on identifying {{and helping the}} individual manage the most troubling or impairing symptoms. Most cases of Tourette's are mild, and do not require pharmacological treatment; instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and reassurance may be sufficient. Treatments, where warranted, {{can be divided into}} those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>a</b> larger source of impairment than the tics themselves. Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions, but when those conditions are present, they often take treatment priority.|$|E
5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>a</b> major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E

25|$|Slums {{often have}} very narrow alleys {{that do not}} allow {{vehicles}} (including emergency vehicles) to pass. The lack of services such as routine garbage collection allows rubbish to accumulate in huge quantities.

25|$|Goals guide habits by {{providing}} the initial outcome-oriented motivation for response repetition. In this sense, habits <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>a</b> trace of past goal pursuit. Although, when a habit forces one action, but a conscious goal pushes for another action, an oppositional context occurs. When the habit prevails over the conscious goal, a capture error has taken place.|$|E

25|$|The Niger's tributaries – the Béli, Gorouol, Goudébo, and Dargol – are {{seasonal}} {{streams and}} flow for only {{four to six}} months a year. They still can flood and overflow, however. The country also contains numerous lakes – the principal ones are Tingrela, Bam, and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Béli, Yomboli, and Markoye.

25|$|The American Pit Bull Terrier is {{a working}} dog, and is {{suitable}} {{for a wide range}} of working disciplines due to their intelligence, high energy, and endurance.
