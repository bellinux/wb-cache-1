5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> seabed {{was being}} {{elevated}} {{were marked by}} fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate tectonics, {{which he did not}} anticipate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meteorological}} surveys alert about hurricanes {{or severe}} storms, in the <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> risk of coastal flooding is particularly high, there are specific storm surge warnings. These have been implemented, for instance, in the Netherlands, Spain, the United States, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Flame robins {{often become}} more {{abundant}} in areas recently burnt by bushfires, but move away once the undergrowth regrows. They may also move into logged or cleared areas in forests. However, a field {{study in the}} Boola Boola State Forest in central Gippsland revealed they are not found in <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> regrowth after logging is dense.|$|E

5|$|The first Civilian Public Service {{projects}} were in rural <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> men performed tasks related to soil conservation, agriculture and forestry.

5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong and equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) long and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The species typically grows in <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> soils are relatively deep, especially in semi-arid and wadi areas, and on terraces and slight inclines and hills.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} a {{secondary}} {{host of the}} parasitic great spotted cuckoo, the European magpie being the preferred host. However, in <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> latter species is absent, such as Israel and Egypt, the hooded crow becomes the normal corvid host.|$|E

5|$|Albinism was {{observed}} in jungle cats (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) along the coastline of the southern Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India). Albinism {{was observed}} in jungle cats from the Amaravila area of Trivandrum district in the Kerala State. Albinism in jackals was observed from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As albinism is observed in those <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> density of these mammals is comparatively low, it is concluded that continuous inbreeding could be the reason for expression of albinism.|$|E
5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to form. When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E

5|$|Divers {{may carry}} one {{cylinder}} or multiples, {{depending on the}} requirements of the dive. Where diving takes place in low risk <b>areas,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency, recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder. Where diving risks are higher, for example where the visibility is low or when recreational divers do deeper or decompression diving, and particularly when diving under an overhead, divers routinely carry more than one gas source.|$|E
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even in <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps {{can be used for}} space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and crashed to the ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide {{made their way to}} the pavement from high up. Police started to block off <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> ice was falling, however one man was hit in the head by the falling ice and was knocked to the ground.|$|E

5|$|In <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> least weasel is {{sympatric}} {{with the}} stoat, {{the two species}} {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.|$|E
5|$|Krüper's {{nuthatch}} {{is threatened}} by urbanisation and development in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and {{made it easier for}} developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire {{take place}} in the Hoenn region, located some {{distance}} from the Kanto and Johto regions featured in previous games. The design of Hoenn was based on the Japanese island and region of Kyushu; however Hoenn is rotated 90° relative to Kyushu, as Junichi Masuda felt that it would provide a better gameplay balance. Like Kyushu, Hoenn possesses many smaller islands, and part of the region is dominated by sea routes, several of which contain <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> player can dive underwater.|$|E

5|$|Pyelonephritis {{is treated}} more aggressively {{than a simple}} bladder {{infection}} using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used in <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option. In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed. Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following {{two or three days}} of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters live {{in coastal}} waters 15 to 23meters (50 to 75ft) deep, and usually stay within a {{kilometer}} (⅔mi) of the shore. They are found {{most often in}} areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, and barrier reefs. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, sea otters can also live in <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Their northern range is limited by ice, as sea otters can survive amidst drift ice but not land-fast ice. Individuals generally occupy a home range a few kilometers long, and remain there year-round.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes in <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> new wages were applied, {{factories}} would {{struggle to}} recruit workers for important tasks because the reform {{had given a}} low pay grade to a task that was considered to require {{a lower level of}} skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a low pay grade, and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory managers were unable to recruit workers to operate them.|$|E
