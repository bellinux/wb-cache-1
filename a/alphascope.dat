40|$|In this {{randomized}} controlled study, effectiveness, operative time, and acceptability of endometrial polypectomy were compared using an <b>AlphaScope</b> vs an office operative lens-based hysteroscope (LBH). One hundred fifty {{women with a}} diagnosis of endometrial polyp were operated on using an <b>AlphaScope</b> or LBH in the office setting. In 73 procedures using the <b>AlphaScope</b> (97. 3 %) and 68 using the LBH (90. 7 %), the polyp was successfully removed completely. In the <b>AlphaScope</b> group, 2 procedures were incomplete because of excessive endometrial mucosa thickness. In the LBH group, 3 procedures were incomplete because of difficulty in management of a large polyp, and 4 procedures were stopped because of patient pain and low compliance. Time to completion of the procedure and complete removal of the polyp was significantly shorter in the <b>AlphaScope</b> group than in the LBH group (p <. 05). Similarly, the pain score {{at the end of}} the procedure was significantly lower in the <b>AlphaScope</b> group than in the LBH group (p <. 05). The <b>AlphaScope</b> is an effective operative hysteroscope that increases the possibility of performing endometrial polypectomy in the office setting without anesthesia and improves the indications for and acceptability of office hysteroscopy...|$|E
