5|$|As {{a highly}} {{radioactive}} element, americium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> must be handled only {{in an appropriate}} laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth.|$|E
5|$|Lithium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> {{have several}} {{industrial}} applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume {{more than three}} quarters of lithium production.|$|E
5|$|The metal is {{divalent}} {{and has a}} noticeably high volatility. In {{order to}} reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid einsteinium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> are performed right after thermal annealing. Also, some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant gas, for example H2O+HCl for EsOCl so that the sample is partly regrown during its decomposition.|$|E

5|$|Water-soluble {{compounds}} of yttrium {{are considered}} mildly toxic, while its insoluble compounds are non-toxic. In experiments on animals, yttrium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of yttrium citrate caused pulmonary edema and dyspnea, while inhalation of yttrium chloride caused liver edema, pleural effusions, and pulmonary hyperemia.|$|E
5|$|Cerium was {{the first}} of the {{lanthanides}} to be discovered, in Bastnäs, Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. It was first isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1839. Today, cerium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of catalytic converters. Cerium metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxide–nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as in hard disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car motors and wind turbine generators.|$|E

5|$|In a flame test, sodium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> glow yellow {{because the}} excited 3s {{electrons}} of sodium emit a photon when they fall from 3p to 3s; the wavelength of this photon {{corresponds to the}} D line at about 589.3nm. Spin-orbit interactions involving the electron in the 3p orbital split the D line into two, at 589.0 and 589.6nm; hyperfine structures involving both orbitals cause many more lines.|$|E
5|$|Polonium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> must {{be handled}} in a glove box, which is further {{enclosed}} in another box, maintained at {{a slightly higher}} pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.|$|E
5|$|Potassium is {{the second}} least dense metal after lithium. It is a soft solid with a low melting point, and can be easily cut with a knife.

5|$|Thallium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> are {{extremely}} toxic, {{and should be}} handled with care. There are numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium poisoning. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for thallium exposure in the workplace as 0.1mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 15mg/m3, thallium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{producers of}} iodine today are Chile and Japan. Iodine <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> are primarily used in nutrition. Due to its high atomic number {{and ease of}} attachment to organic compounds, it has also found favour as a non-toxic radiocontrast material. Because of the specificity of its uptake by the human body, radioactive isotopes of iodine {{can also be used}} to treat thyroid cancer. Iodine is also used as a catalyst in the industrial production of acetic acid and some polymers.|$|E

5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1828; its first application came in 1885, when Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle, a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels.

5|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} samarium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> is as catalyst and chemical reagent. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{as well as}} the dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate (Sm(OTf)3, that is Sm(CF3SO3)3), {{is one of the most}} efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in the desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.|$|E
5|$|Early {{researchers}} tasted beryllium and {{its various}} compounds for sweetness {{in order to}} verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt {{should be made to}} ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds</b> should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds,</b> a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US.

Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years. This irradiation method was and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{inorganic}} thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, {{such as the}} perchlorates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, vanadates, molybdates, and chromates, {{and their}} hydrated forms. They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, {{but most of them}} have not yet been fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>compounds.</b> Thorium complexes with organic ligands, such as oxalate, citrate, and EDTA, are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes.|$|E
