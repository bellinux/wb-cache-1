At the same time, the risk and cost of space missions leads to reluctance to taking on new, complex and difficult-tounderstand technology. A key issue in addressing these concerns is the validation of <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems.</b> In recent years, higher-level <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> have been applied in space applications. In this presentation, we will highlight those <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems,</b> and discuss issues in validating these systems. We will then look to future demands on validating <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> for space, identify promising technologies and open issues. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a programming model for <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> are distributed systems based on wireless networks, mobile devices and the Internet. They are characterized by the high dynamics with which their configuration evolves. Ad hoc networks, a member of <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems,</b> illustrate this point since in these networks participants can join and leave at any time. Similarly in Peer-to-Peer networks, another member of <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems,</b> users can abruptly decide to no longer share their resources and to join only when needed. Besides voluntary disconnections decided by users, <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> also suffer from disconnections caused by the infrastructure, e. g. network failures, latency, node failures, etc [...] . Disconnections are therefore a key issue in <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems.</b> Programming distributed systems has always proven to be difficult, but programming distributed systems where disconnections {{play a major role}} is even more difficult...|$|R

25|$|The router type is an {{attribute}} of an OSPF process. A given physical router may {{have one or}} more OSPF processes.

40|$|The present thesis explores {{questions}} related to the state responsibility for <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems.</b> The aim of this thesis is to conceptualise and elaborate on the main state responsibility {{issues related to the}} <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems.</b> The analysis consists making a definition of <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems,</b> descriptive examination of the state responsibility doctrine in the present context and an attempt to concretise the phenomenon in the scenario analysis. For the purpose of the thesis, <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> represent technical systems that have somewhat extensive independent decision-making capabilities. There are different categories of these systems and so called off-the-loop systems are the purest example of them. In addition to independence in decision-making processes, the capability to learn and to adapt in some extent in unpredictable circumstances is also typical for <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems.</b> All these features are assumed to be constructed by humans and thus at the meta level they cannot be fully separated from human influence. It is also relevant to understand that <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> contain a group of technological apparatuses which through inter-communication form a coherent system. The defining and important matter from the legal perspective is the nexus between these systems that are gaining autonomy and the responsibility for those actions. It is the view taken in the thesis that contemporary state responsibility system is best described in the International Law Commission’s draft articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Following this premise, the research is concentrated on the topics arising from these articles. The main areas of the analysis are general applicability, attribution, state agent, circumstances precluding wrongfulness and ultra vires. Moreover, the framework included rundown of the due diligence and liability aspects of <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems.</b> Pursuant the thesis, it can be concluded that state responsibility includes an international wrongful act and attribution of that act to a state. In the <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> context there is a huge number of primary norms and any breach or omission will lead to an international wrongful act. Attribution to a state is always based on a human or a group of humans. The <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> cannot create the legal link of attribution as such. The circumstances to preclude wrongfulness {{can be applied to the}} <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> as well. Additionally, actions committed by <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> that include components from several states can lead to shared responsibility. It is also by definition that <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> cannot act ultra vires in legal sense. Furthermore, in cases when the action of a state is not against an international norm but still causes damage, the liability regime might be applicable – also in the context of <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems.</b> The real life analysis of <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems</b> is always context specific and the chapter on scenario analysis will provide some examples of the state responsibility questions of the different stages (namely manufacturing, testing and using) of <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems.</b> The scenario analysis is an attempt to concretize an otherwise rather problematic phenomenon. To summarize, the present thesis gives an overview of the relevant state responsibility questions of <b>autonomous</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
