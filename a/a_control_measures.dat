40|$|Background : Each {{production}} {{process in the}} workplace has potential hazard that can lead accidents. The {{production process}} at tinshed using modern technology that use machine and production equipment which has potential hazard and may lead to accidents. There is little information about hazards in Tinshed thus analysis about potential hazard is required. This study aims {{to carry out the}} preliminary hazard analysis on dry process activity at tin separation with mineral material in tinshed PT. Koba Tin. Method : This study is descriptive with qualitative approaches. Sources of information in this study amounted to five people and three key informants. Research instruments using the interview guidelines, hazard checklist, PHA Worksheet, and conducted a document review. Result : The result show that identified hazards based on equipment used are radiation, noise, splashing hot materials, vibration, fire, lightning, falling, hazard from magnet flow, pinch, dust material, explosion, stability disturbed equipment, rotating equipment, and electric shock. Hazards that has extreme risk is fire. <b>A</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> is needed in extreme risk. Control measures that needed is to carry out emergency fire response procedures. Conclusion : There are 30 hazards in medium risk, 11 hazards in high risk, 2 hazards in extreme risk, and 1 hazards in low risk. Suggestion from this research are conducting regular inspection, notice the ventilation, implementing noise control program, conduct training for employees, notice the safety sign, notice the ladder, enrich safety talk material, and in the implementation of hazard identification and risk assessment should be perfomed by person that have safety background...|$|E
40|$|How do some {{managers}} inspire extraordinary achievement, {{going beyond}} productivity {{to touch the}} lives of their subordinates, while others in the same organization, drawing from the same employee pool, make do with ordinary or insufficient performance? One key difference appears to be the leadership style of the manager. Situational Leadership Theory contends this can be done by matching the leader 2 ̆ 7 s amount of relationship and task oriented behaviour to the skill level and willingness of subordinates. Transformational Leadership Theory contends it is done through charisma, individualized consideration, and intellectual stimulation.;This research applies the two theories and measures their impact on subordinate productivity and growth. Staff who supervise inmate work in penitentiaries were divided into three groups. One group received training in Situational Leadership, another group received training in Transformational Leadership, and the third group served as <b>a</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Measures</b> were taken on the work-group productivity and inmates 2 ̆ 7 personal growth for a three month period before the training and a three month period after the training program.

Both courses were highly rated by those who attended and by the managers who saw the impact on their staff. Both experimental groups improved on both productivity and personal growth variables. The Situational Leadership Group had greater improvement on productivity, the Transformational Group had greater improvement on personal growth and development...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} (CSF) {{outbreaks}} can cause enormous losses in naïve pig populations. How to best minimize the economic damage {{and number of}} culled animals caused by CSF is therefore an important research area. The baseline CSF control strategy in the European Union and Switzerland consists of culling all animals in infected herds, movement restrictions for animals, material and people within a given distance to the infected herd and epidemiological tracing of transmission contacts. Additional disease control measures such as pre-emptive culling or vaccination have been recommended {{based on the results}} from several simulation models; however, these models were parameterized for areas with high animal densities. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore whether pre-emptive culling and emergency vaccination should also be recommended in low- to moderate-density areas such as Switzerland. Additionally, we studied the influence of initial outbreak conditions on outbreak severity to improve the efficiency of disease prevention and surveillance. A spatial, stochastic, individual-animal-based simulation model using all registered Swiss pig premises in 2009 (n= 9770) was implemented to quantify these relationships. The model simulates within-herd and between-herd transmission (direct and indirect contacts and local area spread). By varying the four parameters (<b>a)</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures,</b> (b) index herd type (breeding, fattening, weaning or mixed herd), (c) detection delay for secondary cases during an outbreak and (d) contact tracing probability, 112 distinct scenarios were simulated. To assess the impact of scenarios on outbreak severity, daily transmission rates were compared between scenarios. Compared with the baseline strategy (stamping out and movement restrictions) vaccination and pre-emptive culling neither reduced outbreak size nor duration. Outbreaks starting in a herd with weaning piglets or fattening pigs caused higher losses regarding to the number of culled premises and were longer lasting than those starting in the two other index herd types. Similarly, larger transmission rates were estimated for these index herd type outbreaks. A longer detection delay resulted in more culled premises and longer duration and better transmission tracing increased the number of short outbreaks. Based on the simulation results, baseline control strategies seem sufficient to control CSF in low-medium animal-dense areas. Early detection of outbreaks is crucial and risk-based surveillance should be focused on weaning piglet and fattening pig premises...|$|E
