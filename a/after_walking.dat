5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode <b>after</b> <b>walking</b> down the streets of New York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner, staring at him.

40|$|Background: Falls {{are common}} in transtibial amputees which are linked to their poor stability. While amputees are {{encouraged}} to walk more, they are more vulnerable to fatigue which leads to even poorer walking stability. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the dynamic stability of amputees <b>after</b> long-distance <b>walking.</b> : Methods: Six male unilateral transtibial amputees (age: 53 (SD: 8. 8); height: 170. cm (SD: 3. 4); weight: 75. kg (SD: 4. 7)) performed two sessions (30. minutes each) of treadmill walking, separated by a short period of gait tests. Gait tests were performed before the <b>walking</b> (baseline) and <b>after</b> each session of treadmill walking. Gait parameters and their variability across repeated steps at each of the three conditions were computed. : Findings: There were no significant differences in walking speed, step length, stance time, time of occurrence, and magnitude of peak angular velocities of the knee and hip joint (P > 0. 05). However, variability of knee and hip angular velocity <b>after</b> 30 -minute <b>walking</b> was significantly higher than the baseline (P <. 0. 05) and after a total of 60 -minute walking (P <. 0. 05). The variability of lateral sway velocity <b>after</b> 30 -minute <b>walking</b> was significantly higher than the baseline (P <. 0. 05). : Interpretation: The significant increase in variability <b>after</b> 30 -minute <b>walking</b> could indicate poorer walking stability when fatigue was developed, while the significant reduction <b>after</b> 60 -minute <b>walking</b> might indicate the ability of amputees to restore their <b>walking</b> stability <b>after</b> further continuous <b>walking.</b> Interdisciplinary Division of Biomedical Engineerin...|$|R

5|$|Back in New York, {{executives}} of the Pan American Broadcasting System invite Monroe to host a broadcast of the documentary to be made from the recovered film, but Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Powered robotic exoskeletons {{represent}} an emerging {{technology for the}} gait training of Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) persons. The analysis of the psychological and physical impact of such technology on the patient is crucial in terms of clinical appropriateness of such rehabilitation intervention for SCI persons. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acceptability of overground robot-assisted walking {{and its effect on}} pain and spasticity. METHODS: Twenty-one SCI persons participated in a walking session assisted by a powered robotic exoskeleton. Pain assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and muscle spasticity, assessed as subjective perception using an NRS scale and as objective assessment using the Modified Ashworth scale and the Penn scale, were evaluated before and <b>after</b> the <b>walking</b> experience. Positive and negative sensations were investigated using a questionnaire. The patient’s global impression of change (PGIC) scale was administrated as well. RESULTS: <b>After</b> the <b>walking</b> session a significant decrease in the muscle spasticity and pain intensity was observed. The SCI persons recruited in this study reported (i) a global change <b>after</b> the <b>walking</b> session, (ii) high scores on the positive and (iii) low scores on the negative sensations, thus indicating a good acceptability of the robot-assisted walking. CONCLUSIONS: The overground robot-assisted walking is well accepted by SCI persons and has positive effects in terms of spasticity and pain reduction...|$|R
