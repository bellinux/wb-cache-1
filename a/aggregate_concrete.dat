500|$|In the 4th century, Roman domes proliferated due {{to changes}} in the way domes were constructed, {{including}} advances in centering techniques and the use of brick ribbing. The so-called [...] "Temple of Minerva Medica", for example, used brick ribs along with step-rings and lightweight pumice <b>aggregate</b> <b>concrete</b> to form a decagonal dome. The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells. The use of ribs stiffened the structure, allowing domes to be thinner with less massive supporting walls. Windows were often used in these walls and replaced the oculus as a source of light, although buttressing was sometimes necessary to compensate for large openings. The Mausoleum of Santa Costanza has windows beneath the dome and nothing but paired columns beneath that, using a surrounding barrel vault to buttress the structure.|$|E
2500|$|The second design {{obstacle}} {{involved the}} look of the building. [...] Arthur Q. Davis, of Davis & Curtis, said that the design team's goal was to avoid the typical blocky, monumental mass that typified too many office buildings. [...] The architects wanted to introduce a [...] "new vocabulary" [...] to D.C. architecture, one which emphasized a sense of floating, gracefulness, and rectilinear elements. According to Nathaniel Curtis, Jr., Davis's business partner, [...] "A controversy existed between those who wanted to maintain the granite and marble of the Federal City and the new thinkers who favored exposed <b>aggregate</b> <b>concrete,</b> steel, and glass." [...] In April 1963, the joint venture led by Curtis & Davis produced a low structure with glass panels held in place by aluminum frames. [...] Two symmetrical wings extended down either side of 10th Street SW. CFA, however, felt that the Modernist structure did not fit with the Neoclassical architecture of the capital. The CFA, which had explicit statutory authority over the aesthetics of the building, prodded the architectural joint venture to design a smaller building and to use traditional masonry. [...] The commission argued that [...] "uniqueness of individual design" [...] must come second to retaining a unified look for buildings along the National Mall.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation carried out to study the influence of cement content on the properties of recycled <b>aggregates</b> <b>concrete.</b> Five concrete mixtures (containing natural aggregates or recycled ones) with different cement content (250, 300, 350, 400 and 450 kg/m 3) were studied. Tests were performed to measure porosity to water, permeability to gas and compressive strength (at 2, 7 and 28 days). The results indicated that an increase in cement content (over 300 kg/m 3) allows to reduce significantly the porosity to water and to enhance the compressive strength of recycled <b>aggregates</b> <b>concrete.</b> Correlations based on properties of these concrete are presented. That allows to apply the formulation method of natural <b>aggregates</b> <b>concrete</b> to prepare recycled <b>aggregates</b> <b>concrete.</b> </p...|$|R

The results show that, for the same water/cement ratio, the recycled <b>aggregate</b> <b>concretes</b> present a loss of stiffness higher than the control concrete. Furthermore, the use of recycled <b>aggregate</b> in <b>concrete</b> implies a reduction of the fatigue life. These differences are increased for low water/cement ratios, as {{in this case the}} main factor is the lower strength capacity of the aggregate. From the results obtained, recommendable mixtures for recycled aggregates exposed to fatigue loads are proposed...|$|R

This study seeks to add {{value to the}} tailings by utilising them {{as a replacement for}} <b>aggregates</b> in <b>concrete.</b> A concrete mix of grade 40  MPa was prepared in the laboratory with water–cement ratio of 0. 5.

A controlled mix of concrete was also prepared in similar way using conventional materials and the results were compared with the tailings concrete. It was found that the iron ore tailings may be utilised for complete replacement for conventional <b>aggregates</b> in <b>concrete.</b> The iron ore tailings <b>aggregates</b> <b>concrete</b> exhibited a good mechanical strength and even in the case of compressive strength, there was an improvement of 11. 56 % over conventional <b>aggregates</b> <b>concrete.</b> The indirect tensile strength did not improve against the control mix due high content of fines in the tailings aggregates but showed 4. 8 % improvement compared with the previous study where the conventional fine aggregates was partially replaced by 20 % with iron ore tailings...|$|R

40|$|Recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregate</b> is {{considered}} {{as the most}} abundant and used secondary <b>aggregate</b> in <b>concrete</b> production, other types of solid waste are also being used in concrete for specific purposes and to achieve some desired properties. Recycled aggregates and particularly, recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregate</b> substantially affect the properties and mix design of concrete both at fresh and hardened states since it is known by high porosity due to the adhered layer of old mortar on the aggregate which results in a high water absorption of the recycled secondary aggregate. This leads to lower density and strength, and other durability related properties. The use of most recycled <b>aggregate</b> in <b>concrete</b> structures is still limited to low strength and non-structural applications due to important drop in strength and durability performances generated. Embedding recycled <b>aggregates</b> in <b>concrete</b> is now a current practice in many countries to enhance sustainability of concrete industry and reduce its environmental impacts. The present paper discusses the various possible recycled <b>aggregates</b> used in <b>concrete</b> production, their effect on both fresh and hardened properties as well as durability performances.
