500|$|Ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, McCotter had {{not reached}} the one percent polling {{threshold}} necessary {{to participate in}} the event's August 11 debate on Fox News. At the time, McCotter had little support, even at home. Public Policy Polling showed him with only five percent from Michigan Republicans, a figure pollsters described as rare coming from a candidate's homestate. With news of his standing, McCotter cancelled a scheduled stop in New Hampshire, and returned to his headquarters in Michigan to coordinate a debate inclusion effort. As part of the effort, the campaign filmed a YouTube video in a kitchen, featuring McCotter making puns <b>about</b> <b>food,</b> <b>and</b> concluding with [...] "Thanks, dude." [...] The Los Angeles Times described the video as [...] "unfortunate". Despite the effort, McCotter did not meet the polling threshold and was excluded.

2500|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} system, {{particularly the}} stomach, releases a peptide hormone called ghrelin. In 1999 [...] experiments {{have revealed that}} hunger is communicated from the stomach to the brain via this hormone peptide. This peptide can stimulate thought <b>about</b> <b>food,</b> <b>and</b> is suppressed after food is ingested. Nutrient injection into the blood stream does not suppress ghrelin, so the release of hormone is directed by the digestive system and not by nutrient availability in the blood. [...] These blood levels of ghrelin increase with fasting and are reduced after a meal. [...] Ghrelin antibodies or ghrelin receptor antagonists inhibit eating. [...] Ghrelin also stimulates energy production and signals directly to the hypothalamus regulatory nucli that control energy homeostasis.|$|E
2500|$|This idea of {{separating}} the Creator and youth's {{thought about the}} Creator is harmful. He says, [...] "with the years came understanding, and with understanding knowledge, and with knowledge grief,-and with increased knowledge increased grief. But as he was developed and educated in this way, the simple became more difficult for him, and since with out this guidance he wanted to rule himself, everything {{became more and more}} complicated. – Perhaps he chose the guidance of thought, and in order not to owe anyone anything he let this seed sow itself and let one thought evolve out of another, until eventually the infinite manifested itself to him and made him dizzy. The more he stared fixedly at it, the more his eye lost the visual power to find the way back to finitude.-Perhaps desire blinded him, life seemed like a joke to him, and he let God grieve in heaven while he chose pleasure and let enthusiasm speak in vain about conflict and struggle, about courage in dangers, patience in tribulation, love in life, victory in death, reward in heaven, while he let every day have its pleasure.-Perhaps a worldly-minded worry <b>about</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> clothing scattered his mind so that he did neither the one nor the other." [...] Kierkegaard's remedy for this individual is {{to find a place to}} be alone with God. He says, [...] "Just as the first book in the Old Testament has been called Genesis, the second Exodus, so it could very well be said that in human life there is a third book called Retreat." [...] He continues, [...] "We are speaking only of the beautiful meaning of the retreat for human life and of how having thought about the Creator in one's youth is the retreat's rescuing angel. Let a person's work take from him what belongs to it, his time, his diligence, but in the advancing years, O God, preserve a recollection of youth that preserves youth's thought of the Creator. Woe to him who separates what God has joined together, who to him who separates adulthood from its youth.|$|E

60|$|In estimating, therefore, {{the ground}} of Scott's pre-eminence in romance we must {{absolutely}} rid ourselves {{of the notion that}} romance or adventure are merely materialistic things involved in the tangle of a plot or the multiplicity of drawn swords. We must remember that it is, like tragedy or farce, a state of the soul, and that, for some dark and elemental reason which we can never understand, this state of the soul is evoked in us by the sight of certain places or the contemplation of certain human crises, by a stream rushing under a heavy and covered wooden bridge, or by a man plunging a knife or sword into tough timber. In the selection of these situations which catch the spirit of romance as in a net, Scott has never been equalled or even approached. His finest scenes affect us like fragments of a hilarious dream. They have the same quality which is often possessed by those nocturnal comedies--that of seeming more human than our waking life--even while they are less possible. Sir Arthur Wardour, with his daughter and the old beggar crouching in a cranny of the cliff as night falls and the tide closes around them, are actually in the coldest and bitterest of practical situations. Yet the whole incident has a quality that can only be called boyish. It is warmed with all the colours of an incredible sunset. Rob Roy trapped in the Tolbooth, and confronted with Bailie Nicol Jarvie, draws no sword, leaps from no window, affects none of the dazzling external acts upon which contemporary romance depends, yet that plain and humorous dialogue is full of the essential philosophy of romance which is an almost equal betting upon man and destiny. Perhaps the most profoundly thrilling of all Scott's situations is that in which the family of Colonel Mannering are waiting for the carriage {{which may or may not}} arrive by night to bring an unknown man into a princely possession. Yet almost the whole of that thrilling scene consists of a ridiculous conversation <b>about</b> <b>food,</b> <b>and</b> flirtation between a frivolous old lawyer and a fashionable girl. We can say nothing about what makes these scenes, except that the wind bloweth where it listeth, and that here the wind blows strong.|$|E
