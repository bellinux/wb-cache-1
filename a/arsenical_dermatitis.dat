40|$|Many {{preparations}} {{have been}} used for the local treatment of trichomonas vaginitis and the immedi-ate response to many of them has been satisfactory. Unfortunately, recurrence of infection has occurred in a high proportion of the cases and the problem of satisfactory treatment remains unsolved. Local application of the pentavalent arsenical " acetarsol " is accepted by most clinicians as the treatment of choice. This type of therapy is, however, contra-indicated if the patient has in the past shown sensitivity to an arsenical preparation. Long-continued use of acetarsol has occasionally resulted in <b>arsenical</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> a serious complication which inevitably recurs if an arsenical is used again. Under these circumstances an alternative form of local treatment has to be found. PREVIOUS STUDIE...|$|E
40|$|Neem (Azadirachta indica) is {{popularly known}} as the miracle tree. It is known as ‘Nimba’ in India. The Sanskrit name of neem is ‘Arishtha’ meaning the {{reliever}} of the sickness. Neem also holds medicinal value. Each and every part of neem {{is used in the}} medicines. It has been used in Ayurvedic medicines for more than 4000 years. Its important phytoconstituents are nimbin, nimbinene acetylnimbinase, nimbandial, nimbolide and quercentin. Medicinal uses are purgative, antihemorrhoidal, antihelminthic, antileprotic and antipoisonous in nature. Neem bark is cool, astringent, acrid and refrigerant. It is useful in tiredness, cough, fever, loss of appetite, worm infestation. Nimibidin present in used as antipyretic and non-irritant, and it has found to be effective in the treatment of skin diseases such as eczema, furunculosis, <b>arsenical</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> burn ulcers, herpes labialis, scabies and seborrheic dermatitis. Nimbidin and sodium nimbidmate contained in bark are reported to possess spermicidal and anti-inflammatory activity. So it is a tree that {{has a long history of}} use by humans. It is said to have medicinal, cosmetic and insecticidal potential...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown by several {{investigators}} (1, 2) that "BAL " (2, 3 -dimercaptopropanol) accel-erates the excretion of arsenic in experimental animals poisoned with various arsenicals. In man also, the cutaneous application of BAL ointment (3) or the intramuscular injection of a solution in peanut oil and benzyl benzoate (4, 5) in cases of <b>arsenical</b> <b>dermatitis</b> sometimes results in an increased urinary arsenic excretion, as de-termined by analyses on 12 - to 24 -hour specimens collected before and after its administration. In view of the short-lived effect of BAL in experi-mental animals, {{it is possible that}} these effects of BAL on urinary arsenic excretion in man would have been more prQnounced and more regular had it been possible to obtain urine specimens at 2 - to 4 -hour intervals. The present paper represents an attempt to determine the effect of BAL on the normal uri-nary arsenic excretion in man, as compared with its effect in human subjects exposed for brief intervals to minimal concentrations of an arseni-cal smoke (diphenylcyanoarsine). By treating the latter group at varying intervals after exposure and by obtaining urine specimens at 2 -hour in-tervals, it was hoped to delimit somewhat more precisely its effect on the urinary excretion of arsenic, and to ascertain whether BAL could be used to confirm suspected minimal exposure to arsenical poison gases. The results might be of significance also in relation to the detection and prevention of industrial arsenic poisoning...|$|E
