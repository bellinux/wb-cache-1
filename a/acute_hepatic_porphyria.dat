Induction of the first enzyme 5 -aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS 1) by triggers such as fasting or drug exposure can lead to accumulation of neurotoxic heme intermediates that cause disease symptoms. We have demonstrated that hepatic ALAS 1 silencing using siRNA in a lipid nanoparticle effectively prevents and treats induced attacks in a mouse model of acute intermittent porphyria.

40|$|We have {{reported}} previously that the hepatic heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) -eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF 2 α) kinase is activated in acute heme-deficient states, resulting in translational shut-off of global hepatic protein synthesis, including phenobarbital (PB) -mediated induction of CYP 2 B enzymes in rats. These findings revealed that heme regulates hepatic CYP 2 B synthesis at the translational level via HRI. As a proof of concept, {{we have now}} employed a genetic HRI-knockout (KO) mouse hepatocyte model. In HRI-KO hepatocytes, PB-mediated CYP 2 B protein induction is no longer regulated by hepatic heme availability and proceeds undeterred even after <b>acute</b> <b>hepatic</b> heme depletion. It is noteworthy that genetic ablation of HRI led to a small albeit significant elevation of basal hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as revealed by the activation of ER stress-inducible RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER-integral (PERK) eIF 2 α-kinase, and induction of hepatic protein ubiquitination and ER chaperones Grp 78 and Grp 94. Such ER stress was further augmented after PB-mediated hepatic protein induction. These findings suggest that HRI normally modulates the basal hepatic ER stress tone. Furthermore, because HRI exists in both human and rat liver in its heme-sensitive form and is inducible by cytochrome P 450 inducers such as PB, these findings are clinically relevant to acute heme-deficient states, such as the <b>acute</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias.</b> Activation of this exquisitely sensitive heme sensor would normally protect cells by safeguarding cellular energy and nutrients during acute heme deficiency.

Hepatic drug metabolism, haem biosynthesis and catabolism were investigated after repeated intravenous administration of haem arginate in connection with toxicity studies. The daily doses of haem for rats were 4, 12 and 40 mg kg- 1 and for dogs 3 and 9 mg kg- 1 for 30 days and for 28 days, respectively. Hepatic microsomes were used in the assay of the following drug metabolizing enzymes: cytochrome P- 450 and b 5, aminopyrine N-demethylase, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and UDP-glucuronyl transferase. The assay of NADPH-cytochrome C-reductase and the enzymes reflecting synthesis and metabolism of haem in the liver (delta-aminolaevulinic acid synthase, delta-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase, uroporphyrinogen I-synthase, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, haem synthase, haem oxygenase and biliverdin reductase) were performed from 20, 000 g supernatants.

Acute attacks are treated by heme infusion and glucose administration, but the mechanisms underlying the precipitating effects of fasting and the beneficial effects of glucose are unknown. We show that the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic heme biosynthesis, 5 -aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS- 1), is regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor � coactivator 1 � (PGC- 1 �). Elevation of PGC- 1 � in mice via adenoviral vectors increases the levels of heme precursors in vivo as observed in acute attacks. The induction of ALAS- 1 by fasting is lost in liver-specific PGC- 1 � knockout animals, as {{is the ability of}} porphyrogenic drugs to dysregulate heme biosynthesis. These data show that PGC- 1 � links nutritional status to heme biosynthesis and <b>acute</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria...</b>|$|E
40|$|Acute {{intermittent}} porphyria (AIP), {{the most}} common and the most severe form of <b>acute</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria,</b> is an autosomal dominant condition. It results from lower-than-normal levels (less than 50 %) of porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase. Patients may present commonly with gastrointestinal complaints and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Diagnosis may be confirmed with the presence of intermediary metabolites of haem synthesis, amino levulinic acid (ALA) and PBG in urine or with specific enzyme assays. Abdominal pain is {{the most common}} symptom (90 %). Peripheral polyneuropathy, primarily motor with flaccid paresis of proximal musculature, with or without autonomic involvement, is characteristic. Respiratory failure necessitates ventilator and intensive care support. Avoidance of precipitating factors and the use of haem preparations and intravenous dextrose form the basis of management. Gabapentin and propofol, rather than the conventional antiepileptics appear to be the appropriate choice for seizure control. Here, we present intensive care management of four cases of AIP with varying clinical presentation...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{relative}} {{proportions of}} the four coproporphyrin isomers I—IV were analysed in faeces of 20 healthy subjects and 60 patients suffering {{from one of the}} seven common types of hepatic or erythropoietic hereditary porphyrias. A newly developed, reliable method for sample preparation was applied, using reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography for the isolation of naturally occurring coproporphyrin free carboxylic acids. Accurate separa-tion and quantitation of the individual isomers I—IV were achieved with the help of ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography. The four coproporphyrin isomers I—IV were positively identified by on-line scanning of their fluorescence spectra in the emission and excitation modes. Recovery rates with this new analytical procedure were between 90 and 100 %, and coefficients of variation varied between 0. 8 and 5. 7 % (N = 7). Diagnostically important findings were greatly increased proportions of isomer I and decreased proportions of isomers III, II and IV in erythropoietic porphyrias, such as congenital erythropoietic porphyria and protoporphyria. Significantly increased proportions of isomers III, II and IV, on the other hand, were observed in <b>acute</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias,</b> e. g. <b>acute</b> intermittent porphyria and porphobilinogen synthase deficiency porphyria, as compared with porphyria cutanea tarda (p < 0. 005 and p < 0. 03, respectively). Inversion of the faecal coproporphyrin to I ratios and markedly elevated percentages of the atypical isomers II and IV were important diagnostic markers for variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria.

40|$|SummaryAcute {{intermittent}} porphyria (AIP) is {{the major}} autoso-mal dominant form of <b>acute</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias.</b> The disease is due to mutations in the gene encoding for porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase and is characterized by life-threatening neurovisceral attacks, often precipitated by drugs, fasting, cyclical hormonal changes, or infectious diseases. This report describes a prospective study on the molecular epidemiology of PBG deaminase gene defects in AIP. It uses a sensitive, reliable, and easy-to-handle method for routine AIP molecular diagnosis and family study based on an exon-by-exon {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) strategy followed by direct sequencing. Fifteen genomic DNA fragments, including all the coding sequence and covering 3. 35 kb of the PBG deaminase gene, were investigated in 405 subjects from 121 unrelated French Caucasian AIP families who had not been screened previously at the DNA level. PBG deaminase gene mutations were identified in 109 families, but only 78 were of different type, and each of them had a prevalence rate < 5 %. Among these mutations, 33 had not been published previously. Sixty percent of these 78 mutations were located in only three exons (exons 10, 12, and 14), 44 % were missense, 18 % were splice defect, 19 % were frameshift, and 16 % were nonsense. In addition, two de novo mutational events were characterized. The evaluation of the efficiency of the standard PBG deaminase enzymatic screening method for gene-carrier detection indicated 95 % of con-cordancy with the molecular-based diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|The <b>acute</b> or {{inducible}} <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias</b> comprise four inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis. They usually remain asymptomatic {{for most}} of the lifespan of individuals who inherit the specific enzyme deficien-cies but may cause life-threatening attacks of neurovisceral symptoms. Failure to consider the diagnosis frequently delays effective treatment, and inappropriate diagnostic tests and/or mistaken interpretation of results may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The four disorders are ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria. Other conditions that clinically and bio-chemically may mimic acute porphyria include lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia type I. Th...|$|R
