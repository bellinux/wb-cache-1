500|$|Doherty and Iswarienko {{purchased}} a RED camera to film the series. According to Doherty, {{they decided to}} purchase the camera equipment themselves to make the show [...] "a cut above the rest <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>our</b> crew and how it looks". She described the filming technique as allowing for a more-authentic look into her life: [...] "It had to be honest, {{it had to be}} truthful, and it had to look fantastic". Asked by an interviewer about rumors that she was a [...] "bridezilla", Doherty said that the series would show all aspects of her preparation for the wedding and was meant to be revealing. Its opening ("Everyone thinks they know you") was described by Doherty as another way to show her real life, in contrast with her reputation for being difficult.|$|E
500|$|... "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was {{the first}} {{full-length}} episode of the series to be produced in stop motion animation. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square. Walsh explained, [...] "They dug one of our shorts that we'd done a while back, which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted to have us apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ... We {{come from the same}} planet <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>our</b> sense of humor and comic sensibilities are concerned. But we also {{wanted to make sure that}} it felt like a SpongeBob episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Rashad enjoyed {{working with}} both Cosby {{and the young}} cast, {{claiming}} that the actors very much became like a real family {{as early as the}} first episode, although her real-life relationship with the child actors more-so resembled that of friends as opposed to mother. Rashad said, [...] "I think Bill and I are great role models <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>our</b> TV professions are concerned. Kids learn by example, and I think we're very good ones." [...] Second to Cosby himself, Rashad is the series' most regular cast member, appearing in a total of 212 episodes. In response to television personality Oprah Winfrey quoting a common critique of the series – [...] "How is it realistic to have a doctor and a lawyer in the same house?" [...] – Rashad defended, [...] "I grew up in Houston, Texas, in Third Ward, and it was very realistic. … I guess it just depends on who you know and what you know." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 1995–1996 NBA season, Rodman {{was traded}} to the Chicago Bulls of {{perennial}} scoring champion Michael Jordan for center Will Perdue and cash considerations to fill a large void at power forward left by Horace Grant, who left the Bulls prior to the 1994–1995 season. Given Rodman could not use the 10 jersey as the Bulls had retired it for Bob Love, and the NBA denied him the reversion 01, Rodman instead picked the number 91, whose digits add up to 10. Although the trade for the already 34-year-old and volatile Rodman was considered a gamble at that time, the power forward quickly adapted to his new environment, helped by the fact that his best friend Jack Haley was also traded to the Bulls. Under coach Phil Jackson, he averaged 5.5points and 14.9rebounds per game, winning yet another rebounding title, and was part of the great Bulls team that won 72 of 82regular season games, an NBA record at the time. About playing next to the iconic Jordan and co-star Scottie Pippen, Rodman said: [...] "On the court, me and Michael are pretty calm and we can handle conversation. But <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>our</b> lives go, I think he is moving in one direction and I'm going in the other. I mean, he's goin' north, I'm goin' south. And then you've got Scottie Pippen right in the middle. He's sort of the equator." [...] Although struggling with calf problems early in the season, Rodman grabbed 20 or more rebounds 11 times and had his first triple-double against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 16, 1996 scoring 10 points and adding 21rebounds and 10 assists; by playing his trademark tough defense, he joined Jordan and Pippen in the All-NBA Defense First Team. Ever controversial, Rodman made negative headlines after a head butt of referee Ted Bernhardt during a game in New Jersey on March 16, 1996; he was suspended for six games and fined $20,000, a punishment that was criticized as too lenient by the local press.|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist Michael Einziger {{noted that}} his {{contributions}} to the album were influenced by his musical studies during the band's hiatus: [...] "Maybe my desire to return to simplicity, or even to just go to simplicity - because I've never really written music that simple before — {{is sort of a}} response to maybe having a better or larger perspective of the overall musical landscape that I’ve never had before." [...] Einziger elaborated further, [...] "Over the years, we've become less and less aggressive <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>our</b> music goes. There's always moments of that aggression, but this album is pretty free of that. It's definitely not a hard rock record. I think we're asking a lot of our fans. We're asking them to listen for things that they normally wouldn't listen for. We're not leaning on the strengths of our last records either. It's that much different than our previous work. I think we took a risk by making this type of album. But it's not some crazy, experimental album." [...] Vocalist Brandon Boyd cited Einziger as a key reason for the band's new direction, noting [...] "Michael really buckled down and studied musical composition that inspired him to reach out and dig into different places that he never has before." ...|$|E
