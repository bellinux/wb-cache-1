In the game, the player assumes the role of Mustafa, an Iranian <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> being held at Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. Mustafa's request for asylum has been denied, and, fearing that he will be killed by the Iranian government upon his repatriation to Iran, he decides to attempt to escape Woomera. Mustafa must explore Woomera and speak with other individuals at the centre to devise and execute an escape plan.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has found}} that {{generally}} Australians hold negative attitudes towards <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> These negative attitudes appear {{to be influenced by}} perceptions of threat and false beliefs. The current study explored the attitudes of Anglo-Australians towards <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and how attitudes are related to the concept of Australian egalitarianism and fair go. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted for this study. Three main themes were identified through thematic content analysis: characterising <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> responses to <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Australia, and constructing fairness. 2 ̆ 7 Characterising <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> represented the informants 2 ̆ 7 constructs of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> as being genuine <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> or boat people and illegal immigrants. The latter two are stereotypes commonly used by the media and political figures which appear to influence most of the informants 2 ̆ 7 constructs of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> Responses to <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Australia reflected the informants 2 ̆ 7 discussions of intercultural racist attitudes, competition for resources, and perceptions of threat. These appeared to be guided by in-group and out-group relations. Constructing fairness reflected the informants 2 ̆ 7 definitions of fairness and how it is applied to <b>asylums</b> <b>seekers.</b> It appears the allocation of fairness is distinguished by in-group favouritism. This study adds to the prior knowledge of attitudes towards <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> within an Australian context...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} be given refugee status the person must have applied for asylum. This person was then, whilst waiting for a decision, an <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker.</b> However, a {{displaced}} person who would legally be entitled to refugee status may never apply for asylum, {{or may not be}} allowed to apply in the country they fled to and thus not be an <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker.</b>|$|E
25|$|An <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> is a {{displaced}} person or immigrant who has formally sought {{the protection of}} the state they fled to as well as the right to remain in this country and who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> may have applied for Convention refugee status or for complementary forms of protection. Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the legal definition that best describes the asylum seeker's reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> will either be given Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection and can stay in the country, or will be refused asylum and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR, wherever the application was made, has recognised the protection needs, the <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> will be officially referred to as a refugee in the more specific context and enjoys refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations according to the legislation of the receiving country.|$|E

40|$|The {{refugee crisis}} in Europe {{has created a}} {{significant}} challenge for European policy makers, {{both in terms of}} receiving <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and integrating them into their new communities. Among other methods of refugee integration, the ability of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to find work soon after arrival is particularly important to the future welfare of refugees and of their host countries. On this issue, the European response has been mixed: for example, France has historically taken a restrictive stance to prevent <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> from working to make the country less attractive to “fake refugees,” while Sweden allows <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to work near instantly upon arrival in the hope they can find work quickly and sustain themselves as their claim is being evaluated. This paper evaluates best practices for the labor market integration of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees, before reviewing the historical development of labor market integration policies for <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in France since WWII.

25|$|If an <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> {{is inside}} the United States {{and has not been}} placed in removal proceedings, he or she may file an {{application}} with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, regardless of his or her legal status in the United States.

The immigration judge may also consider the applicant for relief that the asylum office has no jurisdiction to grant, such as withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Since the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act passed in 1996, an applicant must apply for asylum within one year of entry or be barred from doing so unless the applicant can establish changed circumstances that are material to his or her eligibility for asylum or exceptional circumstances related to the delay.|$|E

30|$|The {{data on the}} {{destination}} countries of PRS in Europe is limited. When they are identified they are normally classified as stateless, or a variation thereof, with Syria as their country of origin. Therefore, we can only turn to the available data on all stateless <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> This shows that {{during the same period}} there was significantly less variation in {{the destination}}s of this sub group of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> Sweden received the majority of the stateless <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Europe during the period 2011 to 2017 (Eurostat, 2018). States who have a history of receiving and recognising certain groups of stateless <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> such as The Netherlands, France and Denmark, also received steady numbers which were proportionate to the overall asylum numbers throughout the period (Eurostat, 2018). Thus, stateless <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> seem to follow different migration trajectories than non-stateless <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Europe.

25|$|Linguistic {{analysis}} is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics {{used by many}} governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim. This often {{takes the form of}} an interview by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like English. Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved. Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality.
