5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key <b>approaches</b> to animal ethics; utilitarian <b>approaches,</b> animal rights <b>approaches,</b> and capabilities <b>approaches.</b> All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E

50|$|The Initial <b>Approach</b> Fix (IAF) is {{the point}} where the initial <b>approach</b> segment of an {{instrument}} <b>approach</b> begins. An instrument <b>approach</b> procedure may have more than one Initial <b>approach</b> fix and initial <b>approach</b> segment. The initial <b>approach</b> fix is usually a designated intersection, VOR, NDB, or DME fix. The initial <b>approach</b> fix may be collocated with the intermediate fix (IF) of the instrument <b>approach</b> and in such case they designate the beginning of the intermediate segment of the <b>approach.</b> When initial <b>approach</b> fix, and intermediate fix are combined there is no initial <b>approach</b> segment.|$|R

50|$|Planning {{theory is}} the body of {{scientific}} concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning.

5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of the International System of Units (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies and <b>approaches</b> were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned <b>approaches</b> were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All <b>approaches</b> depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All <b>approaches</b> would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.|$|E

5|$|The Avro Shackleton was {{the main}} {{operational}} aircraft in the 1950s, replacing the wartime Liberator GRs, along with the Neptune MR.1s. At the end of August 1951, No. 201 Squadron RAF became the first unit to complete training on the type. In mid-1953 Coastal Command's order of Battle consisted of eight Shackleton squadrons; one at Gibraltar, four covering the South-Western <b>Approaches</b> in the Atlantic, and three more covering the North-Western <b>Approaches.</b> This force numbered 64 aircraft. A further four Sunderland squadrons totalling 20 aircraft were split between the North-Western and South-Western <b>Approaches.</b> The Neptunes, numbering 32 aircraft in four squadrons, covered the North-Eastern and Eastern <b>Approaches.</b> The Helicopter also joined Coastal Command. Bristol Sycamores entered service in 1953 and 16 aircraft were dispersed in Britain for ASW. In March the Avro Lancaster was finally phased out of Coastal Command service.|$|E

Such a request may include heading and altitude instructions to avoid in-flight delays (such as holds) and efficiently maneuver the aircraft into position for either its next <b>approach</b> or a diversion to an alternate airport.|$|R
