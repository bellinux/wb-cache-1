5|$|Kuala Lumpur was {{administered}} by a corporation sole called the Federal Capital Commissioner from 1 April 1961, {{until it was}} awarded city status in 1972, after which executive power transferred to the Lord Mayor (Datuk Bandar). Nine mayors have been appointed since then. The current mayor is Mhd Amin Nordin <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz,</b> {{who has been in}} office since 18 July 2015.|$|E
50|$|During his reign, {{the domain}} of the House of Saud {{extended}} into Riyadh with <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz's</b> victory there. This victory allowed the House of Saud to rule all of Najd. Their military success and orthodox approach to religion won them great support in the area. Their standing was also boosted by <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz's</b> practice of holding open meetings where tribal elders could meet with him, allowing access to their ruler.|$|R

50|$|<b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz's</b> {{military}} and political successes were not mirrored economically until vast reserves of oil were discovered in 1938 in the Al-Hasa region along the Persian Gulf coast. Prior {{to the discovery of}} oil, the main source of income for the government depended on the pilgrimage to Mecca, which was around 100,000 people per year in the late 1920s.|$|R
5|$|Butler, today {{known as}} Muhammad <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz,</b> was paroled in 1985 {{and became the}} head of the Nation's Harlem mosque in 1998; he {{maintains}} his innocence. In prison Johnson, who changed his name to Khalil Islam, rejected the Nation's teachings and converted to Sunni Islam. Released in 1987, he maintained his innocence until his death in August 2009. Hayer, today known as Mujahid Halim, was paroled in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Jamia Hafsa was a {{madrassa}} {{for women}} located near Lal Masjid. It {{was the largest}} Islamic religious institution {{for women in the}} world, with more than 6,000 students. It was constructed by Maulana Qari Abdullah in 1992. After his assassination, supervision passed to his son <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz.</b> Students were taught general subjects, including mathematics and geography but were not tested on these subjects; the only exams were on religious subjects.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1981, {{the local}} council which {{administered}} {{the town of}} Sibu (Sibu Urban District Council) was upgraded to Sibu Municipal Council. The area of administration of Sibu expanded from 50km2 to 129.5km2. In 1994, Sibu Airport and Sibu Hospital were constructed. In 2001, Wisma Sanyan construction was completed. Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, Sultan Salahuddin <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> Shah visited Sibu from 16 to 17 September 2001 to close a month-long Malaysian Independence Day Celebration at Sibu Town Square.|$|E
50|$|In the 2004 general election, Barisan Nasional (BN) won 21 out of 45 {{seats in}} the Kelantan state assembly, a major setback for PAS, whose stronghold had always been Kelantan. PAS now governed the state with a thin three-seat {{majority}} in the state assembly. Wan <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz's</b> passing reduced that majority to two, and if BN wins the seat, PAS will govern by a one-seat majority.|$|R
2500|$|The Saudi Arabian National Guard is not {{a reserve}} but a fully {{operational}} front-line force and originated out of <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz's</b> tribal military-religious force, the Ikhwan. Its modern existence, however, is attributable to it being effectively Abdullah's private army since the 1960s and, {{unlike the rest of}} the armed forces, is independent of the Ministry of Defense. The SANG has been a counterbalance to the Sudairi faction in the royal family; Salman of Saudi Arabia, the king, is one of the so-called [...] "Sudairi Seven" [...] and controls the remainder of the armed forces.|$|R
5000|$|He {{stepped down}} from the VC office on 17 January 2012, during an {{investigation}} by the CBI. The CBI's interim report released on 11 January had found him guilty of financial impropriety [...] "related to travel concession for family, income tax payment from University funds and purchase of luxury cars"; the remainder of the allegations would be released in a final report. An earlier two-person panel investigating had deadlocked. <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz's</b> departure was cited by India Today as evidence of the [...] "waning influence" [...] of the [...] "Malayali lobby" [...] in Delhi.|$|R
5|$|As a result, the Election Commission would {{review the}} postal voting system where EC {{chairman}} Tan Sri <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> Mohd Yusof {{said they would}} study the proposal to call for an early voting session for army personnel, policemen and EC staff instead of posting votes. Nevertheless, the Youth wing of PAS have demanded for the postal votes to be abolished altogether as it claims that the postal votes are no longer relevant and is prone to abuse and exploitation {{by the government to}} their benefit.|$|E
5|$|The Mosque of Islamic Solidarity was {{constructed}} in 1987 with financial support from the Saudi Fahd bin <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> Al Saud Foundation. It is the main mosque in the city, and an iconic building in Somali society. With a capacity of up to 10,000 worshippers, it is the single largest masjid in the Horn region. In 2015, the federal authorities completed formal refurbishments on the mosque's infrastructure. The upgrades {{are part of a}} larger governmental renovation campaign aimed at all of the masjids in Mogadishu. To this end, the municipal authority is refurbishing the historic Central Mosque, situated downtown.|$|E
5|$|The Shia {{community}} of the Eastern province have a separate legal tradition. Although they follow Sharia, they apply the Shia Jafari school of jurisprudence to it. In 1913, when <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> conquered the area, he granted the Shias a separate judiciary for dealing with religious and family law cases: one judge in Qatif, and one in Al-Hasa. This remained the position, with the two judges ministering to a population of around two million, until 2005 {{when the number of}} judges was increased to seven. For all other areas of law, the Shia community are {{under the jurisdiction of the}} regular Sunni courts.|$|E

50|$|In {{the course}} of their studies in Europe, some members of the new Ottoman elite {{concluded}} that the secret of Europe's success rested not just with its technical achievements but also with its political organizations. Moreover, the process of reform itself had imbued a small segment of this elite with the belief that constitutional government would be a desirable check on autocracy and provide them with a better opportunity to influence policy. Sultan <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz's</b> chaotic rule led to his deposition in 1876 and, after a few troubled months, to the proclamation of an Ottoman constitution that the new sultan, Abdul Hamid II, pledged to uphold.|$|R
50|$|<b>Abdul</b> Wahid <b>Aziz</b> (عبدالواحد عزيز) (1931-1982) was a {{weightlifter}} from Basra, Iraq, who won {{a bronze}} medal in the lightweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics. He {{is the only person}} to have won an Olympic medal for Iraq.|$|R
5|$|The current Saudi {{court system}} {{was created by}} King <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz,</b> who founded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, and was {{introduced}} to the country in stages between 1927 and 1960. It comprises general and summary Sharia courts, with some administrative tribunals to deal with disputes on specific modern regulations. Trials in Saudi Arabia are bench trials. Courts in Saudi Arabia observe few formalities and the country's first criminal procedure code, issued in 2001, has been largely ignored. King Abdullah, in 2007, introduced a number of significant judicial reforms, although they are yet to be fully implemented.|$|E
5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took {{the easy way out}} and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> school.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{different}} court systems existed. In Nejd, {{there was}} a simple system of single judges {{for each of the}} major towns. The judge was appointed by the local governor, with whom he worked closely to dispose of cases. In the Hejaz, {{there was a}} more sophisticated system, with courts comprising panels of judges. In 1925, <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1927, the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used. However, Nejd's traditional system of judges was left in place in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz's</b> younger brother, Ghazi Abdul Rashid, {{had been}} {{negotiating}} {{with a government}} mediator. He claimed that the remaining students were willing to leave the mosque and lay down their arms, provided the government would grant them amnesty and not fire on them. Government officials were sceptical that Abdul Rashid would honour this agreement. In {{a telephone interview from}} a live transmission of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all the charges against him and reiterated his innocence. He further negotiated with the government for his safe passage and a guarantee that no harm would come to his followers inside the mosque. He also received a promise that his ailing mother would receive medical care.|$|R

In October 2005, Pakistan-Maldives Joint Economic Commission commenced.|$|R
5|$|Since January 2006, Lal Masjid and the {{adjacent}} Jamia Hafsa madrasah had been operated by Islamic militants led by two brothers, <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> and Abdul Rashid. This organisation advocated {{the imposition of}} Sharia (Islamic religious law) in Pakistan and openly called for {{the overthrow of the}} Pakistani government. Lal Masjid was in constant conflict with authorities in Islamabad for 18 months prior to the military operation. They engaged in violent demonstrations, destruction of property, kidnapping, arson and armed clashes with the authorities. After Lal Masjid militants set fire to the Ministry of Environment building and attacked the Army Rangers who guarded it, the military responded, and the siege of the Lal Masjid complex began.|$|E
5|$|An {{alliance}} between Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Muhammad ibn Saud {{led to the}} formation the first Saudi State (also known as the Emirate of Diriyah), challenging the authority of the Ottoman Empire. Most of the Najd was under Ibn Saud's control by the time Muhammad bin Saud died in 1765. By 1806, the Hijaz, including Mecca and Medina, was {{under the control of the}} Sauds. The expansion of Wahhabi movement came at the expense of the Ottoman empires' losing the control over Islam's holy places. Consequently, Ottoman Empire sent armies and defeated the first Saudi state in the Ottoman–Wahhabi War (1811–1818). Years later in 1924–1925, the Saud clan regained control over Hijaz and the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd was formed under <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> ibn Saud's rule.|$|E
5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 {{attacks on}} the United States, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf {{announced}} {{his support for the}} US-led War on Terror. This declaration sparked conflict with the Lal Masjid, whose leadership was openly pro-Taliban. <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> and Abdul Rashid denied having any links to banned terrorist organisations but were vehemently opposed to the War on Terror and the conflict in Afghanistan. They openly condemned Musharraf and opposed Pakistani security forces, including the Pakistan Rangers and Islamabad Capital Territory police. The mosque became a source for speeches calling for the assassination of Musharraf. One of these speeches was delivered by Masood Azhar, whose Jaish-e-Mohammed group members were later involved in failed attempts to kill the president. In July 2005, Pakistani authorities attempted to raid the mosque in connection with their investigation into the July 7, 2005 London bombings, but the police were blocked by baton-wielding female students. After the raid, authorities apologised for the behaviour of the police.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, {{the first}} six {{students}} graduated from the Centre as imams. These include Moulana Wajid Iqbal, Moulana Qari Imran Rizvi, Moulana Hafiz Abdul Samee, Moulana Hafiz Abdul Saeed, and Moulana <b>Abdul</b> Hafeez <b>Aziz.</b> These imams {{have been a great}} success story not only for the centre but for the wider Sunni community. Having studied in the UK, they are now themselves teaching the Alim course to other students both at Al-Mustafa and other institutions.|$|R
50|$|Taib {{announced}} his cabinet reshuffle on 8 November 2009. Six new state assemblymen were appointed as assistant ministers, while the portfolios of others were changed. Five {{out of the}} six new appointees were sworn in on 21 November 2009 before the state governor, Tun Datuk Patinggi Abang Muhamad Salahuddin in the state assembly.

5|$|Idris' {{government}} was increasingly unpopular {{by the latter}} 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system {{in order to take}} advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the Western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-Western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.|$|E
5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz,</b> the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E
5|$|Pakistani {{intelligence}} {{officials said they}} found letters from Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, after taking control of Lal Masjid. They were written to Abdul Rashid Ghazi and <b>Abdul</b> <b>Aziz</b> Ghazi, directing the brothers and militants to conduct an armed revolt. Government sources believe {{that as many as}} 18 foreign fighters from Uzbekistan, Egypt, and Afghanistan had arrived weeks before the final confrontation and established firing ranges to teach the students, including children, how to handle weapons properly. Diplomats were surprised by how quickly al-Zawahiri condemned the attack on the mosque and called on Pakistanis to rise up against Musharraf's government. Officials blamed the presence of foreign fighters for the breakdown of negotiations, as they seemed about to reach a deal to end the standoff peacefully. According to government sources and western diplomats, the Al-Qaeda fighters in the mosque sought martyrdom instead.|$|E

In the {{lightweight}} category (60 - 67.5 kg) competition {{held at the}} Palazetto Dello Sports Hall, Russia's Viktor Bushuev had already won the gold by breaking the world record. It was down to Tan and Iraq's <b>Abdul</b> Wahid <b>Aziz</b> for the silver medal. Tan had one clean and jerk lift left when he felt some pain in his legs. The doctors advised that he return to the Athlete's Village for treatment, which would have meant a withdrawal from the competition. However, Tan did not give up and competed to claim the silver medal. He lifted a total of 380 kg to beat 33 rivals for second place.|$|R
