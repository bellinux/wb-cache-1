5|$|The Whitby Regatta {{takes place}} {{annually}} over {{three days in}} August. The competition between three rowing clubs – Whitby Friendship ARC, Whitby Fishermen's ARC and Scarborough ARC – forms {{the backbone of the}} weekend. The event has expanded to include a fair on the pier, demonstrations, fireworks and military displays – including the spectacle of the Red Arrows <b>aerobatics</b> display team of the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Built at Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire in 1940, the DH82A Tiger Moth {{that appears}} in the film (registration G-ANFM, serial number 83604) {{had served in the}} RAF before being sold to the Association of British Aero Clubs in 1953. Since the {{production}} of Thunderbird 6, the plane has made appearances in other films, such as Michael Apted's Agatha (1978). Damaged in a crash in 1992, the repaired Tiger Moth currently forms a part of the Diamond Nine <b>aerobatics</b> squadron, based at White Waltham Airfield, Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of <b>aerobatics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited II is a 1997 flight {{simulator}} video game developed by Looking Glass Studios {{and published by}} Eidos Interactive. The player controls one of five planes in the airspace of the San Francisco Bay Area, which is shared with up to 600 artificially intelligent aircraft directed by real-time air traffic control. The game eschews the <b>aerobatics</b> focus of its predecessor, Flight Unlimited, in favor of general civilian aviation. As such, new physics code and an engine were developed, the former because the programmer of Flight Unlimiteds computational fluid dynamics system, Seamus Blackley, had left the company.|$|E
5|$|Graf was {{accepted}} for the Luftwaffes A-level pilot training school in Karlsruhe on 2 June 1936. This training included {{theoretical and practical}} training in <b>aerobatics,</b> navigation, long-distance flights and deadstick landings. He graduated to the B1 school in Ulm-Dornstadt on 4 October 1937. The B courses included high-altitude flying, instrument flights, night landings and training to handle an aircraft in difficult situations. He subsequently completed his B2 training in Karlsruhe on 31 May 1938.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, three {{production}} Su-27Ms {{were delivered}} to the air force's 929th State Flight-Test Centre (GLITs) at , Akhtubinsk, to perform weapons trials. In 2001, the air force decided to transfer several Su-27Ms to re-equip the Russian Knights <b>aerobatics</b> team, and so the team's pilots took familiarisation flights with the aircraft. The three production and two other pre-production Su-27Ms arrived at the team's Kubinka air base near Moscow in 2003. However, they were used {{as a source of}} spare parts for other aircraft in the demonstration fleet.|$|E
5|$|The choughs {{have black}} plumage and brightly {{coloured}} legs, feet, and bills, and are resident {{in the mountains}} of southern Eurasia and North Africa. They have long broad wings and perform spectacular <b>aerobatics.</b> Both species pair for life and display fidelity to their breeding sites, which are usually caves or crevices in a cliff face. They build a lined stick nest and lay three to five eggs. They feed, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey, supplemented by vegetable material or food from human habitation, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{course at}} SFTS {{typically}} {{consisted of two}} streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced <b>aerobatics,</b> formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|A skilful pilot, Hull {{dedicated}} {{much of his}} pre-war {{service to}} <b>aerobatics,</b> flying Hawker Audaxes, Furies and Hurricanes. He reacted to the outbreak of war with enthusiasm and achieved No. 43 Squadron's first victory of the conflict in late January 1940. Reassigned to Norway in May 1940 to command a flight of Gloster Gladiator biplanes belonging to No. 263 Squadron, he downed four German aircraft in an hour over the Bodø area south-west of Narvik on 26 May, a feat that earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross. He was shot down the next day, and invalided back to England. Hull returned to action {{at the end of}} August, when he was made commander of No. 43 Squadron with the rank of squadron leader. A week later, he died in a dogfight over south London.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not stood up to the strain of <b>aerobatics,</b> and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E
5|$|No.410 Squadron was {{reactivated}} on 1 December 1946 as an Air Defence squadron flying de Havilland Vampire F.3 aircraft, and was re-formed from a defence role {{into that}} of a fighter role at St Hubert (Montreal), Quebec on 1 December 1948. From May 1949 to August 1951, the Blue Devils <b>aerobatics</b> team formed, to demonstrate the abilities of the new Vampire aircraft at formation flying. The squadron later converted to Canadair Sabres and was deployed to Europe, flying from RCAF Station North Luffenham in the UK, and then at RCAF Station Marville (No.1 (Fighter) Wing) in France. The squadron {{had been the first}} regular force fighter unit to fly the Vampire aircraft and was the first to fly the Sabre and the first to join No.1 (Fighter) Wing of No.1 Air Division Europe.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer then {{attended}} the advanced Flugzeugführerschule C 3 (FFS C 3—advanced flight school) at Alt Lönnewitz near Torgau and the blind flying school Blindflugschule 2 (BFS 2—2nd blind flying school) at Neuburg an der Donau from August 1940 to May 1941. This qualified him to fly multi-engine aircraft. During this assignment {{he was promoted}} to Fähnrich (cadet sergeant) on 1 September 1940, to Oberfähnrich (rank equivalent to Company Sergeant Major) on 1 February 1941 and to the officer rank of Leutnant (second lieutenant) on 1 April 1941. He was then posted for ten weeks to the Zerstörerschule (destroyer school) at Wunstorf near Hanover. At Wunstorf, Schnaufer and the radio operator (Bordfunker) Friedrich Rumpelhardt were assigned as an aircrew team on 3 July 1941. Schnaufer's previous radio operator had proved unable to cope with <b>aerobatics,</b> and Schnaufer thoroughly tested Rumpelhardt's ability to cope with <b>aerobatics</b> before they teamed up. Here the two decided to volunteer to fly night fighters to defend against the increasing Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command offensive against Germany. Following their training at Wunstorf, the two were sent to the Nachtjagdschule 1 (1st night fighter school) at Schleißheim near Munich, formerly the Zerstörerschule 1 (ZS 1—1st destroyer school), to learn the rudiments of night-fighting. The night fighter training was carried out on the Ar 96, the Fw 58 and the Messerschmitt Bf 110. Training at night focused on night takeoffs and landings, cooperation with searchlights, radio-beacon direction finding and cross country flights.|$|E
5|$|Cummings {{was among}} the first people {{accepted}} into USC's Civil Pilot Training Program in 1939. She completed an advanced <b>aerobatics</b> course and earned her pilot's license in 1940 and, by her 1941 graduation, had acquired enough training to begin work as an instructor. Having been recruited by Jacqueline Cochran, Cummings joined the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron in 1942, which soon became the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). After graduating from training in Houston in May 1943, she served in World War II until the organization's deactivation in December 1944. During this time, {{she was a member of}} the 6th Ferrying Group out of Long Beach, California, eventually reaching the rank of First Lieutenant, and flew 18 different types of military aircraft. In the same month as her unit's deactivation, she married fellow military pilot Howard Critchell, whom she had a met at a base that was used as a ferry stop for the WASP.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Flight Unlimited in 1995, project leader Seamus Blackley planned to use that game's computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) code to create a combat flight simulator called Flight Combat. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Studios demanded that Blackley instead design a direct sequel to Flight Unlimited. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. Constantine Hantzopoulos became the lead designer and project leader of the fourteen-member Flight Unlimited II team. The team eschewed the <b>aerobatics</b> focus of their previous game in favor of general civilian aviation, in order {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Looking Glass announced the game on December 18, 1996. It was slated to include 6 planes, 45 airports and 8,500 square miles of terrain from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area was chosen because of its varied landscape and numerous airports. In January 1997, Eidos Interactive partnered with Looking Glass to provide the game's marketing and distribution.|$|E
5|$|General {{aviation}} in the United Kingdom {{has been}} defined as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, rotorcraft, piston and jet-engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than air craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which {{plays an important role in}} the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, <b>aerobatics,</b> and parachuting, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.|$|E
5|$|In December 1937 {{he began}} flight {{training}} at the No. 7 Elementary Flying School (EFS) at Desford. It was normal for pilots to undertake solo flights after eight to eleven hours dual instruction with their flight instructor. For Braham, progress was slow and {{he made his first}} solo flight after 14 hours of dual instruction. On 9 March 1938 Braham flew solo {{for the first time in}} a Tiger Moth. In May 1938 Braham began officer instruction at RAF Uxbridge. After the completion of this course he was moved to RAF Shawbury to begin training on military aircraft. Now assigned to the No. 11 EFS he elected to become a fighter pilot and began training on the Hawker Hart. He completed his advanced flight training on 20 August 1938 and began the final phase of training in the Hawker Fury. He completed his training in formation flying, <b>aerobatics</b> and gunnery practice over the next four months, graduating in December 1938.|$|E
5|$|In May German forces {{attacked}} the Netherlands and Belgium which fell quickly. In June France collapsed. Fighter Command now needed {{an influx of}} pilots after losses in Western Europe. Finucane had improved and on 27 June 1940 he was posted to 7 Operational Training Unit (7 OTU) in Hawarden near Chester, to undergo conversion training onto Supermarine Spitfires while awaiting a fighter squadron posting. Finucane made his first flight in a Spitfire on 3 July 1940 and made 26 such flights in nine days. The pilots were tested on radio transmission, handling, formation flying and <b>aerobatics.</b> On 11 July 1940 he was permitted just one firing practice. At {{the end of his}} stay at 7 OTU he had logged 2 hours 40 minutes on the Magister, 2 hours 25 minutes on the Fairey Battle, 15 minutes on the Hawker Hurricane and 22 hours and 20 minutes on the Spitfire.|$|E
5|$|No.5 SFTS began flight {{training}} in February 1942 using 28 Wirraways. The unit grew {{over the next}} two years, and by early 1944 was operating 128 Wirraways, two de Havilland DH.84 Dragons, two de Havilland Moth Minors and a CAC Wackett. It typically graduated one course of pilots each month, although the wastage rate sometimes exceeded 40 per cent. Among its graduates was Len Waters, the first Aboriginal Australian military aviator, and the only one to serve as a fighter pilot in the RAAF during World WarII. As a training facility, No.5 SFTS regularly suffered flying accidents. Forty-two of its students died during the war, an average of around one per month. A near miss involving more experienced pilots occurred at the school in December 1943, when aces Clive Caldwell and John Waddy, then instructors at No.2 Operational Training Unit in Mildura, almost collided when they crossed paths during an <b>aerobatics</b> display over the base.|$|E
5|$|Permission {{was granted}} for flight testing {{to begin in}} April 1935, and Bajdak {{conducted}} his first flight in the prototype on 22 April 1935. For this initial uneventful flight, no weapons were installed and a light fuel load was used. The following day, Bajdak put the IK-1 into unplanned aerobatic manoeuvres, after which the wing fabric was observed as being slack. An official from Ikarus checked it and stated that this would resolve once the fabric varnish had completely dried. Bajdak took the aircraft for a third test flight the next day, which involved more unplanned <b>aerobatics.</b> When the aircraft was at , Bajdak {{put it into a}} shallow dive and pulled up abruptly at high speed, at which point the wing fabric began to tear rapidly, {{to the extent that it}} could be seen from the ground. The aircraft dropped into a spin to starboard, and Bajdak baled out safely while the IK-1 crashed into the ground.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tintin finds {{electric}} cables and red beacons in the garden, surmising {{that they are}} there designed to attract a plane drop. At night, he lights the flares, and finds that planes drops sacks of counterfeit money, revealing that Müller {{is part of a}} gang of forgers. He pursues Müller and his accomplice Ivan and along the way, Thompson and Thomson try to arrest him again, but he convinces them to follow him. When Müller takes a plane north, Tintin and Snowy try to follow, but hit a storm and crash land in rural Scotland. The detectives commandeer another plane, but discover too late that the man they told to fly it is actually a mechanic who has never flown before, and after a harrowing air-bound odyssey they end up crash-landing into (and winning) an <b>aerobatics</b> competition.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to demands for more aircrew to meet Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying {{training in the}} RAAF was again expanded in 1951–52, resulting in the functions of No.1 FTS being split among three separately located units. No.1 FTS itself was renamed No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS) in March 1952, and assumed responsibility for advanced weapons and combat training on CAC Wirraways. Meanwhile, in November 1951, No.1 Initial Flying Training School (No.1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on de Havilland Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.1 IFTS went on to another new unit, No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) at RAAF Base Uranquinty, New South Wales, where they underwent further aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, as well as <b>aerobatics</b> and navigation. The first part of their training at No.1 BFTS included 40 hours on Tiger Moths, after which they would fly 50 hours on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.1 AFTS, before graduating as sergeant pilots.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 August, the weather was bad and Göring ordered a {{postponement}} of raids. However, the Dornier Do 17s of KG 2 were not informed and took off at 04:50 for their target. They were to meet with their escorts from ZG 26 over the Channel. ZG 26 received the cancellation order, but II., and III./KG 2 did not.kg 2 had formed up by 05:10, led by Geschwaderkommodore Johannes Fink. Part of the ZG 26 formation that had taken off—led by Oberstleutnant Joachim Huth—tried to warn the Dorniers of the cancellation. Unable to contact the bombers by radio, Huth tried to signal them by flying {{in front of them}} and performing <b>aerobatics.</b> Fink ignored him and flew on.kg 2 flew around the coast to his target, Eastchurch airfield on the Isle of Sheppey. Albert Kesselring had issued orders for bombers to abandon missions if their escorts did not show up, but Fink did not want to be accused on failing to obey orders and continued onward even though the Bf 110s turned back. The return leg would take KG 2 across No. 11 Group's territory, which could have been disastrous without fighter escort. But owing to the Observer Corps misjudging the direction of the bombers, owing to low-lying cloud, and the radar not picking up the direction of the German bombers, the WAAF plotted the course of the raid incorrectly and the RAF failed to prevent the target being attacked.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression {{prevented}} Bär from {{gaining a}} civil pilot license. In 1934, {{he joined the}} Reichswehr and {{was assigned to the}} 3. Kompanie of Kraftfahrabteilung 4 (3rd Company of the 4th Motor Vehicle Battalion) as a mechanic. He served in this position until the following year, when he was transferred to a combat wing of the Luftwaffe. A few months later, he was accepted for pilot training, receiving his transport aircraft pilot's training. From 1 November 1937 to 31 March 1938, Bär attended the flight school at Oldenburg and was then transferred to the flight school at Hildesheim. He was transferred again, attending the flight school at Ludwigslust where he attained his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate (Erweiterter Luftwaffen-Flugzeugführerschein), also known as 'C'-Certificate, confirming proficiency on multi-engine aircraft, on 16 May 1938. Bär then attended the blind flying school Blindflugschule 2 (BFS 2—2nd blind flying school) at Neuburg an der Donau from 7 July to 14 August 1938. He was transferred to I./Jagdgeschwader 135, the core of the future Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG51), on 1 September 1938, usually flying the Junkers Ju 86. The Squadron Leader (Staffelkapitän) Douglas Pitcairn noticed Bär's flying talents and tried to convince Bär to become a fighter pilot. Initially Bär refused, but after he illegally conducted some <b>aerobatics</b> in the Ju 86 leading to an engine failure, he reluctantly accepted and became a fighter pilot.|$|E
