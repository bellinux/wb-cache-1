"Captain Batt was {{believed}} to be far away; his family was at Oakwell; when in the dusk on winter evening, he came stalking along the lane, through the hall <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> into his own room, where he vanished. He has been killed in duel in London that very same afternoon of December 9th 1684." ...|$|E
60|$|But without answer Barbara {{vanished}} into the dim hall <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|And {{without waiting}} for a reply Mrs. Stillwell swept by us <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|He led the {{man down}} the alley, across the court, round <b>the</b> corner, <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> to <b>the</b> landing.|$|R
5000|$|Heard in scene: Deckard enters <b>the</b> Bradbury <b>and</b> walks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> ...|$|R
60|$|He {{shot through}} the door, banging it after him, <b>and</b> pounded <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|R
60|$|Testily he made {{room for}} himself beside long John Fanning's flank and passed in <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|Outside, {{she took}} a candle, and, hurrying along the {{passages}} <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to her own room, locked the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't understand," [...] he {{said once}} more. Then, without another word, {{or even a}} look at Felix, he went out <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|Flinging the old {{man from}} him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly <b>and</b> furiously, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ziza, so {{far from}} objecting, {{said that she was}} used to being left alone for long, long hours at a time, and wouldn't mind it. So Willie put the candle nearer to her bedside, placed a tea-cup of water within reach, went out, shut the door softly behind him, groped his way through <b>the</b> passage <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> <b>and</b> got into the street.|$|R
6000|$|Of mice that chased {{each other}} through <b>the</b> chambers, [...] <b>And</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> [...] And rioted among the ashen embers, [...] And left their frolic {{footprints}} everywhere,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, do come along, then, mother," [...] said Mela; {{and she got}} {{her out of the}} room, with Mrs. Mandel's help, <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|Leaving the storeroom, Tom led the {{way through}} the semi-dark hallway <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> At the rear of the upper hall was a bedroom {{reserved}} for the captain's private guests.|$|E
60|$|That was it, mister, and I {{tell you}} it floored me. And then it come to me, kind of as a new idea, that I'd best do {{something}} pretty soon, <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> I went quick.|$|E
60|$|Little Pax {{heard and}} understood. In one moment he bounded through <b>the</b> blazing doorway <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> smoking <b>stair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Grrh!" [...] replied his ex-prospective-father-in-law, <b>and</b> bounded <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> like {{a portion}} of the sunset which had become {{detached}} from the main body.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't {{have hurt}} you, either," [...] she retorted, <b>and</b> started <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Once she glanced {{back and saw}} him looking after her.|$|R
60|$|She {{ran into}} the hall <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> and in another moment they heard her coming down again; the outer door shut after her, {{and then came the}} flutter of the sleigh-bells as she drove away.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's only {{crossing}} the bar, sir, <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> if you wouldn't mind, and waiting {{there for a}} moment till I get a candle. If you should hear a dog, sir, it's only Merrylegs, and he only barks.' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{moved slowly}} through the cloisters, neither speaking, <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{that led to the}} Great Hall. Each was gratefully {{conscious}} of the fact that prayers would be beginning in another minute, putting an end to an uncomfortable situation.|$|E
60|$|They {{cut across}} into Sixth Avenue, <b>and</b> walked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to <b>the</b> station of the Elevated Railway. A train was just coming in.|$|R
6000|$|Poor fellow! {{for some}} reason, surely bad, [...] They had slain him with five slugs; {{and left him}} there [...] To perish on the pavement: so I had [...] Him borne into <b>the</b> house <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> [...] <b>And</b> stripp'd and look'd to--But why should I ad [...] More circumstances? vain was every care; [...] The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel [...] Kill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ogden!" [...] she shrilled; <b>and</b> passed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{two at a}} time, {{gathering}} {{speed as}} she went. A boy's best friend is his mother.|$|R
60|$|He {{went up to}} his attic {{room and}} closed the door. So quiet was the village that a score of people heard {{the roar of the}} great pistol. They flocked thither, <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> where the smoke, issuing, drew their notice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely. It has no egress save {{into the}} tap-room <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> to the rooms above. Your English spies {{if they came}} now would have to fly {{in and out of}} those top windows ere they could get to the aristos." ...|$|E
6000|$|They passed {{under the}} doorway <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> in silence. As {{soon as they}} were in the sitting-room, Dolly fronted Herminia fiercely. [...] "Mother," [...] she cried, with the air of a wild {{creature}} at bay, [...] "were you married to my father?" ...|$|E
50|$|She meets up with Agent Tuna {{for some}} {{training}} with Street Wars. Training included push-ups, rolling on <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> running <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> like in Rocky.|$|R
60|$|On {{the third}} day the wolf strode into <b>the</b> palace yard <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> great <b>stairs,</b> to <b>the</b> room where {{the king and queen}} were seated.|$|R
60|$|As {{the captain}} {{accompanied}} him along the passage, {{they heard the}} voice and step of poor Mrs Leven's dissipated son, as he came stumbling <b>and</b> singing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b>|$|R
60|$|My {{slippers}} were thin: I {{could walk}} the matted floor as softly as a cat. He glided up the gallery <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> {{and stopped in}} the dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his side.|$|E
60|$|Ciccio obediently {{followed}} Alvina {{into the}} house <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> without a word. He was ushered into the bedroom. He drew back when he saw Effie in the bed, sitting with her long plaits and her dark eyes, and the subtle-seeming smile {{at the corners of}} her mouth.|$|E
60|$|Anne, {{bursting}} into tears, {{rushed to the}} hall door, slammed it until the tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the hall <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> like a whirlwind. A subdued slam above told that {{the door of the}} east gable had been shut with equal vehemence.|$|E
60|$|Madame Fontaine {{hurried out}} of the room without {{answering}} <b>and</b> ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> without looking back. Minna's eyes filled with tears. Fritz stood at the open door, bewildered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll fix Tom Rover for this!" [...] exclaimed <b>the</b> bully, <b>and</b> looked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> at <b>the</b> {{laughing}} students. [...] "I'll {{make him}} laugh {{on the other}} side of his face!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} midnight, {{and the street}} was deserted save {{for one or two}} revellers upon their way home. The party crossed the road, and, pushing open the door of the {{newspaper}} office, Baldwin and his men rushed in <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> which faced them. McMurdo and another remained below. From the room above came a shout, a cry for help, and then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs. An instant later a gray-haired man rushed out on the landing.|$|R
