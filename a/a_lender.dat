5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular short-term financing. As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At {{the end of the}} second quarter of 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007. The assets of the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at {{the end of the second}} quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as <b>a</b> <b>lender</b> of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E
5|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} Federal Reserve Act in 1913, {{giving rise to}} the Federal Reserve System. Its {{inception}} drew influence from the Panic of 1907, underpinning legislators' hesitance in trusting individual investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, to serve again as <b>a</b> <b>lender</b> of last resort. The system's design also considered {{the findings of the}} Pujo Committee's investigation of the possibility of a money trust in which Wall Street's concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which investment bankers were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the directorates of manufacturing corporations. Although the committee's findings were inconclusive, the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the long-resisted notion of establishing a central bank. The Federal Reserve's overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the United States' money supply during significant shifts in money demand. In addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the 1907 money market crunch, New York's banks were liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks. New access to rediscount facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches, bolstering New York's rivalry with London's competitive discount market.|$|E

25|$|Risks of investment: There {{is always}} a risk that the {{borrower}} will go bankrupt, abscond, die, or otherwise default on the loan. This means that <b>a</b> <b>lender</b> generally charges a risk premium to ensure that, across his investments, he is compensated for those that fail.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the ex-post performance {{of small and}} medium enterprises (SMEs) that obtained small business credit scoring (SBCS) loans by using a unique Japanese firm-bank matched dataset.

50|$|The {{discussion}} {{on the need for}} <b>an</b> international <b>lender</b> of last resort is more controversial than for the domestic function. While most authors agree {{that there is a need}} for <b>a</b> national <b>lender</b> of last resort and argue only about the specific set-up, there is no agreement about the basic question of whether there can be <b>an</b> international <b>lender</b> of last resort. There are mainly two opposing groups: one group (Capie and Schwartz) says that <b>an</b> international <b>lender</b> of last resort (ILOLR) is technically impossible, but the other group (Fischer, Obstfeld, Goodhardt and Huang) wants a modified International Monetary Fund (IMF) to assume this role.|$|R

40|$|Without {{denying the}} {{importance}} of asymmetric information, this article purports the view that credit rationing may also originate from <b>a</b> <b>lender's</b> inability to classify loan applicants in proper risk categories.

This article presents {{a measure of the}} inadequacy of <b>a</b> <b>lender's</b> classi-cation criteria to the qualitative features of prospective borrowers.

25|$|Hyman Philip Minsky (September 23, 1919 – October 24, 1996) was an American economist, a {{professor}} of economics at Washington University in St. Louis, and a distinguished scholar at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College. His research attempted to provide an understanding and explanation of the characteristics of financial crises, which he attributed to swings in a potentially fragile financial system. Minsky is sometimes described as a post-Keynesian economist because, in the Keynesian tradition, he supported some government intervention in financial markets, opposed some of the financial deregulation policies popular in the 1980s, stressed the importance of the Federal Reserve as <b>a</b> <b>lender</b> of last resort and argued against the over-accumulation of private debt in the financial markets.|$|E

25|$|These {{cultural}} and political activities blended with Zissu's activity {{in the realm of}} business. In 1920, he administered a sugar factory in Ripiceni, Botoșani County. He also worked in an iron forge and for several forestry firms Neamț County, and later owned both the Ripiceni factory and the Omega Oil Press in Bucharest. Reportedly, Zissu's wealth allowed him to act as <b>a</b> <b>lender</b> or benefactor for Romanian and Jewish intellectuals, including journalist-philosopher Nae Ionescu (before Ionescu's turn to antisemitism). From 1924, he sponsored the Jewish modernist Vilna Troupe, which he relocated to Bucharest. In 1929, with revenues from the sugar industry, he commissioned Michael Rachlis, the Russian architect, to build him a luxurious Art Deco home in Berlin-Grunewald, currently known as Villa Zissu.|$|E
25|$|Banking {{institutions}} in the United States are required to hold reservesamounts of currency and deposits in other banksequal to {{only a fraction of}} the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as <b>a</b> <b>lender</b> of last resort when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929.|$|E
