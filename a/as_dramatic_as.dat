5|$|After Stephen's death, Henry II succeeded to {{the throne}} of England. Henry vigorously re-established royal {{authority}} {{in the aftermath of}} the civil war, dismantling castles and increasing revenues, although several of these trends had begun under Stephen. The destruction of castles under Henry was not <b>as</b> <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> once thought, and although he restored royal revenues, the economy of England remained broadly unchanged under both rulers. Stephen's remaining son William I of Blois was confirmed as the Earl of Surrey by Henry, and prospered under the new regime, with the occasional point of tension with Henry. Stephen's daughter Marie I of Boulogne also survived her father; she had been placed in a convent by Stephen, but after his death she left and married. Stephen's middle son, Baldwin, and second daughter, Matilda, had died before 1147 and were buried at Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate. Stephen probably had three illegitimate sons, Gervase, Ralph and Americ, by his mistress Damette; Gervase became Abbot of Westminster in 1138, but after his father's death Gervase was removed by Henry in 1157 and died shortly afterwards.|$|E

25|$|Charles passed several {{laws that}} appealed to the upper class, but angered the middle class. The {{situation}} {{came to a head}} when he appointed a new minister on 8 August 1829 who did not have the confidence of the chamber. The chamber censured the king on 18 March 1830 and in response Charles proclaimed five ordinances on 26 July intended to silence criticism against him. This almost resulted in another revolution <b>as</b> <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> the one in 1789, but moderates were able to control the situation.|$|E
25|$|Johnson's {{entry into}} office would prove just <b>as</b> <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> his {{campaign}}. One {{of the campaign}} issues had been a valuable piece of city-owned downtown lakefront property, which outgoing mayor John H. Farley and the council had agreed to hand over to the railroads without compensation. Johnson obtained a court injunction to stop the giveaway, but it was set to expire {{three days after the}} election. Taking advantage of a legal technicality to get the new mayor sworn in early, Johnson's men staged a surprise takeover of City Hall and saved the land for the city (today this land, with later landfill additions, holds Cleveland Browns Stadium, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center).|$|E
25|$|Brownsville has {{consistently}} been {{considered to be}} the murder capital of New York City, with the 73rd Precinct ranking 69th safest out of 69 city precincts for per-capita crime in 2009. That year, there were 3 murders per 10,000 residents (higher than in any other neighborhood in the city), making for 28 overall murders in Brownsville; in overall crime, the 73rd Precinct was the 66th safest out of 69 neighborhoods. In the fifteen years between 1990 and 2005, reports of murder in Brownsville–Ocean Hill dropped 63 percent (to 22 murders in 2005); robberies 79 percent (to 597 in 2005); and felony assaults decreased 51 percent (to 562 in 2005). Crime rates in Brownsville had declined in the same manner that they had elsewhere in the city, but the declines were not <b>as</b> <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> {{in other areas of the}} city, with 72 people shot and 15 killed in Brownsville in 2013. At 348 per 100,000 adult residents in prison, Brownsville's incarceration rate is three times the city's as a whole and higher than all but one other neighborhood's incarceration rate. At a non-fatal assault rate of 180 per 100,000 people, Brownsville also sees the most violent crimes per capita out of any neighborhood in the city. By contrast, Morrisania, a Bronx neighborhood that once had a crime rate as high as Brownsville's, saw its crime rate decline by 25 percent between 1998 and 2011, while Brownsville's crime rate stayed roughly even during the same time period.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics.

Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, {{on the edge of my}} seat. And the appearance of the caped figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was <b>as</b> <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> could be." ...|$|E

[...] However MSN's Danielle Cheeseman said that [...] "Trouble" [...] being a safe return to what Lewis has always done wasn't necessarily a good thing. In her review, Cheeseman called the song the [...] "same melodrama" [...] as past Lewis songs and that due to the song sounding familiar to Sandé's song [...] "Daddy", [...] "Lewis has yet to find her own stride". Corner featured [...] "Trouble" [...] on his weekly playlist [...] "10 Songs You Need to Hear" [...] for the week beginning 27 August 2012. There he described elaborated that the song was a welcome return for Lewis thanks to [...] "big beats, big strings and even bigger vocals". Whilst the majority of reviews praised Gambino's appearance on the song, Cheeseman described the collaboration as [...] "a saviour" [...] but that it did nothing for Lewis' [...] "credibility". Her review was subtitled [...] "Leona Lewis Tries to Convince Us She's 'Trouble' — We're not buyin' what she's sellin'" [...] and concluded that if the best that Glassheart could preview after all the delays was [...] "Trouble", [...] "it won't be worth the wait."

[...] McGready complained that Kentuckians were worldly people whose conversations were “of corn and tobacco, or land and stock…. the name of Jesus has no charms; and it is rarely mentioned unless to be profaned."

2500|$|The {{history of}} the Armenian nobility is <b>as</b> <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> that of the Armenian people. Sometimes, during {{internal}} feuds, entire noble houses would be exterminated. Many Armenian aristocratic families perished during wars with foreign invaders, notably Arabs and Turks. The latter quickly realized that the Armenian state {{was based on the}} national aristocracy and thus adopted policies of annihilation of the Armenian nobility. For example, in 705 the ostikan (governor under the Arab caliphate) of Armenia deceitfully invited around 800 Armenian noblemen together with their guards to Nakhichevan as if for negotiations and massacred them all. Nevertheless, some Armenian noble houses lived through this tragedy and continued their efforts to liberate the country. Some descendants of the Armenian nobility achieved high-ranking positions at foreign royal courts. For example, the offspring of the Armenian noble house of Artzruni became influential grandees at the Georgian court. The Georgian branch of the Armenian noble family of Bagratuni was enthroned as Bagrationi and became the reigning house in Georgia. An entire line of noblemen of Armenian descent reigned in Byzantium. As a result of dynastic marriages, the descendants of the Armenian royal house of Lusignan (Lusinian), a Frankish family who came to the Near East in the Crusades, once ruling over Cilicia and Cyprus, merged with the representatives of the west European royal dynasty of Savoy reigning in parts of Italy. Some other offspring of nakharar houses founded medieval Armenian aristocratic houses, such as the Cartozians, Proshians, Kyurikians, Orbelians, Artzrunis of Mahkanaberd, and the Tornikians, among others. These dynasties {{played a significant role in}} the struggle for the liberation of Armenia and the revival of Armenian statehood. In the 13th century particularly prominent were the Zakarian princes - brothers Zakare and Ivane - whose military strength and political influence in the united Armenian-Georgian state was so significant that they were de facto the fully-fledged rulers of the Armenian territories. The last strongholds of Armenian statehood were preserved by the semi-dependent princes (meliks) of Karabakh-Artsakh, also known as melikdoms of Khamsa (from Arabic word meaning [...] "five principalities). These principalities preserved their status until the annexation of eastern Armenia into the Russian Empire. The Russian emperors either accepted the noble titles of the Armenian aristocracy or themselves elevated prominent representatives of Armenian origin in an effort to use the potential of the Armenian nobility. During this period the noble houses of Madatian (Madatov), Lazarian (Lazarev), Beybutian (Beybutov), Pirumyan (Pirumov), Loris-Melikian (Loris-Melikov) emerged.|$|E
