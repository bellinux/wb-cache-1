In 1833, Benjamin's son, James Stephenson owned the title to the Stephenson House, but by the next year it was owned by the wife of Stephenson family friend Ninian Edwards, Elvira, who held the deed until 1837. Another owner, Frederick Wolf, purchased the home in 1838 and made significant alterations {{to the house in}} 1845, tearing down the detached kitchen and adding an ell to the building. That family occupied the home until at least 1894. Others who owned the house also made alterations including J. Frank Dickman in 1902; other changes were made during the 1940s. Rev.

50|$|History {{of trade}} fairs in Zagreb {{dates back to}} 1242 when the Hungarian king Bela IV issued a Golden Bull declaring Zagreb a free royal city and {{granting}} it the right to hold fairs. The first international exhibition in Zagreb was held in 1864. Zagreb Assembly (Zagrebački zbor), the predecessor to Zagreb Fair, was founded {{by a group of}} Croatian businessmen, including Ferdinand Budicki and Samuel David Alexander. The Assembly was one of the co-founding institutions of The Global Association of the Exhibition Industry in 1925. At the ascent of the communist regime, in 1946, Zagreb Assembly was disbanded and its property and role was taken over by the newly incorporated Zagreb Fair. The Zagreb Fair was also the first fair held in post-World War II Yugoslavia in 1947. In 1956 it was relocated to the newly constructed Novi Zagreb part of the city south of the river Sava. During the European migrant crisis in 2015, when over 39.000 migrants from the Middle East, South Asia and Africa entered Croatia, the fairgrounds served as an <b>acceptance</b> center <b>housing</b> over 1.200 migrants.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Changing {{demographics}} and lifestyles in Thailand are eroding traditional patterns of family {{support for the}} elderly. Caring for the elderly within the family structure is no longer assured. However, the concept of living in retirement housing is unfamiliar to most senior Thai citizens. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the acceptance of nontraditional retirement housing by pre-retirees in Thailand. The study was based on Rogers' (1995) theory on diffusion of innovations. Personal innovativeness toward <b>housing</b> and <b>acceptance</b> of nontraditional retirement housing of an age-stratified sample of 423 faculty pre-retirees at selected Thai universities, representing metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, were examined. Four types of housing, perceived as new options to Thai people, were considered: the universal designed single detached house (SD); Elder Cottage Housing Opportunity or "granny flat" (ECHO); congregate housing (CH), and the Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC). Independent variables were demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, education, and income) and housing characteristics (tenure status, dwelling expenditure, current housing type, and location). Data were collected during February 2002 through a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive analyses of the independent variables were presented in frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, and t-tests and ANOVA were conducted for comparison of variables. Stepwise multiple regression and nonparametric correlation were utilized to test seven null hypotheses. Results dictated rejection of six of the seven null hypotheses. A relationship between personal innovativeness toward housing and gender, income, and education level were found. Males and those with higher income had higher mean innovativeness scores. However, those with higher education levels had lower innovativeness toward housing. Females had higher mean acceptance scores for combined non-traditional housing types. Of the four housing types, the universal designed single detached house (SD) was the most acceptable, followed by Continuing Care Retirement Housing (CCRC). Metropolitan respondents were more accepting of the CCRC than non-metropolitan. A positive correlation was found between personal innovativeness toward <b>housing</b> and <b>acceptance</b> of non-traditional <b>housing</b> types. Personal innovativeness also mediated the effect of demographic and <b>housing</b> characteristics on <b>acceptance</b> of all non-traditional retirement housing types. Respondents showed a medium level of personal innovativeness and a medium to high level of <b>acceptance</b> of non-traditional <b>housing</b> types. Mass media communication was suggested to promote awareness and knowledge of non-traditional housing types to prospective elderly housing consumers.

40|$|Rapid {{population}} growth, changing demographic profiles {{and increased}} focus on sustainable urban form {{has led to}} significant changes in settlement patterns in Australian cities. Growth management strategies are increasingly employed to help cities manage strain on infrastructure, housing and ecosystems. Urban consolidation is one such strategy and has been adopted by all Australian capital cities. Despite strong governmental support, urban consolidation has triggered much academic debate and has often been accompanied by staunch community opposition and complaints from the development industry about barriers to the provision of higher density housing. Greater understanding of stakeholder representations of higher density housing is important for planning, given the strong policy focus on urban consolidation nationally. This paper contributes to existing urban consolidation literature by empirically demonstrating how urban consolidation is represented in Brisbane’s newspaper media {{through the use of}} metaphors. Its conceptual departure point is Social Representations Theory, drawing on the theory’s notion of objectification to illustrate how the media translates the abstract notion of urban consolidation into a tangible and understandable object. The objectification of urban consolidation is identified and discussed relative to four themes: land use conflict; growth; neighbourhood change and apartment living. This paper argues that understanding stakeholder representations is important for planners seeking to promote and negotiate delivery of higher density development. It concludes that stakeholder representations can highlight key areas of contention to be addressed by planners, provide indications on the likelihood of public <b>acceptance</b> of increased <b>housing</b> densities and delineate the boundaries of urban consolidation debates...|$|R

Design – Qualitative study involving the participant librarians keeping a reflective journal of all interactions with the subjects involved in the first 6 months of the study (September 1974 – March 1975). Setting – Hartford Hospital, Connecticut. Subjects – Teaching physicians, house staff, and medical students at Hartford Hospital. Methods – This pilot project, funded by a two-year grant from the U. S. Public Health service and the National Library of Medicine, placed three medical librarians (two full-time and one part-time) on rounds with pediatrics, medicine, and surgery teams. The librarians kept diaries to record “critical incidents” (p. 86), including the “acceptance of the program, its impact on patient care, its potential for changing the information seeking behavior of health professionals, and its usefulness for developing a core collection of clinical readings” (p. 86). Main Results – Despite a few physicians’ initial apprehension, each of the three clinical librarians recorded indications of acceptance by clinical staff, including a dramatic increase in literature search requests; increased phone calls, drop-ins, pages, and requests for research assistance; and gestures of <b>acceptance</b> from <b>house</b> staff and students. More broadly, the literature searches in Lamb’s report identifies direct patient care (including to “resolve a debate” (p. 84)), medical teaching/education, and searching techniques for clinicians. It is implied that these interactions resulted in a higher profile of the resources and services offered through the library; as one patron queried, “Would you show me how to find articles and where everything is in the library sometime?” (p. 83). Conclusions – The authors state that while their conclusions are only preliminary and no firm conclusions can be drawn, there are four observations of note: 1. The clinical librarian can be accepted as part of a patient care teaching team by contributing to educational activities. 2. The clinical librarian provides quick and useful information to assist in the decisions and management of patient problems. 3. There is an opportunity to strengthen and modify the information seeking behavior of the health professional. 4. As patient care questions recur, {{there is a need for}} a “patient care information system” which can be initiated and supported through the provision of photocopied articles (p. 86) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Housing) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. This study {{looks at}} the {{potential}} contribution of informal housing delivery in establishing enabling low-income housing standards in Kitwe, Zambia {{as a way of}} addressing the shortage of adequate and affordable housing for the urban poor. Informal housing delivery is increasingly being seen as the urban poors' response to the chronic shortage of housing in most cities in developing countries. Proponents of informal housing delivery have been alluding to the many positive impacts that informal housing has on the poor households since the 1960 's. This aspect is slowly gaining <b>acceptance</b> in many <b>housing</b> policies in developing countries that are now opting to work with rather than forcefully relocated informal dwellers. The Zambia National Housing Policy set an ambitious list of objectives aimed at realising its goal of providing adequate and affordable housing to all income groups in the country, including the reform of housing standards which currently inhibit the incorporation of informal housing techniques and materials into conventional practices. However, {{there appears to be no}} framework within which this objective will be achieved. The study, therefore, investigated the positive attributes of informal housing delivery through a literature review of standards and general discourse and policies regarding traditional, informal and formal housing settlements. Through the literature review, a set of indicators was established to measure and analyse informal housing standards prevailing in Kamatipa, an informal settlement north of the city of Kitwe in Zambia and building regulations that substantially hinder the incorporation of these standards into conventional low-income housing standards. They study establishes a number of positive attributes of informal housing in Kamatipa and the regulations that they contravene under current standards. It concludes by making recommendations towards establishing guidelines for assimilating these positive elements in a reformed regulatory framework to achieve enabling low-income housing standards in the city and country...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA (Geography and Environmental Studies) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In 2004, {{the then}} Department of Housing’s Breaking New Ground (BNG) policy {{introduced}} {{a compilation of}} principles that underlie a sustainable human settlement. The principles were aimed at guiding, amongst others, municipal officials in the decisions they take {{when faced with a}} housing development project. This thesis will set out to determine how municipal officials have taken up BNG’s principles for sustainable housing settlements as well as the perceptions, methods of implementation and degree of <b>acceptance</b> that <b>housing</b> and town planning managers have of BNG. In the study, the perceived relevance that these managers have of BNG within their non-metropolitan towns is explored using five of the fifteen leader towns of the Western Cape Province. This research has shown that BNG considers the compact urban form, coupled to other development considerations, as the most sustainable for South Africa. In terms of building sustainable human settlements: the low-income housing unit has evolved substantially since its conception, and that the current unit is held in far higher regard (by both municipalities and beneficiaries) than its predecessors. The design of this unit remains standardised {{due to a lack of}} funding for a more flexible design, but its structure allows for additions to be made at the cost of the beneficiary. Funding thus remains a major constraint to housing delivery. Municipalities feel that they are able to implement BNG, but that there are certain shortcomings in the document which prevent its full implementation. One of these shortcomings is the lack of an external funding mechanism for housing delivery, proposed in BNG, but never having materialised. Further, BNG focuses more on the metropolitan scenario and is not always relevant to non-metropolitan towns. Almost all of the municipalities have initiated inner city regeneration projects, but fewer have included the provision of social housing as part of their inner city rejuvenation. Subsidy housing is the most implemented housing typology, but these units often experience decay due to the absence of original owners who have (mostly illegally) sold or rented out their units. The one-erf-one-unit nature of subsidy housing is not seen as sustainable owing to space limitation experienced by most of the municipalities interviewed. Contrary to earlier research, in situ upgrading is a common occurrence in municipalities. However, there is a great need for stronger regional (or broader scale) planning regarding housing delivery. Low-income housing is strongly influenced by politics – a fact which municipalities say negatively influences housing delivery. Migration also poses a serious threat to municipal backlogs. Currently, the fight against an escalating demand for low-cost housing is a losing battle as the rate at which government is rolling out housing is vastly ineffectual. Municipalities deem that large-scale projects like the N 2 Gateway might be a solution to their housing backlogs which, they concur, are at crisis point. However, municipalities indicated that their implementation of large scale projects will not follow the same path as the N 2 Gateway – the planning of which is seen to be substandard. Currently, urban integration takes place on an income basis and not due to racial division. Inclusionary housing is seen as a relevant tool for the promotion of integration, but cannot be enforced to its full potential due to a lack of supporting legislation...|$|R

The teenager was born in normal condition then had an accident that caused him blind at the age of teenage, will face many changes on him self, in physic also in psychologic. These sudden changes will appear negative emotions on him, because he must do some self acceptance process which take a certain time until he could accept his present condition. This research is aimed to identify the scetch of self acceptance process of the blind teenager, also the factors which support and barrier the self acceptance. The design of this research is using the descriptive qualitative approach. The subject of this research is 2 blind teenagers who learn the self <b>acceptance</b> in deformity <b>house</b> of “Budi Mulya” Malang. The technique – use in picking the subject is purposive sampling. The method of collecting the data is using interview. The technique of analyzing the data is using triangulation. The result of this research shows that the two teenagers were physically normal then suddenly got an accident and became blind teenagers. They used to be rejected their blind condition, got angry, depressed and finally they could accept themselves. These self acceptance are fluctuative and not stabil. Which means, the process of self acceptance could be repeated when the subject again facing some conflict which he could not solve them and also the negative thought of his condition. As for information that a woman (Subject) takes a longer time to accept herself than a man. This condition is caused by the way of facing problems, woman usually uses her emotions while a man uses minds. Woman is easy to fall down when the problem is about her physical matter while a man would fall down if the matter is about respect. However, the subject’s self acceptance will be last if he has a great hope. This thing is also supported by the religious approach with the same sufferers, so that he could think more positive, be realistic and motivates himself to go straight forward...|$|R
40|$|Environmental concerns, {{together}} with increasing development costs {{have created the}} need for urban housing which can provide {{an alternative to the}} popular, but low density detached house. Coaxing Australians into denser housing, however, is proving a difficult task, particularly as many regard the detached house as the ideal home. The concept of home is extremely complex, incorporating many physical, social and psychological factors. However, attempting to understand and incorporate these attributes into the development of denser housing will surely produce a greater <b>acceptance</b> of urban <b>housing</b> in Australian cities. This approach must be preferable to simply insisting that Australians modify their lifestyles and values in order to accept urban housing. This thesis will explore one important component of housing design - spatial organisation, in order to establish its role and importance in creating home in Australia. Spatial organisation describes the method of arranging dwellings, external spaces and associated facilities on a site. It forms a particularly important consideration in the design of urban housing where it is often necessary to design a number of individual dwellings and functions on a common block of land. This research is therefore not concerned with the internal spatial arrangement of the dwelling, instead focusing on the relationship, both physically and socially, between the individual dwelling and the broader community and urban fabric. The major component of this research traces the historical development of spatial organisation in Australian housing. This occurred in two distinct phases involving: a) the modification of English cultural models; and b) the post World War II application of Modernist housing principles. These two phases were characterised by contrasting spatial organisations which produced very different concepts of home. The traditional model, for example, favoured individual and private homes whereas the Modernist models emphasised mass housing developments with communal facilities. Evaluation of these models reveal that many Australians have a clear preference for the domestic qualities produced by the traditional spatial organisation while contemporary housing design still incorporates many aspects of Modernist spatial organisation. This thesis examines this paradox from a number of perspectives and concludes with a new direction for spatial organisation in urban housing, based on an Australian perception of home. In addition, it demonstrates the value of multi-disciplinary research in the development of contemporary design theory, which balances the needs of the broader population against the inclinations of the design profession...|$|R
40|$|Canadian {{societies}} {{have developed a}} paradoxical relationship with change, where we commend “bold and visionary” leaders and adventurers, yet staunchly resist major change in our own lives. Nonetheless, instances of extensive and pervasive societal change inevitably occur. A notable example of current change is sustainable housing, now appearing in various forms throughout a diverse cross-section of society. This movement is {{in a period of}} growth and so there is still much to learn about how concepts of sustainability will take hold, and in terms of understanding who are effecting the changes we are starting to experience. Significantly, housing represents a sector that is directly linked to physical health, happiness, the economy and sustainability. Innovation has been the flash point for progress since the dawn of time. Advancement in thinking moves like a relay hurdler, taking even measured logical steps forward until periodically there is a leap, a movement up and over an obstacle into a new zone before the baton is passed to the next runner. These innovators present a new direction of thought and action, and challenge established procedures and routines. The aim of this thesis is to identify and understand influential sustainable housing innovators in order to determine whether it is possible to support them deliberately. The intended use of the results is to determine practical guidelines for sustainable housing innovators and organizations in hopes of improving their influence in the conventional housing arena. A varied and extensive literature review identifies key characteristics of societal leaders and innovators. Case studies, from North America and the Region of Waterloo focusing on the profiles of innovators from the sustainable housing sector are considered in the context of those characteristics. Primary data collection consisted of interviews and personal observations of several sustainable housing groups. Six key characteristics were found in influential sustainable housing innovators. Four were highlighted in the literature search (i. e. possessing charisma, a goal oriented personality and environmental ethic, and a willingness to share knowledge). Two more were derived from the primary data collection (i. e. community awareness and exceptionally effective collaborators and facilitators an ability to be an effective collaborator/facilitator). Results reveal that sustainable housing innovation may be integrated more effectively into mainstream practice in two ways: one, through education and marketing to reduce resistance from fear of the unknown and two, with the introduction of an intermediary moderator between innovators and official city or government decision makers. This study concludes that there are common key characteristics among influential sustainable housing innovators. Understanding those characteristics that identify such innovative leaders is an important step toward mainstream <b>acceptance</b> of sustainable <b>housing...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a body of work {{directed}} at enhancing the acceptance of photovoltaics in various sectors of the U. S. economy. The focus here is on residential applications. The work is funded by the U. S. Department of Energy as part of its photovoltaics program. Earlier work has considered the nature of institutional forces in the housing sector generally, including a study of several housing developments incorporating solar thermal technologies {{with the assistance of the}} HUD-DOE Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Program. This earlier work resulted in a series of papers summarizing the application of institutional analysis methods to housing, including a research design (Nutt-Powell, 1979), and preliminary sector explorations covering housing production (Swetky and Nutt-Powell, 1979), governmental involvement in housing (McDaniel and Nutt-Powell, 1979), research and socialization in housing (Furlong and Nutt-Powell, 1979), energy provision in housing (Reamer, Heim and Nutt-Powell, 1979), and standards in housing (Parker and Nutt-Powell, 1979). The housing development case studies are reported in three papers (Nutt-Powell et al., 1979; Nutt-Powell, 1979 b; Parker, 1980.) Additionally a separate analysis was undertaken of the HUD-DOE program, focused on implications for program design of PV <b>acceptance</b> in the <b>housing</b> sector (Nutt-Powell, 1980). This analytic work has paralleled and contributed to development of specific approaches to residential acceptance, including a Residential Application Implementation Plan (MIT EL/LL, 1979). The various studies and plans completed to date have taken a very broad view of the housing sector. As the technology develops, coming closer to cost and production feasibility on a large scale, it is appropriate to begin more detailed analyses of the housing sector. Among such detailed analyses are those considering the possibilities for acceptance of PV among different modes of housing construction. This paper is one such analysis. The focus is on that form of housing production defined as "mobile-component housing," a type of housing built in a factory to a single national construction standard administered by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. There are four sections in this paper. The first section describes the structure of the manufactured housing industry. It provides definitions and terminology necessary to a discussion of mobile-component housing. It then reviews the production activity and approach, distribution, consumer and financing for this mode of housing. The second section presents the product characteristics of mobile-component housing. The third section reviews solar technologies, and discusses their relation to mobile-component housing. The fourth section focuses specifically on factors influencing receptivity to solar by the mobile-component housing industry. The conclusion to this paper summarizes the analysis as it relates to the possibilities for photovoltaics in mobile-component housing...|$|R
