25|$|Anders briefly {{served as}} {{a fellow of the}} American Enterprise Institute, then joined General Electric in September 1977. As Vice President and General Manager of GE's Nuclear Products Division in San Jose, California, he was {{responsible}} for the manufacture of nuclear fuel, reactor internal equipment, and control and instrumentation for GE boiling-water reactors at facilities located in San Jose and Wilmington, North Carolina. He also oversaw GE's partnership with Chicago Bridge and Iron for making large steel pressure vessels in Memphis, Tennessee. In August 1979, Anders began attending Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program. On the first day of 1980, Anders was appointed General Manager of the GE Aircraft Equipment Division. Headquartered in Utica, New York, the division included more than 8,500 employees in five locations in the northeastern U.S. Its products included aircraft flight and weapon control systems, cockpit instruments, <b>aircraft</b> <b>electrical</b> generating systems, airborne radars and data processing systems, electronic countermeasures, space command systems, and aircraft/surface multi-barrel armament systems.|$|E
2500|$|The Airacuda {{was also}} {{saddled with a}} complex and temperamental {{electrical}} system and was the only aircraft ever built to rely on an independent auxiliary power unit (APU) to power both engine fuel pumps, {{as well as all}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>electrical</b> systems. Systems usually powered by an aircraft's engines were instead powered by the single generator. The generator, with its own supercharger, was located in the belly of the aircraft. In the event of a failure (and they occurred frequently), the crew was instructed to begin immediate emergency restart procedures as the aircraft basically shut down. When the APU failed, the pilot had [...] "NO fuel pressure, NO vacuum, NO hydraulic pressure, NO gear, NO flaps and NO ENGINES".|$|E
50|$|On January 24, 2012, a Pinnacle CRJ-200 {{was damaged}} beyond repair at T.F. Green Airport in Providence, Rhode Island. A piece of ground {{equipment}} to which the aircraft was connected caught fire, severely damaging the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>electrical</b> systems.|$|R

5000|$|The {{annunciator}} panel may display warnings or cautions {{that are not}} necessarily indicative of a problem; for example, a Cessna 172 on its after-landing roll will often flicker the [...] "Volts" [...] warning simply due to the idle throttle position and therefore the lower voltage output of the alternator to the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>electrical</b> system.|$|R

5000|$|The NTSB deduced {{that the}} cause of the {{accident}} was the [...] "controller's issuance and the flight crew's subsequent acceptance of an incomplete and ambiguous holding clearance".

50|$|Upon {{returning}} to the tail, the trio found that the batteries were too heavy to take back to the fuselage, which lay uphill from the tail section. They decided instead {{that it would be}} more effective to return to the fuselage and disconnect the radio system from the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>electrical</b> mainframe, take it back to the tail, and connect it to the batteries. One of the other team members, Roy Harley, was an amateur electronics enthusiast, and they recruited his help in the endeavour. Unknown to any of the team members, the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>electrical</b> system used alternating current while the batteries in the tail produced direct current, making the plan futile from the beginning. After several days of trying to make the radio work, they gave up and returned to the fuselage with the knowledge {{that they would have to}} climb out of the mountains if they were to have any hope of being rescued.|$|R
25|$|The {{defensive}} armament {{consisted of}} six remote-controlled retractable gun turrets, and fixed tail and nose turrets. Each turret was fitted with two 20mm cannons, {{for a total}} of 16. Recoil vibration from gunnery practice often caused the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>electrical</b> wiring to jar loose or the vacuum tube electronics to malfunction, leading to failure of the aircraft controls and navigation equipment; this contributed to the crash of B-36B 44-92035 on 22 November 1950.|$|R
50|$|In September 2013, Dillon Aero {{released}} the DGP2300 gun pod for the M134D-H. It contains 3,000 rounds, enough ammunition {{to fire the}} minigun for a full minute. The system is entirely self-contained, {{so it can be}} mounted on any aircraft that can handle the weight, rotational torque, and recoil force (190 lb) of the gun. The pod has its own battery which can be wired into the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>electrical</b> system to maintain a charge.|$|R
50|$|In <b>aircraft,</b> <b>electrical</b> bonding {{prevents}} {{static electricity}} build-up that {{can interfere with}} radio and navigational equipment.

5000|$|The 3600th FTW {{became the}} {{dedicated}} training organization for both USAF and NATO pilots in the F-84.

They were replaced by F-84E, and shortly afterwards to the F-84G which was then in use by SAC.

50|$|All of {{the above}} {{considerations}} are basic to the engine running on its own and, at the same time, doing nothing useful, i.e. it is not moving an aircraft or supplying energy for the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>electrical,</b> hydraulic and air systems. In the aircraft the engine gives away some of its thrust-producing potential, or fuel, to power these systems. These requirements, which cause installation losses, reduce its efficiency.
