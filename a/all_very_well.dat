Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, and she hoped that he would grow bored with music, often telling him, [...] "The guitar's <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> John, but you'll never make a living out of it".

Harrison and Klein quashed the idea, but an English version of the Concert for Bangladesh did take place, on 18 September, before 30,000 fans at The Oval in south London, with a bill featuring the likes of the Who, the Faces, Mott the Hoople, America and Lindisfarne. On 22 September, George and Pattie Harrison arrived home in the UK, with mixing having been completed on the upcoming live album, and Harrison due to meet with Patrick Jenkin of the British Treasury, to deal with the unforeseen obstacle of a [...] "purchase tax" [...] being levied on the album.

500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It is <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E

2500|$|Entry to Neath was <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> {{having been}} chosen {{because of the}} {{convenience}} of simply building down from Onllwyn to Neath in the Dulais Valley. Swansea, however, was a much more attractive destination, and the N set about thinking how that place might be reached. The Swansea Vale Railway had been opened in stages down to 1861; it ran from Swansea to Ystalyfera, and was not far {{to the west of}} the N line. The decision was taken to build a connecting line, and this became the Swansea Vale & Neath & Brecon Junction Railway. It was incorporated by Act of 29 July 1864 to run from Colbren, a little north of Onllwyn, to a junction with the Swansea Vale Railway at Ynysygeinon. This railway became known as [...] "the Junction line".|$|E

Business Week listed a number of difficult fundamental questions finance ministers would now have to resolve by the end of March.

However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, [...] "It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back [...] "is very welcome". He comments, [...] "Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good.

[...] When they responded that they [...] "did not commit the folly of god-denial, [...] avoided with equal care the folly of god-assertion", Darwin gave a {{thoughtful}} response, concluding that [...] "I am with you in thought, but I should prefer the word Agnostic to the word Atheist." [...] Aveling replied that, [...] "after all, 'Agnostic' was but 'Atheist' writ respectable, and 'Atheist' was only 'Agnostic' writ aggressive." [...] Darwin smiled and responded [...] "Why should you be so aggressive? Is anything gained by trying to force these new ideas upon the mass of mankind? It is <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> for educated, cultured, thoughtful people; but are the masses yet ripe for it?" [...] Aveling and B√ºchner questioned {{what would have happened}} if Darwin had been given that advice before publication of the Origin, and had confined [...] "the revolutionary truths of Natural and Sexual Selection to the judicious few", where would the world be? Many feared danger if new ideas were [...] "proclaimed abroad on the house-tops, and discussed in market-place and home. But he, happily for humanity, had by the gentle, irresistible power of reason, forced his new ideas upon the mass of the people. And the masses had been found ripe for it. Had he kept silence, the tremendous strides taken by human thought during the last twenty-one years would have been shorn of their fair proportions, perhaps had hardly been made at all. His own illustrious example was encouragement, was for a command to every thinker to make known to all his fellows that which he believed to be the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the onset}} of the First World War in September 1914, Kirchner volunteered for {{military}} service. In July 1915 he was sent to Halle an der Saale to train as a driver in the reserve unit of the 75th Mansfeld Field Artillery Regiment. Kirchner's riding instructor, Professor Hans Fehr, arranged for Kirchner to be discharged after a mental breakdown. [...] Kirchner then returned to Berlin and continued to work, producing many paintings including Self-Portrait as a Soldier (1915); in December 1915 he was admitted to Dr. Kohnstamm‚Äôs sanatorium in K√∂nigstein in Taunus, where he was diagnosed with a strong dependency on Veronal, and alcoholism. In a letter to Dr. Karl Hagemann, a friend and patron, Kirchner writes: [...] "After lengthy struggles I now find myself here for a time to put my mind into some kind of order. It is a terribly difficult thing, of course, to be among strangers so much of the day. But perhaps I‚Äôll be able to see and create something new. For the time being, I would like more peace and absolute seclusion. Of course, I long more and more for my work and my studio. Theories may be <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> for keeping a spiritual balance, but they are grey and shadowy compared with work and life". Throughout 1916, Kirchner periodically returned to Berlin for a few weeks at a time to continue his work at his studio; he also produced a series of oil paintings, and many drawings, during his stays in K√∂nigstein. After an exhibition of his work in at the gallery of Ludwig Schames, in Frankfurt am Main, in October 1916, Kirchner sold many works and began to do well financially. In December, he suffered from a nervous breakdown and was admitted to Dr. Edel‚Äôs sanatorium in Berlin Charlottenburg.|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Byrdmaniax {{was greeted}} {{positively}} by the UK music press but received scathing reviews in the U.S. [...] Richard Meltzer's {{review in the}} August 1971 edition of Rolling Stone magazine was particularly vicious, with Meltzer describing the album as [...] "increments of pus". [...] The same review also described the McGuinn‚ÄìLevy composition [...] "I Wanna Grow Up to Be a Politician" [...] as a song that was [...] "degenerating into namby pamby innocuous mickey mouse with latent-blatant political content". [...] Meltzer concluded his withering attack by deriding The Byrds themselves as [...] "a boring dead group." [...] In the UK, Roy Hollingworth's review in the August 14, 1971 edition of Melody Maker was more positive and described the album as [...] "one sweet length of bursting Byrds sunshine, so perfect in quality and quantity you'd feel an absolute heel to ask for more." [...] Record Mirror was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, describing it as [...] "another fine album by The Byrds." [...] However, not all British reviews of Byrdmaniax were positive, with Richard Green of the NME noting that [...] "When the true history of rock comes to be written, The Byrds will get a deserved place of honour {{on the strength of}} tunes like 'Mr. Tambourine Man', 'Eight Miles High', and 'So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star'. [...] Hopefully the writer will not have listened to Byrdmaniax or he may drastically alter his opinion."
