5|$|When I got {{the call}} , I was like, 'I don't know if that's me. She was like, 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
25|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> {{had very}} little idea how the story would go. But then {{suddenly}} Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.|$|E

The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding {{the use of public}} space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to think there was the potential to create a phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|During {{a string}} of soundtrack releases, Beyoncé commented on the song with Billboard stating, [...] "A lot of music was written {{especially}} for the film. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> {{was concerned about the}} timing of the soundtrack, [...] my solo album was supposed to come out way before the movie. But then the solo album got delayed." [...] While later announcing the release of the soundtrack album in a press release, Beyoncé said: ...|$|E
500|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> {{thought we}} were going to work on one song; that was the {{original}} plan. Let's try to work on one song and take it from there -- not spend too much time thinking about the legend, and do something that just makes sense. [...] We did one song and another song, and we were having fun making music. And actually it was a very privileged time. She wasn't under any kind of pressure, she had time to spend on it; it was the only thing she had to work on.|$|E

500|$|Lauren {{is portrayed}} by actress Ashley Fink. She made routine guest {{appearances}} throughout the first season, {{and became a}} member of the McKinley High glee club in the episode [...] "Special Education". Upon receiving the script in which Lauren joins the club, Fink initially reacted with disbelief. She commented, [...] "I didn't quite believe it <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> thought I was getting Punk'd." [...] She said that being cast in Glee makes her feel like [...] "the luckiest girl in the world". Fink's favorite element of Glee is how series creator Ryan Murphy manages to take the underdogs and make them shine. She said, [...] "In life, there's so much diversity, and it's not necessarily represented on television. I think Glee is one of the few shows that actually displays the diversity and it’s just so inspirational." [...] When asked about her casting process, Fink said: ...|$|E

500|$|Ornstein soon {{moved in}} a very {{different}} direction. He began imagining and then writing works with new sounds, dissonant and startling. Ornstein himself was unsettled by the earliest of these compositions: [...] "I really doubted my sanity <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> simply said, what is that? It was so completely removed from any experience I ever had." [...] On March 27, 1914, in London, he gave his first public performance of works then called [...] "futurist", now known as modernist. In addition to a Busoni arrangement of three Bach choral preludes and several pieces by Schoenberg, Ornstein played a number of his own compositions. The concert caused a major stir. One newspaper described Ornstein's work as [...] "the sum of Schoenberg and Scriabine [...] squared." [...] Others were less analytical: [...] "We have never suffered from such insufferable hideousness, expressed in terms of so-called music." ...|$|E
500|$|Although by {{the early}} 1960s Levin was {{becoming}} a well-known name, his was not yet a well-known face. Meeting him in London the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis did not immediately recognise him: [...] "He looks about sixteen, and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> thought he was someone’s little boy brought along to see the fun – very Jewish, with wavy fairish hair, very intelligent and agreeable to talk to". In 1963 Levin was invited to appear regularly on BBC television's new weekly late-night satirical revue, That Was The Week That Was, where he delivered monologues to camera about his pet hates and conducted interviews, appearing as [...] "a tiny figure taking on assorted noisy giants in debate". The programme, which had a short but much-discussed run, was transmitted live; this added to its edginess and impact, but also made it prone to disruption. Levin was twice assaulted on air, once by the husband of an actress whose show Levin had reviewed severely, and once by a woman astrologer who squirted him with water.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), Jozen Cummings from PopMatters {{described}} the song's production and instrumentation: [...] "The track is vintage Neptunes with big drums and intergalactic sound effects, and Carey {{adds to the}} breezy, easygoing feel of the song with a voice that is sexy, but subtle, like a shy woman who doesn’t need to {{say anything at all}} to get a man’s attention." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] recalls an encounter in which a male expresses interest in having a sexual affair in a bathroom with a female, while she agrees and responds [...] "If its worth you're while / Say somethin' good to me". In an interview with Newsweek, Carey described how she felt regarding the song: [...] "You're right. It is a totally different approach for me musically. When I heard it <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> thought it was a cool and interesting track, but I didn't know if it was very me." [...] Additionally, Carey outed the lines [...] "Something like volcanic / You and me seems organic / Just like stars and planets" [...] as [...] "nonesense", but claimed she [...] "loved it".|$|E

500|$|In late 2011, Bieber {{confirmed}} to radio network Capital FM {{that he was}} recording material for his third studio album, which was originally going {{to be released in}} early 2012. He later spoke to MTV News and revealed that Believe would surprise people in different ways, since it musically is a departure from his previous works. [...] "Boyfriend" [...] was written by Bieber, Michael Posner, Mason D. Levy and Mat Musto. During an interview with radio DJ Bootleg Kev, Posner revealed that he was impressed with Bieber's work ethic, and further commented, [...] "he's super talented. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> didn't know what to expect because he's super young, but dude can write." [...] Posner said that people would [...] "flip" [...] over the beat and that radio stations would want to play the song. Levy also commented on the track, and described it as [...] "definitely edgier, it's more grown-up, it's more developed and it's sexier." [...] Prior to the song's release, it had been previewed by several industry insiders, including radio host Mick Lee of WZFT, who said that the song was [...] "so much different than his previous music.|$|E
500|$|Early in {{the writing}} process, Donegan created guitar riffs. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote {{the rest of the}} music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, [...] "The writing process is... pretty much the same since the beginning... of this band. It's always been riffs; {{something}} musically that I'll come up with [...]" [...] Wengren commented, [...] "We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really until we get home and we are able to clear our minds, decompress for a little bit, and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life." [...] Bassist John Moyer left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, [...] "When the basic guitar, bass, [...] drums were being laid down, <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> didn't really see a whole lot of room for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics." ...|$|E
500|$|Goater's trial {{resulted}} in the offer of a professional contract, {{but he did not}} break into the first team. In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first team football. At this time, Goater suffered homesickness, finding it difficult to adapt to the English climate: [...] "It took me a good two years to get used to life in England. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> thought the sun never shone and it wasn't for me." [...] However, he gradually got used to living in England, and over the course of seven seasons at Rotherham he gained a reputation as a reliable lower division striker, scoring 86 goals in 262 appearances, with a winner's medal for the 1996 Auto Windscreens Shield the highlight. A 1992 League Cup tie against Everton gave Goater his first experience of playing against a Premier League team. In the first leg, Goater scored the only goal of the game as Rotherham won 1–0. However, Everton won the return leg 3–0 and Rotherham were eliminated. In 1993, Goater also had a brief loan spell at Notts County, though he made only one appearance for the Nottingham club due to a work permit problem. Towards the end of the 1995–96 season, Goater had a disagreement with Rotherham manager Archie Gemmill, and decided his future lay elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|Of the {{starring}} cast, Pryce, Hurt, Redgrave and Tutin {{were already}} established screen actors, while Ayola had previously only acted theatrically. She appraised of her screen debut: [...] "it {{was a wonderful}} experience {{for me to be}} appearing alongside so many established names. It was very exciting although I must admit <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> was a bit daunted by the prospect." [...] The film featured several minor black characters, either as members of Gabriel's family, or as workers aboard the ship. When these roles were cast, complaints were made by black members of the British actors' union to the BBC and the Department of Employment at having been [...] "passed over" [...] in favour of overseas artists. The film was shot from 23 September to 6 November 1992. It was funded in the most part by the BBC, though a quarter of the budget came from the American Miramax. While Kidron had previously come to dislike directing for major studios when filming My Cousin Vinny for Fox, she found the low budget of Great Moments in Aviation [...] "just as horrendous a compromise". Though originally intended for theatrical release, the film failed to find theatrical distribution. It was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994, then broadcast in Britain on BBC Two on 11 November 1995. It was released on video in the United States under the alternate title Shades of Fear two years later, on 11 November 1997.|$|E
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E
