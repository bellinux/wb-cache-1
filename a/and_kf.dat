30|$|Temporal {{smoothness}} is a {{key factor}} for the human visual system to evaluate the visual quality during the playback of a video sequence. Generally, a decoded video sequence with lower flicker is more preferable, whether for conventional video coding schemes or DVC schemes. In particular, a DVC scheme will suffer from quality unbalance and thus annoying visual perception between <b>KFs</b> <b>and</b> WZFs if the quantization parameters are not well chosen. The DISCOVER system suggested eight quantization parameter pairs (QM, QP) for WZFs <b>and</b> <b>KFs</b> according to heuristic experiments which target at maximizing the R-D performance while keeping image qualities of the WZFs <b>and</b> <b>KFs</b> similar. Even though the reconstructed WZFs <b>and</b> <b>KFs</b> have similar PSNRs, it is not guaranteed to have low flicker while playing the decoded video sequences. Intuitively, flickering artifacts can be reduced if the coding mode switch is kept less frequent [26]. This can normally be accomplished by choosing a larger GOP size.|$|R

40|$|Saturated {{hydraulic}} conductivity (<b>Kfs)</b> <b>and</b> macroscopic capillary length of soil pores are important hydraulic properties for water flow and solute transport modeling. Measuring these parameters is tedious, time consuming and expensive. One way is using indirect {{methods such as}} Pedotransfer functions (PTFs). The objective {{of this research was}} to develop some PTFs for estimating saturated {{hydraulic conductivity}} and inverse of macroscopic capillary length parameters (*). Therefore, the coefficients, <b>Kfs</b> <b>and</b> * from 60 points of Azadegan plain in Shahrekord were measured using single ring and multiple constant head method. Also, some of the readily available soil parameters from the two first pedogenic layers of the soils were obtained. Then, the desired PTFs were developed using stepwise multiple linear regression. The accuracy and reliability of the derived PTFs were evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE), mean error (ME), relative error (RE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The highest correlation coefficients of 0. 92 and 0. 72 were found between Kfs-bulk density and *-bulk density, respectively. There was no significant correlation between soil particle size distribution <b>and</b> <b>Kfs</b> <b>and</b> *. This can be related to {{the fact that most of}} the soil samples were similar in texture and macro pores. The most efficient PTFs in predicting <b>Kfs</b> <b>and</b> * could explain 85 and 66 percent of the variability of these parameters, respectively. All the derived PTFs underestimated the <b>Kfs</b> <b>and</b> * parameters...|$|R
