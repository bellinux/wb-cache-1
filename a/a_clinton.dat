5|$|Kagame has {{received}} many honours and accolades during his presidency. These include honorary {{degrees from the}} American University of the Pacific, Oklahoma Christian University, and the University of Glasgow, the Andrew Young Medal for Capitalism and Social Progress by Georgia State University, and <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> Global Citizen Award. Kagame has also received the highest awards bestowed by the countries of Liberia and Benin, the Distinction of the Grand Cordon in the Most Venerable Order of the Knighthood of Pioneers, and the Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit respectively. In September 2010, the British magazine New Statesman named Kagame one of its 50 most influential figures for that year, placing him in 49th place. The Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations football tournament has been named the Kagame Interclub Cup since 2002, due to Kagame's sponsorship of the event.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{endorsed}} Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton {{and made}} several high-profile speeches {{in favor of}} her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. She also appeared multiple times {{on the campaign trail}} in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton. On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> rally in Manchester, New Hampshire. A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regards to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.|$|E

25|$|In March 2014, {{the appeal}} of Judge Pregerson's ruling was argued before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, with a three-judge panel asking {{questions}} to both the appellants and the appellee, which was the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) rather than the lawsuit's official defendant, Los Angeles County. The panel was headed by Ninth Circuit Chief Justice Alex Kozinski, Circuit judge Susan P. Graber, <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> appointee, and Judge Jack Zouhary of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, a George W. Bush appointee.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} of March 2008, rumors that Obama was born in Kenya before being flown to Hawaii were spread on {{conservative}} websites, with the suggestion that this would disqualify Obama from the presidency. In April of that year, anonymous e-mails from supporters of Hillary Clinton repeated the same rumor, including <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> Iowa campaign worker, who was fired for sending the e-mail. These and numerous other chain e-mails during the subsequent presidential election circulated false rumors about Obama's origin, religion, and birth certificate.|$|E

5000|$|On January 19, The Boston Globe {{published}} <b>a</b> poll showing <b>Clinton</b> {{ahead of}} the field with 29 percent, Paul Tsongas with 17 percent, and Bob Kerrey 16. [...] Following this poll, reports of an extramarital affair between Clinton and Gennifer Flowers surfaced. <b>As</b> <b>Clinton</b> fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes following the Super Bowl to deny the charges. The Clinton campaign also weathered attacks concerning alleged draft dodging during the Vietnam War and the case of Ricky Ray Rector.|$|R
25|$|Before {{his term}} as {{governor}} ended, Matthews was nominated by David Turpie {{to run for}} president at the 1896 Democratic National Convention held in Chicago. Matthews was a leading candidate until the sixth ballot when his supporters switched to William Jennings Bryan after Bryan delivered an impassioned speech. Matthews left office and returned to his farm. He continued making occasional public appearances and delivering speeches. While delivering a speech in Montgomery County, he suffered a stroke and died three days later in an Indianapolis hospital on August 28, 1898. His body was returned to his home town and buried in <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> cemetery.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, Clinton {{scored a}} convincing win in Pennsylvania. However, on May 6, Obama {{surprised}} many observers by winning North Carolina by almost 15 percentage points, effectively erasing Clinton's gains in Pennsylvania. Clinton won by only 1 point in Indiana. With Obama now leading by 164 pledged delegates {{and with only}} 217 pledged delegates left to be decided in the remaining contests, many pundits declared that the primary was effectively over. Obama gave an election night speech that {{looked forward to the}} general election campaign against McCain. The pace of superdelegate endorsements increased. On May 10, Obama's superdelegate total surpassed Clinton's {{for the first time in}} the race, making the math increasingly difficult for <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> win.|$|E
25|$|On April 6, 2004, he was {{appointed}} dean of the Pepperdine University School of Law. He originally accepted a position at Pepperdine as the first dean of the newly created School of Public Policy in 1996; however, he withdrew from the appointment in 1998, several months after the Lewinsky controversy erupted. Critics charged {{that there was a}} conflict of interest due to substantial donations to Pepperdine from billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> critic who funded many media outlets attacking the president. (Scaife's money, however, supported the Foster-was-murdered theory, according to CNN, and Scaife defunded The American Spectator after it endorsed Starr's conclusion of suicide and mocked a Scaife-aided book.) In 2004, some five years after President Clinton's impeachment, Starr was again offered a Pepperdine position at the School of Law and this time accepted it.|$|E

25|$|In August 2015, it was {{reported}} that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer, Bryan Pagliano, who had previously served as IT director for Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, to maintain her private server while she was Secretary of State. According to <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> campaign official, this ensured that taxpayer dollars would not be spent on a private server that was shared by Clinton, her husband and their daughter, as well as several aides to the former president. On September 1, 2015, Pagliano's attorney sent letters to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which had subpoenaed Pagliano, and to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was inquiring about Pagliano's outside employment while a Federal employee, informing the committees that his client would invoke his constitutional Fifth Amendment rights not to answer any questions from the committees, and on September 10, in a closed-door session before the Benghazi Committee, Pagliano personally appeared to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify before the committee.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods were}} used to {{forecast}} {{the outcome of the}} 2016 election. For the 2016 election, there were many competing election forecast approaches including Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot at The New York Times, Daily Kos, Princeton Election Consortium, Cook Political Report, Rothenberg and Gonzales, PollyVote, Sabato's Crystal Ball and Electoral-Vote. These models mostly showed a Democratic advantage since the nominees were confirmed, and were supported by pundits and statisticians, including Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, Nate Cohn at The New York Times, and Larry Sabato from the Crystal Ball newsletter, who predicted a Democratic victory in competitive presidential races and projected consistent leads in several battleground states around the country. The near-unanimity of forecasters in predicting <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> victory may have been the result of groupthink. However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} {{separate}} incidents involving Barack Obama's State Department passport file in 2008. Although these occurred over a three-month span, Obama was notified only on March 20, as upper {{levels of the}} State Department themselves first {{became aware of the}} breaches. On March 21, 2008, the United States Department of State revealed that Obama's passport file was improperly accessed three times in 2008. Three contract employees are accused in the wrongdoing. One, who works for The Analysis Corporation (TAC), accessed Obama and McCain's records and was disciplined. The two other workers, who worked for Stanley, Inc.., each accessed Obama's file on separate occasions and were fired. An unauthorized access of Hillary Clinton's file was also made in mid-2007, but was considered a training error and unrelated to the other instances. John O. Brennan, president and CEO of Analysis, is a consultant to the Barack Obama campaign and contributed $2,300 to the Obama campaign in January 2008. Brennan is a former senior CIA official and former interim director of the National Counterterrorism Center. The chairman of Stanley Inc., Philip Nolan, is <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> supporter and contributor; his company has had contracts with the United States Department of State since 1992 and was recently awarded a $570 million contract to continue providing support for passport processing. The State Department is focusing an internal inquiry on the TAC employee, but plans to question all three of the contractors who accessed the candidates' files.|$|E

500|$|The Giuliani {{campaign}} {{showed some}} structural weaknesses. So closely identified with New York City, he had somewhat limited appeal to naturally Republican voters in Upstate New York. [...] The Farmersville Garbage Scandal was indicative of his {{lower levels of}} support upstate. [...] By late December 1999, Clinton adapted to Giuliani's psychological warfare, saying in response to one such gambit, [...] "I can’t be responding every time the mayor gets angry. Because that's all I would do." [...] A February 2000 attempt by Giuliani to capitalize on <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> campaign event's accidental playing of Billy Joel's suburban drug tale [...] "Captain Jack" [...] led to more ridicule for him than for her.|$|E
500|$|The New York Police Department's fatal {{shooting}} of Patrick Dorismond on March 15, 2000 inflamed Giuliani's already strained {{relations with the}} city's minority communities, and Clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue. [...] By April, reports showed Clinton gaining upstate and generally outworking Giuliani, who stated that his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more. [...] He gave priority to city duties over campaign activities. [...] Some Giuliani aides and national Republican figures concluded that {{his interest in the}} campaign was flagging, as although he was desirous of winning in political combat against <b>a</b> <b>Clinton,</b> he was by nature an executive personality and the prospect of serving as one of a hundred legislators was unappealing to him.|$|E

500|$|In 95 {{games for}} the Class <b>A</b> <b>Clinton</b> Dodgers, Wiggins hit [...]257 and had 43 steals. After having played {{exclusively}} at second base the prior two years, the Dodgers converted him primarily to shortstop that year, but he also appeared in the outfield and at {{all three of the}} other infield positions. Playing with the Class A Lodi Dodgers of the California League in 1980, Wiggins batted [...]288 and scored 108 runs while stealing 120 bases in just 135 games. His steals established a then professional-baseball single-season record, surpassing the previous minor league mark of 116 set by Allan Lewis in 1966, as well as Lou Brock's major-league record of 118 in 1974. Wiggins caught the eye of San Diego Padres general manager Jack McKeon, who drafted him in the 1980 Rule 5 draft after the Dodgers decided to leave him unprotected. According to the Padres, Wiggins had been arrested for possession of marijuana while with the Dodgers.|$|E
500|$|Corzine was one {{of several}} United States Governors – {{including}} Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Mike Beebe of Arkansas, and Eliot Spitzer of New York – who were early supporters of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. He raised $1million for her campaign. He, Bill Clinton, Eliot Spitzer, Chuck Schumer, and Charlie Rangel co-hosted Clinton's October 25, 2007 60th-birthday party. [...] He remained a committed Clinton superdelegate late into the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary season. [...] If the Democratic National Committee had decided to recontest the Michigan and Florida primaries, Corzine and Ed Rendell were prepared to spearhead Clinton's fundraising in for those races. [...] Towards the end of the primary season in April 2008, Corzine made it clear that although he was <b>a</b> <b>Clinton</b> supporter, his superdelegate vote would be determined by the popular vote. [...] After her win in the April 22, 2008 Pennsylvania Democratic primary and a calculation of popular votes that excluded caucuses and included the controversial Michigan and Florida Democratic primaries, Corzine reaffirmed his support for her. Once Barack Obama became the presumptive nominee, Corzine became a prominent spokesperson for Obama's agenda.|$|E
