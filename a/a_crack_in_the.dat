5|$|Images of the First and Second Doctors are {{displayed}} on the Doctor's mirror device and printout from the TARDIS' typewriter. The episode presents these trips as the Doctor's compensation to Amy for her fiancé Rory Williams' death in the previous episode, which Amy herself does not remember since Rory was consumed by <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe and thus erased from time. Van Gogh is able to sense Amy's sadness at Rory's death, and the Doctor later accidentally addresses Amy and Vincent as Amy and Rory, respectively.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand through <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of}} a day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E

5|$|In July 2005 {{the statues}} adorning the {{monument}} underwent a restoration. DeKalb County appropriated US$15,000 {{for the project}} which, among other tasks, repaired a split seam {{in one of the}} soldier statues and <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other sculpture's base. The project took approximately six months; the statues were removed {{for the duration of the}} restoration work and reinstalled in March 2006. During the restoration it was revealed that the statues, thought to be bronze, were actually copper. The work, the first in the 110-year history of the memorial, was completed at a cost of $16,500. Three months after the work was completed one of the statues was removed for a second time because the metal began to oxidize.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of futile escape attempts, Springfield's {{residents}} finally make <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dome; pointing out the damage, Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon {{on the site of}} Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children {{want to go back to}} save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil where they can burrow, often {{to a depth of}} 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E

25|$|A {{catastrophic failure}} is one which {{suddenly}} makes the vacuum tube unusable. <b>A</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass envelope will allow {{air into the}} tube and destroy it.

25|$|The government's {{final report}} found that the {{officers}} who had issued the order approving use of the HTP torpedoes {{did not have the}} authority to issue that order. The dummy torpedo was ten years old and some of its parts had exceeded their service life.

The crane that would normally have been used to load the missiles was, as usual, out of order, and another had to be brought in, delaying the loading process. This also made the possibility of removing a damaged torpedo more difficult.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} many later {{stories of the}} origins of the Delphic Oracle. One late explanation, which is first related by the 1st century BC writer, Diodorus Siculus, tells of a goat herder named Coretas, who noticed one day that one of his goats, who fell into <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earth, was {{behaving}} strangely. On entering the chasm, he found himself filled with a divine presence and could see outside of the present into the past and the future. Excited by his discovery he shared it with nearby villagers. Many started visiting the site to experience the convulsions and inspirational trances, though some were said to disappear into the cleft due to their frenzied state. A shrine was erected at the site, where people began worshiping in the late Bronze Age, by 1600 BC. After the deaths of a number of men, the villagers chose a single young woman as the liaison for the divine inspirations. Eventually she spoke on behalf of gods.|$|E
