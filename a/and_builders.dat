5|$|A {{weekly market}} has been held in Somerton for much of its history. The cloth {{industry}} dominated the town's market from the 17th century until the 20th century, when agriculture took over as the leading industry. Some light industries and services, such as garage repair, physiotherapy, water treatment, <b>and</b> <b>builders</b> and decorators, {{are located in the}} business park on Bancombe Road.|$|E
5|$|Construction in Norway {{has always}} been {{characterized}} {{by the need to}} shelter people, animals, and property from harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, heavy precipitation in certain areas, wind and storms; and {{to make the most of}} scarce building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, <b>and</b> <b>builders</b> largely had to rely on locally available materials.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Georgian {{architecture}} (about 1720–1840) the main architects <b>and</b> <b>builders</b> working in Bristol were James Bridges, John Wallis, and Thomas Paty with his sons John and William Paty. They put up hundreds of new buildings, reflecting the increased prosperity {{that came with the}} new Floating Harbour and trade based at The Exchange, built in 1741–43 by John Wood the Elder. Their early work included the Royal Fort, Blaise Castle House and Arno's Court estate, with the associated Arno's Court Triumphal Arch and Black Castle Public House. More modest terraces and squares grew up in the new suburbs such as Hotwells and north into Clifton, including 7 Great George Street, now the Georgian House Museum. It was built around 1790 for John Pinney a successful sugar merchant, and {{is believed to be the}} house where the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge first met. It was also home to Pinney's slave, Pero, after whom Pero's Bridge at Bristol Harbour is named.|$|E

5|$|Sources give differing {{reports of}} what {{happened}} next. Wiesenthal's autobiographies contradict each other on many points; he also over-dramatised and mythologised events. One version has Wiesenthal opening an architectural office and finally being admitted to the Lwów Polytechnic for an advanced degree. He designed a tuberculosis sanatorium, along with some residential buildings {{during the course of}} his studies and was active in a student Zionist organisation. He wrote for the Omnibus, a satirical student newspaper, and graduated in 1939. Author Guy Walters states that Wiesenthal's earliest autobiography does not mention studies at Lwów. Walters quotes a curriculum vitae Wiesenthal prepared after World War II as stating he worked as a supervisor at a factory until 1939 and then worked as a mechanic in a different factory until the Nazis invaded in 1941. Wiesenthal's 1961 book Ich Jagte Eichmann ("I Hunted Eichmann") states that he worked in Odessa as an engineer from 1940 to 1941. Walters says that there is no record of Wiesenthal attending the university at Lwów, and that he does not appear in the Katalog Architektów i Budowniczych (Catalogue of Architects <b>and</b> <b>Builders)</b> for the appropriate period.|$|E

25|$|In the 21st century an {{increased}} interest in bluegrass music, especially in Central European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic, has inspired many new mandolin players <b>and</b> <b>builders.</b> These players often mix traditional folk elements with bluegrass. Radim Zenkl came from this tradition, emigrating to the United States, where he has played with U.S. stars, including David Grisman and Béla Fleck.|$|E
25|$|Individuality and {{experimentation}} became the new cause for young architects, however {{the country as}} a whole was slow to move from the old traditions into seeing good architecture aesthetics as being important to the sense of a village, town, or city. Change was forced at times against intense resistance, and new buildings evolved at great cost to the architects <b>and</b> <b>builders</b> and within a great tension.|$|E
25|$|To be able {{to provide}} home buyers <b>and</b> <b>builders</b> with the funds needed, banks must compete for deposits.

One of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits.|$|E

25|$|The years {{immediately}} after the First World War witnessed {{the transformation of the}} rural farmland in Belmont into a residential area. Further subdivision occurred in the 1920s, stimulated by {{the construction of a new}} bridge over the Barwon River in 1926, and the consequent extension of the Geelong tram system to Roslyn Road in 1927. Houses erected during the interwar years (and those following World War II) were affordable homes for textile workers, drivers, labourers, clerks, secretaries, teachers <b>and</b> <b>builders.</b>|$|E
25|$|As the {{designers}} <b>and</b> <b>builders</b> pushed north into Columbia County, connecting Lake Taghkanic State Park {{at last to}} the parkway, they {{took advantage of the}} more open and rolling terrain to improve the road's scenic possibilities. Medians averaged 100 feet (31 m) in width, and it was easier to include views of the distant Catskills. Curves were generally wider than they had been in Dutchess County. A service station was built in the median at the park, and a scenic overlook at CR8.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} two decades, stone yards were opened at several {{locations}} in the future district. Middle-class citizens continued settling there, joined by carpenters <b>and</b> <b>builders</b> who bought several lots at once, put up a row, lived in one unit and rented out the others. The houses they built, many of which survive on South Ferry between Franklin and Green, introduced the third story, gabled roof and dormer windows to the neighborhood. Joseph C.
