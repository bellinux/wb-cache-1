5|$|The {{film was}} Machiko Kyō's second {{collaboration}} with Mizoguchi, {{as she had}} a small role in his 1944 film The Three Danjuros. She had collaborated much more frequently with Masayuki Mori. As Lady Wakasa, Kyō's costume was modeled after fashion before the Edo period <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> designed to appear similar to a mask common in Noh theatre.|$|E
25|$|Often {{as part of}} cheerleading at William and Mary, {{including}} {{for games}} and parades, a man and/or woman wore Native American inspired costume. This was common from the 1950s through the early 1990s. The 1992 Colonial Echo yearbook includes mention of student Shawn Wilkins who dressed as the mascot. She wore a white dress with fringe, a headband with feathers, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> painted (p.309).|$|E
25|$|Marie Louise was not {{considered}} attractive, as her features were heavy <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> dominated by a large nose. She was however very charming, and greeted those of all ranks with natural friendliness and sincere concern for their well being. They had two children before his untimely death by drowning on 14 July 1711, the youngest of whom was born after his death. William Charles Henry Friso's birth was met with great relief by the Frisians, and he automatically inherited the title Prince of Orange.|$|E
5000|$|The Grudge, {{a horror}} series by {{director}} Takashi Shimizu, {{is all about}} the hauntings of a woman in white; Kayako Saeki's ghost appears as a woman in white <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> almost always hidden by her long dark hair.|$|R

500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song at the 2013 YouTube Music Awards on November 3, 2013. She {{arrived on the}} red carpet of the event wearing the same pair of rotten, yellow teeth she wore on the cover art. John Walker from MTV News analyzed Gaga's look to be a combination of the snake from Tim Burton's 1988 fantasy film, Beetlejuice, the Scarecrow character from DC Comics and the rocker Marilyn Manson. During the performance, the singer wore a flannel shirt, her natural hair and a snapback with the NASA symbol altered to read DOPE <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> devoid of any make-up. She performed a piano only version of [...] "Dope", without any other instrumentation and with tears falling down her face. Gaga exited the stage while shaking hands and hugging the members of the audience.|$|E
500|$|The gallows {{consisted}} of {{nothing more than}} a large elm tree. [...] Here the prisoners would step up a ladder with one end of a rope about their neck and the other end secured to the tree, and the ladder would then be pulled away. [...] William Robinson {{was the first of the}} three to mount the ladder, and when he was positioned he made a statement to the crowd, then died when the ladder was removed. [...] Marmaduke Stephenson was the next to hang, and then it was Dyer's turn, after she witnessed the execution of her two friends. [...] Dyer's arms and legs were bound <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> covered with a handkerchief provided by Reverend John Wilson who had been one of her pastors in the Boston church many years earlier. [...] She stood calmly on the ladder, prepared for her death, but as she waited, an order of a reprieve was announced. [...] A petition from her son, William, had given the authorities an excuse to avoid her execution. [...] It had been a pre-arranged scheme, in an attempt to unnerve and dissuade Dyer from her mission. [...] This was made clear from the wording of the reprieve, though Dyer's only expectation was to die as a martyr.|$|E
2500|$|John Farrar was {{the captain}} of the Edgartown Fire Rescue unit and diver who {{recovered}} Kopechne's body. He alleged that Kopechne died from suffocation rather than from drowning or from the impact of the overturned vehicle. This hypothesis was based upon the posture in which he found the body and the body's relative position to the area of an ultimate air pocket in the overturned vehicle. Farrar also asserted that Kopechne would have likely survived if a more timely rescue attempt had been conducted. Farrar located Kopechne's body in the well of the backseat of the overturned submerged car. Rigor mortis was apparent, her hands were clasping the backseat, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> turned upward. Farrar testified at the Inquest: ...|$|E
60|$|The Queen {{had arrived}} there before them, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> smiling as sweetly as ever. She set Dot upon {{one side of}} her at the big table and Tot upon the other side.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, you brute!' she cried. 'Are all {{men like}} this? Help {{me to get}} her into my room <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> cut against the table.

60|$|Trot {{turned to}} look at him, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> sweet <b>face</b> <b>was</b> grave <b>and</b> curious.|$|R
2500|$|She {{helped the}} girls change into long white nightgowns. She then softly combed their hair. Misch tried to {{concentrate}} on his work but {{he knew what was}} going to happen. Magda then went back up to the Vorbunker with the children. Shortly thereafter, Werner Naumann came down to the Führerbunker and told Misch that he had seen Hitler's personal physician, Dr Stumpfegger give the children something [...] "sweetened" [...] to drink. About two hours later, Magda came back down to the Führerbunker, alone. She looked very pale, her eyes very red <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> [...] "frozen". She sat down at a table and began playing patience. Goebbels then came over to her, but did not say a word at that time.|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Schneider was {{attacked}} {{in the early}} evening hours of August 5, 1918. [...] The 8 months pregnant, 28-year-old of Elmira Street, [...] awoke to find a dark figure standing over her, and was bashed in the face repeatedly. [...] Her scalp had been cut open, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> completely covered in blood. [...] Mrs. Schneider was discovered after midnight by her husband, Ed Schneider, who was returning late from work. Schneider claimed that she remembered nothing of the attack, and gave birth to a healthy baby girl two days after the incident. Her husband told police that nothing was stolen from the home, besides six or seven dollars that had been in his wallet. [...] The windows and doors of the apartment appear to have not been forced open, and authorities {{came to the conclusion that}} the woman was most likely attacked with a lamp that had been on a nearby table. James Gleason, who police said was an ex-convict, was arrested shortly after Schneider was found. [...] Gleason was later released due to a complete lack of evidence, and stated that he originally ran from authorities because he had so often been arrested. [...] Lead investigators began to publicly speculate that the attack was related to the previous incidents involving Besumer and Maggio.|$|E

50|$|During the panel, {{the judges}} {{come to the}} {{conclusion}} that the best of the day are Mari Richardt, Lana, and Mari Velho. Ana Paula Costa didn't show the concern about the charges <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> closed. Andrea <b>and</b> Anne were criticized for the little progress and repetitive pictures. Anne is eliminated, because she is not yielding to the expectations of the judges.|$|R

6000|$|... 'So I do, of course, and I hope I always shall. But oh! Violet, I {{have not}} {{told you that}} I saw that lady again this morning at the early service. She had still her white dress on, I am sure it <b>is</b> for Whitsuntide; <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> so striking--so full of thought and earnestness, just like what one would suppose a novice. I shall take her for my romance, and try to guess at her history.' ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{head was}} {{tied in a}} dark-red kerchief, but pieces of hair, like dirty snow, quite short, stuck out over <b>her</b> ears. <b>And</b> she was spinning. I {{wondered}} so much, that I could not cross towards her. She was grey, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> apron, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> dress, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> kerchief, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> hands <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>were</b> all sun-bleached <b>and</b> sun-stained, greyey, bluey, browny, like stones and half-coloured leaves, sunny in their colourlessness. In my black coat, I felt myself wrong, false, an outsider.|$|R
6000|$|... "I grieve to say, your highness, {{that she}} has been seized with some terrible disease. I know not what it is, for never did I see a woman so smitten.

She is in a high state of fever, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> in a terrible state. It must be a sort of plague." ...|$|R
60|$|Helen {{gave him}} a steady look, but her color was high <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> hard.|$|E
