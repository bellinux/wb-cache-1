After landing on Yellow Beach near Ramatuelle, Murphy's platoon was making its way through a vineyard when the men were attacked by German soldiers. He retrieved a machine gun that had been detached from the squad and returned fire at the German soldiers, killing two and wounding one. Two Germans exited a house about [...] away and appeared to surrender; when Murphy's best friend responded, they shot and killed him. Murphy advanced alone on the house under direct fire. He killed six, wounded two and took 11 prisoner.|$|E
500|$|Ten {{years after}} the {{beginnings}} of the first four lower level grammar / primary schools of the Baltimore City Public Schools system in 1829, two for boys and two for girls in the four quadrants of Baltimore, soon created a need for more further advanced opportunities for learning of swiftly increasing numbers of growing children. Public pressure and increasing needs of the trade and commercial classes induced several progressive farsighted political leaders to call for and introduce resolutions into the old City Hall structure on Holliday Street. This was at the former Rembrandt Peale museum, built 1812 as the first building constructed for use as a museum in the Western Hemisphere and acquired by the city government in 1830 for the few municipal offices then existing including two City Council chambers - later the site for the first public school for young African-Americans (then called [...] "colored schools") in the late 1870s. [...] Then it later served from 1931-1997 as a city history museum). Here was the <b>action</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> resolutions introduced calling {{for the creation of a}} high school [...] "in which the higher branches of English and classical literature should be taught exclusively" [...] was unanimously passed and authorized by the Baltimore City Council on March 7, 1839, and signed by the tenth Mayor, Shepard C. Leakin, who only served one [...] two-year term, 1838-1840.|$|E

2500|$|MSU {{reported}} the typical {{annual cost of}} attendance for the 2012-13 academic year as $14,996 for Missouri residents and $21,342 for non-residents. [...] This included tuition and required student fees of $6,792 for residents and $13,138 for non-residents, $7,204 for room and board, and $1,000 estimated for books and supplies.

6000|$|It was to {{come soon}} enough by the quite {{unforced}} operation of chance, the young man's opportunity to ask her the question suggested by Mrs. Assingham shortly before her entrance. The license, had he chosen to embrace it, was {{within a few minutes}} all there--the license given him literally to inquire of this young lady how long she was likely to be with them. For a matter of the mere domestic order had quickly determined, on Mrs. Assingham's part, a withdrawal, of a few moments, which had the effect of leaving her visitors free. [...] "Mrs. Betterman's there?" [...] she had said to Charlotte in allusion to some member of the household who was to have received her and seen her belongings settled; to which Charlotte had replied that she had encountered only the butler, who had been quite charming. She had deprecated any <b>action</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> behalf of her effects; but her hostess, rebounding from accumulated cushions, evidently saw more in Mrs. Betterman's non-appearance than could meet the casual eye. What she saw, in short, demanded her intervention, in spite of an earnest [...] "Let ME go!" [...] from the girl, and a prolonged smiling wail over the trouble she was giving. The Prince was quite aware, at this moment, that departure, for himself, was indicated; the question of Miss Stant's installation didn't demand his presence; it was a case for one to go away--if one hadn't a reason for staying. He had a reason, however--of that he was equally aware; and he had not for a good while done anything more conscious and intentional than not, quickly, to take leave. His visible insistence--for it came to that--even demanded of him a certain disagreeable effort, the sort of effort he had mostly associated with acting for an idea. His idea was there, his idea was to find out something, something he wanted much to know, and to find it out not tomorrow, not at some future time, not in short with waiting and wondering, but if possible before quitting the place. This particular curiosity, moreover, confounded itself a little with the occasion offered him to satisfy Mrs. Assingham's own; he wouldn't have admitted that he was staying to ask a rude question--there was distinctly nothing rude in his having his reasons. It would be rude, for that matter, to turn one's back, without a word or two, on an old friend.|$|E
