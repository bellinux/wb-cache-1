5|$|Nuthatches {{are very}} vocal, using an {{assortment}} of whistles, trills and calls. Their breeding songs tend to be simple and often identical to their contact calls but longer in duration. The red-breasted nuthatch, which coexists with the black-capped chickadee throughout much of its range, is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> latter species' calls. The chickadee has subtle call variations that communicate information about the size and risk of potential predators. Many birds recognise the simple alarm calls produced by other species, but the red-breasted nuthatch is able to interpret the chickadees' detailed variations and to respond appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E
5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had {{suddenly}} abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> nature of what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E

25|$|Armenian can {{be divided}} into two major dialectal blocks and those blocks into {{individual}} dialects, though many of the Western Armenian dialects have become extinct due to the effects of the Armenian Genocide. In addition, neither dialect is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several subdialects. Although Western and Eastern Armenian are often described as different dialects of the same language, many subdialects are not readily mutually intelligible. Nevertheless, a fluent speaker of one of two greatly varying dialects who is also literate in one of the standards, when exposed to the other dialect {{for a period of time}} will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> other with relative ease.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, sign {{languages}} have {{a linguistic}} base and permit {{the expression of}} an unlimited number of messages. Approaches to signing {{can be divided into}} two major categories, those that encode an existing language, and those that are languages in their own right. [...] Signing Exact English may be considered the most widely used example of the former and American Sign Language as a common example of the latter. Signing is used alone or in conjunction with speech to support communication with individuals with a variety of disorders. [...] The specific hand shapes and movements of sign and gesture require an individual to have adequate fine motor and motor planning skills. Sign languages require more fine-motor coordination and are less transparent in meaning than gestural codes such as Amer-Ind; the latter limits the number of people <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> person's communication without training.|$|E

500|$|Kouno had {{attempted}} to present the idea at pitch meetings twice {{in the early part}} of 2005 but was turned away. [...] While management was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> mechanic of tilting the world, they could not understand Kouno's vision of applying artificial intelligence to the LocoRoco or other creatures in the game. On the second rejection, the management staff suggested that Kouno return with something more concrete to explain his ideas. Kouno spent one month with a four-person team to create a simple pre-prototype version of the game that demonstrated the rolling gameplay aspect. [...] The pre-prototype version was well received, and Kouno was given further resources to develop the full game. A complete prototype was created by an eight-person team over three months to establish the rest of the game's core mechanics, including the joining and splitting of the Loco Roco and the dynamic music. [...] The remainder of the game was completed in the following 11 months by the full 16-person staff at Sony Computer Entertainment Japan.|$|E

500|$|Whether an {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message {{is a matter}} of debate in itself. Sagan argued that a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization would bear in mind that they were communicating with a relatively primitive one and therefore would try to ensure that the receiving civilization would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> message. Arguing against this view, astronomer Guillermo Lemarchand stated that {{an advanced}} civilization would probably encrypt a message with high information content, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, {{in order to ensure that}} only other ethically advanced civilizations would be able to understand it. Douglas Vakoch assumes it may take some time to decode any message, telling ABC News that [...] "I don't think we're going to understand immediately what they have to say." [...] “There’s going to be a lot of guesswork in trying to interpret another civilization," [...] he told Science Friday, adding that [...] "in some ways, any message we get from an extraterrestrial will be like a cosmic Rorschach ink blot test.” ...|$|E
