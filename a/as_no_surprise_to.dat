5|$|Fouroux was {{succeeded by}} Daniel Dubroca, who coached {{the team to}} the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dubroca's tenure as coach did not last long, however, as he {{resigned}} after violently confronting referee David Bishop following France's World Cup quarter-final against England. Dubroca was replaced by Pierre Berbizier, who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Berbizier's replacement, Jean-Claude Skrela, coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 before they came last in the tournament in 1999. He officially resigned following France's loss to Australia in the 1999 Rugby World Cup final. Bernard Laporte was appointed as Skrela's successor in November. Laporte guided France through the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups before stepping down to become Secretary of State for Sport. After Philippe Saint-André turned down the offer to replace Laporte, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset appointed Marc Lièvremont to guide France to the 2011 World Cup. Lièvremont's tenure as coach was marked by inconsistent and puzzling squad selection choices, and player discontent. There were some bright moments, notably wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. But {{there was also a}} 59–16 loss to Australia in Paris, a 22–21 loss to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19–14 loss to Tonga during the 2011 World Cup.

30|$|Another {{important}} {{process that}} is regulated by PI 3 K signaling involves lipid kinases in the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides. Activated PI 3 K leads to increased production of phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -triphosphate (PIP 3), which in turn recruits Akt for cell growth, proliferation, and survival. These are hallmarks for cancers. Conversely, PIP 3 is negatively regulated by a tumor suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) via dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation is also inhibited by rapamycin. It should come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> due <b>to</b> {{the significance of the}} regulatory activities of the PI 3 K/Akt pathway and its interaction with mTOR, that dysfunction of these signaling activities would alter cellular functions, as observed in most cancers. Dysfunction can also stem from genetic mutations. Mutations or gene amplification are found in components of the PI 3 K/Akt pathway in a large number of tumors [34]. A remarkably large percentage of breast cancer, greater than 70 %, was found to have mutations in the genes involved in this pathway [35].|$|R

Sestak's victory was seen as a minor embarrassment for Obama, who strongly and publicly advocated for Specter during the race. Several news outlets reflected that Sestak's television advertisements condemning Specter as a hypocrite and opportunist were especially effective and may have been the primary factor in his victory. The Washington Post said the Pennsylvania race drew more attention than any other primary election in 2010 due to Specter's longevity and his switch to the Democratic party.|$|E

Wintour at first objected to his cousin's scheme, but Catesby, who said that [...] "the nature of the disease required so sharp a remedy", won him over. Despite Catholic Spain's moves toward diplomacy with England, Catesby still harboured hopes of foreign support and a peaceful solution. Wintour therefore returned to the continent, where he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the affable Constable of Castile to press for good terms for English Catholics in forthcoming peace negotiations. He then turned to Sir William Stanley, an English Catholic and veteran commander who had switched sides from England to Spain, and the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen; both {{cast doubt on the}} plotters' chances of receiving Spanish support. Owen did, however, introduce Wintour to Guy Fawkes, whose name Catesby had already supplied as [...] "a confidant gentleman" [...] who might enter their ranks.

Wintour told him of their plan to [...] "doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott", and thus in April 1604 the two men returned home.

50|$|In {{ovarian cancer}} {{as in other}} cancers, perlecan {{expression}} occurs differently throughout progression of the disease. Perlecan staining is lost in ovarian basement membrane that has been breached by an invasive adenocarcinoma, which {{is in contrast to}} perlecan staining in the basement membranes of normal ovaries and those with benign tumors, where basement membrane is homogeneous and very similar in composition to that in other normal tissues. This is consistent with other results showing loss of perlecan in basement membranes affected by invasive cervical cancer spreading to the pelvic lymph nodes, which comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> due <b>to</b> the correlation of elevated levels of heparanase mRNA expression with invasion of similar cervical carcinoma. By contrast, tumor formation of the immortalized mouse epithelial cell line RT101 injected into rats was dependent on perlecan expression by the mouse cells and not on the presence of endogenous rat perlecan. RT101 cells with perlecan knocked down by antisense did not show tumor formation in this system, however cells expressing the antisense perlecan and a recombinant construct encoding domains I, II, and III of mouse perlecan did indeed show tumor formation. Thus in this system it does appear that tumor cell expression of perlecan is necessary for tumor aggregation. More research into GAG chain or core protein modification by invasive tumor cells as compared to benign tumor cells and normal tissue would be informative to better understand perlecans role in cancer migration.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that nonpredictive gaze cues trigger reflexive shifts in attention toward the looked-at location. But just how generalizable is this spatial cuing effect? In particular, are people especially tuned to gaze cues provided by conspecifics, or can comparable shifts in visual attention be triggered by other cue providers and directional cues? To investigate these issues, we used a standard cuing paradigm to compare the attentional orienting produced by different cue providers (i. e., animate vs. inanimate) and directional cues (i. e., eyes vs. arrows). The results of three experiments revealed that attentional orienting was insensitive to both the identity of the cue provider {{and the nature of the}} triggering cue. However, compared with arrows, gaze cues prompted a general enhancement in the efficiency of processing operations. We consider the implications of these findings for accounts of reflexive visual orienting. Understanding the language of eyes is an exquisitely adapted human skill. From simple gaze cues, it is possible to compute not only the direction of social attention, but also the behavioral intentions, desires, and preferences of others (Baron-Cohen, 1995; Emery, 2000; Kleinke, 1986; Macrae, Hood, Milne, Rowe, & Mason, 2002). As people naturally look at objects in the environment that are of interest or importance to them, gaze direction is a communicative channel of considerable signal value. It comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> therefore, <b>to</b> learn that a specialized processing system is believed to deal with the problem of gaze detection (Allison, Puce, & McCarthy, 2000; Haxby, Hoffman, & Gobbini, 2000).

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this article is to suggest richer {{potential}} meanings of spiritual wisdom and theological reflection in response to a critical reading of Pamela Cooper-White's book, Shared wisdom: Use of the self in pastoral care and counseling.

I was pregnant whi Ie seeing the client whose case I presented-a young, European-American woman with questions about her recent marriage, sexual orientation, and spiritual experiences with Wicca. Three persons ran my accreditation interview-two European-American men and one Roman Catholic sister. Not one of them asked about the impact of my pregnancy on the therapy. This was not just a major oversight. Pamela Cooper-White's book, Shared wisdom: Use of self in pastoral care and counseling, suggests that this represents a limited and outdated understanding of selfhood, knowledge, and therapy.

Of greater interest in light of Cooper-White 's book is their neglect of the powerful transferential and countertransferential feelings that my pregnancy must have evoked. One of the more remarkable findings of a clinical social work dissertation that Cooper White completed in 2000 is the large percentage of counselors who foclls only on the conscious here-and-now.

40|$|Andrei Simic's {{response}} to my earlier letter raises some very interesting points. Nevertheless, I believe my main point stands. While intermarriage rates are only one indicator of social relations, they are a telling one. Comparing intermarriages in a complex modern society such as Yugoslavia to medieval Crusaders forcibly taking "Saracen " brides is of course not useful. But quite apart from intermarriage statistics, the detailed evidence on the ground clearly indicates that the violence in Yugoslavia has been a purposeful policy by the political elite aimed exactly at reinforcing ethnic boundaries that had been slowly disappearing in some regions. (see for example Conversi; Gagnon). Also very telling are social science studies showing that as late as 1989 - 90 {{the highest levels of}} tolerance in the former Yugoslavia were exactly the most ethnically mixed regions. (Hodson et al) Of course in other regions, especially rural ones, some degree of animosity continued to exist. But it is indicative that Simi('s anecdotal evidence comes from Hercegovina and Lika, which are very rural and (along with Montenegro) are traditionally the homes to the most fervent and violent nationalist forces among Serbs. (Western Hercegovina serves the same function for Croats). Thus Simi('s anecdotes come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise.</b> But <b>to</b> generalize those experiences to the very different environments in other regions of Yugoslavia is a mistake. My main point is not that everyone in the former Yugoslavia lived happily and peacefully with their neighbors; clearly there was tension and problems, including ethnically-related ones, in certain regions. Rather, it is that ethnic differences alone were not enough to trigger the kind of violence seen in the Balkans. Despite the political arguments of the nationalists on all sides, there was {{a significant part of the}} population which did live together peacefully and which was the target of the violence of the past war. Also, it is very clear that the violence was brought in from outside in these regions. In the case of Serbs in Croatia, Belgrade imposed extremist nationalists who repressed moderate Serbs who dared to disagree; likewise Croat extremists from Hercegovina imposed their views on Croats in Slavonia.

40|$|There are {{two common}} ways of construing Jacques Derrida's theory of deconstruction: as a {{refinement}} of the Nietzschean doctrine that God is dead; {{and as a}} displaced negative theology. Upon my reading, neither view is correct; for deconstruction offers a decisive critique of metaphysics, not theology as such. A difficulty arises immediately, though, concerning the scope of metaphysics. On the one hand, Derrida contends that metaphysics has a far greater extension than has ever been acknowledged, such that it marks any discourse oriented by an appeal to presence. And on the other hand, Derrida develops a transcendental argument that any discourse will contain the means to call its metaphysical claims into question. What Derrida offers us, in short, {{is a means of}} tracing and circumscribing the metaphysics within theology. So deconstruction is not an attack against theology but rather an answer to the theological demand for a 'non-metaphysical theology'. This answer is far from final, however. For Derrida argues that any attempt to pass beyond metaphysics is immediately repossessed by what it tries to foreclose. This means that non-metaphysical theology may mark the closure of metaphysics yet never entirely escape its determinations. It comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> then, <b>to</b> discover that most attempts to develop a non-metaphysical theology are destined to fail before they begin. The strongest candidate is mysticism., especially the negative theology of Pseudo-Dionysius. Contrary to the Thomist tradition, I argue that negative theology does not merely correct positive theology but rather supplements it at its very origin. Deconstruction may not be a negative theology, but negative theology performs the deconstruction of positive theology. Upon my account, deconstruction provides us with the means to describe not only negative theology but also its complex relations with positive theology with far more precision than has yet been available. From Descartes to Russell, mysticism has often been represented as philosophy's 'other', as that which must at all costs be excluded from philosophical discourse. Deconstruction enables us to trace the effects within a discourse of precisely this kind of exclusion; and to do so gives us a greater understanding of the history of both 'philosophy' and 'mysticism'. But this situation also has consequences for deconstruction; and in my concluding chapters I explore the troubled connections between deconstruction and mysticism in the work of two philosophers whose work has greatly influenced Derrida: Immanuel Kant and Martin Heidegger.

Guillou and Stagh did the research for the book in 1975 and they assert that, at this time, [...] "the Baath regime is clearly popular and among the most stable in the Arab World" [...] (pp.168–169), the freedom of the press enjoyed in Iraq was more extensive than in most other countries in the world (p.239) and it would come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the authors if [...] "well before the year 2000, Iraq will have surpassed European countries in living standards" [...] (p.174).|$|E
2500|$|The {{announcement}} of neutralising the time gaps came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> {{many of the}} riders and team members. Stage winner Brajkovič described the stage and its conditions as the [...] "hardest day of his life", while runner-up on the day Gołaś noted {{that it was not}} until he saw race officials that he knew where the finish of the stage was. Race leader Albasini's team director at , Neil Stephens, also described the announcement as a fair decision, having encountered a similar situation during the 1995 running of the event, when he was riding for the [...] team. Fellow team director José Azevedo (...) was more frank with his comments; he expressed dismay at the late nature of being told about the stage's shortening, and anger at other riders for failing to wait for crashed riders in the early stages. The order of riders placed 3rd to 7th were subsequently revised on the UCI's official results service, but as of May 2012 remained unchanged on the event organisers' site.|$|E
2500|$|Many theorists {{raised the}} issue that hedging and {{speculation}} were more of a spectrum than a distinct duality of goals. [...] "Academic studies (e.g. Bodnar et al, 1998) show that companies usually incorporate predictions of future price levels (i.e. a ‘view’) when executing hedges (a fact which will come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> most risk management practitioners). If hedging is really just about reducing risk, then why should our expectations of future market direction have any bearing on our hedging decisions? If we hedge 50% of our exposure, instead of 80% or 100%, because {{we feel that the}} price / rate of the underlying exposure is more likely to move in our favour, does this meet the criteria for speculation?...On one level (at the extremes), {{there is no doubt that}} hedging and speculation are very different activities. However, once you move beyond the straightforward elimination of open positions, into more nuanced transactions involving complex hedging strategies or tenuous relationships between hedges and exposures, the distinction between a hedge and a bet becomes increasingly vague." ...|$|E
6000|$|July 19th.--Yesterday S----- {{went down}} the lake in the {{steamboat}} to take U----, baby, and nurse to Newby Bridge, while the three rest of us should make a tour through the lake region. After mamma's departure, and when I had finished some letters, J----- and I {{set out on a}} walk, which finally brought us to Bowness, through much delightful shade of woods, and past beautiful rivulets or brooklets, and up and down many hills. This chief harbor of the lakes seemed alive and bustling with tourists, it being a sunny and pleasant day, so that they were all abroad, like summer insects. The town is a confused and irregular little place, of very uneven surface. There is an old church in it, and two or three large hotels. We stayed there perhaps half an hour, and then went to the pier, where shortly a steamer arrived, with music sounding,--on the deck of which, with her back to us, sat a lady in a gray travelling-dress. J----- cried out, [...] "Mamma! mamma!" [...] to which the lady deigned no notice, but, he repeating it, she turned round, and was <b>as</b> much <b>surprised,</b> <b>no</b> doubt, <b>to</b> see her husband and son, as if this little lake had been the great ocean, and we meeting each other from opposite shores of it. We soon steamed back to Lowwood, and took a car thence for Rydal and Grasmere, after a cold luncheon. At Bowness I met Miss Charlotte Cushman, who has been staying at the Lowwood Hotel with us since Monday, without either party being aware of it.|$|R
5000|$|Children {{are quickly}} {{becoming}} the most targeted group within the {{advertising and marketing}} industries. Younger children have an incredible influence over the money their parents spend on them, whilst older children are also targeted because of the money they will spend later in life [...] Consumer spending habits and brand loyalty are all values that are formed as a child. Advertisers recognise that this age group is important to target because of the certain spending habits that will follow them into adulthood. Children are seen {{as one of the}} most vulnerable age groups targeted by advertisers and are constantly exposed to expansive amounts of commercial promotion every day. It comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that advertising <b>to</b> children is considered to be highly unethical. Targeting this age group is often noted as highly dishonorable and is a topic of great controversy [...] The violation of advertising to such a susceptible age group has been seen to have a detrimental impact on the child’s cognitive development as well as behavioural issues that generally lead to poor spending habits and values in the future [...] It is seen to be an unethical practice as it is obvious that children are not fully aware of the persuasive aim and purpose of advertising, it is unclear to children that it is an advertisers’ job to convince consumers to buy their products. The advertising message shown to children is often obscured and advertisers choose to target emotions, opposed to knowledge and understanding. Therefore, children are exposed to poor spending habits with this type of advertising, including impulse buying and they are not necessarily taught to buy products for value [...] Not only does this effect the overall cognitive development of a child but also starts to interfere with how they view themselves. Children are so focused on the importance of materialistic items that they convince themselves that what they already own, isn’t enough, resulting in a constant demand for more. This is commonly known as the “nag factor” which puts pressure on parents to unnecessarily spend more on their children [...] Another unethical practice is observed when advertisers engage psychologists in order to understand how children think and how they receive a promotional message. With the psychologists’ help and findings of their studies, advertisers now have an in depth understanding about children’s developmental and emotional needs, which analyses their behavior, fantasies and their dreams. This strategy is purely to make money instead of protecting children and can be considered unprofessional. Psychologists are able to understand and observe just how a child’s mind works, therefore using this information for a commercial purpose is unethical and ultimately, exploitation [...]|$|R
