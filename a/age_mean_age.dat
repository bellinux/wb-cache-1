50|$|Sternberg's {{triangular}} {{theory of}} love {{may not be}} as simple as he initially laid it out to be. Sternberg measured his theory on couples who were roughly the same <b>age</b> (<b>mean</b> <b>age</b> of 28) and whose relationship duration was roughly the same (4 to 5 years). His sample size was limited in characteristic variety. Acker and Davis announced this issue as being one of three major problems with Sternberg's theory. Romantic love, in particular, is not often the same in undergraduate level couples as couples who are not undergrads. Acker and Davis studied a sample that was older than Sternberg's sample of undergraduates.|$|E
50|$|Average adults reach 1.6 to 2.4 {{inches in}} length. Growth rates of N. chrosomus {{increase}} in spring in both length and weight in {{individuals who are}} {{one or two years}} of <b>age.</b> <b>Mean</b> <b>age</b> in months differs between sexes. Males live an average of 11.7 months whereas females typically live 13.5 months. The maximum age for males is around 23 months and 25 months for females. Sexual maturity typically occurs by 12 months of age for most individuals {{with the exception of a}} few that will become sexually mature by 24 months of age. The maximum age of a little over 24 months and sexual maturity occurring in most individuals by 12 months of age, suggests no more than two spawning seasons for any individual. Spawning occurs in 16-25 °C waters in late spring/early summer. N. chrosomus spawn in habits similar to those used throughout the year but egg deposition usually occurs in Semotilus sp. nests and Nocomis sp. nests. Rainbow shiners increase food intake during late winter and early spring which coincides with the increase in growth experienced in the spring months before the spawning season and also precedes the increased energy requirements of gamete production and courtship behaviors.|$|E

40|$|Background—Muscle wasting {{occurs in}} both chronic heart failure (CHF) and normal aging and {{contributes}} to exercise intolerance and increased morbidity/mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms of muscle atrophy in CHF and their interaction with aging are still largely unknown. We therefore measured the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the lysosomal pathway of intracellular proteolysis in muscle biopsies of CHF patients and healthy controls in two age strata and assessed the age-dependent effects of a 4 -week endurance training program on the catabolic-anabolic balance. Methods and Results—Sixty CHF patients (30 patients <b>aged</b> 55 years, <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> 465 years; 30 patients <b>aged</b> 65 years, <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> 725 years) and 60 healthy controls (30 subjects <b>aged</b> 55 years, <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> 505 years; 30 subjects <b>aged</b> 65 years, <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> 724 years) were randomized to 4 weeks of supervised endurance training or to a control group. Before and after the intervention, vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained. The expressions of cathepsin-L and the muscle-specific E 3 ligases MuRF- 1 and MAFbx were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by Western blot. At baseline, MuRF- 1 expression was significantly higher in CHF patients versus healthy controls (mRNA: 62459 versus 40125 relative units; P 0. 007). After 4 weeks of exercise training, MuRF- 1 mRNA expression was reduced by 32. 8 % (P 0. 02) in CHF patients aged 55 years and by 37. 0 % (P 0. 05) in CHF patients aged 65 years. Conclusions—MuRF- 1, {{a component of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system involved in muscle proteolysis, is increased in the skeletal muscle of patients with heart failure.

Cefoperazone concentrations in serum of elderly persons were significantly higher at each interval from 30 min to 6 h for the 2 -g dose. Compared with that in younger persons, the total clearance in elderly subjects was significantly lower for both the 1 - and 2 -g doses, the renal clearance was significantly lower for the 2 -g dose, and the area under the curve was significantly higher for the 2 -g dose in the elderly persons. The half-life at beta phase was higher in the elderly persons at both the 1 - and 2 -g doses but not significantly so. Changes in total clearance and area under the curve and higher levels in serum in the elderly persons suggest a longer duration of antimicrobial activity in this age group...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare acute and chronic undernutrition rates before and after the introduction of a food-supplementation program as an adjunct to routine health care for children of migrant workers in the Dominican Republic. The cross-sectional study was conducted in five rural communities in the Dominican Republic. Children 18 years and younger were eligible if they received routine health care from local mobile clinics. Data were obtained before (2005) and after (2006) initiation of a food-supplementation program. χ 2 or Fisher exact tests were used for analysis. Among 175 children in 2005, 52 % were female, and 59 % were < 5 years of <b>age</b> (<b>mean</b> <b>age</b> = 5. 3 years). Among 148 children in 2006, 48 % were female, and 57 % were < 5 years of <b>age</b> (<b>mean</b> <b>age</b> = 5. 6 years). Acute undernutrition rates decreased from 40 % to 23 % (P = 0. 001) after initiation of the food-supplementation program. Rates of chronic undernutrition decreased from 33 % to 18 % after the initiation of the food-supplementation program (P = 0. 003).

We present two experiments exploring the generality of this finding. Experiment I compared young, young-old, and old-old <b>age</b> groups (<b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> 19, 67, and 8 1 years, respectively) on their understanding of ToM stories both with and without the need to remember the information, and control studies that did not require the ability to attribute mental states.

In Experiment 2, young and old-old <b>age</b> groups (<b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> 21 and 81 years, respectively) were compared on their understanding of ToM and control stories without the need to remember the information.

Overall, word reading was significantly slower for developmental dyslexics compared to reading age (RA) and chronological age (CA) controls.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore whether a short {{postural}} training period could affect postural stability in dyslexic children. Postural performances were evaluated using Multitest Equilibre from Framiral. Posture was recorded in three different viewing conditions (eyes open fixating a target, eyes closed and eyes open with perturbed vision) and in two different postural conditions (on stable and unstable support). Two groups of dyslexic children participated in the study, i. e.

Findings showed that short postural training improved postural stability on unstable support surfaces with perturbed vision: indeed the surface, the mean velocity of CoP and the spectral power indices in both directions decreased significantly, and the cancelling time in the antero-posterior direction improved significantly.
