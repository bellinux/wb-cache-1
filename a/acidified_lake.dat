Regional emissions of oxidised sulphur and nitrogen compounds increased rapidly over this period and similar emissions {{have been linked to}} lake acidification in other parts of North America and Europe. To determine whether lakes in the region have undergone acidification, 12 lakes within the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo and the Caribou Mountains were selected to cover chemical and spatial gradients and sediment cores were obtained for palaeolimnological analyses including radiometric dating, diatom analysis, isotopic analysis of bulk sediment 13 C and 15 N, and spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs). All lake sediment cores show evidence of industrial contamination based on SCPs, but there is no clear industrial signal in stable isotopes. Most lakes showed changes in diatom assemblages and sediment C:N ratios consistent with nutrient enrichment over various timescales, with potential drivers including climatic change, forest fires and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. Only one of the 12 lakes investigated showed strong evidence of acidification with a decline in diatom-inferred pH from 6. 3 to 5. 6 since 1970 linked to increasing relative abundances of the acidophilous diatom species Actinella punctata, Asterionella ralfsii and Fragilariforma polygonata.

In the circumneutral lake, 72 % of the captured whitefish were mature, while in the moderately acidic lake all seven captured fish were immature.

40|$|Acidic deposition, {{commonly}} referred to as acid rain, is causing serious environmental damage in eastern Canada. The revenues from forest products, tourism and sport fishing are estimated to account for about 8 % of the gross national product. The impact on human health is not as clearcut and a multi-department program on the Long-Range Transport of Airborne Pollutants (LRTAP) was approved by the federal government in June 1980. The objectives of the LRTAP program are to reduce wet sulfate deposition to less than 20 kg/ha per year in order to protect moderately sensitive areas. This will require a 50 % reduction in Canadian SO 2 emissions east of the Saskatchewan/Manitoba border and concomitant reductions in the eastern U. S. A. The objectives of the health sector of the program are to assess the risk to health posed by airborne pollutants which are subjected to long-range transport and to monitor the influence of abatement programs. Two major epidemiology studies were undertaken in 1983, one in which the health effects related to acute exposure to transported air pollutants were studied in asthmatic and nonasthmatic children, and another in which the effects of chronic exposure to these pollutants were studied in school children living in towns with high and low levels of pollutants. Preliminary analysis of the data do not indicate major health effects, but definitive conclusions must await final analysis.

It turned out that, during the acidification, the number of zooplankton changed and also the species composition of their assemblages, at some sites {{there was also the}} total disappearance.

The rate and extent of biological recovery after restoring the pH in <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> varies considerably across regions. Recovery of aquatic communities is significantly lagging behind the recovery in chemistry. Some zooplankton species are nonetheless able to quickly colonize recuperating ecosystems and in many <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> again started to appear native species that have disappeared during acidification.

40|$|Ecological resilience, {{defined as}} the {{capacity}} of an ecosystem to withstand disturbances without losing original structures, processes and functions, has remained elusive and challenging to quantify. In this thesis, two methods {{were used to assess}} the resilience of aquatic communities to different stressors and management practices. Time series modelling and discontinuity analysis were used to quantify scaling structures and dynamics, both relevant for ecological resilience. The aims of this work were to: (i) evaluate the performances of two time series modelling approaches: Asymmetric Eigenvector Maps (AEM) and Moran’s Eigenvector Maps (MEM), and determine which is best suited to study ecological resilience, (ii) assess the efficiency of liming as management technique to restore lakes to pre-acidified conditions, (iii) investigate if <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> (degraded systems) are more vulnerable to environmental change compared to near-pristine circumneutral lakes, and (iv) investigate regional climatic effects on the resilience of shallow lakes using an experiment along a latitudinal gradient that manipulated nutrients and ecosystem size. AEM consistently outperformed MEM with differences in modelled scale-specific patterns. These results suggest that the outcomes are dependent on the modelling approach and that AEM might be better suited to assess resilience when temporal trends are relevant. Liming improved species richness and diversity, but resulted in communities that are neither typical of acidified nor of circumneutral lakes. The resilience attributes were similar across all lakes; however both limed and <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> had higher proportions of species with stochastic dynamics. These findings suggest that liming is unable to break the feedbacks that maintain the system in an acidified state. <b>Acidified</b> and circumneutral <b>lakes</b> were found to be equally vulnerable to environmental change as both lake types had similar resilience characteristics.

While this suggests a low resilience of limed lakes, attributes that confer resilience have not been assessed, limiting our understanding of the efficiency of costly management programs.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two themes {{concerning}} the anthropogenic impacts on Finnish lakes {{during the past}} 150 years. The effects of pulp mill discharges, municipal wastewaters and diffuse loading on the ecosystems of large lakes were studied from macroinvertebrate samples and from short-core paleolimnological samples. The response of benthic invertebrates to acidification and the patterns of recovery were studied from the littoral macrozoobenthos of acid-sensitive headwater lakes. The long-term responses of lacustrine chironomids to the changing degree of acidification were studied from paleolimnological samples. Based on the {{physical and chemical properties}} and biological remains in the sediment, several developmental phases were distinguished in the ecological status of the loaded lakes. These phases differed from each other on the basis of changing ecological disturbance affecting the lake ecosystems. The sediment profiles covered the time from the pre-industrial phase to the phase of severe pollution and, later on, to the phase of recovery. The lakes exposed to point loading from industrial and municipal sources revealed recent biological recovery patterns, while the lakes suffering from diffuse loading still revealed an ongoing eutrophication process. The study of acidic headwater lakes revealed many acid-sensitive benthic taxa, but also taxa tolerant of acidification. Recent chemical recovery was accompanied by a slight biological recovery in the most <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes.</b> Sedimentary chironomid assemblages of <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> revealed only slight changes during the past centuries. Possible future trends and threats to the biological recovery of loaded lakes are discussed. Järvien kuormitus-, rehevöitymis- ja palautumishistoria on ollut monivaiheinen ja pitkäkestoinen.

30|$|Measured {{aluminium}} {{concentration in}} the lagoon water ranged from 1.8 to 13.6  mg/L whilst a mean concentration of 708.47  mg/kg was measured in the fish samples. The environmental effect of aluminium is that its ions can react with phosphates which cause phosphates to be less available to water organisms. An increased level of aluminium in acidified natural waters is a primary cause of fish death from damage to gill epithelia and loss of osmo-regulatory capacity (Driscoll 1985). Aluminium can also accumulate in plants and cause health problems for animals that consume these plants. In most <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes,</b> the population of fishes and amphibians declines due to reactions of aluminium ions with proteins in the gills of fish and the embryos of frogs.

Sediment cores were collected from <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> with known present fish population status and well-documented fish community developments in southwest Sweden. Sediment analyses were conducted on comparatively large sediment samples from sediment cores that were sectioned for a high temporal resolution (5 -mm intervals). Subfossil Chaoborus assemblages were related to fish population developments in the study lakes. Mandibles of Chaoborus flavicans were common in most sediment samples, and this species is known to co-exist with fish. However, C. obscuripes mandibles were exclusively recovered and identified in more recent sediments from fish-free lake periods, as judged from known historical fish population changes in the study lakes. These findings suggest that past fish extirpations can be revealed by the appearance and successive presence of C. obscuripes mandibles in sediment records. Progressive acidification was additionally confirmed {{by the loss of}} acid-sensitive daphnid zooplankton, as indicated by developments in sedimentary assemblages of Daphnia ephippia (resting eggs). In this thesis I describe and test the first ever paleo-method for revealing periods of cyprinid presence in lake histories, without including fish fossils in the analyses. Cyprinid fish species are characterized by pharyngeal teeth that are used to crush and fragment food items. Cyprinid fish, in this thesis represented by roach (Rutilus rutilus L.), were shown to evacuate significantly higher proportions of fragmented Chaoborus mandibles than non-cyprinid perch individuals (Perca fluviatilis L.), when fed live Chaoborus larvae in the laboratory. Similar and significant differences in proportions of fragmented subfossil Chaoborus mandibles were also shown for three independent paleolimnological approaches; (1) a comparative study of surface sediments from lakes with and without cyprinid fish, (2) a stratigraphical analysis of a dated sediment core from a lake with a known period of roach presence, and (3) a comparison between two dated sediment cores from lakes that differed in historical presence of roach. These findings have important implications for future freshwater management by providing tools for assessing past fish population changes in <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> with uncertain developmental histories...|$|R
2500|$|Sulfur {{dioxide and}} {{nitrogen}} oxides are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, {{but the majority}} of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur. These substances dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lentic systems as acid rain. Lakes and ponds that contain bedrock that is rich in carbonates have a natural buffer, resulting in no alteration of pH. [...] Systems without this bedrock, however, are very sensitive to acid inputs because they have a low neutralizing capacity, resulting in pH declines even with only small inputs of acid. At a pH of 5–6 algal species diversity and biomass decrease considerably, leading to an increase in water transparency – a characteristic feature of <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes.</b> [...] As the pH continues lower, all fauna becomes less diverse. [...] The most significant feature is the disruption of fish reproduction. [...] Thus, the population is eventually composed of few, old individuals that eventually die and leave the systems without fishes. Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in Scandinavia, western Scotland, west Wales and the north eastern United States.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThousands of Swedish <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> {{and streams}} have been {{regularly}} limed for about 30 years. Standard sampling of fish assemblages in lakes and streams {{was an important}} part of monitoring the trends after liming, i. e. sampling with multi-mesh gillnets in lakes (EN 14757) and electrofishing in streams (EN 14011). Monitoring data are nationally managed, in the National Register of Survey test-fishing and the Swedish Electrofishing Register. We evaluated long-term data from 1029 electrofishing sites in limed streams and gillnet sampling in 750 limed lakes, along with reference data from 195 stream sites and 101 lakes with no upstream liming in their catchments. The median year of first liming was 1986 for both streams and lakes. The proportion of limed stream sites with no fish clearly decreased with time, mean species richness and proportion of sites with brown trout (Salmo trutta) recruits increased. There were no consistent trends in fish occurrence or species richness at non-limed sites, but occurrence of brown trout recruits also increased in acid as well as neutral reference streams. Abundance of brown trout, perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) increased significantly more at limed sites than at non-limed reference sites sampled before and after 1986. The mean species richness did not change consistently in limed lakes, but decreased in low alkalinity reference lakes, and fish abundance decreased significantly in limed as well as in non-limed lakes...|$|R
40|$|Ecosystem {{resistance}} to the impacts of diverse hu-man insults depends on the replacement of sensi-tive species by ones more tolerant of the stressor. Here we present evidence from a whole-lake acid-ification experiment (Lake 302 S, Experimental Lakes Area, Canada) that resistance and species compensation decline with increasing trophic level. Diverse and fast-growing algal and rotifer assem-blages with high dispersal potentials showed signif-icant compensatory species dynamics, resulting in the maintenance of total biomass despite 30 %– 80 % declines in species richness. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that significant compensatory algal and rotifer dynamics were best explained by differential species tolerances of acid-ified chemical conditions coupled with release from resource limitation and predation. However, less diverse cladoceran, copepod, and fish assemblages showed significant declines in total biomass and weak species compensation with loss of species during acidification. In comparison, algal and zooplankton species dynamics remained relatively synchronized in a nearby unperturbed reference lake (Lake 239) dur-ing the experiment. As a result, Lake 302 S showed limited ecosystem {{resistance to}} anthropogenic acidifi-cation. Therefore, we hypothesize that lost species will increase the susceptibility of <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> to the adverse impacts of other environmental stressors (for example, climate warming, stratospheric ozone deple-tion, invasive species). Consequently, the ecosystem stability of boreal lakes is expected to decline as global change proceeds.

40|$|In lake liming {{operations}} in Sweden, <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> are reclaimed by neutralization with calcite powder. The amount added {{is intended to}} neutralize the water column {{as well as to}} delay the reacidification. The reacidification of limed lakes is dependent on the dilution of the dissolved calcium carbonate with time and, for a limited period of time, the dissolution of calcite from the lake sediments. Calcite on the lake bottom will, in addition to being covered by sedimentation, become inactivated by precipitates of humus and clay minerals clogging the calcite surfaces. A model has been developed to calculate the reacidification of a limed lake which includes the following mechanisms: (1) the dissolution of calcite and a subsequent neutralization of acid water, (2) owing to the increase inpH value, occurrence of precipitation of humus and dissolved metals onto the calcite surface and inhibition of the dissolution of calcite (3) reversible sorbtion of calcium from the water column by sediments not covered with calcite, and (4) diffusive transport through a boundary bottom layer to the water column. In a first approach the lake was modeled as a continuously stirred tank. The equations were derived from a mass balance and the dissolution kinetics for calcite to describe the long-term development ofpH, alkalinity, and calcium concentration in the lake. The differential equations describing the mechanisms were solved {{with the help of a}} computer code. The model accurately describes the reacidification and the mass balances observed in several limed lakes...|$|R
40|$|A methodical {{approach}} {{for the assessment}} of pelagic biomass and the main carbon fluxes in remote and hardly accessible mountain lakes was elaborated and tested. Number and biomass of bacteria (BAC), autotrophic picoplankton (APP), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), ciliates (CIL), phytoplankton (PHY), zooplankton smaller than 40 μm (ZOOS) and zooplankton larger than 40 μm (ZOOL) were investigated regularly during two ice-free periods in 13 European mountain lakes (1 st level approach – fixed samples elaborated in specialized laboratories). Carbon fluxes measured in 9 lakes included: primary production, exudation by PHY and BAC uptake of exudates, BAC production, elimination of BAC. These processes were measured in the field by specialized teams (2 nd level approach). The ranges of values found in mountain lakes were evaluated and possible methodical and interpretative errors discussed. BAC were a significant component of pelagic biomass. The intercomparison between different partners showed differences in bacterial counts lower than 10 %, whereas the mean cell volumes measured fluctuated by more than 40 %. APP was never found in a significant quantity, except in one lake. HNF and CIL, though regularly found, were usually scarce and only occasionally significant in terms of biomass. The main components of pelagic biomass were BAC, PHY and ZOOL+ZOOS, except for <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes,</b> where zooplankton was very low. In oligotrophic mountain lakes, the percentage of extracellular production in the total primary production was considerable. Bacterial abundance and production often reached values quite comparable with the situation found in lowland mesotrophic lakes during winter...|$|R
40|$|Many {{catchments}} in high N-deposition {{areas have}} low N retention. It has been hypothesised that {{under such conditions}} P addition may increase N retention in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Fertiliser trials in N-saturated terrestrial ecosystems show that P addition can cause increased plant uptake of N. Few studies, however have focused on N leaching to surface waters. Theoretical considerations and limited empirical data suggest that P addition to acidic, oligotrophic lakes will stimulate NO 3 assimilation and thereby increase alkalinity and N retention within the lake. Near-shore coastal waters may benefit from reduced riverine N loading during summer in terms of reduced algal biomass and reduced probability of development of toxic dinoflagellate blooms. P treatment may be suitable to neutralise moderately <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> and streams (pH> 5. 2). P addition will also increase biodiversity, stimulate aquatic production and improve the resource base for fish production. In more acidic lakes and streams, a combination of liming and moderate P addition may be an optimal management tool. We conclude that a large-scale experiment is necessary to test if P addition (both terrestrial and aquatic) might provide a mitigation technique for areas experiencing high NO 3 levels in surface waters. Possible technological solutions {{on how to use}} P to increase pH and stimulate biological production in acidified areas have been evaluated. Instead of adding P as PO 4 3 salts, P-containing wastewaters can be utilised at relatively low cost, after removing particulate matter, BOD, and N, but not P. HYDRO AS...|$|R
40|$|Changes in cell {{size and}} silica content were {{examined}} in response to aluminum additions in cultures of the acidophilic diatom Asterionella ralfsii var. americana KÖrn at pH 6. 0. The effects of Al were examined over a range of steady-state growth rates using silica-limited semicontinuous cultures (Si:P = 8. 0). Additions of ≥ 2. 8 Μmol · L − 1 total Al decreased mean cell length, total surface area, and biovolume up to 40 – 50 %. The effects of Al were dependent on growth rate with the magnitude of size reduction increasing at higher growth rates. The proportion of small (approximately 15 – 20 Μm) cell length classes increased relative to large (approximately 50 Μm length) cell length classes when total Al exceeded 2. 8 Μmol · L − 1, particularly at higher growth rates. The relationship between cell quota and steady-state growth rate fit a Droop relationship at 0 and 2. 8 Μmol·L − 1 total Al, but this fit was highly variable {{in the presence of}} Al. Cell quotas in the 6. 22 Μmol·L − 1 total Al treatment were highest at low growth rates; therefore, a Droop relationship was an inappropriate descriptor of growth rate. Cells also became 30 – 40 % more heavily silicified per unit surface area in the presence of Al and at growth rates ≥ 0. 22 day − 1. Although the mechanisms responsible for size reductions in response to Al additions are unclear, the relationship between metal concentration and frustule morphology may be useful as an indicator of Al loading to <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{acidic water}} percolates through mineral soils, Al is mobilized and transported into streams and lakes. We {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} increasing temperature (climate warming) on Al concentrations in four strongly <b>acidified</b> <b>lakes</b> in the Bohemian Forest, southwestern Czech Republic, over a 17 -yr period (1984 – 2001). Pronounced decreases in atmospheric S and N deposition resulted mainly in a sharp monotonic decrease in lake water concentration of total Al (� 0. 49 to � 1. 38 �mol L� 1 yr� 1). Residuals from the linear relationship between total Al concentrations and the sum of strong acid anions were inversely correlated with air temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation index. An increase in the average annual air temperature of � 1. 27 � 0. 49 �C between 1984 and 2001 was correlated with decreases in toxic Al 3 � and explained, on average, 13 % of the total Al decrease in three lakes and 11 % of the Al 3 � decrease in Černé Lake. The inverse relationship between Al solubility and temperature caused lower Al mobilization in soil horizons and/or enhanced precipitation of Al in the lakes at higher temperature but otherwise similar conditions. As a consequence, the recent period of warmer years and mild winters significantly contributed to the trend of decreasing Al in lakes recovering from acidification. Lake water chemistry in areas without direct human influence is controlled mainly by watershed characteristics and atmospheric deposition. Recent studies have shown several climate-related factors to affect concentrations of water constituents, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC; Schindle...|$|R
