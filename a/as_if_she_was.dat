5|$|Father McCue (Arnie Walters) {{contacts}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and asks}} for her help in the case. Scully visits the Kernofs, and learns that Dara was adopted six years earlier. Due to her severe spinal deformities, there is no explanation as to how Dara {{walked out of the}} house. Lance is convinced that it was the Devil that stood over her in the street. Scully examines Dara's body with a pathologist Vicki Belon (Lorraine Landry), who notes her surgically removed extra fingers. Belon reluctantly proposes that the girl was struck down by God, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a mistake.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt {{it was fun to}} fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E
5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E

5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E

25|$|Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine {{teamed up}} in 1994 to write Ready to Wear, a weekly style {{guide for the}} Daily Telegraph which ran for seven years. They had {{previously}} met {{at a dinner party}} hosted by David, Viscount Linley but did not actually like each other at first. They both perceived each other in negative ways: Woodall looked upon Constantine <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a stuck-up English aristocrat and Constantine saw Woodall as 'Eurotrash'.|$|E

25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to have made her, {{for the first time in}} her young life, fully aware of the serious, even deadly, nature of her succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, she dressed in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy splendor of the other ladies present, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trying to live down the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E

Lovelace commented that it was [...] "obvious that Spanish isn't Gomez' first language, and comes in a distant second", and that [...] "Gomez' odd voice" [...] came across as sometimes [...] "much higher and very squeaky when speaking Spanish", concluding that it [...] "doesn’t match the rest of the song and momentarily brings everything to a halt".|$|E

A writer from Engadget has criticised the Cortana integration in Skype for only responding to very specific keywords, feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "chatting with a search engine" [...] due to the impersonal way the bots replied to certain words such as [...] "Hello" [...] the Bing Music bot brought up Adele's song of that name.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday 19 May, Anne Boleyn was {{executed}} within the Tower precincts, not upon {{the site of the}} execution memorial, but rather, according to historian Eric Ives, on a scaffold erected {{on the north side of}} the White Tower, in front of what is now the Waterloo Barracks. She wore a red petticoat under a loose, dark grey gown of damask trimmed in fur and a mantle of ermine. Accompanied by two female attendants, Anne made her final walk from the Queen's House to the scaffold and she showed a [...] "devilish spirit" [...] and looked [...] "as gay <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not going to die". Anne climbed the scaffold and made a short speech to the crowd: ...|$|E

Mark Anthony Neal of the international webzine PopMatters, regarded [...] "Baby Boy" [...] {{as one of the}} [...] "high-profile collaborations" [...] on Dangerously in Love. Lisa Verrico of the daily British newspaper The Times described the song a [...] "Latino-tinged collaboration ...

500|$|Also in 2004, Beckinsale portrayed Ava Gardner in Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator. Scorsese {{decided to}} cast Beckinsale because, [...] "I’ve always liked her. I’ve seen all her work, and I {{was glad that}} she agreed to audition." [...] Beckinsale's {{performance}} received mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of New York Magazine said she played the part [...] "in full va-va-voom blossom" [...] while LaSalle felt that she manages [...] "to convince us that Ava {{was one of the}} great broads of all time." [...] However, Clark described it as [...] "the one performance that doesn't come off (though Beckinsale has the requisite beauty)" [...] while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian stated that [...] "Gardner's rich, voluptuous sexiness is completely absent as Beckinsale sleepwalks through the role <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> advertising perfume." [...] The film grossed over $213million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|American vocalist Barbra Streisand {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "Didn't We" [...] for her second live album, Live Concert at the Forum (1972). It was released as the record's third and final single and was {{recorded a}}t Streisand's first concert in six years, titled [...] "Barbra-Live!", on 15 April 1972. It was held at The Forum in Inglewood, California; the event itself served as a concert {{to raise money for}} George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign. To warn the public on the misuse of drugs and alcohol, the singer pretended <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> under the influence of marijuana. Richard Perry produced this version while Claus Ogerman helped with the arrangements. The vinyl single release features the B-side track [...] "On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)", while the promotional release has the same A-side and B-side.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of PCD (2005), {{and over the}} course of two years (2005–07), Scherzinger recorded 75-100 songs for Her Name Is Nicole, her planned solo debut album. [...] Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity as she began work on her own music. She stated that she enjoyed collaborating with many different artists, and that although she had been writing songs for over ten years, she felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> at a different level while working with such A-list writers and producers. Following the moderate success of [...] "Baby Love", the complete lack of success of the singles such as [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] and numerous push backs, Scherzinger decided to put the release of the on hold. She then returned her focus back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album. Scherzinger cited that she felt as if the songs were more suited as a Pussycat Dolls song than her own.|$|E

500|$|According to Lucy O'Brien, {{author of}} Madonna: Like an Icon, the album artwork was on-par with Andy Warhol's concept of pop art. She {{felt that the}} image {{was a mixture of}} innocence and idealism, while {{incorporating}} 1950s-style Technicolor and hand tinted color, characteristic of Warhol's silkscreen printed design, prevalent in the 1960s. Jeri Heiden, the album's cover designer, commented, [...] "She was already highly aware of the value of her image and was in control of it. After I took the photo, it appeared <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> floating—her clothing was not visible. She took on the appearance of a marble statue, goddess-like." [...] O'Brien felt that the artwork heralded the arrival of a new Madonna, while drawing on the enduring appeal of her celluloid icon Marilyn Monroe. [...] "With this picture, Madonna made explicit the connection between Warhol and herself, the vivid nexus between pop art and commerce. The late 1980s marked a new era of the pop artist as a brand, and Madonna became the first one to exploit this." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, a mass {{proportion}} of the album deals with the theme of self-discovery and freedom of expression. The first batch of darker tunes opens with the [...] "chaotic" [...] drum and bass composition [...] "Too Far", which has Minogue discuss her paranoia and anger; she had to write the song at a local cafe in order to leave her home in London, which she claimed to have infested [...] "negative vibes" [...] at the time. [...] "Did It Again", a rock song heavily influenced with Middle Eastern beats, was inspired by negative stories that the British press had published about her. As a result, Minogue used this as an advantage and wrote it <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "telling herself off". The guitar-driven tune [...] "I Don't Need Anyone" [...] doesn't have a linear story, as Minogue commented with Deconstruction that it was taken from four sets of songs, all interpreting different moods and stories. [...] "Jump", the album's only recognised trip hop number, advises the public to accept her {{during the course of}} her career and personal choices.|$|E
500|$|O'Brien {{said that}} the songs on I'm Breathless had a [...] "coquettish" [...] and [...] "pandering nature", and was the polar {{opposite}} to Madonna's previous release, Like a Prayer, which had an introspective composition. I'm Breathless opens {{with the sound of}} an intercom and a shuffle, and power ballad [...] "He's a Man" [...] starts, a song which Madonna sings <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "hooker stalking the boulevard". Also, Madonna's [...] "haunting" [...] vocals continue after the music has faded. One of the Sondheim songs, [...] "Sooner or Later", is a 1930s jazz ballad with comping piano, brushed drum sounds, double bass and horns. Conjuring the atmosphere of a smoky nightclub, the song finds Madonna in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously. [...] "Hanky Panky", the third song and second single, deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centered around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a [...] "good spanking". It is performed in an almost comical style, and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, [...] "You don't know whether to hit me or kiss me".|$|E
