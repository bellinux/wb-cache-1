25|$|Adolescence {{and early}} {{adulthood}} {{have been described}} as special times in memory encoding because individuals typically recall a disproportionate number of autobiographical memories from those periods. The reminiscence bump accounts for this disproportionate number of memories. The reminiscence bump typically occurs between 10 years of age and 30 years of age and is the period that individuals produce the most memories during free recall tasks. Research suggests that memories are easily accessible from the reminiscence bump because they are linked to self-identity. The memories found within the reminiscence bump significantly contribute to an individual's life goals, self-theories, <b>attitudes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Additionally, life events that occur during the period of the reminiscence bump, such as graduation, marriage, or the birth of a child, are often very novel, thus, making them more memorable.|$|E

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the role of music in advertising and how it may influence <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> formation. Two groups of subjects (high or low involvement) were presented with three television advertisements embedded within a sitcom, each paired with either familiar, unfamiliar, or no music. Immediately afterwards, subjects completed <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> memory/beliefs measures. The results are inconclusive due to inconsistencies between the commercial and the manipulated variables. There is evidence that music does influence <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> formation but it is not clear whether this influence is generalizable across all advertisements...|$|R

25|$|Some {{news outlets}} have called into {{question}} why the Baltimore County Crisis Intervention Team was not deployed. Police say trained negotiators were involved but could not respond {{as to why the}} unit was not dispatched. Others suggest there are deficiencies in the way law enforcement attempt to deescalate interactions in minority communities, suggesting that Gaines' interactions with police may have been shaped by <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> regarding police and the justice system in urban black communities. According to Vox Media reports, legally, the police officers only must reasonably believe that their lives were in immediate danger, but are not required to ascertain whether the shooting victim actually posed a threat, however, activists maintain the police should have sought other means of resolving the conflict. Others have called for the hiring of more female police officers, arguing that policewomen {{would be less likely to}} use lethal force to resolve conflicts.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, body schema {{and body}} image were {{generally}} lumped together, used interchangeably, or ill-defined. In science and elsewhere, the two terms are still commonly misattributed or confused. [...] Efforts {{have been made to}} distinguish the two and define them in clear and differentiable ways.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on {{tropical}} fruits, both in fresh and processed form, and on the influence of socio-demographic, psychosocial and socio-environmental factors on their consumption and purchasing intention. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire-based survey (n = 290) was used to gain insight in the perceived importance of different food choice determinants (i. e. familiarity with tropical fruits, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> towards this food category, influence of social norm and socio-demographic characteristics), and their role on the intention to purchase tropical fruits. Data analysis consisted of descriptive analyses and statistical validation. Findings – Familiarity with tropical fruits differs and depends on consumers’ product-related experiences. Tropical fruits are perceived as nutritious, healthy, good in taste, attractive and special. Socio-demographic characteristics, such as gender, place of living and travel experience outside Europe, associate with product familiarity, consumers’ general <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>beliefs,</b> <b>and</b> the purchasing intention of tropical fruits. Originality/value – This paper covers a previously rather unexplored, even neglected research topic, namely consumers’ <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> behavioural intention towards fresh and processed tropical fruits...|$|R

The inner self, or inner ego, {{is responsible for the}} construction and maintenance of the individual's physical body and immediate physical environment, and the unfolding of events is determined by the expectations, <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> of the outer ego, that portion of the self that human beings know as themselves.

2500|$|Some pedophiles do not molest children. Little {{is known}} about this {{population}} because most studies of pedophilia use criminal or clinical samples, {{which may not be}} representative of pedophiles in general. Researcher Michael Seto suggests that pedophiles who commit child sexual abuse do so because of other anti-social traits in addition to their sexual attraction. He states that pedophiles who are [...] "reflective, sensitive to the feelings of others, averse to risk, abstain from alcohol or drug use, and endorse <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> supportive of norms and the laws" [...] may be unlikely to abuse children. A 2015 study indicates that pedophiles who molested children are neurologically distinct from non-offending pedophiles. The pedophilic molesters had neurological deficits suggestive of disruptions in inhibitory regions of the brain, while non-offending pedophiles had no such deficits.|$|E

This measure is completed on a computer by working with 150 stimulus words.

The participants are shown a set of words and then press a key {{in response to the}} words. The participants' reaction times represent their connection between themselves and nature (faster times mean higher connection). A recent study found that when positive categories (such as flowers) were paired with a pleasant word, the reaction time was faster than when flowers were paired with a negative word.

This study {{investigates the}} level of {{teachers}} ‟ knowledge towards the nature of science (NOS), <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> towards inquiry teaching, and the implementation of inquiry-based learning (IBL); the difference of the implementation of IBL based on teachers ‟ years of experience; {{and the relationship between}} teachers ‟ knowledge on NOS, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> towards inquiry teaching with the implementation of IBL. The quantitative research methodology has been used to complete this study. The sample involved is 728 in-service primary science teachers in China.

The items measuring teachers ‟ knowledge on NOS, teachers ‟ attitude towards inquiry teaching and the implementation of IBL are adopted from previous studies with the permission of the respective author; whereas, the items measuring teachers ‟ belief towards inquiry teaching has been adapted from another study to meet with the research objectives.

5000|$|The Tribunal {{found that}} the applicant's race and/or gender {{played a role in}} the officer's failure to take steps to try and de-escalate the situation. They {{recognized}} that there is an inherent exercise of power and power imbalance in an interaction between a police officer and the public, and that this may be inappropriately exacerbated when it is combined with a racial and/or gender power dynamic. The Tribunal cited a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, which recognized that racial discrimination most often does not operate on a conscious basis, but rather emanates from unconscious <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> systems. [...] In a historical context, some of these <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> systems include the fact that Black persons (and other groups) are expected to “know their place” and that any Black person who talks back or refuses to comply is to be regarded as “uppity” and needs to be dealt with harshly.|$|R
