25|$|Eloy Velasco, {{the judge}} {{in charge of the}} <b>Audiencia</b> <b>Nacional</b> of Spain ordered the arrested men taken to Spain for {{questioning}} under charges of piracy, possession of illegal weapons, damage to government property, and assault on members of the security forces. Velasco considered that the attack in international waters came under Spanish jurisdiction since the assault was carried out against Spanish citizens and no current agreement with a third country prevented a Spanish trial.|$|E
25|$|Spanish law {{recognizes the}} {{principle}} of universal jurisdiction. Article 23.4 of the Judicial Power Organization Act (LOPJ), enacted on 1 July 1985, establishes that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Spaniards or foreign citizens outside Spain when such crimes can be described according to Spanish criminal law as genocide, terrorism, or some other, {{as well as any}} other crime that, according to international treaties or conventions, must be prosecuted in Spain. On 25 July 2009, the Spanish Congress passed a law that limits the competence of the <b>Audiencia</b> <b>Nacional</b> under Article 23.4 to cases in which Spaniards are victims, there is a relevant link to Spain, or the alleged perpetrators are in Spain. The law still has to pass the Senate, the high chamber, but passage is expected because it is supported by both major parties.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2009, Senator Gregg {{was sent}} to {{accompany}} an American diplomat to speak with a Spanish diplomat [...] after a war crimes case was filed by Spanish NGO Association for the Dignity of Spanish Prisoners at the <b>Audiencia</b> <b>Nacional</b> of Spain accusing them of crimes in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. The case targeted six former US government officials for allegedly violating the Geneva Convention, the 1984 Convention Against Torture, and the 1998 Rome Statute. The six accused were: Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Douglas Feith, Jay Bybee, and John Yoo. A summary of the meeting as recorded in a confidential diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Complaints were lodged against former Israeli Defense Forces {{chief of}} General Staff Lt.-Gen. (res.) Dan Halutz {{and six other}} senior Israeli {{political}} and military officials by pro-Palestinian organizations, who sought to prosecute them in Spain under the principle of universal jurisdiction. On 29 January 2009, Fernando Andreu, a judge of the <b>Audiencia</b> <b>Nacional,</b> opened preliminary investigations into claims that a targeted killing attack in Gaza in 2002 warranted the prosecution of Halutz, the former Israeli defence minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the former defence chief-of-staff Moshe Ya'alon, and four others, for crimes against humanity. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticized the decision, and Israeli officials refused to provide information requested by the Spanish court. The attack killed the founder {{and leader of the}} military wing of the Islamic militant organisation Hamas, Salah Shehade, who Israel said was responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths. The attack also killed 14 others (including his wife and 9 children). It had targeted the building where Shahade hid in Gaza City. It also wounded some 150 Palestinians, according to the complaint (or 50, according to other reports). [...] The Israeli chief of operations and prime minister apologized officially, saying they were unaware, due to faulty intelligence, that civilians were in the house. The investigation in the case was halted on 30 June 2009 by a decision of a panel of 18 judges of the <b>Audiencia</b> <b>Nacional.</b> The Spanish Court of Appeals rejected the lower court's decision, and on appeal in April 2010 the Supreme Court of Spain upheld the Court of Appeals decision against conducting an official inquiry into the IDF's targeted killing of Shehadeh.|$|E
2500|$|After {{transition}} to democracy the perception of Rodezno changed dramatically. In the current Spanish public discourse he is associated mostly with the most repressive phase of Francoism. Naming of the Pamplona plaza was subject to heated public debate in Navarre and elsewhere following adoption of [...] and ley de Memoria Histórica. The 2008-2009 discussion, involving present-day political parties and related to some present-day political issues, has eventually led to renaming the plaza to “Conde de Rodezno”, an aristocratic title formally not associated with any individual, until in 2016 it was renamed to [...] "Plaza de la Libertad". The former [...] erected during Francoism to honor the fallen requetés has been renamed to “Sala de exposiciónes Conde de Rodezno” but in public it prefers to be named “Sala de exposiciónes”. In unrestrained cyberspace Rodezno is at times referred to as [...] "fascist to the core". In 2008 <b>Audiencia</b> <b>Nacional,</b> the Spanish high tribunal, launched formal bid to acknowledge Rodezno as guilty of crimes against humanity during his tenure as Minister of Justice and afterwards, but the motion bore no fruit due to procedural reasons. Judge Baltasar Garzón was later charged with perversion of justice for launching the bid, which was defined as an error by the Supreme Court of Spain.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his release}} {{on grounds of}} ill health, the {{unprecedented}} detention of Pinochet {{in a foreign country}} for crimes against humanity committed in his own country, without a warrant or request for extradition from his own country, marks a watershed in international law. Some scholars consider {{it one of the most}} important events in judicial history since the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals. Judge Garzón's case was largely founded on the principle of universal jurisdiction—that certain crimes are so egregious that they constitute crimes against humanity and can therefore be prosecuted in any court in the world. The British House of Lords ruled that Pinochet had no right to immunity from prosecution as a former head of state, and could be put on trial. In Spain, the Court of Appeal of the <b>Audiencia</b> <b>Nacional</b> affirmed Spanish jurisdiction over Argentine and Chilean cases, declaring that domestic amnesty laws (in the case of Chile, the 1978 amnesty law passed by Pinochet's regime) could not bind the Spanish courts. Both for matters concerning the [...] "Dirty War" [...] in Argentina and for Chile, they characterized the crimes as genocides. However, both the Spanish and British decision did not rely on international law, but on domestic legislation: [...] "They talked about universal jurisdiction, but grounded their decision in domestic statutory law." ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>Audiencia</b> <b>Nacional</b> (National Court) is {{a special}} and {{exceptional}} high court in Spain. It has jurisdiction over all of the Spanish territory, as well as over international crimes which come under the competence of Spanish courts. The <b>Audiencia</b> <b>Nacional</b> was created in 1977 {{at the same time}} as the Public Order Tribunal (Tribunal de Orden Público), a Francoist institution, ceased to exist. Despite what many people think, the two work differently, and both the Spanish Constitutional Court and the European Commission of Human Rights have observed this tribunal to be legal. Its seat is in the city of Madrid. In most cases, the rulings and decisions of these different divisions of the <b>Audiencia</b> <b>Nacional</b> can be appealed before the Supreme Court of Spain.|$|E
