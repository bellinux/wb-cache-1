25|$|Modern composers {{will often}} specify the beating spot {{to alter the}} sound of the drum. When the timpani are struck {{directly}} in the center, they have a sound that is almost completely devoid of tone and resonance.

This effect is used by composers such as Bartók, Bernstein, and Kodály.|$|E
25|$|Gershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and {{composition}} with Rubin Goldmark, Henry Cowell and Joseph Brody.

After returning to New York City, he wrote Porgy and Bess with Ira and the author DuBose Heyward.
