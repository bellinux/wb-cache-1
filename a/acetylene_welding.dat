50|$|Early {{one morning}} in 1981, other {{visitors}} to Palmyra, sailors Robert and Sharon Jordan, from Durban, South Africa, found Muff Graham's skull and other skeletal remains in the surf near a large metal container. The remains showed signs of dismemberment and burning (possibly by Mac Graham's <b>acetylene</b> <b>welding</b> torch), and the body {{appeared to have been}} concealed underwater in the container.|$|E

50|$|In thick fog on 10 September 1951 the Scillonian was on {{her usual}} journey to St Mary’s. Visibility that day was {{described}} by the lifeboat secretary, Trevellick Moyle as “I don’t think I have ever seen it thicker”. The ship did not have radar and the captain, in poor visibility, often found his bearings by listening for the bell buoy of the Spanish Ledge, or the bugle of Vic Trenwith who would play on Peninnis Head. The captain heard neither and the Scillonian continued westward and hit the Great Wingletang Ledge on St Agnes. The fog lifted later that day to find the ship between two rocks and her bow in the air. Nine hours later, at 11 pm, she was refloated by the tide together with her own engines and {{a line from the}} lifeboat, and {{made her way to the}} harbour. The next day patched with cement and <b>acetylene</b> <b>welding</b> she was cleared by the Board of Trade as seaworthy to make the return journey to the mainland.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{main task}} {{of this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of hardfacing technique and service temperature on the fatigue properties of heat-resistant steel X 45 CrSi 9 - 3 coated with Co-based alloy Stellite 12. The results of rotating bending fatigue tests showed that at room temperature (RT), the fatigue strength of specimens <b>welded</b> by the <b>acetylene</b> gas <b>welding</b> (AGW) was lower than that of specimens welded by the plasma transferred arc welding (PTAW). For PTAW specimens, the fatigue strength at 500 oC was much higher than that at RT. Two failure modes were presented, one was termed as the coating failure mode at RT and the other was termed as coating-interface failure mode at 500 oC. The fatigue life prediction was conducted by using a modified Murakami’s model...|$|R
2500|$|Acetylene is {{the primary}} fuel for {{oxy-fuel}} welding and is the fuel of choice for repair work and general cutting and <b>welding.</b> <b>Acetylene</b> gas is shipped in special cylinders designed to keep the gas dissolved. [...] The cylinders are packed with porous materials (e.g. kapok fibre, diatomaceous earth, or (formerly) asbestos), then filled to around 50% capacity with acetone, as acetylene is soluble in acetone. This method is necessary because above 207 kPa (30 lbf/in²) (absolute pressure) acetylene is unstable and may explode.|$|R
50|$|On an {{oxyacetylene}} torch system {{there will be}} three types of valves, the tank valve, the regulator valve, and the torch valve. There will be a set of these three valves for each gas. The gas in the tanks or cylinders is at high pressure. Oxygen cylinders are generally filled to approximately 2200 psi. The regulator converts the high pressure gas to a low pressure stream suitable for <b>welding.</b> <b>Acetylene</b> cylinders must be maintained in an upright position to prevent the internal acetone and acetylene from separating in the filler material.|$|R

50|$|Flame contact welding is a {{very common}} form of welding. The most popular kind of flame contact welding is oxyfuel gas welding. Flame contact welding uses a flame exposed {{to the surface of}} the metals being welded to melt and then join them together. Oxyfuel uses oxygen as a primary {{ignition}} source in tandem with another gas such as acetylene to produce a flame which is 2500oC at the tip and 2800-3500oC at the tip of the inner cone. Other gasses such as propane and methanol can be used for oxyfuel <b>welding.</b> <b>Acetylene</b> is the most common gas used in oxyfuel welding.|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} few years the {{attention}} of architects, engineers and others encased in or connected with the building industry has been attracted to the possibilities of the application of welding processes to the joining of structural members.

It developed however on examination of the two processes that while <b>acetylene</b> <b>welding</b> gave better results in most cases {{it was only in the}} hands of experts that it could consistently outscore the arc as a welding medium. Arc-welding has the advantage over the acetylene process, where each individual operator must use his own judgement as to the proper flame, in that a squad of arc-welders can work under the direction of a single expert supervisor who accepts the responsibility of fixing the current value and of determining the proper size of welding rod to be used on any given type of work...|$|E
40|$|Acetylene is a colorless gas {{commonly}} used for welding. It acts mainly {{as a simple}} asphyxiant. In this paper, however, we present a patient who developed a severe interstitial pneumonitis after acetylene exposure during aluminum welding. A 44 -year old man was welding with acetylene, argon and aluminum electrode sticks in a non-ventilated aluminum tank for 2 h. Four hours after welding dyspnea appeared and 22 h later he was admitted at the Emergency Department due to severe respiratory insufficiency with pO 2 = 6. 7 kPa. Chest X-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltration. Pulmonary function and gas diffusion tests revealed a severe restriction (55 % of predictive volume) and impaired diffusion capacity (47 % of predicted capacity). Toxic interstitial pneumonitis was diagnosed and high-dose systemic corticosteroid methylprednisolone and inhalatory corticosteroid fluticasone therapy was started. Computed Tomography (CT) of the lungs showed a diffuse patchy ground-glass opacity with no signs of small airway disease associated with interstitial pneumonitis. Corticosteroid therapy was continued for the next 8 weeks gradually reducing the doses. The patient's follow-up did not show any deterioration of respiratory function. In conclusion, <b>acetylene</b> <b>welding</b> might result in severe toxic interstitial pneumonitis that improves after an early systemic and inhalatory corticosteroid therapy...|$|E
