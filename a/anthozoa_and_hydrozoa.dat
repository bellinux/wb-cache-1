40|$|Cnidaria {{is a rich}} phylum that {{includes}} thousands of marine species. In this study, we focused on <b>Anthozoa</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hydrozoa</b> that are represented by the Nematostella vectensis (Sea anemone) and Hydra magnipapillata genomes. We present a method for ranking the toxin-like candidates from complete proteomes of Cnidaria. Toxin-like functions were revealed using ClanTox, a statistical machine-learning predictor trained on ion channel inhibitors from venomous animals. Fundamental features that were emphasized in training ClanTox include cysteines and their spacing along the sequences. Among the 83, 000 proteins derived from Cnidaria representatives, we found 170 candidates that fulfill the properties of toxin-like-proteins, {{the vast majority of}} which were previously unrecognized as toxins. An additional 394 short proteins exhibit characteristics of toxin-like proteins at a moderate degree of confidence. Remarkably, only 11 % of the predicted toxin-like proteins were previously classified as toxins. Based on our prediction methodology and manual annotation, we inferred functions for over 400 of these proteins. Such functions include protease inhibitors, membrane pore formation, ion channel blockers and metal binding proteins. Many of the proteins belong to small families of paralogs. We conclude that the evolutionary expansion of toxin-like proteins in Cnidaria contributes to their fitness in the complex environment of the aquatic ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Cnidaria, {{the sister}} group to Bilateria, {{is a highly}} diverse group of animals in terms of morphology, lifecycles, ecology, and development. How this {{diversity}} originated and evolved is not well understood because phylogenetic relationships among major cnidarian lineages are unclear, and recent studies present contrasting phylogenetic hypotheses. Here, we use transcriptome data from 15 newly-sequenced species in combination with 26 publicly available genomes and transcriptomes to assess phylogenetic relationships among major cnidarian lineages. Phylogenetic analyses using different partition schemes and models of molecular evolution, as well as topology tests for alternative phylogenetic relationships, support the monophyly of Medusozoa, <b>Anthozoa,</b> Octocorallia, <b>Hydrozoa,</b> <b>and</b> a clade consisting of Staurozoa, Cubozoa, and Scyphozoa. Support for the monophyly of Hexacorallia is weak due to the equivocal position of Ceriantharia. Taken together, these results further resolve deep cnidarian relationships, largely support traditional phylogenetic views on relationships, and provide a historical framework for studying the evolutionary processes involved {{in one of the}} most ancient animal radiations...|$|R

40|$|Two cold-water coral taxa, Octocorallia in {{the class}} <b>Anthozoa</b> <b>and</b> Stylasteridae {{in the class}} Hydrozoa, were identified. Deep-water samples were {{collected}} in fishing nets at depths ranging between 20 and 200 m along the coasts of the East Sea in Korea from 1976 to 1993. The two species {{found in this study}} represent new records for Korea: Paragorgia arborea (Linnaeus, 1758) in the class <b>Anthozoa,</b> <b>and</b> Stylaster profundiporus Broch, 1936 in the class Hydrozoa. Two families, Paragorgiidae and Stylasteridae, are also newly recorded in Korea.

The two newly recorded cold-water coral species from Korea are described in detail based on their morphological characteristics. Paragorgia arborea is characterized by its growth form, medulla and cortex, zooid dimorphism, canal system, and spicule composition. Stylaster profundiporus is distinguished by its external skeletal characteristics, such as the coordination of dactylopores and gastropores, presence or absence of gastrostyles and dactylostyles, cyclosystem orientation, ampullar position, gastropore tube shape, and coenosteal texture...|$|R
40|$|Shipwrecks are {{considered}} artificial reef environments - structures immersed in aquatic environments (especially marine ones) that provide fauna with shelter, hard substrates, food and nursery areas. This study aimed {{to survey the}} benthic animal biodiversity of the Pirapama shipwreck, located 23 m deep and six miles off Recife harbor. From 2001 to 2007, species were observed, photographed and collected through scuba diving. The material was later sorted and identified in the laboratory. A total of 76 sessile and sedentary animal taxa were recorded belonging to the following phyla: Porifera (Demospongiae <b>and</b> Calcarea), Cnidaria (<b>Hydrozoa</b> <b>and</b> <b>Anthozoa),</b> Mollusca (Bivalvia <b>and</b> Gastropoda), Annelida (Polychaeta), Arthropoda (Cirripedia), Bryozoa (Gymnolaemata), Echinodermata (Asteroidea and Echinoidea), and Chordata (Ascidiacea). The greatest richness was for Porifera and Bryozoa - 13 listed species for each. Eleven new occurrences were recorded {{for the state of}} Pernambuco, the hydroid Halopteris polymorpha and ten bryozoan species, one of them being the first record for Brazil (Scrupocellaria curacaoensis).

40|$|International audienceThe phylum Cnidaria {{is usually}} divided into five classes: <b>Anthozoa,</b> Cubozoa, <b>Hydrozoa,</b> Scyphozoa <b>and</b> Staurozoa. The class Anthozoa is {{subdivided}} into two subclasses: Hexacorallia and Octocorallia. Morphological and molecular studies based on nuclear rDNA and recent phylogenomic studies support the monophyly of Anthozoa. On the other hand, molecular studies based on mitochondrial markers, including two recent studies based on mitogenomic data, supported the paraphyly of <b>Anthozoa,</b> <b>and</b> positioned Octocorallia as sister group to Medusozoa (the monophyletic group of Cubozoa, <b>Hydrozoa</b> <b>and</b> Scyphozoa). On {{the basis of}} 51 nuclear orthologs from four hexacorallians, four octocorallians, two hydrozoans and one scyphozoan (with poriferans and Homo sapiens as out-groups), we built a multilocus alignment of 9 873 amino acids, which aimed at minimizing missing data and hidden paralogy, {{in order to understand}} the discrepancy between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies. Our phylogenetic analyses strongly supported the monophyly of Anthozoa. We compared the level of substitution saturation between our data set, the data sets of two recent phylogenomic studies and one of a mitogenomic study.

40|$|Cnidarians are {{the most}} {{primitive}} animals to possess a nervous system. This phylum is composed of the classes Scyphozoa (jellyfish), Cubozoa (box jellyfish), <b>and</b> <b>Hydrozoa</b> (e. g., Hydra, Hydractinia), which make up the subphylum Medusozoa, {{as well as the}} class <b>Anthozoa</b> (sea anemones <b>and</b> corals). Neuropeptides have an early evolutionary origin and are already abundant in cnidarians. For example, from the cnidarian Hydra, a key model system for studying the peptides involved in developmental and physiological processes, we identified a wide variety of novel neuropeptides from Hydra magnipapillata (the Hydra Peptide Project). Most of these peptides act directly on muscle cells and induce contraction and relaxation. Some peptides are involved in cell differentiation and morphogenesis. In this review, we describe FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs), GLWamide-family peptides, and the neuropeptide Hym- 355; FPQSFLPRGamide. Several hundred FLPs have been isolated from invertebrate animals such as cnidarians. GLWamide-family peptides function as signaling molecules in muscle contraction, metamorphosis, and settlement in cnidarians. Hym- 355; FPQSFLPRGamide enhances neuronal differentiation in Hydra. Recently, GLWamide-family peptides and Hym- 355; FPQSFLPRGamide were shown to trigger oocyte maturation and subsequent spawning in the hydrozoan jellyfish Cytaeis uchidae. These findings suggest the importance of these neuropeptides in both developmental and physiological processes...|$|R
500|$|Within the Cnidaria, the <b>Anthozoa</b> (sea anemones <b>and</b> corals) are {{regarded}} as the sister-group of the rest, {{which suggests that the}} earliest cnidarians were sessile polyps with no medusa stage. However, it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage, since Hydrozoa form medusae by budding {{from the side of the}} polyp while the other Medusozoa do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp. The traditional grouping of Scyphozoa included the Staurozoa, but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to Cubozoa (box jellies) than to other [...] "Scyphozoa". Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct Conulariida suggest that they are closely related. The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the cnidarian family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria, and this is supported by the fact that <b>Anthozoa</b> <b>and</b> Bilateria share some genes that determine the main axes of the body.|$|R

30|$|Zoanthids are {{an order}} (Zoantharia = Zoanthidea) of Hexacorallia (Cnidaria: <b>Anthozoa)</b> <b>and</b> are common benthos in {{tropical}} and subtropical shallow waters (e.g., Karlson 1980). Species of the zooxanthellate genera Zoanthus (family Zoanthidae) and Palythoa (Sphenopidae) within the suborder Brachycnemina are usually dominant components of live reef cover, particularly on coral reef tops and reef edges (Burnett et al. 1997; Swain 2010; Irei et al. 2011). Nevertheless, species identification in both genera is problematic due to much intraspecific variation and plasticity (Burnett et al. 1994, 1997; Reimer et al. 2004; Ong et al. 2013) {{and a high}} “synonymy load” due to inadvertent redescriptions {{of the same species}} from different localities (Burnett et al. 1997).|$|R

40|$|The low {{evolutionary}} rate of mitochondrial {{genes in}} Anthozoa has challenged their utility for phylogenetic and systematic purposes, especially for DNA barcoding.

In this study, the divergence of mitochondrial DNA of Ceriantharia was compared to members of other <b>Anthozoa</b> <b>and</b> Medusozoa groups. In addition, nuclear markers were used to check the relative phylogenetic position of Ceriantharia in relation to other Cnidaria members. The results demonstrated a pattern of divergence of mitochondrial DNA completely different from those estimated for other anthozoans, and phylogenetic analyses indicate that Ceriantharia is not included within hexacorallians in most performed analyses. Thus, we propose that the Ceriantharia should be addressed as a separate clade...|$|R

40|$|Background: The metagenesis of sessile polyps into pelagic medusae in cnidarians {{represents}} one of the most ancient complex life cycles in animals. Interestingly, scyphozoans and hydrozoans generate medusae by apparently fundamentally different processes. It is therefore unclear whether medusa formation has evolved independently in different medusozoans. To this end, a thorough understanding of the correspondence of polyp and medusa is required. Results: We monitored the expression patterns of conserved developmental genes in developing medusae of Clytia hemisphaerica (<b>Hydrozoa)</b> <b>and</b> Aurelia aurita (Scyphozoa) and found that developing medusae and polyps share similarities in their morphology and developmental gene expression. Unexpectedly, however, polyp tentacle marker genes were consistently expressed in the developing medusa bell, suggesting that the bell of medusae corresponds to modified and fused polyp tentacle anlagen. Conclusions: Our data represent the first comparative gene expression analysis of developing medusae in two representatives of Scyphozoa <b>and</b> <b>Hydrozoa.</b> The results challenge prevailing views about polyp medusa body plan homology. We propose that the evolution of a new life stage may be facilitated by the adoption of existing developmental genes...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{molecular}} data for species delimitation in Anthozoa {{is still a}} very delicate issue. This is probably due to the low genetic variation found among the molecular markers (primarily mitochondrial) commonly used for Anthozoa. Ceriantharia is an anthozoan group that has not been tested for genetic divergence at the species level. Recently, all three Atlantic species described for the genus Isarachnanthus of Atlantic Ocean, were deemed synonyms based on morphological simmilarities of only one species: Isarachnanthus maderensis. Here, we aimed to verify whether genetic relationships (using COI, 16 S, ITS 1 and ITS 2 molecular markers) confirmed morphological affinities among members of Isarachnanthus from different regions across the Atlantic Ocean. Results from four DNA markers were completely congruent and revealed that two different species exist in the Atlantic Ocean. The low identification success and substantial overlap between intra and interspecific COI distances render the Anthozoa unsuitable for DNA barcoding, which is not true for Ceriantharia. In addition, genetic divergence within and between Ceriantharia species is more similar to that found in Medusozoa (<b>Hydrozoa</b> <b>and</b> Scyphozoa) than <b>Anthozoa</b> <b>and</b> Porifera that have divergence rates similar to typical metazoans. The two genetic species could also be separated based on micromorphological characteristics of their cnidomes.

In stony corals, also known as hard corals, the polyps produce a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate to strengthen and protect the organism. This is deposited by the polyps and by the coenosarc, the living tissue that connects them. The polyps sit in cup-shaped depressions in the skeleton known as corallites. Colonies of stony coral are very variable in appearance; a single species may adopt an encrusting, plate-like, bushy, columnar or massive solid structure, the various forms often being linked to different types of habitat, with variations in light level and water movement being significant.|$|R

40|$|Taxonomically {{restricted}} genes or lineage-specific genes {{contribute to}} morphological diversification in metazoans and provide unique functions for particular taxa in adapting to specific environments. To understand how such genes arise {{and participate in}} morphological evolution, we have investigated a gene called nematogalectin in Hydra, which has a structural role {{in the formation of}} nematocysts, stinging organelles that are unique to the phylum Cnidaria. Nematogalectin is a 28 -kDa protein with an N-terminal GlyXY domain (glycine followed by two hydrophobic amino acids), which can form a collagen triple helix, followed by a galactose-binding lectin domain. Alternative splicing of the nematogalectin transcript allows the gene to encode two proteins, nematogalectin A and nematogalectin B. We demonstrate that expression of nematogalectin A and B is mutually exclusive in different nematocyst types: Desmonemes express nematogalectin B, whereas stenoteles and isorhizas express nematogalectin B early in differentiation, followed by nematogalectin A. Like Hydra, the marine hydrozoan Clytia also has two nematogalectin transcripts, which are expressed in different nematocyte types. By comparison, anthozoans have only one nematogalectin gene. Gene phylogeny indicates that tandem duplication of nematogalectin B exons gave rise to nematogalectin A before the divergence of <b>Anthozoa</b> <b>and</b> Medusozoa and that nematogalectin A was subsequently lost in Anthozoa. The emergence of nematogalectin A may {{have played a role in}} the morphological diversification of nematocysts in the medusozoan lineage...|$|R

Unlike other cnidarians however, the cavity is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions, thin sheets of living tissue, known as mesenteries. The gonads are also located within the cavity walls.

This approach allows fluorescent proteins to be used as reporters for any number of biological events, such as sub-cellular localization and expression patterns.A variant of GFP is naturally found in corals, specifically the <b>Anthozoa,</b> <b>and</b> several mutants have been created to span the visible spectra and fluoresce longer and more stably.Other proteins are fluorescent but require a fluorophore cofactor, and hence can only be used in vitro; these are often found in plants and algae (phytofluors, phycobiliprotein such as allophycocyanin).|$|R
