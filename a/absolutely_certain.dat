25|$|Viticulture {{in present-day}} Germany {{dates back to}} Ancient Roman times, to {{sometime}} from 70 to 270 CE/AD (Agri Decumates). In those days, the western parts of today's Germany made up the outpost of the Roman empire against the Germanic tribes {{on the other side}} of Rhine. What is generally considered Germany's oldest city, Trier, was founded as a Roman garrison and is situated directly on the river Moselle (Mosel) in the eponymous wine region. The oldest archeological finds that may indicate early German viticulture are curved pruning knives found in the vicinity of Roman garrisons, dating from the 1st century AD. However, it is not <b>absolutely</b> <b>certain</b> that these knives were used for viticultural purposes. Emperor Probus, whose reign can be dated two centuries later than these knives, is generally considered the founder of German viticulture, but for solid documentation of winemaking on German soil, we must go to around 370 AD, when Ausonius of Bordeaux wrote Mosella, where he in enthusiastic terms described the steep vineyards on river Moselle.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ball}} was bowled along the ground, the batsman used his curved bat to attack {{it and try to}} hit it away, usually with the {{intention}} of lofting it over the fielders. There was, as such, no defensive technique other than the most rudimentary and instinctive attempt to stop a ball that had deceived him. The pitched delivery made the curved bat obsolete and the straight bat lent itself to the deployment of a defensive stroke. As the aim of the batsman with a curved bat was to hit the ball over the fielders, low scores were normal. If he did not time his shot correctly, the chances were high that he would miss the ball and be bowled or stumped; or else if he hit it poorly, he would not clear the fielder and be caught out. In addition, the pitches of the time were little more than rough tracks which were to the bowler's advantage. One of the greatest players of the pioneering period was Richard Newland of Slindon and Sussex. In July 1745, he scored 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not <b>absolutely</b> <b>certain</b> that he did this in one innings as it may have been his match total (there is a parallel here with Small in a 1768 match). If it was one innings, it is the highest individual score recorded during the pioneering period and, for its time, was a very high score which could equate in real terms to a modern triple-century.|$|E

In this paper, we extend this procedure to all BPS-saturated amplitudes of the form ∫_F Γ_d+k,dΦ, with Φ being a weak (almost) holomorphic modular form of weight -k/ 2. We use the fact that any such Φ can be expressed as a linear combination of <b>certain</b> <b>absolutely</b> convergent Poincaré series, against which the fundamental domain F can be unfolded.
