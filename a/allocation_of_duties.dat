40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} two questions. First, under what {{conditions}} would two countries agree to hold their bilateral cross exchange rate fixed? and second, what <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> intervention <b>duties</b> would this require? Answers to these questions are sought by combining a standard macroeconomic model of an open economy with the solution concepts of fixed-threat bargaining games. It is shown that for reasonable parameter values {{the core of the}} bargaining game implied by this set-up is non-empty, so that an agreed-upon and mutually beneficial <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> intervention <b>duties</b> exists. Conditions for the non-emptiness of the core as well as the properties of the Nash solution are discussed and the results are used to characterize the difference between a monetary union and a fixed exchange rate regime. It is argued that a fixed exchange rate system in which the bargaining solution requires an asymmetric <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> intervention <b>duties</b> cannot be an intermediate phase in the transition towards a monetary union.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{issues concerning}} local versus global equality of opportunity, {{the presence of}} inequality for education attainment and the optimality of policies addressing such problems. The literature distinguishes between two different approaches to distributive justice: the global and the local approach. Local distributive justice analysis determines the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> rights, <b>duties</b> and resources concerning {{a subset of the}} aspects that determine individual welfare. On the other hand, global distributive justice analysis determines the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> rights, <b>duties</b> and resources concerning all aspects in a society that affect individuals welfare. Global and local distributive justice notions have been analyzed independently in the literature and the focus has been more on global rather than local distributive justice. In the first chapter we interpret a collection of local distributive justice problems as decentralized global distributive justice problems. This permits global distributive justice analysis, mainly done by philosophers, to inform policymakers on what the local distributive justice goal should be, and also allows us to understand what the global distributive justice properties of a collection of local problems are. We then analyze the properties on local distributive justic...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} address the lack of {{knowledge}} in the water industry of how policy development can be understood to have shaped the development and application of European Union (EU) drinking water policy. In particular, the paper develops a comparative understanding of how policy development {{can be viewed as}} having affected the development and application of the Drinking Water Directive (80 / 778 /EEC) in England/Wales and the Republic of Ireland. As a result of this focus, the paper explores policy development issues relating to conflicting interests, invalid causal theories, political symbolism, lack of attention to detail by policy makers, and the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> and resources. It is subsequently established that consideration of these issues is useful in fostering a focused understanding of how policy development may have affected policy application. Despite the significant changes which took place with regard {{to the development of the}} current Drinking Water Directive (98 / 883 /EC), the paper concludes by arguing that greater attention should be accorded the conflicting interests and abilities of Member States during the development of EU water policy, particularly if attempts are to be made to identify measures targeted at improving the application of EU water policy in a diverse political and economic union of member states...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{framework}} for analyzing the moral responsibilities of global agents in what I call the Global Health Crisis (GHC), with special attention devoted to the moral responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies. The main contribution of this thesis is {{to provide a}} general account of the moral responsibilities of different global players, mapping the different kinds of duties they have, their content and force, and their relation to the responsibilities of other relevant actors in the GHC. I also apply this account to current debates surrounding the need for reforms to the international legal rules addressing the GHC, notably the TRIPs regime.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{decentralized}} charging control strategy {{for a large}} population of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to neutralize wind power fluctuations so as to improve the regulation of system frequency. Without relying on a central control entity, each PEV autonomously adjusts its charging or discharging power {{in response to a}} communal virtual price signal and based on its own urgency level of charging. Simulation results show that under the proposed charging control, the aggregate PEV power can effectively neutralize wind power fluctuations in real-time while differential <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> neutralization <b>duties</b> among the PEVs can be realized to meet the PEV users' charging requirements. Also, harmful wind-induced cyclic operations in thermal units can be mitigated.

40|$|Brain drain {{has been}} {{the main cause of}} {{academic}} staff attrition in Nigeria Higher Education Institutions which results in talent void. This circumstance has left HEIs to grapple with the challenge of managing the consequences of talent void among faculty in areas of course/module allocation, project supervision and recruitment of new talents to fill the vacuum occasioned by brain drain. This loss of experienced academics remains a challenge to institutions of higher learning in particular and often culminates in disruptive academic service delivery. In a proactive approach to manage the fallouts of talent void in HEIs, this research proposes a talent management strategy based on application of Profile theory to manage talent positioning in a higher education institution in Nigeria in order to cope with evolving workforce. The research specifically had its focus on three scenarios; talent recruitment, project supervision, and course/module allocation. The research used a mixed method of inquiry involving five departments in a single institution in which two sets of data were collected. The first set of data collection involved survey using questionnaire and interview. While simple descriptive statistics was used in analysing the questionnaire, Soft System Methodology was used in interpreting and analysing the qualitative data in order to gain rich contextual understanding of the problem situation. The second set of data collection involved anonymous artefact representing candidates’ attributes used for modelling candidates profile for capability and compatibility. The profile theory based talent management strategy was developed and evaluated using Importance-Satisfaction analysis model. Specifically, profile theory modelled candidates’ characteristics/attributes for talent identification and made distinctive talent identification where ties occurred based on capability and compatibility This research contributes to body of knowledge in two ways. First, it demonstrates how Talent Management approach can mitigate the impact of brain drain and other forms of employee turnover in HEI. Second, it also explores and demonstrates how profile theory tool can be applied in filling talent void and <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> as a strategy for talent positioning within academic roles in a HEI...|$|E

Four agreement designs are tested that differ {{in the level of}} total abatement and the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> abatement <b>duties</b> among coalition members. Apart from the standard assumption in the literature of an optimal and efficient abatement scheme, which we call “Reference Design”, three designs of a uniform emission reduction quota, which we call “Joint Quota”, “Median Quota Proposal” and “Lowest Quota Proposal”, are considered. Additionally, we analyze the possibility that quotas can be traded among signatories. The analysis is conducted with the empirical STAbility of COalitions (STACO) model that captures the impacts of the climate change problem on abatement costs and damage costs of 12 regions. Our findings show that uniform quotas help to improve upon the success of IEAs in the presence of free-rider incentives. The median and lowest quota agreement designs are particularly successful - with and without trade. Our results provide a rationale for the frequent application of uniform emission reduction quotas in past IEAs. ...|$|R

40|$|Describes {{experiences}} of: World Fish Center, IWMI, Bioversity with Knowledge networksContext: The {{approach is}} currently being adopted {{in the implementation of}} the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems. The approach encourages critical awareness of gender roles and norms among men and women, challenges the distribution of resources and <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> between men and women, and promotes the position of women while addressing power relationships between women and others in the community (Interagency Gender Working Group, USAID). The CCAFS Smart Farm (SF) Project and Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) are looking at strategies to address climate-related challenges. They are exploring viable gender-differentiated strategies to enhance the resilience, productivity and diversity of aquaculture systems in weather and water challenged contexts, including differentiated research needs in improving fish circulation, homestead pond management with women and integrating farming systems such as homestead vertical agriculture systems. The goal is ultimately to simultaneously help women and men farmers and fisherfolk increase their adaptive capacity and livelihoods. Worldfish as a whole is interested in gender transformative approaches to minimize vulnerabilities experienced by socially differentiated users. Interface: SF – researchers and communities exchange information, needs, ideas and jointly identify research questions. Involves a group-oriented visioning process between researchers and farmers/fisherfolk to identify needs and ways to achieve certain impacts. Men and women are approached separately and are strongly encouraged to identify their research needs. AAS – researchers are going to villages and talking to specific individuals about research needs but have not assessed the types of socially differentiated groups that need to be targeted. Learning: SF – Farmers are being trained by researchers to collect and interpret data so they are more independent in assessing their needs and have more direct decision-making about how to adapt to climate change and other drivers of change. AAS – Farmers are being trained on implementing micro-habitats in rice fields where fish can thrive even after the intense rains. WorldFish is getting school children involved in learning about research and GIS mapping so they can also take part in adapting to climate change in their own villages, so they do not need to migrate to large cities for alternative sources of income in the future. Channels: Knowledge networks, where scientists work with farmers’ networks in order to better identify needs and appropriate approaches on the ground. Outcome: Having senior management involved in gender approaches demonstrates that {{this is an issue that}} is being taken seriously across the centre...|$|E

40|$|While {{many studies}} have been {{conducted}} about the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> household <b>duties</b> within households, {{little is known about the}} impact of land use and accessibility on the distribution of out-of- home household tasks between spouses and about men's participation in such activities. This paper addresses this impact, while controlling for the impact of household structure, life cycle, employment status and hours, access to transport systems, and interactions among activities in persons' activity schedules. Path models for male ^ female couples in the Amsterdam^Utrecht corridor, the Netherlands, show that land use and accessibility influence between-partner interactions in maintenance activity participation, although their role appears to be smaller than that of sociodemographics and access to transport systems. While women perform the bulk of out-of-home household tasks, men are respon- sible for a larger share <b>of</b> out-of-home household <b>duties</b> in neighbourhoods characterised by a higher population density and/or more diversity of land uses than they are in lower density and/or less diverse neighbourhoods. However, women's responsibilities are not reduced to the same extent, because spouses' joint participation is also somewhat larger in higher density, more diverse neighbour- hoods and because part of men's participation in these neighbourhoods reflects household activities not undertaken elsewhere...|$|R

This thesis develops and implements a network linear programming model, called the Officer Staffing Goal Model-NPS (OSGM-NPS), {{to assist the}} United States Marine Corps in the peacetime <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> active <b>duty</b> officers to meet manpower requirements. Due to the Marine Corps' small officer population and diverse range of missions, they are constantly faced {{with the problem of}} which officer job positions to fill and which to leave vacant. A set of manning targets, called staffing goals, is needed to ensure the officer population is efficiently used. Targets are obtained by an allocation model (a generalized version of an assignment model) that takes the officer population (supply) and manpower requirements (demand) and retums a solution that fills the most requirements with the most suitable officers. A staffing goal for a billet represents the existence of an officer in the population that can fill that billet. The Marine Corps prioritizes requirements into classes, and unmet requirements within a priority class are shared evenly. OSGM-NPS's computer implementation comprises a group of portable algorithms written in FORTRAN using the elastic transhipment network solver ENET. OSGM-NPS solves the officer staffing goal problem with more requirements filled and unmet requirements more evenly shared than the current mainframe computer model, and it executes in a few minutes on a desktop personal computer making it a less expensive, more accessible modelCaptain, United States Marine Corp...|$|R
