5|$|Napoleon's focus now shifted {{towards the}} {{southern}} end of the battlefield where the French and the Allies were still fighting over Sokolnitz and Telnitz. In an effective double-pronged assault, St. Hilaire's division and part of Davout's III Corps smashed through the enemy at Sokolnitz and persuaded the commanders of the first two columns, Generals Kienmayer and Langeron, to flee <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could. Buxhowden, the commander of the Allied left and the man responsible for leading the attack, was completely drunk and fled as well. Kienmayer covered his withdrawal with the O'Reilly light cavalry, who gallantly managed to defeat five of six French cavalry regiments before they too had to retreat.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{contacts}} Sulu, who informs {{them the}} conference is being held at Camp Khitomer. Both ships head for the talks <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> can. As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the Bird of Prey with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.|$|E

25|$|Fluids {{that have}} low {{electrical}} conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are separated and hence electrostatic charge accumulation is not significant. In the petrochemical industry, 50 pS/m is the recommended minimum value of electrical conductivity for adequate removal of charge from a fluid.|$|E

Because of this, Major League teams began televising games and attracted {{a whole new}} audience into ballparks in the process. People who had only casually followed baseball began going to the games in person. In 1948, Major League Baseball's total attendance reached a record high of 21 million.|$|E

25|$|The January 1994 Chiapas uprising, and the assassinations of {{the ruling}} party's presidential {{candidate}} in March 1994, Luis Donaldo Colosio and the Secretary-General {{of the party and}} brother of the Assistant-Attorney General José Francisco Ruiz Massieu in 1994, sent a disquieting message to investors. Public debt holders rapidly sold their tesobonos, depleting the Central Bank's reserves, while portfolio investments, which had made up 90% of total investment flows, left the country <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had come in.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{charging}} mechanism can occur within low conductivity fluids flowing through pipelines—a process called flow electrification. Fluids which have low electrical conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are separated and hence electrostatic charge generation is not significant.

25|$|The {{rains and}} French mortar fire {{destroyed}} German field fortifications almost <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were built. To gain more defensive depth and to mislead the French about German offensive preparations at Verdun, the I Bavarian Reserve Corps (General der Infanterie Karl von Fasbender) conducted Unternehmen Rupprecht (Operation Rupprecht), several carefully prepared local attacks. Before the first attack (Unternehmen Rupprecht I), {{a battalion of}} Reserve Infantry Regiment 229 of the 50th Reserve Division built fake encampments and made several approach marches to simulate a big reinforcement of the area to French reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
50|$|If a {{mass transit}} network {{was going to}} be able to replace a highway, the system would need to offer the {{convenience}} of a car.

Unfortunately, they lost them back to Badd Company <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had won them. After the quick run with Badd Company, the Sheepherders again became entangled in a feud with the Fabulous Ones in a rivalry that seemingly would never end.

25|$|The War of the Spanish Succession {{and later}} Napoleonic Wars allowed {{politics}} {{to once again}} influence the fortune of Sherry and its producers. Sales to England and the Netherlands were dramatically reduced as hostilities increased. European tastes also started to change as {{the emergence of the}} more accessible port wine hit the world's wine market-being particularly encouraged by the favorable Methuen Treaty. This left many Sherry merchants with excess stock that could do little more than sit and age in oak barrels. Unlike during the boom market when Sherry makers were selling their stocks <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could produce it, these aging stocks began to slightly oxidize and develop more concentrated and nutty flavors.|$|E

25|$|Sheridan, {{who would}} be {{characterized}} in later battles as very aggressive, hesitated to pursue the smaller force, and also refused a request by Daniel McCook to move north {{in support of his}} brother's corps. However, his earlier request for reinforcements bore fruit and the 31st Brigade of Col. William P. Carlin (Mitchell's division) moved up on Sheridan's right. Carlin's men moved aggressively in pursuit of Powel, chasing them <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could run toward Perryville. As they reached the cemetery on the western outskirts of town, fierce artillery dueling commenced. Carlin pressed forward and was joined by the 21st Brigade of Col. George D. Wagner (Wood's division, II Corps). They were poised to capture the town and the critical crossroads that dominated Braxton Bragg's avenue of withdrawal, but an order from Gilbert to Mitchell curtailed the advance, despite Mitchell's furious protestations.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian economy did not {{stabilise}} {{after the}} war, and {{a period of}} hyperinflation followed: the money supply increased from 12 to 30 billion Kronen in 1920, and to about 147 billion Kronen {{at the end of}} 1921. In August 1922 consumer prices were 14,000 times greater than {{before the start of the}} war eight years earlier. The highest-denomination banknote issued was the 500,000 Kronen note, issued in 1922. Faith in the currency had been lost, and people spent money <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> received it. In October 1922 Austria secured a loan of 650 million gold Kronen from the League of Nations, with a League of Nations Commissioner supervising the country's finances. This stabilized the currency at a rate of 14,400 paper Kronen to 1 gold Krone. On 2 January 1923 the Austrian National Bank (Österreichische Nationalbank) began operations, taking over control of the currency from the Austro-Hungarian Bank which had gone into liquidation.|$|E
25|$|In 1741, Chinese {{rebels were}} present in Central Java, {{particularly}} around Tanjung (Welahan), Pati, Grobogan, and Kaliwungu. In May 1741 Juwana was captured by the Chinese. The Javanese at first sided with the Dutch and reinforced Demak on 10 June 1741. Two days later, a detachment of Javanese forces together with VOC forces of European, Balinese and Buginese in Semarang to defend Tugu, west of Semarang. The Chinese rebel lured them into their main forces’s position in Mount Bergota through narrow road and ambushed them. The allied forces were dispersed and ran <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could back to Semarang. The Chinese pursued them but were repulsed by Dutch cannons in the fortress. Semarang was seized by panic. By July 1741, the Chinese occupied Kaligawe, south of Semarang, Rembang, and besieged Jepara. This {{is the most dangerous}} time for VOC. Military superiority would enable VOC to hold Semarang without any support from Mataram forces, but it would mean nothing since a turbulent interior would disrupt trade and therefore profit, VOC’s main objective. One VOC high official, Abraham Roos, suggested that VOC assumed royal function in Java by denying Pakubuwana II’s “legitimacy” and asking the regents to take an oath of loyalty to VOC’s sovereignty. This was turned down by the Council of Indies (Raad van Indie) in Batavia, since even if VOC managed to conquer the coast, it would not be strong enough to conquer the mountainous interior of Java, which do not provide much level plain required by Western method of warfare. Therefore, the Dutch East India Company must support its superior but inadequate military by picking the right allies. One such ally had presented itself, that is Cakraningkrat IV of Madura who could be relied on to gold the eastern coast against the Chinese, but the interior of Eastern and Central Java was beyond the reach of this quarrelsome prince. Therefore, VOC {{had no choice but to}} side with Pakubuwana II.|$|E

500|$|The album {{consists}} of 22 songs, {{most of which}} are short, under 3 minutes, and contain no hooks or choruses. Sam Samuelson of AllMusic compared the album to a comic book, [...] "sometimes segued with vignettes sampled from 1940s movies and broadcasts or left-field -toting skits". He also noted that some instrumentals on the album [...] " [...] to be so out of time or step with a traditional hip-hop direction". The A.V. Club compared the album to a buffet, where [...] "Madlib and Doom are interested in throwing out ideas <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have them, giving them as much attention as they need, and {{moving on to the next}} thing".
