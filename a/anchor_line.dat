5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the <b>anchor</b> <b>line.</b> In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the <b>anchor</b> <b>line</b> during the decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|The diver ascends {{along the}} shotline, and may use it purely {{as a visual}} reference, or can {{hold on to it}} to {{positively}} control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to an <b>anchor</b> <b>line</b> or shot line during a decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground <b>anchor</b> <b>line</b> breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E

25|$|If {{there is}} no current, and the divers are visiting a small site and can surface on the shot-line or <b>anchor</b> <b>line,</b> keeping track is {{nominally}} simple if all goes to plan, as they will surface at a predictable position which is marked.

In other cases divers will not make it back to the shot-line and have to surface independently. If the dive boat is anchored and the plan is for the divers to ascend on the <b>anchor</b> <b>line,</b> {{it may be necessary to}} have a tender or chase boat available to follow and pick up divers surfacing off the mark.|$|E

40|$|Particle tracing {{has been}} {{established}} as a powerful visualization technique to show the dynamics of 3 D flows. Particle tracing in 3 D, however, quickly overextends the viewer due to the massive amount of visual information that is typically produced by this tech-nique. In this paper, we present strategies to reduce this amount {{at the same time}} revealing important structures in the flow. As an im-portance measure, we introduce a simple, yet effective clustering approach for vector fields, and we use scalar flow quantities at dif-ferent scales in combination with user-defined regions of interest. These measures are used to control the shape, the appearance, and the density of particles {{in such a way that}} the user can focus on the dynamics in important regions at the same time preserving context information. We also introduce a new focus for particle tracing, so called <b>anchor</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Anchor</b> <b>lines</b> are used to analyze local flow features by visualizing how much particles separate over time and how long it takes until they have separated to a fixed distance. It is of particular interest if the finite time Lyapunov exponent- a scalar quantity that measures the rate of separation of infinitesimally close particles in the flow- is used to guide the placement of <b>anchor</b> <b>lines.</b> The effectiveness of our approaches for the visualization of 3 D flow fields is validated using synthetic fields as well as real simulation data...|$|R

The far end of the line is usually marked with a brightly coloured buoy to show divers where it is and to help other boats avoid crossing the line. If there is any significant risk of a diver drifting away from the site, the dive boat should either be ready to slip the moorings at short notice, or have a tender in the water. Some skippers will tether the tender behind the dive boat where it can also be used as a drift line. A lazy shot or decompression trapeze may be suspended from the boat near the boarding area, and the drift line may be set up between this and the <b>anchor</b> <b>line</b> to guide decompressing divers ascending on the <b>anchor</b> <b>line</b> to the more convenient facility at the stern for the shallow stops.|$|E

In this thesis, the following aspects related to the quantitative and qualitative flow exploration are investigated. Firstly, a novel reconstruction method has been developed, which employs a physics-based filter operation to generate a velocity field {{that is consistent with}} the underlying flow model described by the Navier-Stokes equations. Interactive steering of the reconstruction process is achieved by exploiting programmable graphics hardware as a co-processor for numerical computations and the interactive visualization of 2 D flow fields. The quality of the proposed method has been estimated via the reconstruction of velocity fields from synthetic and real-world image sequences of laminar flow.

2500|$|Operation Biting, between 2728 February (also {{known as}} the Bruneval Raid), {{targeted}} a German coastal radar installation atop [...] cliffs. The raiding party itself was dropped by parachute at night and following the raid was taken back to England by sea. The naval force under Commander F. N. Cook, Royal Australian Navy, departed earlier, during {{the afternoon of the}} 27th, for the journey across the Channel. Motor Gun Boats (MGBs) towed LCAs across the Channel (LCA crews manned their craft during such tows) and carried detachments from No. 12 Commando who would provide fire support for the raiding party when they reached the evacuation beach. To accomplish this task each LCA had sandbags laid down its decks as parapets for Boys anti-tank rifles and Bren guns fitted with high volume drum magazines. When close to the coast the commandos climbed into the LCAs, the crews cast off, and the craft made for the beach under their own power. Meanwhile, on land, having accomplished their objectives the airborne raiders withdrew through a gully in the cliffs to the evacuation beach. By this time, it was 02:15, a sea mist prevented the naval force from seeing paratrooper's signals to evacuate them. The raiders fired off an emergency Very light seen by three LCA crews who soon approached accompanied by three MGBs. The original plan for the operation had called for two LCAs to land on the beach at a time, but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during the training manoeuvres. Instead, as the other three LCAs caught up, all six landed at the same time. One, LCA 125, dropped its kedge anchor just prior to beaching, but the <b>anchor</b> <b>line</b> played out and ran off the drum. Troops in the landing craft opened fire on German troops gathering by the top of the cliff. With all the craft beached at once, and enemy fire causing considerable confusion on the beach, some LCAs left over-crowded, whilst others left half-empty. The coxswain of LCA 125 was able to reverse his engines quickly and prevent the craft from being stranded. The entire raiding force was taken off the beach and soon transferred to MGBs for more comfortable transport back to England. Communications had failed; the naval force had received no signals apart from the Very light, and had spent much of the time hiding from a German naval patrol that had nearly discovered them. The journey back to Britain was uneventful, with the MGBs, LCAs in tow, being escorted by four destroyers and a flight of Spitfires. This raid with its dramatic embarkation from the base of a cliff occupied by enemy soldiers demonstrated the need for deck armour on LCA. Production of new craft soon incorporated 1/4inch armour for the decks over the hold and the stoker's position.|$|E
