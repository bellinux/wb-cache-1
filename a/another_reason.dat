5|$|All work {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, something in short supply at the time.|$|E
5|$|Surrounded by hills, Lam Tin {{does not}} have {{direct access to the}} Victoria Harbour. However, {{merchant}} ships and ferries dock at Kwun Tong Pier and Lei Yue Mun Pier, which are both within 15 minutes' walk from Lam Tin, and provide surface transport for Lam Tin residents. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> for Lam Tin's absence of an outlet to the Harbour is the presence of an Eastern Harbour Crossing entrance inside the district, whose buses and MTR overtook ferries for cross-harbour transport.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. Maude was voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven while regular voice actor Maggie Roswell had left the show over a pay dispute, but the producers decided to kill off the character to open up for new storylines. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> for her death was to increase ratings. The episode was viewed in 10.8million households during its original broadcast on February13,2000, and became the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|This {{hurricane}} was {{the only}} usage of the name Fico. The name Fico was removed after this storm and replaced with Fabio in the 1982 season. It is unknown whether it was retired due to its damage or for <b>another</b> <b>reason.</b> Other possible reasons listed {{for the removal of}} a name are pronunciation ambiguity, a socially unacceptable meaning in another language, or because the storm name represented a significant human disaster.|$|E
5|$|To reach {{all points}} {{designated}} by the Admiralty for longitude measurements, it was sometimes necessary to take chronometers ashore, across inlets and up rivers too shallow for the ship. This put the chronometers at risk and the disturbance of moving them affected their accuracy. This was <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> for survey ships to carry a large number – most {{of them could be}} kept permanently in a safe, well-cushioned place on the main vessel.|$|E

5|$|Weber {{abandoned}} {{research into}} Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch, a professional theologian, had begun {{work on the}} book The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area: {{laying the groundwork for}} a comparative analysis of religion and society.|$|E
5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> to doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
5000|$|Amy Gutmann and Dennis F. Thompson's {{definition}} {{captures the}} elements that are found in most conceptions of deliberative democracy. They define it as [...] "a form of government in which free and equal citizens and their representatives justify decisions in {{a process in which}} they give one <b>another</b> <b>reasons</b> that are mutually acceptable and generally accessible, with the aim of reaching decisions that are binding on all at present but open to challenge in the future".|$|R

50|$|In late October 2006 {{the offer}} of the Russian Atomstroyexport, the French Framatome (Areva), and the German Siemens using third-generation VVER-1000/V-446B {{reactors}} {{was approved by the}} National Electric Company. The offer was selected due to the highest safety level guaranteed by several new independent active and passive safety systems, as well as the option for Atomstroyexport to buy back the old unit supplied in the 1980s. <b>Another</b> <b>reasons</b> was the 60-year operation term. According to the Atomstroyexport president, the first unit would be in operation by 2013 and the second a year later.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to the entrance of Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige, the {{archbishop}} of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, {{and it appears that}} Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done. There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed {{the archbishop}} sufficient revenue to support himself.|$|E
5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass {{down through the}} entire magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|E

5000|$|Rawls {{held that}} the duty of civility - the duty of {{citizens}} to offer one <b>another</b> <b>reasons</b> that are mutually understood as reasons - applies within {{what he called the}} [...] "public political forum". This forum extends from the upper reaches of government - for example the supreme legislative and judicial bodies of the society - {{all the way down to}} the deliberations of a citizen deciding for whom to vote in state legislatures or how to vote in public referenda. Campaigning politicians should also, he believed, refrain from pandering to the non-public religious or moral convictions of their constituencies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{significant}} <b>reason</b> for {{the increased}} performance of the upgraded Tianhe-1A system is the Chinese-designed NUDT custom designed proprietary high-speed interconnect called Arch that runs at 160 Gbit/s, twice the bandwidth of InfiniBand.|$|R
5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
5|$|The Octopus {{system was}} {{launched}} {{after three years}} of trials on 1 September 1997. Three million cards were issued within {{the first three months of}} the system's launch. The quick success of the system was compelled by the fact that MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete, which drove commuters to switch quickly. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> was the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997. With the transfer of Hong Kong away from British rule, there was a belief that the older Queen's Head coins in Hong Kong would rise in value, so many people hoarded these older coins and waited for their value to increase.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
50|$|During {{the last}} 12-month period for which data is available, it was {{determined}} that 2,488 prisoners at Basile Detention Center were deported, released under supervision, or left ICE detention for <b>another</b> unstated <b>reason.</b>|$|R
50|$|The use of vanabins and {{vanadium}} for oxygen transport in ascidians and tunicates is doubtful. <b>Another</b> hypothesized <b>reason</b> {{for these}} organisms collecting vanadium {{is to make}} themselves toxic to predators, parasites and microorganisms.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> common <b>reason</b> for debadging is {{to rid the}} car of its {{commercial}} advertising. Drivers are not being paid to advertise the brand so some decide to remove this commercial aspect of the vehicle.|$|R
5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> for DNA {{testing was}} to {{determine}} the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear {{to be the result of}} pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> is the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the debt, <b>another</b> strong <b>reason</b> for D.B. Brinquedos declare bankruptcy and cease operations began in 1994, when imported toys sold by street vendors began to strongly compete with the retail toy industry.|$|R
5000|$|Augustine of Hippo once {{described}} a cockfight in spiritual terms: [...] "in every motion {{of these animals}} unendowed with reason there was nothing ungraceful since, of course, <b>another</b> higher <b>reason</b> was guiding everything they did".|$|R
50|$|Pakistan's {{automotive}} sector has not experienced significant {{growth and the}} small car segment remains totally monopolized by PakSuzuki. Due {{to the lack of}} competition in the country, Paksuzuki is selling obsolete vehicles without any safety features or upgrades in Pakistan. Government policies have consistently favored Paksuzuki, Toyota, and Honda due to which further investment has been blocked in the country. Used car imports are also <b>another</b> <b>reasons</b> why new assemblers are unwilling to invest. When Nexus Automotive was operating Gandhara Nissan (Nissan), Deewan Mushtaq (Hyundai and Kia), and Adam Motors had assembling operations in Pakistan; however, now all three have stopped assembly of passenger vehicles in the country.|$|R
