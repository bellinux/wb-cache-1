25|$|Racial {{tensions}} in Cleveland were exacerbated {{as the city}} began busing <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>children</b> to all-white schools in order to racially desegregate its schools and to reduce overcrowding in minority-majority elementary schools. Black parents were outraged when they discovered that their children were not eligible to participate in arts, sports, and after-hours activities at these schools. In January 1964, the United Freedom Movement, a coalition of black civil rights groups, decided to march on the Murray Hill School in the city's Little Italy neighborhood. When city leaders learned that local white residents intended to stop the march, they feared a riot would break out. The black civil rights groups were persuaded to cancel their protest. But the white mob still formed, and throughout the day on January 30, 1964, white citizens threw rocks and bottles and assaulted any African American person they found on the streets.

25|$|In 1960, Johnson began {{conducting}} research on reducing prejudice and {{became involved in the}} national civil rights movement. He was awarded the Russell Bull Scholarship Award (given by the United Packinghouse, Food, and Allied Workers) for the most outstanding work done in civil rights in the United States in 1962 (Martin Luther King, Jr., chaired the selection committee). During the summer of 1963, he led a day camp for children in the Bedford–Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, New York, and a youth center for the Brooklyn Bishops (a street gang). In 1964, he helped plan and conduct the training program for the Mississippi Freedom Summer sponsored by the Mississippi Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). From 1963 to 1965, Johnson taught African American history at Freedom Schools in New York City, sponsored by the Harlem Parents Committee, and conducted two studies on the impact of learning Black history on <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>children.</b> At the same time, he worked with the Northern Student Movement, among other things organizing rent strikes in Harlem. He trained group leaders in the use of guided group interaction for juvenile delinquents in the Essex Fields Program in New Jersey. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Johnson worked with teenage runaways and teenagers with drug problems (through The Bridge and the Walk In Counseling Center in Minneapolis). He has been active in politics, serving as Treasurer for the 2nd Ward in Minneapolis in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and ran for the Minnesota State Legislature twice in the 1990s. Finally, his correspondence with Martin Luther King is being included in the Martin Luther King Library.|$|E

It was once {{considered}} one of Chicago's finest luxury hotels, and a dozen 20th-century U.S. presidents have stayed at the hotel. In addition, the Blackstone has also become part of Chicago's history as the city that has hosted more United States presidential nominating conventions (26) than any other two American cities, a history which {{goes back to the}} 1860 Republican National Convention hosted at the Wigwam. The hotel has a special room designed for use by presidents which was separated {{from the rest of the}} hotel by hollowed out walls in which the Secret Service could operate. In 1911, Republican businessman and philanthropist Julius Rosenwald—then president of Sears, Roebuck & Company—invited African American educator Booker T. Washington and a few dozen of Chicago's leading citizens to discuss raising funds for Washington's Tuskegee Institute. [...] Washington became the hotel's first African American guest. [...] As a result of the meeting, Rosenwald became a supporter and trustee of Tuskegee, and the following year initiated a campaign to fund the construction and support of schools throughout the South to provide an education to black children, by the time of his death building nearly 5000 schools educating well over half a million <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E

500|$|After {{attending}} USC School of Cinematic Arts {{and working}} at a youth center in South Los Angeles, Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who {{do well in school}} are said to be [...] "acting white". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that [...] "Spelling Bee is for someone else". She [...] "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy," [...] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it [...] "empowers her to ... accomplish this task." [...] Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, [...] "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people who look like her doing". The director affirmed that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>children</b> in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated [...] "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing in their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics [...] "but particularly for kids of color to see a little black girl who does something powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|The last {{vestiges of}} the Stanley plan were swept aside by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964. The case {{involved}} the Prince Edward County public school system. [...] Prince Edward County {{was one of the}} Southside counties. In 1951, the NAACP filed suit on behalf of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>children</b> in Prince Edward County demanding racial integration of the public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court consolidated the case, Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, with Brown v. Board of Education, and as part of its ruling in Brown ordered that the Prince Edward County public schools integrate. [...] By 1959, a second lawsuit was working its way through the federal court system in Virginia, and this suit seemed likely to force the county's schools to integrate in time for the 1959-1960 school term. [...] On June 3, 1959, Prince Edward County officials voted to defund and close their public school system. It became the first school system in the nation to close rather than integrate. White parents subsequently contributed funds to establish an all-white private school, the Prince Edward County Free School. Poor African American parents were unable (and unwilling) to establish a similar school, and sued to have the public schools reopened. [...] On January 6, 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court finally agreed to hear their case. The United States Department of Justice, citing the [...] "extraordinary history" [...] of the Prince Edward County case, intervened to support the black parents. On May 25, 1964, the U.S. Supreme unanimously held in Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, that Prince Edward County's school closure violated the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and ordered the public schools reopened immediately. The high court also struck down the tuition grants program, concluding that providing the grants while schools were closed violated the 14th Amendment. On June 1, the Supreme Court agreed to send its order to the district court in Richmond immediately, rather than through normal procedures (which would have delayed action by three weeks). On June 2, the federal district court in Richmond ordered the schools opened. Prince Edward County officials refused to obey the court's orders, and on June 17 the district court threatened to have county officials imprisoned. Prince Edward County officials bowed to the court's authority, and agreed to reopen the county's public schools on June 23, 1964.|$|E
500|$|African Americans pioneered rural {{settlements}} in the state throughout {{the first half of}} the nineteenth-century. Although Indiana entered the Union in 1816 as a free state it gave only a tepid welcome to African Americans and frequently sought to exclude and/or marginalize African Americans from public and social life. African Americans faced discrimination on a variety of fronts. Blacks were denied the right to testify in court in 1818. In 1829 the Indiana Colonization Society was founded to help repatriate African Americans to Liberia which reflected a desire to rid the state of its black residents. [...] The 1830 census recorded three slaves in the state. The earliest days of the territory and of statehood witnessed intense debates over whether to allow slavery in Indiana. Laws in the 1830s sought to prevent free blacks from entering the state without certificates of freedom under threat of fines and expulsion. [...] While the 1830 law was only sporadically enforced it reflected hostility towards African Americans and their settlement in the state. Throughout the early nineteenth century, Black Hoosiers struggled to enjoy basic civil rights in the state, including the right to educate their children. In 1837 and 1841 the state shifted towards formally excluding African Americans from public education. In 1837 the state legislature moved to recognize [...] "The white inhabitants of each congressional district" [...] as the citizens qualified to vote in school board elections. Four years later, they followed with an effort to preclude black households from school board assessments. This helped to establish Hoosier schools as de facto white. Efforts in 1842 to formally exclude <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>children</b> from public education were rebuffed, however. The State Committee on Education responded to the matter acknowledging that they [...] "...Are here, unfortunately, for us and them, and we have duties to perform in reference to their well-being." [...] Indiana also passed laws against interracial marriage in 1818 and 1821. Under 1840 state laws to ban miscegenation Indiana became the first state to make interracial marriage a felony. [...] Article XIII of the Indiana Constitution of 1851 sought to exclude African Americans from settling in the state, declaring [...] "No negro or mulatto shall come into or settle in the State." [...] This was the only provision of the new constitution submitted to a special election. Indiana constitutional convention delegates voted 93 to 40 in favor of the article. The popular vote was even more enthusiastic in its support for exclusion with a vote of 113,828 in favor and only 21,873 against excluding African Americans. [...] Throughout {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, Indiana attempted to keep Black Hoosiers from attending public school, voting, testifying in court, and endeavored to set other limits on African American citizenship and inclusion. Racial hostility and discrimination co-existed alongside abolition sentiments and efforts, however. The Underground Railroad in Indiana sought to help runaway slaves escape to northern states and Canada. White Quakers, Baptists, and others worked to secure safe passage for runaway slaves. Abolition efforts conflicted with a growing antipathy towards free blacks in the state.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the role of the musical culture of an <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>child</b> with {{developmental}} disabilities in group music therapy. Qualitative methods were employed in an early childhood education setting. First, interview questions were sent home to parents and guardians of participants regarding music in the home, and music examples were analyzed based on the genres reported in the interview answers. Then, one session of four male participants with developmental disabilities, ages 4 - 5, was conducted and analyzed. The participants were of <b>African</b> <b>American,</b> Hispanic, Pakistani, and Caucasian ethnicities. The researcher focused on the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>child,</b> utilizing clinical data and an examination of the musical sources that represent the child’s musical culture in the home. The results indicated that the musical culture of the child played a significant role in the group music therapy process. The musical culture of the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>child</b> in the study was found to be characterized by three main elements: emphasis on a strong rhythmic pulse, emphasis on movement, and singing or chanting as a means of expression. The child seemed to be less engaged when the music was syncopated, lacked a strong rhythmic pulse, was interspersed with verbal injections, or contained Spanish lyrics. Although some conclusions have been drawn to indicate the significance of musical culture in a group music therapy setting with children, there is a great need for further research in order to determine more precise ways in which musical culture influences the group music therapy process. Thus, this study serves as a catalyst for future music therapy research. </span...|$|R
