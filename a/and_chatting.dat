5|$|The next morning, {{having won}} the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager {{to return to the}} offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being {{prepared}} for the men, their first meal in 48 hours. He {{was standing in the doorway}} of the platoon headquarters, having a mug of tea <b>and</b> <b>chatting</b> with friends, when a stray German mortar bomb landed at his feet, killing him outright.

5|$|At {{the scene}} of Marks' game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, Eric Matthews, and calls him in. Despite {{not wanting to be}} {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; arsonist Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting <b>and</b> <b>chatting</b> with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.|$|E

They seem to be sharing some all-absorbing joke. Holmes, proudly wearing his Yorkshire cap, walks with quick, short steps, shoulders erect and head in the air, {{doing his best to}} look as tall as (John) Tunnicliffe. Sutcliffe has dark, glossy hair and usually disdains the valued White Rose cap when batting. He strolls casually along by the side of Percy, keeping his weather eye open for the wicket-keeper's end and the honour of taking the first ball.|$|E
25|$|In ancient China, {{women were}} under-appreciated. This opinion was {{deeply rooted in}} the mind of Lanying’s family. Compared with her little sisters, she was quite lucky because she was the first baby. All of her sisters were sent to be child brides or killed. She was often mistreated and was not allowed to get an education. Before she was 6 years old, Lanying was {{required}} to wash all the clothes and cook for whole family. At age of six, she wanted to go to school because she wanted to escape the traditional pattern for women at her time, which was doing housework <b>and</b> <b>chatting</b> with other women all day. The only way to do was to get an education. However, her mother, who was deeply influenced by gender schema from society and controlled her life, did not allow that. So Lanying locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat if she was not allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, so she finally got the chance to get an education.|$|E
25|$|King George's daughter, Elizabeth, aceeded to {{the throne}} in 1952. Squamish Nation Chief Joe Mathias was amongst the Canadian dignitaries who were invited to attend the her {{coronation}} in London the following year. In 1959, the Queen toured Canada and, in Labrador, she was greeted by the Chief of the Montagnais and given a pair of beaded moose-hide jackets; at Gaspé, Quebec, she and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, were presented with deerskin coats by two local Aboriginal people; and, in Ottawa, {{a man from the}} Kahnawake Mohawk Territory passed to officials a 200-year-old wampum as a gift for Elizabeth. It was during that journey that the Queen became the first member of the Royal Family to meet with Inuit representatives, doing so in Stratford, Ontario, and the royal train stopped in Brantford, Ontario, so that the Queen could sign the Six Nations Queen Anne Bible in the presence of Six Nations leaders. Across the prairies, First Nations were present on the welcoming platforms in numerous cities and towns, and at the Calgary Stampede, more than 300 Blackfoot, Tsuu T'ina, and Nakoda performed a war dance and erected approximately 30 teepees, amongst which the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh walked, meeting with various chiefs. In Nanaimo, British Columbia, a longer meeting took place between Elizabeth and the Salish, wherein the latter conferred on the former the title of Mother of all People and, following a dance of welcome, the Queen and her consort spent 45 minutes (20 more than allotted) touring a replica First Nations village <b>and</b> <b>chatting</b> with some 200 people.|$|E

500|$|She {{had just}} taken on a steady job working for Marianne Faithfull and John Dunbar as the nanny to their little boy Nicholas, and it was while taking care of Nicholas in Marianne’s third floor Chelsea flat that she first {{encountered}} Paul McCartney. He buzzed the intercom to ask if John (Dunbar) was around, and when Paul explained who he was, Maggie invited him straight up. “Paul ran {{up the stairs and}} came in. Very casually I told him that John wasn’t really in and that sent us both into hysterics. We were laughing <b>and</b> <b>chatting.</b> I made a nice lunch for Marianne and a bunch of her friends but they never showed up. Paul and I sat together and ate it instead. I’ll never forget the meal – it was chicken casserole. It was such a funny introduction that it threw us both off guard.

500|$|In March 1955, Johnson led Australia's first Test {{tour of the}} West Indies. The Australian Board of Control was {{concerned}} about the team's relations with the West Indian public. Against a background of rising anti-colonial feeling and resentment, England's tour of the West Indies the year before had been marred by riots and violent disturbances. With the White Australia policy in place at the time, the Australians feared an unpleasant reception from the Caribbean public. [...] However, the Australian team proved very popular throughout the West Indies; Wisden reported that [...] "much credit belonged to the tact displayed by Ian Johnson, who proved a most able captain". Johnson cultivated a relaxed manner with the locals; in one instance at Sabina Park in Jamaica, he stopped to pick up a toddler who had run onto the playing field during the change of innings. Smiling <b>and</b> <b>chatting</b> to the boy, he then carried him safely off the ground. [...] Team mate Alan Davidson claimed, [...] "Ian did the best PR job of any captain I've ever seen".|$|E
