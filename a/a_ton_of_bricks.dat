60|$|You've {{probably}} noticed about London, mister, that a {{flock of}} sheep isn't in it with the nuts, the way they all troop on each other's heels to supper-places.

The trouble {{with most of the}} places is that once they've got the custom they think it's going to keep on coming and all they've got to do is to lean back and watch it come.
