40|$|Lightning surge {{protection}} This paper proposes an industrial solution (equipment) for lightning and {{surge protection}} of distribution transformers. The proposed protection equipment has been installed at 100 distribution transformers detected by {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) and k-nearest neigh-bors [6]. A transformer fault diagnosis system is developed in [7], {{which is based on}} dissolved gases analysis by extracting fuzzy rules from Kohonen self-organizing maps. An ANN is used to <b>ations</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tages [1, 12 e to the di tion transformer [1]. Both lightning and switching surge v are large magnitude traveling waves, which travel at the sp light. The distribution transformer is designed and manufactured with a user-specified basic impulse level (BIL) rating. The BIL rating determines the level of lightning and switching surge voltages that the transformer can withstand without damage [1]. The protection of distribution transformers from the low volt-age side is an important subject that has triggered the interest of the electric utilities, the manufacturers of protection systems...|$|R
