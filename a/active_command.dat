George Carleton, on 26 January 1818. Rear-Admiral James Macnamara died at Clifton, Bristol, on 15 January 1826 {{at the age of}} 57.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the {{division}} remained as an <b>active</b> <b>command</b> in the National Guard, gradually expanding its command to contain units from other divisions which had been consolidated. However, {{the division}} was never called up to support any major contengencies or see major combat, and was eventually deactivated in 1993, reorganized as a brigade under the 29th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, no serving British {{officer of}} the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had {{controlled}} a formation larger than a division on active operations. The first Commander in Chief of the BEF appointed in August 1914 was Field Marshal John French. His last <b>active</b> <b>command</b> had been the cavalry division in the Second Boer War.|$|E

5000|$|... 1994 saw the {{restructuring}} of the Reserve Program {{with the advent of}} the [...] "Team Coast Guard" [...] concept. This led to the disestablishment of most Reserve Units and the assignment of the Reservists to <b>active</b> duty <b>commands.</b> As a result, reservists work very closely with their active duty counterparts, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, and Coast Guard civilians as they augment the resources of <b>active</b> duty <b>commands.</b> PSUs are the only remaining reserve units, as all other reservists are assigned to <b>active</b> duty <b>commands.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2007, she {{remained}} <b>active,</b> <b>commanded</b> by Commander Augustus P. Bennet, assigned to Destroyer Squadron 14, and homeported at NAVSTA Mayport, Florida. In August 2008, while underway to avoid Tropical Storm Fay, the scheduled change of command occurred with Commander Derek Lavan assuming {{command of the}} vessel.|$|R
5|$|After the United States {{declaration}} of war upon Japan in December 1941, Eichelberger applied for a transfer to an <b>active</b> <b>command.</b> He was given the choice of three new divisions, and chose the 77th Infantry Division, which was activated at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in March 1942. The other two divisions were given to Major Generals Omar Bradley and Henry Terrell, Jr. The three generals and their staffs attended a training course at Fort Leavenworth. For his chief of staff, Eichelberger chose Clovis Byers, an officer who had also attended Ohio State and West Point, and had been a fellow member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.|$|E
5|$|Vasey slowly recovered. In October 1944, Blamey {{set up a}} Post-War Army Planning Committee {{headed by}} Vasey {{to report on the}} future of the Royal Military College and the {{training}} and education of Staff Corps officers. Vasey called for a greatly expanded regular army of 20,000 men. His report recommended that the course at Duntroon be deepened professionally and academically to the level of an undergraduate university degree. The report's recommendations were not accepted or welcomed by the government but pointed the way to the future, in which the Army would become increasingly professional. In February 1945, Frank Forde pressed for Vasey to be given another <b>active</b> <b>command.</b> Blamey, who still had doubts about Vasey's physical fitness despite Vasey being given an A by an Army medical board, reluctantly appointed him to command the 6th Division, then in action in the Aitape-Wewak campaign.|$|E
5|$|Administrative Headquarters, AIF, {{and against}} the {{opposition}} of Birdwood, Senator Pearce appointed McCay as commander of the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom. These depots received and trained reinforcements arriving from Australia, and rehabilitated and retrained convalescents who were released from hospital. McCay established his headquarters at Tidworth, {{in the heart of}} the Salisbury Plain where most of the Australian camps were located. He occupied this post for the remainder of the war, failing in bids to return to an <b>active</b> <b>command</b> at the head of the 5th Division, the Australian Corps, or the 3rd Division when Monash was promoted to corps commander. A bid to replace Birdwood as administrative commander of the AIF also came to naught. For his services in the United Kingdom, McCay was mentioned in despatches a fourth time, made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919.|$|E

50|$|The Serbian officers’ {{complaints}} of the Russian command and of armaments, {{and of the}} lack in professionally trained active NCOs and <b>active</b> <b>commanding</b> officers, resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of cadets in schools, in establishing a wider peace keeping formation. Following an imposed war on Bulgaria in 1885, King Milan became the military commander in chief and initiated the most important reform which set foundations for future liberation wars in the period 1912-1918.|$|R
5|$|Although {{pleased with}} {{the result of the}} engagement, Lord Keith issued strict {{instructions}} that Nelson was to remain in <b>active</b> <b>command</b> of the blockade and on no account to return to Palermo. If {{he had to go to}} port in Sicily, then he was to use Syracuse instead. Keith then sailed to Livorno, where his flagship was destroyed in a sudden fire that killed over 700 of the crew, although Keith himself was not on board at the time. By early March, Nelson had tired of the blockade and in defiance of Keith's instructions returned to Palermo again, leaving Captain Thomas Troubridge of HMS Culloden in command of the blockade squadron. In March, while Nelson was absent at Palermo, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell, the last survivor of the Nile, attempted to break out of Malta but was chased down and defeated by a British squadron led by Berry in Foudroyant. Although Nelson briefly returned in April, both of the Hamiltons were aboard his ship and most of his time was spent at Marsa Sirocco in the company of Emma, with whom he was now romantically attached.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the British I Corps in 1914 was Douglas Haig. French had remarked in 1912 that Haig would be better suited to {{a position on the}} staff than a field command. Like French, Haig was a cavalryman. His last <b>active</b> <b>command</b> had been during the Second Boer War, first as a senior staff officer in the cavalry division, then commanding a brigade-sized group of columns. The first {{commander of}} the British II Corps was Lieutenant General James Grierson, a noted tactician who {{died of a heart attack}} soon after arriving in France. French wished to appoint Lieutenant General Herbert Plumer in his place, but against French's wishes, Kitchener instead appointed Lieutenant General Horace Smith-Dorrien, who had begun his military career in the Zulu War in 1879 and was one of only five officers to survive the battle of Isandlwana. He had built a formidable reputation as an infantry commander during the Sudan Campaign and the Second Boer War. After the Second Boer War, he was responsible for a number of reforms, notably forcing an increase in dismounted training for the cavalry. This was met with hostility by French (as a cavalryman). By 1914, French's dislike for Smith-Dorrien was well known within the army.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{return to}} <b>active</b> <b>command,</b> {{he found the}} army had lost most of its officer corps and {{experienced}} troops, and in 1793, following a series of reversals in the spring, the French lost control {{of much of the}} territory they had acquired the year before. Ordered to take command of the Army of the North, Custine sought first to solidify French control of the important crossings of the Rhine by Mainz. However, when he failed to relieve the besieged fortress of Condé the following year, he was recalled to Paris. After Condé, Mainz and Speyer had all been lost, he was arrested. He was prosecuted in a lengthy trial before the Committee on Public Safety's Revolutionary Tribunal by Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville, and Jacques Hébert continued to attack Custine through his publication Le Père Duchesne. Custine was found guilty of treason by a majority vote of the Tribunal on 27 August, and guillotined the following day.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Later career=== In 1855 Pullen {{was placed}} in command of HMS Falcon {{as a part of}} {{operations}} of the Crimean War against Russia forces in the Baltic Sea, and was promoted to Captain the next year. His subsequent <b>active</b> <b>commands</b> mostly involved him in surveying: the Red Sea and Ceylon with HMS Cyclops, and Bermuda with HMS Terror. After several years in Coast Guard posts, he {{was placed in}} the retired list in 1870, and in retirement was promoted, first to Rear Admiral, then to Vice Admiral. He received a Greenwich pension in 1886, and died the next year at Torquay.|$|R
50|$|In the War of 1812, Tucker {{returned}} to <b>active</b> service, <b>commanding</b> a schooner which protected {{the coast of}} Maine from British privateers. In 1813, he captured the British privateer Crown in a short, sharp engagement.|$|R
5|$|Peng {{was one of}} {{the most}} senior generals who defended the Jiangxi Soviet from Chiang's {{attempts}} to capture it, and his successes were rivaled only by Lin Biao. Peng participated in the Long March, and supported Mao Zedong at the Zunyi Conference, which was critical to Mao's rise to power. During the 1937–1945 Second Sino-Japanese War, Peng {{was one of the}} strongest supporters of pursuing a ceasefire with the Kuomintang in order to concentrate China's collective resources on resisting the Japanese Empire. Peng was the senior commander in the combined Kuomintang-Communist efforts to resist the Japanese occupation of Shanxi in 1937; and, by 1938, was in command of 2/3 of the Eighth Route Army. In 1940, Peng conducted the Hundred Regiments Offensive, a massive Communist effort to disrupt Japanese logistical networks across northern China. The Hundred Regiments Offensive was modestly successful, but political disputes within the Communist Party led to Peng being recalled to Yan'an, and he spent the rest of the war without an <b>active</b> <b>command.</b> After the Japanese surrendered, in 1945, Peng was given command of Communist forces in Northwest China. He was the most senior commander responsible for defending the Communist leadership in Shaanxi from Kuomintang forces, saving Mao from being captured at least once. Peng eventually defeated the Kuomintang in Northwest China, captured huge amounts of military supplies, and actively incorporated the huge area, including Xinjiang, into the People's Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|Smith-Dorrien {{then left}} <b>active</b> <b>command</b> {{to go to}} the Staff College, Camberley (1887–9). Staff College was not yet much respected, and he later {{recorded}} that he devoted much time to sport whilst there.|$|E
25|$|Returning to the United States, he was shuffled {{from one}} fort to another each further westward {{until he reached}} the Presidio of San Francisco in later part of 1903. His {{repeated}} efforts for an <b>active</b> <b>command</b> fell on deaf ears.|$|E
50|$|Lieutenant James Askey <b>commanded</b> <b>Active</b> in 1810. On 11 January 1809, <b>Active,</b> {{under the}} <b>command</b> of Mr. John Middleton, {{captured}} the French privateer St. Jago et Erfurt.

This may have occurred while she was participating in the debacle that was the Walcheren Campaign.|$|R
50|$|The {{department}} was merged into the Department of the Susquehanna on April 6, 1864, forming a new Department of Pennsylvania. General Brooks returned to <b>active</b> field <b>command,</b> leading a {{division in the}} XVIII Corps in the Army of the James.|$|R
5|$|In France {{the battle}} was {{represented}} as a victory, largely based on a report sent to Paris by Dumanoir le Pelley {{on the strength of}} a letter written by Captain Troude, which claimed that he had fought not only Venerable and Thames, but also Caesar and Spencer (misidentified in the report as Superb). Troude claimed that he had not only driven all of these ships off and completely destroyed Venerable by driving the ship ashore by 07:00, but that he had then waited nearby until 10:00 in the hope of resuming the action. In reward for his services as represented, Troude was promoted and highly praised, later holding a number of important <b>active</b> <b>commands</b> in the French Navy.|$|R
25|$|Roberts was {{approached}} for advice about the Ulster Voluntary Force, formed in January 1913 by Ulstermen {{who had no}} wish {{to be part of a}} Home Rule Ireland. Too old himself to take <b>active</b> <b>command,</b> Roberts recommended Lieutenant General Sir George Richardson, formerly of the Indian Army, as commander.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Jellicoe was criticised for his {{caution and}} for {{allowing}} Scheer to escape. Beatty, in particular, {{was convinced that}} Jellicoe had missed a tremendous opportunity to annihilate the High Seas Fleet and win what would amount to another Trafalgar. Jellicoe was promoted away from <b>active</b> <b>command</b> to become First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy, while Beatty replaced him as commander of the Grand Fleet.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 {{when war}} broke out in Europe, he redoubled his effort to join the {{diplomatic}} corps and when that failed, he offered to serve in any capacity. As America was dragged into World War I, Bigelow was recalled to active duty as a lieutenant colonel. Again he was denied an <b>active</b> <b>command</b> and served at Rutgers and in the War Department's Historical Branch until his release in the later part of 1919.|$|E

25|$|At the Battle of Marengo on 14 June, Ott {{commanded}} the Austrian left wing. Because of congestion in the bridgehead, {{it took a}} long time for the left wing to deploy. However, once his attack at mid-day got underway, it broke the French right flank and helped convince them to retreat from Marengo. Later in the battle, when French reinforcements defeated the Austrian main body, Ott withdrew in good order and brought his command off in safety. This was his last <b>active</b> <b>command.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 1895, he was {{inspector-general}} of the cavalry, a post he {{held for}} 10 years. His tenure has been judged a success with reforms in training, cavalry schools, cavalry reserves and the remount services. He {{was not given}} an <b>active</b> <b>command</b> during the Russo-Japanese War, perhaps because the Tsar {{did not wish to}} hazard the prestige of the Romanovs and because he wanted a loyal general in command at home in case of domestic disturbances. Thus, Nicholas did not have the opportunity to gain experience in battlefield command.|$|E
25|$|Baden-Powell {{was further}} sidelined from <b>active</b> <b>command</b> {{and given the}} role of organising the South African Constabulary, a colonial police force. He {{returned}} to England {{to take up a}} post as Inspector General of Cavalry in 1903. While holding this position, Baden-Powell was instrumental in reforming reconnaissance training in British cavalry, giving the force an important advantage in scouting ability over continental rivals. In 1907 he was promoted to Lt. General but left on the inactive list. Eventually he was appointed to the lowly command of the Northumbrian Division of the newly formed Territorial Force.|$|E
