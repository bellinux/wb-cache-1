2500|$|Ngezi Forest Reserve covers {{an area of}} [...] {{and is in the}} {{north-western}} tip of Pemba Island. It {{was declared}} a reserve in 1950 after most of the area had been denuded for cultivation of cloves. It still has high closed forests known as Ngezi forest extending right up to the beach at Vumawimbi. The forest types reported consist of coral bushes and thickets, thick grasses and bushes in the sandy-loam soils and Mtifutifu soils; dominant plant species are: Odyendea zimmermanni (Mjoho), riverine forest of Barringtonia racemosa (Mtomondo), Milicia spp (Mvule), Alexandrian laurel (Mtondoo), Erythropholem spp (Mwavi), Antiarus spp (Mgulele), Chrisalidocarpus pembanus (Mpapindi) and Terminalia catapa (Mkungu), and mangrove forests. Avifauna recorded consists of 27 bird species in the forests, out of which the endemic species are hadada, the <b>African</b> <b>goshawk,</b> the palm-nut vulture, scops owl, the malachite kingfisher and the Pemba white-eye. Other faunal species consist of Pemba flying fox (large fruit-eating bat), the Pemba vervet monkey, the Zanzibar red colobus monkey, hyrax, Pemba blue duiker (an antelope {{about the size of a}} hare), feral pigs (introduced by the Portuguese), the Javan civet cat (introduced by southeast Asian traders for the production of musk) and marsh mongoose (an endemic carnivore).|$|E
2500|$|Black sparrowhawks prey {{primarily}} on mid-sized birds. Most prey is spotted from a foliage-concealed perch {{and then is}} killed in flight while on a short flying dash. Less often, they stoop or chase prey seen during low or high flight over open country or near the canopy of trees and, in some cases, may even pursue prey on foot. Although kills are often made in under a minute after the initial attack, occasionally this species may engage in a prolonged pursuit over several minutes. They {{have been known to}} scan for antswarms so they can predate birds attracted to them. Most birds preyed on by this species are in the size range of [...] However, they have taken guineafowl weighing up to [...] Doves are the primary prey of males, whereas females take a greater quantity of larger prey such as pigeons and francolins. They also feed on poultry found in rural villages, which have been inadvertently made available to them by humans. They also often take species such as rock pigeons that have flourished due to urban growth and settlement. It is, in fact, one of the species that have been able to adapt to a changing habitat due to afforestation and urbanization by taking advantage of the increase in dove and pigeon populations. [...] With some regularity, they prey on other raptor species, including shikra, Ovambo sparrowhawk, <b>African</b> <b>goshawk</b> and wood owl. [...] Very occasionally, they may supplement their diet with small mammals, such as bats, rodents and juvenile mongooses. Black sparrowhawks can carry their plucked, and decapitated prey up to , usually well above the canopy.|$|E

40|$|Winter radio-tracking {{of three}} <b>African</b> <b>goshawks</b> Accipiter tachiro showed that they each {{occupied}} well-wooded home ranges {{of at least}} 28 hectares. They perched and roosted mainly within densely foliaged trees and an adult female changed perches on &# 13; average 4, 7 times per hour. No crepuscular predation of bats was recorded, in contrast to regular summer predation on colonies of little free-tailed bats, Tadarida pumila, but winter emergence rates of these bats at dusk had dropped to < 5 of the previous summer. We predict that many accipiters will be regular predators of bats and that skewed sex ratios and high fecundity may be two means by which bats counter this predation...|$|R

50|$|The two {{subspecies}} {{groups may}} be considered separate species, {{in which case the}} western one is called Accipiter macroscelides, the West <b>African</b> <b>goshawk.</b> More commonly, though, the present species is lumped with the <b>African</b> <b>goshawk</b> because the groups intergrade and vary widely within themselves and separated populations resemble each other. The red-chested goshawk is treated here as a separate species following the Handbook of the Birds of the World and other authorities.|$|E
50|$|The red-chested goshawk (Accipiter toussenelii) is {{a medium}} size hawk of West Africa. It is often {{considered}} conspecific with the <b>African</b> <b>goshawk.</b>|$|E

50|$|Closely {{related to}} the <b>African</b> <b>goshawk</b> Accipiter tachiro and the red-chested goshawk Accipiter toussenelii, albeit smaller than either of those species. It is {{normally}} regarded as monotypic, although some authorities recognise the smaller birds in the Congo Basin as the subspecies Accipiter castanilius beniensis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>goshawk</b> {{generally}} {{occurs in}} forest and diverse dense woodland in both lowland and montane areas, {{but it can}} also be found in riverine and gallery forest, plantations of exotic trees, parks and large gardens. It can occur in both moist and dry forest, even in isolated patches.|$|E
50|$|They are preyed {{on by the}} <b>African</b> <b>goshawk,</b> {{and their}} nest {{contents}} fall prey to the grey-headed bushshrike. They may be killed by ants or come under attack by territorial boubou shrikes. They are parasitised by the black cuckoo and emerald cuckoo, besides perhaps klaas's cuckoo and the red-chested cuckoo.|$|E
50|$|This species' main {{foods are}} frogs and {{freshwater}} crabs. It takes more large insects than the <b>African</b> <b>goshawk,</b> and also eats lizards, earthworms, and small mammals and birds. It hunts throughout the day, including dawn and dusk. Among its methods is waiting {{hidden in the}} forest canopy, often near an open space such as a trail or a body of water. It also flies quickly {{from tree to tree}} looking for prey that it can swoop down on or snatch, and flies beside lines of dense vegetation to surprise prey by flying through.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>African</b> <b>goshawk</b> is {{typically}} soars above the canopy {{in the morning}} in a display flight involving slow wing beats interspersed with gliding, sometimes so high up that the only sign of the birds is its regular clicking call. [...] Its main prey is birds up to the size of hornbills or francolins, it also feeds on mammals and lizards. It is an ambush hunter, waiting on a perch until the prey is observed then swooping down to catch it. Pairs occasionally hunt co-operatively at large congregations of prey, such as bat roosts or weaver colonies. Invertebrates are also sometimes recorded as prey.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} season begins in July or August and ends in February. Unlike the <b>African</b> <b>goshawk,</b> this species {{is said to}} perform flight displays only rarely. The nest is placed 6 to 20 meters above {{the ground in the}} main fork or on a side branch of a large tree, hidden by leaves or vines. It is built of sticks, 40 to cm across and 15 to 45 cm deep, with a lining of fresh leaves. The female lays 2 or 3 eggs (less often 1 or 4). As in most Accipitridae, the female incubates and cares for the young while the male supplies the food, with the female doing some of the hunting after the young are half-grown. Incubation lasts some 4 or 5 weeks, and the young fledge in 32 to 36 days. Juveniles probably molt directly into adult plumage when a little over one year old.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>goshawk</b> is {{a medium}} sized to large Accipiter which is mainly grey and rufous with the typical broad winged and long tailed shape of its genus. The adult has grey upperparts {{which tend to}} be darker in males than in females, the underparts are whitish marked with rufous barring which is more rufous and heavier in the males. The underwing is pale rufous fading to white on some birds and the flight {{feathers}} and tail vary from sooty brown to grey with faint grey bars above, white with grey bars below. The bill is black, the cere is greenish-grey, the eyes are yellow and the legs and feet are yellow. Juveniles are brown above and boldly blotched with brown and with brown flank bars too. Females weigh 270 - 510 g, while smaller males weigh 150 - 340 g. They wingspan is 172 - 225 mm for males and 211 - 275 mm in females, the wingspan is 1.7 times the bird's total length.|$|E

50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>goshawk</b> is {{territorial}} and {{the typical}} courtship display is performed by both sexes where they fly {{together in an}} undulated flight while calling loudly, sometimes finishing with a steep dive. The females builds the nest making a platform of sticks lined with fresh foliage, as well as pine needles, lichen and mistletoe. It is normally built on a branch away from the main trunk of a tree, as they prefer to nest within dense foliage bit the nest may may also be constructed {{on top of an}} old Hadeda ibis nest, They have also been recorded taking over the nest of a little sparrowhawk Accipiter minullus instead of building their own. The 1-3 eggs are laid in July-December, with a peak in September-November and are incubated mainly or solely by the female for about 35-37 days, while the male regularly brings food to her. The chicks are fed by both parents, fledging at about 30-35 days old but staying within the vicinity of the nest tree for another six weeks or so before becoming fully independent roughly 1-3 months after leaving the nest.|$|E

50|$|Outside of the Bubo genus, other owls in Africa {{are much}} smaller than Verreaux's eagle-owls {{and are more likely}} to be viewed as prey than competition. Among the small-to-mid-sized owls that have fallen prey to this species {{including}} the barn owl (Tyto alba) and the African grass owl (Tyto capensis), both of which average around 419 g in body mass in Africa, the 334 g marsh owl (Asio capensis) and the 216 g southern white-faced owl (Ptilopsis granti). The only verified interactions with other typical eagle-owls have been predatory, as the 645 g spotted eagle-owl has been recorded among their prey in a few cases. There are several owls was broadly similar habitat preferences from African scops owls (Otus senegalensis) to African wood owls (Strix woodfordii) that have not been reported as food but are almost certainly occasionally threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owls. As is commonly the case with eagle-owls, the Verreaux's eagle-owl is perhaps the most serious predatory threat to diurnal raptors in its range, most often ambushing raptors on their prominent nests upon nightfall and freely killing birds of prey of any age from nestlings to adults. Such prey is not quantitatively significant as a food source but since raptors as a rule are sparsely distributed the habitual visitation of a single or pair of Verreaux's eagle-owl can potentially be devastating to a local population. Among the species known to be attacked have included, among small-to-medium-sized raptors, include the 638 g African harrier-hawk (Polyboroides typus), the 675 g pale chanting goshawk (Melierax canorus), the 507 g African marsh harrier (Circus ranivorus), the 110 g scissor-tailed kite (Chelictinia riocourii), the 291.5 g <b>African</b> <b>goshawk</b> (Accipiter tachiro) the 875 g common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and the 640 g Wahlberg's eagle (Hieraaetus wahlbergi).|$|E
