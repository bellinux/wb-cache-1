40|$|<b>Antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> {{dispensed}} {{during the}} 2009 influenza pandemic generally failed to contain transmission. This poses {{the question of}} whether preparedness for a future pandemic should include plans to use <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> to mitigate transmission. Simulations using a standard transmission model that allows for infected arrivals and delayed vaccination show that attempts to contain transmission require relatively few antiviral doses. In contrast, persistent use of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> when the reproduction number remains above 1 use very many doses and are unlikely to reduce the eventual attack rate appreciably unless the stockpile is very large. A second model, in which the community has a household structure, shows that the effectiveness of a strategy of dispensing <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> to infected households decreases rapidly with time delays in dispensing the antivirals. Using characteristics of past pandemics it is estimated that at least 80 % of primary household cases must present upon show of symptoms to have a chance of containing transmission by dispensing <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> to households. To determine data needs, household outbreaks were simulated with 50 % receiving <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> early and 50 % receiving <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> late. A test to compare the size of household outbreaks indicates that at least 100 – 200 household outbreaks need to be monitored to find evidence that <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> can mitigate transmission of the newly emerged virus.

40|$|Abstract: Before {{effective}} vaccines become available, <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> {{are considered}} {{as the major}} control strategies for a pandemic influenza. However, perhaps such control strategies can be severely hindered by the low-efficacy of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> For this reason, using <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> and an isolation strategy is included in our study. A compartmental model that allows for imported exposed individuals and asymptomatic cases is {{used to evaluate the}} effectiveness of control strategies via antiviral prophylaxis and isolation. Simulations show that isolation strategy plays a prominent role in containing transmission when <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> are not effective enough. Moreover, relatively few infected individuals need to be isolated per day. Because the accurate calculations of the needed numbers of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> and the isolated infected are not easily available, we give two simple expressions approximating these numbers. We also derive an estimation for the total cost of these intervention strategies. These estimations obtained by a simple method provide a useful reference for the management department about the epidemic preparedness plans...|$|R

25|$|Some {{antiviral}} drugs, such as acyclovir (ATC: J05AB01) and ganciclovir (ATC: J05AB06) as well {{as other}} nucleoside analogs make use of the substrate specificity of viral thymidine kinase, as opposed to human thymidine kinases. These drugs act as prodrugs, which in themselves are not toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase. Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic triphosphates that lead to cell death. Human thymidine kinase, in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific thymidine kinase. In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance is frequently observed. Sequencing the thymidine kinase gene in Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance.|$|E

25|$|After {{smallpox}} {{was declared}} eradicated by WHO in December 1979, vaccination programs were terminated. A re-emergence {{of the disease}} either by accident or {{as a result of}} biological warfare would meet an unprotected population and could result in an epidemic that could be difficult to control. Mass vaccination would be unethical, as the only efficient vaccines against smallpox include live vaccinia virus with severe adverse effects on rare occasions. As one protective measure, large amounts of vaccine are kept in stock, but an efficient drug against smallpox has high priority. One possible approach would be to use the specificity of the thymidine kinase of poxvirus for the purpose, in a similar way that it is used for drugs against herpesvirus. One difficulty is that the poxvirus thymidine kinase belongs to the same family of thymidine kinases as the human thymidine kinases and thereby is more similar chemically. The structure of poxvirus thymidine kinases has therefore been determined to find potential antiviral drugs. The search has, however, not yet resulted in a usable <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> against poxviruses.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{different}} types of interferons are approved for use in humans. One was first approved for medical use in 1986.

When used with the <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> ribavirin, PEGylated interferon is effective in treatment of hepatitis C; at least 75% of people with hepatitis C genotypes 2 or 3 benefit from interferon treatment, although this is effective in less than 50% of people infected with genotype 1 (the more common form of hepatitis C virus in both the U.S. and Western Europe).

The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the direct costs per patient of chronic hepatitis C therapy in a Brazilian setting. MethodA microcosting study from a public health system perspective. The costs included were those of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs,</b> secondary medicines, diagnostic tests, visits to physicians and other professionals, hospitalization, nurse, and pharmaceutical care. All costs were priced in 2010. The values were converted to US $ (2010). ResultsThe total direct cost of hepatitis C treatment per patient with interferon alpha (IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) was US $ 982. 25, with peginterferon alpha (PEG) 2 a 180 μg plus RBV was US $ 10, 658. 08, and with PEG 2 b 120 μg plus RBV was US $ 12, 597. 63, taking into account entire treatment according to Brazilian guidelines and assuming that all patients completed full treatment. The <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> are the most expensive element of the cost of treatment, totaling more than 40 % of the medical costs of IFN plus RBV therapy and more than 88 % of PEG plus RBV therapy. Calculating an average of 10, 000 treatments per year, the total direct cost is US $ 90, 346, 772. 39. According to the Ministry of Health, 90 % of the annual total cost of hepatitis C treatment is accounted for by <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> ConclusionsIn Brazil, <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> are the most expensive component of hepatitis C treatment.
