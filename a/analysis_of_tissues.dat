40|$|International {{audience}} Oestrogens play a {{major role}} in the development of gynaecological oestrogen-dependent diseases that overexpress oestrogen receptors (ER+). The ER status is assessed using immunohistochemistry  <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>tissues</b> samples. It is believed that a non-invasive method such as positron emission tomography (PET) that would accurately evaluate and quantify in vivo the presence of ER could play an important role in managing such diseases. PET using fluorinated oestrogen analogues may be helpful in selecting patients who will benefit from endocrine therapy or could be used to identify high-grade cancer with poorer prognosis. Among more than 20 fluorinated oestrogens analogues that have been proposed as PET tracer candidates, 16 a-[18 F]fluoro- 17 b-oestradiol ([18 F]FES) has been the most actively investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe ras {{proteins}} (Harvey, Kirsten and N-ras) are key regulators {{of signal}} transduction and a perturbation of their GDP/GTP cycle is frequently observed in tumors. In mammals, N-ras constitutes with unr (upstream of N-ras) a tightly linked tandem of ubiquitously expressed genes. Although unr and N-ras {{appear to be}} involved in distinct functions, this unusual genetic organization could be important for the regulation of N-ras expression. Specifically, transcription of unr could negatively regulate that of N-ras by transcriptional interference. To investigate this possibility, we have deleted the unr promoter by homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem cells. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>tissues</b> of heterozygous mice revealed an increase in N-ras mRNA accumulation ranging between 20 and 65 %, in agreement with the suppression of a transcriptional interference...|$|E
