Instead of using the shock wave to create the conditions needed for fusion above the ignition range, this approach directly heats the fuel.

In HiPER, the compression provided by the driver is [...] "good", but not nearly that created by larger devices like NIF; HiPER's driver is about 200kJ and produces densities of about 300g/cm3.

40|$|Objective: Literature {{speculates that}} visual image quality (IQ) and {{compression}} force levels may be directly related. This small study investigates whether a relationship exists between compression force levels and visual IQ. Method: To investigate how visual IQ varies with different levels <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> force, 39 clients were selected over a 6 year screening period that had received markedly different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> force {{on each of}} their three sequential screens. Images for the 3 screening episodes for all women were scored visually using 3 different IQ scales. Results: Correlation coefficients between the 3 IQ scales were positive and high (0. 82, 0. 9 and 0. 85). For the scales, the IQ scores their correlation does not vary significantly, even though different compression levels had been applied. Kappa IQ scale 1 : 0. 92, 0. 89, 0. 89. ANOVA IQ scale 2 : p = 0. 98, p = 0. 55, p = 0. 56. ICC IQ scale 3 : 0. 97, 0. 93, 0. 91. Conclusion: For the 39 clients {{there is no difference}} in visual IQ when different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> are applied. We believe that further work should be conducted into compression force and image quality as ‘higher levels’ <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> force may not be justified in the attainment of suitable visual image quality...|$|R

Digital audio compression enables more efficient storage and transmission of audio data.

A potential limitation of these devices is that they may fail to measure the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> mattress <b>compression</b> when CPR is performed on a bed. The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> mattress <b>compression</b> compared to chest compression using a commercially available compression sensor (Q-CPR, Laerdal, UK). A secondary aim was to evaluate if placing a backboard beneath the victim would alter the degree <b>of</b> mattress <b>compression.</b> Methods: CPR was performed on a manikin on the floor and on a bed with a foam or inflatable mattress with and without a backboard. Chest and mattress compression depths were measured by an accelerometer placed on the manikin's chest (total compression depth) and sternal-spinal (chest) compression by manikin sensors. Results: Feedback provided by the accelerometer device led to significant under <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> the chest when CPR was performed on a bed with a foam 26. 2 (2. 2) mm or inflatable mattress 32. 2 (1. 16) mm.
