Inspired by the works of feminist scholars engaged in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article attempts to demonstrate the need to broaden the debate on gender-sensitive climate change <b>adaptation</b> <b>technologies.</b> I argue that, first and foremost, this debate must question the potentially oppressive effects of the climate change narratives that call for technological solutions. Second, I urge feminist researchers and practitioners to denounce the counter-productive effects of <b>adaptation</b> <b>technologies</b> that impede the transformation of the “traditional” gender roles. Based on my ethnographic fieldwork in rural Nicaragua, this article calls for rethinking the role of climate change <b>adaptation</b> <b>technologies</b> in offering possibilities for challenging gender inequalities...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters on technological innovation as adaptation to climate change. The first chapter adopts a non-cooperative game theory model to investigate the relationship between <b>adaptation</b> <b>technology</b> {{and the formation of}} emission-reducing International Environmental Agreements (IEAs) on climate change. The main contribution to the literature {{consists of}} considering countries that are heterogeneous with respect to the benefits and costs of both mitigation of emissions and adaptation. While differences in climate vulnerability are a deterrent for cooperation, this chapter shows that increasing the effectiveness of adaptation in highly vulnerable countries can foster an IEA. Both free-riding on climate change mitigation efforts, and free-riding on <b>adaptation</b> <b>technology</b> among members of an IEA can be reduced by the transfer of <b>adaptation</b> <b>technology</b> within the IEA. A numerical example with parameters estimated from climate change data is employed to simulate stable coalitions and demonstrate how the transfer of <b>adaptation</b> <b>technology</b> reduces free-riding on an IEA. The second chapter examines the determinants of adaptive innovation aimed at reducing the impact of natural disasters, which are expected to intensify with climate change. Starting from a conceptual model combining perceived risk theory with innovators' profit motive, this study investigates the salience of innovation induced by natural disasters, using a unique dataset that includes related U. S. patent data, and flood, drought, and earthquake damage data for the years 1977 to 2005. To address the potential endogeneity of disaster damage, the control function approach is employed with instrumental variables constructed from disaster intensity measurements. The results show that impact-reducing innovations at the state level respond to national disaster damages in the U. S. In general, the impact of natural disasters is not localized to a state [...] that is, disaster damage in a state also stimulates innovations in more-distant states. This is in contrast with comparable existing cross-country evidence. The findings in this paper highlight a policy role for the federal government in more effectively spurring impact-reducing innovations nationwide. With the pressure of economic growth and the impact of climate change, water issues such as water shortage and pollution have substantial impacts on welfare and sustainability. Taking a view of innovation as adaptation to intensified water threats, the third chapter explores the impact of federal and state level regulatory changes with respect to drinking water quality, water pollution and water quantity in the U. S. on the level of relevant technological innovation. Based on a detailed review of relevant legislative acts, a unique dataset covering major amendments and additions to regulated contaminants lists is constructed to capture the changes of water governance in the U. S. in the past 30 years. In addition, technological patents pertaining to water quality and quantity are identified through a comprehensive search process. The empirical results show the impact of water regulations on innovation to be both statistically and economically significant...|$|E

40|$|Adapting to {{changing}} climate {{is essential for}} individuals and communities to sustain their livelihoods. Improving adaptive capacity at various levels is essential, and {{this can be done}} by strengthening ongoing initiatives, introducing new measures, training and capacity building. One of the main focus areas of the Climarice projects is to train the farmers on implementing various <b>adaptation</b> <b>technologies</b> that would increase the water and nutrient use efficiencies at field level. Climarice project scientists have identified various technologies such as usage of biofertilizers such as blue green algae and azolla to improve the nutrient use efficiency in paddy cultivation, application of green manures to enhance soil organic matter content, introduction of short duration rice cultivar during delayed monsoon, cultivation of alternate crops for income generation, System of Rice intensification for enhancing water and grain productivity, usage of bio control agents such as Trichoderma and Pseudomonas for eco friendly management of pest and diseases etc.,. For the successful implementation of these technologies at field level, the farmers have to be given with training and exposure visits. ClimaRice project scientists have undertaken many capacity building programmes to farmers of Cauvery basin on various <b>adaptation</b> <b>technologies</b> and these programmes have created confidence among the farmers. Many farmers who have attended the training programmes are following the technologies with great interest. A summary of the training programmes and their impact are furnished in this report...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a major problem {{undermining}} agricultural production in Africa. Consequently, efforts are being made to provide farmers with adaptation technologies, but little empirical research exists on the determinants of adopting such technologies. This article addresses this research gap, using the case of drought tolerant maize (DTM) technology in Nigeria. With survey data from 200 farm households and econometric techniques, we explore the determinants of whether to invest and how much to invest in <b>adaptation</b> <b>technology</b> by smallholder farmers. Results from the study indicate that among the key determinants of adoption are access to the technology, complementary inputs, extension services, and climate change information. We also show that off-farm income and wealth status of a household {{play a significant role in}} adoption, implying capital constraints; hence, it can be difficult for resource-poor farmers to adopt the technology. Moreover, the farmers identified cost of the technology and complementary inputs, particularly fertilizer as major constraints to adoption. We conclude that while the DTM technology is suitable and important in helping smallholder maize farmers to continue to produce under a changing climate, more support is needed for them to invest in the technology and overcome adoption constraints. Necessary interventions include improving access to information about climate change and the available <b>adaptation</b> <b>technology,</b> timely access to the technology and complementary inputs, and improving access to credit, particularly for the resource-poor farm households...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Researchers {{and policymakers}} are {{figuring}} out the <b>adaptation</b> <b>technologies</b> {{to cope with the}} changing climate. Adaptation strategies for crop production followed by the farmers at selected study locations had ranged from 6 - 30 per cent only, and this was mainly due to lack of awareness about the actual cost associated with adaptation and non-adaptation of these strategies. Design/methodology/approach: Hence, this study aims to address the cost of adaptation for rice using joint probability distribution of rainfall and crop prices. Findings: Cost of adaptation varied from INR 2, 389 to 4, 395 /ha for System of Rice Intensification (SRI); INR 646 to 1, 121 /ha for alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and INR 8, 144 to 8, 677 /ha for well irrigation (WI), whereas expected cost for not using these technologies has ranged from INR 6, 976 to 9, 172 /ha for SRI; INR 4, 123 7, 764 /ha for AWD and INR 10, 825 to 17, 270 /ha for WI. Hence, promotion of the <b>adaptation</b> <b>technologies</b> itself will minimize the income losses to the farmers. Research limitations/implications: Even though, there are many ways for farmers (other than technology), to adapt to climate change (such as out-migration to cities, selling farm assets, focus on children’s education, etc.), this report, given the framework of the major research study undertaken, addresses only farm-level <b>adaptation</b> of the <b>technologies</b> to enhance farm income. Originality/value: Public–private partnership in providing the technologies at cheaper costs, capacity building in handling the technologies and creating awareness about the technologies to minimize the expected cost of adaptation are suggested to improve the adoption level...|$|R
