[...] "Billy is genuinely interested in and excited by cyberculture, and like <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> wants to factor that interest into his work, {{which happens to be}} pop music. Whether presenting cyberculture in that forum is ultimately a good thing or not is beside the point of Billy's right to bring it to that forum. After all, access to information should be free and total, right? Or at least that's how the mythology goes." [...] An update to Branwyn's Beyond Cyberpunk! hyper-card stack included a new introduction, which referred to the Cyberpunk controversy, frankly stating [...] "The release of Billy Idol's album Cyberpunk was met with a hailstorm of controversy on the Net, as young cyber-Turks whined about how he had ripped them off and destroyed their secret club." ...|$|E

The U.S. Commissioner of education came to see firsthand what Pratt was doing, and so did the president of Amherst College. Pratt's Fort Marion program convinced him that [...] "distant education" [...] {{was the only way to}} totally assimilate the Indian. He wrote, the Indian [...] "is born a blank, like <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> Transfer the savage born infant to the surroundings of a civilization and he will grow to possess a civilized language and habit." [...] Witmer writes,If all men are created equal, then why were blacks segregated in separate regiments and Indians segregated on separate tribal reservations? Why weren't all men given equal opportunities and allowed to assume their rightful place in society? Race became a meaningless abstraction in his mind.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson's romanticized portrayals {{were only}} amplified after Taylor {{announced}} that Smile was [...] "scrapped" [...] in May 1967. Later that month, he terminated his employment {{with the group}} in order to focus his attention on organizing the June 16–18 Monterey Pop Festival, an event the Beach Boys declined to headline at the last minute. In 1968, Jazz & Pops Gene Sculatti wrote that Wilson was [...] "currently {{at the center of}} an intense contemporary rock controversy, involving the academic 'rock as art' critic-intellectuals, the AM-tuned teenies, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in between. ... the California sextet is simultaneously hailed as genius incarnate and derided as the archetypical pop music copouts". On December 14, 1967, Wenner printed an influential article in Rolling Stone that denounced the [...] "genius" [...] label, which he called a [...] "promotional shuck" [...] and an attempt to compare Wilson with the Beatles. He wrote: [...] "Wilson believed [...] and felt obligated to make good of it. It left Wilson in a bind; a bind which meant that a year elapsed between Pet Sounds and their latest release, Smiley Smile. ... The Beach Boys are just one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles. It's a pointless pursuit." [...] Subsequently, many discerning rock fans began excluding the group from [...] "serious consideration".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{came to know}} Ann {{first as}} a moviegoer. I’d walk into various movie theaters and see the white hair up above the stadium seating. That’s how you'd know she was there. People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. And she looked at me and she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E
