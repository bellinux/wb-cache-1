40|$|An {{inertial}} navigation system (INS) has been widely used in challenging GPS environments. With the rapid development of modern physics, an atomic gyroscope will come into use {{in the near future}} with a predicted accuracy of 5 × 10 − 6 °/h or better. However, existing calibration methods and devices can not satisfy the accuracy requirements of future ultra-high accuracy inertial sensors. In this paper, an improved calibration model is established by introducing gyro g-sensitivity errors, accelerometer cross-coupling errors and lever arm errors. A systematic calibration method is proposed based on a 51 -state Kalman filter and smoother. Simulation results show that the proposed calibration method can realize the estimation of all the parameters using a common dual-axis turntable. Laboratory and sailing tests prove that the position accuracy in a five-day {{inertial navigation}} can be improved about 8 % by the proposed calibration method. The accuracy can be improved at least 20 % when the position accuracy of the <b>atomic</b> <b>gyro</b> INS can reach a level of 0. 1 nautical miles/ 5 d. Compared with the existing calibration methods, the proposed method, with more error sources and high order small error parameters calibrated for ultra-high accuracy inertial measurement units (IMUs) using common turntables, has a great application potential in future <b>atomic</b> <b>gyro</b> INSs...|$|E
