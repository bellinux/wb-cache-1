40|$|This {{current study}} focuses on {{exploring}} expectations of World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farming (WWOOF) hosts <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> participating in various countries using online semi-structured interview method. Using psychological contract theory, motivation is discovered as playing {{an important role}} in the formation of expectations of 27 hosts <b>and</b> 20 <b>volunteers.</b> When comparing motivation of both groups, they display contrast, similarity and complementarity. Expectations as contents of the psychological contract of hosts <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> are both transactional and relational in nature. The transactional aspect include work, food, accommodation and learning opportunities while the relational aspect involve social life and cultural exchange. Both hosts <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> view communication as mutual obligation and one of the main challenges of their exchange relationship. The psychological contract of hosts <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> include their relationship with their respective WWOOF organizations. Communication from these organizations influences the formation of expectations of hosts <b>and</b> <b>volunteers.</b> Finally, all hosts <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> who were motivated to continue cited the benefits they gained from the woofing experience in the form of met expectations and unexpected positive outcomes. In contrast, perceived breach and violation of their psychological contract as described through self-reported accounts may lead to shortening of hosting and early withdrawal from volunteering. Hosts respond to violation of contract by requesting their volunteers to leave...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was through {{theories}} of emotional labor; understand how staff <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> within women’s shelter handled their emotions in the encounters with battered women. To examine this we used a qualitative method and interviewed four staff members <b>and</b> three <b>volunteers</b> spread across four different women’s shelters. The data collected was analyzed using Hochschilds’ theory of emotional labor. The results show that the most common feelings within the women’s shelters were feelings of friendship, happiness, sadness and frustration. The results also show that the staff <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> needed to manage their emotion due to the inappropriateness of some feelings. The feelings that needed managing were primarily feelings of sadness, frustration and shock. To manage their emotion the staff <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> of the women’s shelters used both surface acting and deep acting. The surface acting used was that staff <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> hid the feelings that were considered inappropriate. The deep acting used was method acting, working experience, life experience and the staff <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> also managed their emotions by talking to fellow staff and their loved ones...|$|R
40|$|This report itself makes a {{contribution}} to the professional literature on giving <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> in Australia.

5|$|Japan's {{rapid advance}} south had been unexpected, and the {{perceived}} threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions {{and hundreds of other}} units. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps <b>and</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. However, Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943.|$|E
5|$|Temple-building {{continued}} into the third centuryAD, but as the empire weakened, imperial donations to the temple cults dried up. Cult activities continued, relying increasingly on financial support <b>and</b> <b>volunteer</b> labor from surrounding communities. In the following centuries, Christian emperors issued decrees that were increasingly hostile to pagan cults and temples. Some Christians attacked and destroyed temples, as in the plundering of the Serapeum and other temples in Alexandria in AD 391 or 392. Through some combination of Christian coercion and loss of funds, temples ceased to function at various times. The last temple cults died out in the fourth through sixth centuriesAD, although locals may have venerated some sites long after the regular ceremonies there had ceased.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} {{the reader to}} the main themes and general content of an edited volume on Religion <b>and</b> <b>Volunteering.</b> It starts from the observation {{that the relationship between}} religion <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> constitutes a key focus of research on volunteering. The ‘default’ perspective posits a strong and positive causal relationship between both phenomena. However, both <b>volunteering</b> <b>and</b> religion are multi-dimensional and dynamic social phenomena. On closer inspection the relation between them appears to be more complex, contested and ambiguous than is generally assumed. This introduction explores the (intensifying) tensions between religion <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> from the viewpoint of the particular nature and changing role of religion in society. A fundamental tension originates in the definition of volunteering as a freely chosen activity. From a religious perspective, in contrast, being of service to others is something the pious person does in obedience to God. A second source of tension relates to processes of religious change that include both the return and decline of religion A post-secular perspective is introduced, contributing to a more complex and variable understanding of how religion <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> interrelate. Against this broader background, the anthology addresses the following questions: How do the relationships between types of religions/religiosity <b>and</b> types of <b>volunteering</b> vary within <b>and</b> across nations? What recent changes in our understanding of society, religion <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> challenge the default view? What other dimensions, enactments, and consequences of the interplay religion <b>and</b> <b>volunteering</b> can be studied beyond the traditional perspective...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{generally}} prevailing diagnosis of 'hybridization' {{in the third}} sector under a new mode of governing welfare, {{with a focus on}} processes of devolution of public responsibility and 'responsibilized autonomy' for third sector organizations (TSOs) <b>and</b> <b>volunteers.</b> To this end we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with representatives from field-specific umbrella organizations and with officials working in independent governmental agencies. Our analysis generally deals with three themes: devolution of responsibility, accountability, <b>and</b> <b>volunteers</b> as responsibilized service providers. Our findings reveal four paradoxes or unintended consequences of 'responsibilized autonomy': decreased autonomy for TSOs, an administrative deadlock that crowds out grassroots associations <b>and</b> <b>volunteers,</b> an increasing demand for professional support for <b>volunteering,</b> <b>and</b> a bifurcation between strong <b>and</b> weak <b>volunteers,</b> whereby the latter are 're-excluded' through volunteering...|$|R

An Order in Council was made under this section on 19 March 1908, which transferred all existing units of the Yeomanry and Volunteers, with a small number of exceptions.|$|E

As he was only given three days of work per month by the BBC, he continued to freelance <b>and</b> <b>volunteer</b> for the Sherman Theatre. In 1986, he was approached by the Sunday Sport before its launch to provide a football-themed daily strip; he declined because he was concerned about the pornographic content of the newspaper. He submitted a script for Crossroads in response to an appeal for new writers; it was not used because the show was cancelled in 1987. He ultimately abandoned his graphic art career entirely when he realised in his early twenties that he enjoyed writing the dialogue of a comic more than creating the art.|$|E
