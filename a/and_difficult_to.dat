5|$|The infrageneric {{phylogeny}} of Narcissus {{still remains}} relatively unsettled, the taxonomy having proved complex <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> resolve, {{due to the}} diversity of the wild species, the ease with which natural hybridization occurs, and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation.

5|$|The infrageneric {{phylogeny}} of Narcissus {{still remains}} relatively unsettled.

5|$|A major {{capital works}} program was also {{undertaken}} to prepare RAAF bases for the Hornets. Over $150 million was spent upgrading the runways, hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF Base Williamtown, {{which has been}} the main F/A-18 base throughout the aircraft's service. The pre-existing airfield at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory was also developed into a major air base between 1985 and 1988 at a cost of $215 million so that it could accommodate No.75 Squadron. Until this time the squadron had been stationed at RAAF Base Darwin which, due to its location on Australia's north coast, was vulnerable to damage from cyclones <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> defend during wartime.|$|E
5|$|As the long-tailed {{ground roller}} is remarkably silent <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> see during the non-breeding season, the local {{inhabitants}} of Madagascar once {{believed that this}} bird hibernated in its burrows. While not particularly tasty, this species is hunted for food due to its large size and the relative ease of capture compared with arboreal birds. In the early twentieth century, it was hunted by herdsmen with blowguns. In the 1950s and 1960s, natives trapped this ground roller and dug out its nesting burrows. This bird has been featured on several of Madagascar's stamps. Only one zoo, Germany's Weltvogelpark Walsrode, keeps this species. It is considered by birdwatchers {{to be one of}} the world's most elusive birds.|$|E

5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it {{was not one of}} the three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, Germany, has led to the nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E
5|$|Dreamtime was a {{controversial}} best-seller upon its initial release in West Germany, and inspired academic debate {{leading to the}} publication of Der Gläserne Zaun (1983), an anthology discussing Duerr's ideas, edited by Rolf Gehlen and Bernd Wolf.

5|$|Fertility {{control is}} a {{non-lethal}} method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment, and its use {{is supported by the}} RSPCA. While it appears as though these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. Because it is costly <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented.|$|E

5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses a slightly different welding torch {{to create a more}} focused welding arc and as a result is often automated.|$|E
5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of algebraic topology, the homotopy groups of spheres describe how spheres of various dimensions can wrap around each other.

5|$|Once Beach {{accepted}} the commission on March 12, 1928, Juliette Fraser's sketches were forwarded to him. On April 7, he sent completed models to the Mint and photographs to the Fine Arts Commission. Both the Mint and Houston responded with criticism, the former that {{the relief of}} the coin was high <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reduce to coin-sized hubs. On April 19, Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock wrote in a memorandum that the coin {{would be very hard}} to produce because the area of greatest relief on each side was in the same part of the design. Beach agreed to lower any high points that might cause the Mint difficulty.|$|E
50|$|The mass {{of a long}} gun {{is usually}} {{greater than that of}} a short gun, making the long gun more {{expensive}} <b>to</b> transport, <b>and</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> tiring <b>to</b> carry. The increased moment of inertia makes the long gun slower <b>and</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> traverse <b>and</b> elevate, and it is thus slower <b>and</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> adjust the aim. However, this also results in greater stability in aiming. The greater amount of material in a long gun tends to make it more expensive to manufacture, other factors being equal. The greater size makes it more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> conceal, <b>and</b> more inconvenient to use in confined quarters, as well as requiring a larger storage space.|$|R

5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E

While plans for First Tennessee Park's scoreboard were initially undisclosed, following overwhelming support for Greer's guitar from the community, the team announced plans for a larger, more modern guitar-shaped scoreboard for the new ballpark. The new guitar scoreboard, paid for entirely by the Sounds, was designed by TS Sports in conjunction with Panasonic, and was installed beyond the right-center field wall on the concourse.|$|E
