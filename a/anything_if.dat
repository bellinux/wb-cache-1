25|$|Cicero {{understood}} {{what was going}} on and got Lucius Ninnius Quadratus, a plebeian tribune, to oppose every move of Clodius. The latter, fearing that this could result in disturbances and delays outwitted them by deceit. He agreed with Cicero not to bring an indictment against him. However, when these two men lowered their guard, Clodius proposed a bill to outlaw those who would or had executed any citizen without trial. This brought within its scope the whole of the senate, which had decreed the executions during the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC (see above). However, it was actually targeting Cicero, who had received most of the blame because he had proposed the motion and had ordered the executions. Cicero strenuously opposed the bill. He also sought the support of Pompey and Caesar. These two men did not want to appear to have instigated Clodius or to be pleased with his motion. Caesar advised Cicero to leave Rome because his life was in danger and offered him to become one of his lieutenants in Gaul so that his departure would not be dishonourable. Pompey advised him that to leave would be an act of desertion and that he should remain in Rome, defend himself and challenge Clodius, who would not achieve <b>anything</b> <b>if</b> he did so because he would help him. He also said that Caesar was giving him bad advice out of enmity. Pompey and Caesar presented opposite views on purpose to deceive Cicero and not give rise to suspicions. Cicero attached himself to Pompey. He also thought that he could count on the consuls. Aulus Gabinius was a friend of his and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus was amiable and a kin of Caesar.|$|E

Lisa suggests that perhaps there is not a lesson to be learned from this, to which Homer agrees as it's [...] "just a bunch of stuff that happened", though everyone agrees it has been a memorable few days.|$|E

Selznick wrote, [...] "I would give <b>anything</b> <b>if</b> we had Olivia deHavilland under contract to us so that we could cast her as Melanie." [...] The film he was preparing to shoot was Gone with the Wind, and Jack L. Warner was unwilling to lend her out for the project. DeHavilland had read the novel, and unlike most other actresses, who wanted the Scarlett O'Hara role, she wanted to play Melanie Hamiltona character whose quiet dignity and inner strength she understood and felt she could bring to life on the screen.|$|E
500|$|Upon their meeting, Emperor Wu inquired into Luan Da and his teacher's powers. [...] In response, Luan Da {{boasted that}} he had met immortals. He also claimed that with enough stature and skill, one could create gold, {{manufacture}} a means to achieve immortality, dam the Yellow River, and become an immortal. Luan Da then expressed concern at how Shaoweng had been killed, but the excited emperor assured him that the rumours of Shaoweng's execution were false. The emperor, in his enthusiasm, offered Luan Da <b>anything</b> <b>if</b> he would take Shaoweng's place and discover the secret of immortality from his allegedly immortal master. To this, Luan Da replied: ...|$|E

500|$|Irene Kacandes, {{professor}} of German Studies and Comparative Literature at Dartmouth College, calls Rosa's internal monologues apostrophes, or [...] "intrapsychic witnessing", in which [...] "a character {{witnesses to the}} self about the character's own experience". Kacandes points out that Rosa believes {{she would not be}} able to internalise <b>anything</b> <b>if</b> she knew someone was listening. In an apostrophe addressed to Conrad, Rosa remarks, [...] "If you knew I was talking to you I wouldn't be able to talk". But because Rosa is not vocalising her monologues, no one can hear her, and she is able to proceed with her self-analysis unhindered. Kacandes says [...] "Rosa imagines an interlocutor and then occupies that place herself." ...|$|E

500|$|Four filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Do-Over" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy plans to seduce Kathy so that he can get his old job back. The next scene, after Jack tells Liz he plans on reclaiming his former job back, Liz asks him how {{he will be able to}} get inside the 30 Rock building, as he does not have his employee ID card. Jack tells her you can do <b>anything</b> <b>if</b> you walk with confidence, which he does, and is permitted inside. Liz tries to do the same, but the guard asks her for ID, which she shows. In the third scene, Liz and Bev talk to NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth is fascinated with the adoption process, and says that his own mother worked two jobs as an animal control person for the state and selling meats door-to-door. The final scene, Liz introduces Bev to Tracy in the [...] "do over".|$|E

500|$|Bush {{authorized}} the CIA to use waterboarding {{and several other}} [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques" [...] that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture. Between 2002 and 2003 the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on a secret Justice Department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture and Vice President Cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal. The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given {{to it in the}} Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn. While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert [...] "that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information", the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations [...] "provided critical information" [...] to preserve American lives. Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, [...] "you can get anyone to confess to <b>anything</b> <b>if</b> the torture's bad enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Canopus {{was still}} some [...] south of Cradock when he {{encountered}} Spee's squadron, and the German ships were {{faster than the}} British cruisers, preventing Cradock from rejoining Canopus. In the ensuing Battle of Coronel, the East Asia Squadron sank both of Cradock's armoured cruisers and damaged Glasgow; by the time Cradock was defeated, Canopus was still [...] away. Glasgow and Otranto escaped {{to the south and}} rendezvoused with Canopus. Spee broke off the pursuit of the fleeing British ships when he became aware that Canopus was in the area, writing the following day that, [...] "against this ship, we can hardly do <b>anything.</b> <b>If</b> they had kept their forces together we should most likely have come off second best." [...] Shortly after news of the battle reached Britain, the Royal Navy ordered all naval forces in the region to consolidate; this included the remnants of Cradock's command, along with the armoured cruisers , , and [...] In addition, a pair of battlecruisers— and —were detached from the Grand Fleet to hunt down and destroy Spee's squadron.|$|E

However, Norville takes the opportunity to pitch an invention he's been working on {{which turns out to}} be a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, [...] "you know, for kids." [...] Believing Norville to be an idiot, Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker. Across town, Amy Archer, a brassy Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Manhattan Argus, {{is assigned}} to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She gets a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary, pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from Muncie. One night, Amy searches the building to find clues and meets Moses, a man who operates the tower's giant clock and knows [...] "just about <b>anything</b> <b>if</b> it concerns Hudsucker". He tells her Mussburger's plot, and she takes the story back to her Chief, but he does not believe a word of it.|$|E

500|$|From early on, it {{had been}} decided that The Spirits Within would be filmed entirely in English. The {{original}} script, written by Sakaguchi, was titled Gaia. The screenplay was written by Al Reinert and Jeff Vintar. The film was co-directed by Motonori Sakakibara, with Jun Aida and Chris Lee both serving as producers. Lee compared The Spirits Within, the first full-length photorealistic animated film, to Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first full-length cel animated film. In {{order to keep the}} film in line with Hironobu Sakaguchi's vision as director, several script rewrites took place, most in the initial stages of production. Sakaguchi stated he was pleased with the film's final cut, saying he would not have changed <b>anything</b> <b>if</b> given the chance. The film had high cost overruns towards the end of filming. New funds had to be sourced to cover the increasing production costs while maintaining staff salaries. The film's final cost of $137 million, which included about $30 million spent on marketing by the film's distributor Columbia Pictures, escalated from an original budget rumored to be around $70 million. $45 million alone was spent on the construction of Square's studio in Hawaii. It was Columbia Pictures' first animated feature film since [...] in 1986.|$|E
500|$|Idol was keen {{to share}} his ideas {{regarding}} the future of Cyberculture {{and its impact on}} the music industry, and was noted for his enthusiastic speculation in the future of computers throughout the promotion of the album. [...] "You're using very sort of extreme and raw ideas, but with very high level technology... it's probably whats going to be happeningor in fact, it is what is happening nowbecause that's how we made this album, Cyberpunk." [...] Some of the predictions Idol made for the future of the internet, computers, and musicians, was that it would allow for cheap and efficient recording from home; that musicians could record their music and send it to producers and fellow band members from great distances, perhaps while on tour; and that musicians would be able to directly communicate with their fans and critics. Idol also hoped that the rapid ability to do whatever he desired with the production would allow raw forms of rock music to remain relevant after the Grunge movement swept America in the early 90s. [...] " [...] can do <b>anything...</b> <b>If</b> you want the music backwards, it can be backwards in a snap. This is in a way my sort of answer to grunge. I know there's a way of using this modern technology to bring a lot of rawness back." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn. Kahn, who also directed the video for Brown and Ester Dean's [...] "Drop It Low", said that Brown played him tracks from his album on the set, and had {{a clear idea of}} what he wanted for the [...] "I Can Transform Ya" [...] video. Kahn said, [...] "...obviously, him going in there and dancing and turning into cars and trucks is right up my alley. His interests, in terms of kung fu and special effects and science fiction and all the boy-culture stuff, it falls directly in line with what I like. [...] "His talent is phenomenal. I'm still struggling to try and capture that talent on film, and it's a challenge. Here's a guy who can literally do <b>anything.</b> <b>If</b> you watch this thing, he's doing nunchuck tricks, and I'm a huge kung fu aficionado, and they're mind-blowing. I've never seen stuff like that before in kung fu flicks. I would say it's like a pure aesthetic dance video from the very fiber of it. Everything dances onscreen. Everything has movement. Everything has a certain mechanical rhythm. He actually created a dance style for this that is mechanical. It's sort of a hyper-intense version of the robot. Even the transformations go directly in line with the movements." ...|$|E
