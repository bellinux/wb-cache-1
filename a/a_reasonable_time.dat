5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>time,</b> unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} Americans {{were likely to}} build a Nicaragua Canal, {{the owners of the}} defunct French company, {{including}} Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who still had exclusive rights to the Panama route, lowered their price. Beginning in early 1902, President Roosevelt became a backer of the latter route, and Congress passed legislation for it, if it could be secured within <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>time.</b> In June, Roosevelt told Hay to take personal charge of the negotiations with Colombia. Later that year, Hay began talks with Colombia's acting minister in Washington, Tomás Herrán. The Hay-Herrán Treaty, granting $10 million to Colombia for the right to build a canal, plus $250,000 annually, was signed on January 22, 1903, and ratified by the United States Senate two months later. In August, however, the treaty was rejected by the Colombian Senate.|$|E
5|$|The works {{was shut}} down on 25 June 2007, after the Don burst its banks, and the entire site was engulfed by several feet of water. It {{remained}} submerged for over a week, {{with much of the}} equipment suffering catastrophic damage. Once the water subsided, imaginative ways had to be found to return it to operation within <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>time.</b> The analyser which measures emissions from the incinerator plant had been completely destroyed, and in order to mitigate a 16-week delivery time, the manufacturers removed one from a training centre at Telford, and it was hired by Yorkshire Water until a new unit could be supplied. The plant was recommissioned and operational just 18 days after its inundation.|$|E

25|$|Upon the {{creation}} of the government of the Town of Brunswick in April 1807, three commissioners of schools were appointed. Their tasks were to develop schools within the town and offer funding using the Common School Fund, which the New York Legislature had set up in 1805 to help cover the costs of public education. In 1812, the Legislature developed a school district system in which each district was self-governing. These districts were typically small by necessity, so that students could walk or ride to school in <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>time</b> period each day.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the rules}} of any two-person game with {{a finite number of}} positions, one can always trivially {{construct}} a minimax algorithm that would exhaustively traverse the game tree. However, since for many non-trivial games such an algorithm would require an infeasible amount of time to generate a move in a given position, a game is not considered to be solved weakly or strongly unless the algorithm can be run by existing hardware in <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>time.</b> Many algorithms rely on a huge pre-generated database, and are effectively nothing more.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the initial}} {{analysis}} is correct, {{there is another}} effect that can happen, known as the overvoltage effect. Additional voltage is sometimes required, beyond the voltage predicted by the E°cell. This {{may be due to}} kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. In fact, it has been proven that the activation energy for the chloride ion is very low, hence favorable in kinetic terms. In other words, although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed in <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>time</b> frame, the voltage of the external source has to be increased (hence, overvoltage).|$|E

Such an offer is irrevocable {{even in the absence of}} consideration. If no time is stated, it is irrevocable for <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>time,</b> but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months.
