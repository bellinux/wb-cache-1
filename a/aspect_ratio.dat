5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did not bother to copyright it, resulting in the film falling into the public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{superficial}} {{similarities between the}} two flags, the Italian flag and the Mexican flag have been compared over time. However, the Italian tricolour actually uses lighter shades of green and red and the two have different aspect ratios; the Italian flag's <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is 2:3, while the Mexican flag's <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4:7 results in a more elongated rectangular shape. When Italy became a republic in 1946, the Mexican naval ensign was a plain tricolour; for this reason, on demand of the international naval authorities, Italy could not adopt a sole national flag similar to France as it wished.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in North America on December 9, 2008. Releases include a one-disc edition DVD; a two-disc Special Edition DVD; a two-disc edition BD; and a Special Edition BD package featuring a statuette of the Bat-pod. The BD/iTunes version presents the film in a variable <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> with the IMAX sequences framed in 1.78:1, while scenes filmed in 35mm are framed in 2.40:1. The DVD versions feature the entire film framed in a uniform 2.40:1 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> Disc 2 of the two-disc Special Edition DVD features the six main IMAX sequences in the original 1.44:1 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> Additional IMAX shots throughout the film that are presented in 1.78:1 on the Blu-ray release are not, however, included in the DVD's special features. In addition to the standard DVD releases, some stores released their own exclusive editions of the film.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the air side heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics at steady state for the cross flow heat exchangers having flat tube configuration with staggered arrangement are presented. The effect of attack angles on the air side is major to study. In addition, the effect of tubes <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> was also studied. Nineteen heat exchangers with four <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> (0. 18, 0. 39, 0. 66 and 1) and six attack angles (0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150) are investigated. The water temperature of 75 °C and the air at ambient condition flowed through the heat exchangers with velocity range from 2 to 6 m/s. The {{results show that the}} thermal and the pressure drop characteristics had governed by the attack angles and the tube <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios.</b> For all values of the air velocity of each tube <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios,</b> to increasing the attack angles (0 90) the heat transfer rate and the pressure drop were increased, while the thermal hydraulic performance was decreased. When considered effect of tubes <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> on thermal and pressure drop characteristics, the results indicated that to change of the attack angles of lower tube <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> had effected on thermal and pressure drop more than attack angle changed of higher tube <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R
5|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have very}} large <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> i.e., their length {{is much larger}} than their diameter. Consequently, as expected from the classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or Rayleigh scattering) by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced.|$|E
5|$|There were various {{extended}} TV versions each {{broadcast in}} various countries. Most {{of these are}} in pan and scan, as they {{were made in the}} 1980s, when films were not letterboxed to preserve the theatrical <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> on old TVs.|$|E

5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video. That left {{less than a}} year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E
5|$|Inside Man was {{director}} of photography Matthew Libatique's second film with Lee. Because the filmmakers intended to finish with a digital intermediate (the post-production digital manipulation of color and lighting), Libatique chose to shoot Inside Man in the Super 35 format for a 2.35:1 <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> He mainly used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 and Vision2 Expression 500T 5229 film stocks. The film was shot with Arricam and Arriflex cameras and Cooke S4 lenses.|$|E
5|$|Mystery Train was {{released}} on DVD on March 28, 2000 with an <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.85:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1/2 surround sound. The DVD release was criticized by Anna Lazowski of allmovie who awarded it two stars out of five compared to four for the film itself, citing the paltry special features of 24 scene selections and a collectible behind-the-scenes booklet. A Criterion Collection DVD and Blu-ray were released on June 15, 2010, utilizing a new restored high-definition digital transfer.|$|E

5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.|$|E

50|$|The goal {{of these}} various lenses and <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> was to capture {{as much of}} the frame as possible, onto as large an area of the film as possible, in order to fully utilize the film being used.
