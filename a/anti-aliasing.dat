5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game engine. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample <b>anti-aliasing</b> and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample <b>anti-aliasing</b> and consumed twice as much video card memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the RGB color space, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample <b>anti-aliasing,</b> and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards unable to run high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in a different way to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E
5|$|The PC version {{received}} less favorable reviews overall. Critics of it noted the unrefined controls, limited framerate to 30 FPS, {{and a lack}} of <b>anti-aliasing</b> or other advanced graphics options. Ubisoft's DRM for the game, in particular, received many complaints since a constant Internet connection is required when launching the game, even though it was initially reported that the game would simply require a one-time-only activation. There were also a large number of reports that the PC version had crashing issues, glitches, and a small bracket of supported graphics cards, rendering the game unplayable for some. Ubisoft later announced that it was developing a patch that would enable offline authentication; players who were unwilling to wait could ask for a refund.|$|E
5|$|The PC port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos Montréal by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision to outsource the PC port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra <b>anti-aliasing</b> options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne to the platform.|$|E

5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without <b>anti-aliasing</b> – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E

25|$|Audiophiles have {{differed}} {{over the}} relative merits of the LP versus the CD since the digital disc was introduced.

25|$|Most {{web pages}} employ {{sans-serif}} type. Hinting information, spatial <b>anti-aliasing,</b> and subpixel rendering technologies have partially mitigated {{the perception of}} serif fonts on screen. Due to the basic constraint of screen resolution (typically 100 pixels per inch or less) the serifs in some fonts {{can be difficult to}} discern on screen. Some serif fonts, such as Georgia, are specially designed for web readability, employing higher x-heights in the letters, as well as sturdier serifs.|$|E
25|$|For {{a digital}} oscilloscope, {{a rule of}} thumb is that the {{continuous}} sampling rate should be ten times the highest frequency desired to resolve; for example a 20megasample/second rate would be applicable for measuring signals up to about 2megahertz. This allows the <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter to be designed with a 3dB down point of 2MHz and an effective cutoff at 10MHz (the Nyquist frequency), avoiding the artifacts of a very steep ("brick-wall") filter.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of the sampling theorem to images should be made with care. For example, the sampling process in any standard image sensor (CCD or CMOS camera) is relatively far from the ideal sampling which would measure the image intensity at a single point. Instead these devices have a relatively large sensor area at each sample point {{in order to obtain}} sufficient amount of light. In other words, any detector has a finite-width point spread function. The analog optical image intensity function which is sampled by the sensor device is not in general bandlimited, and the non-ideal sampling is itself a useful type of low-pass filter, though not always sufficient to remove enough high frequencies to sufficiently reduce aliasing. When the area of the sampling spot (the size of the pixel sensor) is not large enough to provide sufficient spatial <b>anti-aliasing,</b> a separate <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter (optical low-pass filter) is typically included in a camera system to further blur the optical image. Despite images having these problems in relation to the sampling theorem, the theorem can be used to describe the basics of down and up sampling of images.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Analog-to-digital {{converters}} (ADCs) convert analog continuous {{time signals}} into discrete time, digital format. One precondition {{that must be}} met for conventional nyquist rate ADCs is that the input signal must be suitably band-limited to an input bandwidth less than the nyquist frequency. This mandates expensive <b>anti-alias</b> filters which contribute to system noise and distortion degradation. By choosing an OSR of 2 and adopting simple linear phase filtering techniques, significant inherent <b>anti-alias</b> filtering is achieved, avoiding {{the need for an}} explicit <b>anti-alias</b> filter in many applications. Additionally the proposed continuous time input pipeline ADC eases a number of other challenges present in conventional switched capacitor ADCs:- sampled opamp noise folding, sampling distortion, reduced ADC area, switched-capacitor pipeline ADC input loading. Chapter 2 introduces the first continuous time input pipeline ADC in the literature. This ADC, while providing significant benefits, does not provide the inherent filtering.
