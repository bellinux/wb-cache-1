5|$|On January 25, 1776, Congress {{approved}} {{the establishment of}} a monument in memory of Montgomery. A state memorial service was also scheduled and carried out on February 19, 1776. Throughout the colonies, Montgomery was viewed as <b>a</b> <b>hero,</b> <b>and</b> Patriots tried to use his death to promote their cause in the war. Montgomery's name was used very often in literature; among the authors who used his name was Thomas Paine.|$|E

5|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the creation of}} the Polish Legions, many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits and had little desire to invest in the re-creation of the Polish state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's Polish Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon himself is often regarded as <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> <b>and</b> liberator there. About the Polish Legion, Napoleon himself is reputed to have said that 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Lafayette left Boston for France on 18 December 1781. On arrival he {{was welcomed}} as <b>a</b> <b>hero,</b> <b>and</b> on 22 January 1782 he was {{received}} at Versailles. He witnessed {{the birth of}} his daughter, whom he named Marie-Antoinette Virginie upon Thomas Jefferson's recommendation. He was promoted to maréchal de camp, skipping numerous ranks. He was made a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis. In 1782, with no treaty yet signed ending the war, Lafayette helped prepare for a combined French and Spanish expedition against the British West Indies. The Treaty of Paris signed between Great Britain and the U.S. in 1783 made the expedition unnecessary—Lafayette took part in the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), {{sister of the}} Bulgarian voivoda Momchil (who ruled {{territory}} in the Rhodope Mountains). At Marko's birth three narecnitsi (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting {{that he would be}} <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> <b>and</b> replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket to get rid of him. A samodiva named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the samodivas milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia ("dappled") and a stepsister, the samodiva Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.|$|E
5|$|In France, Napoleon was massing {{forces to}} invade Great Britain. After a brief spell in London, where he again visited the Hamiltons, Nelson {{was placed in}} charge of {{defending}} the English Channel to prevent the invasion. He spent the summer reconnoitring the French coast, but apart from a failed attack on Boulogne in August, saw little action. On 22 October 1801 the Peace of Amiens was signed between the British and the French, and Nelson – in poor health again – retired to Britain where he stayed with Sir William and Lady Hamilton. On 30 October Nelson spoke {{in support of the}} Addington government in the House of Lords, and afterwards made regular visits to attend sessions. The three embarked on a tour of England and Wales, visiting Birmingham, Warwick, Gloucester, Swansea, Monmouth and numerous other towns and villages. Nelson often found himself received as <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> <b>and</b> was the centre of celebrations and events held in his honour. In 1802, Nelson bought Merton Place, a country estate in Merton, Surrey (now south-west London) where he lived briefly with the Hamiltons until William's death in April 1803. The following month, war broke out again and Nelson prepared to return to sea.|$|E

25|$|In Travnik, he {{established}} a Divan, a Bosnian congress, which together with him made up the Bosnian government. Gradaščević also collected taxes at this time, and executed various local opponents of the autonomy movement.

One anecdote that illustrates this is Husein-kapetan's alleged response to whether he was scared of waging war against the Ottoman Empire. God I fear slightly, Gradaščević replied, the Sultan not at all, and the Grand Vizier no more than my own horse.|$|E
25|$|At {{a meeting}} of Indians called for a {{condemnation}} of Dhingra's deed, Savarkar protested the intention to condemn and was drawn into a hot debate and angry scuffle with other participants. A secretive and restricted trial and a sentence awarding the death penalty to Dhingra provoked an outcry and protest across the Indian student and political community. Strongly protesting the verdict, Savarkar struggled with British authorities in laying claim to Dhingra's remains following his execution. Savarkar hailed Dhingra as <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> <b>and</b> martyr, and began encouraging revolution with greater intensity.|$|E

After the battle, neither the Athenians or the Spartans wanted to {{continue}} the war (Cleon and Brasidas being the most hawkish members from each side), and the Peace of Nicias was signed in 421 BC. This treaty was also eventually broken. Thucydides was exiled for his failure to protect Amphipolis, thus ending the period of the war in which he directly participated.|$|E

He was hailed as <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> <b>and</b> from this time forth the legend of Anthony began to spread and grow. Anthony went to Fayyum and confirmed the brethren there in the Christian faith before returning to his fort.|$|E
25|$|He is revered as <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> <b>and</b> martyr in Kabylie, the Berber World, and the world.

His assassination, in circumstances which remain unclear, provoked violent riots in Kabylie. Berber Algerians still accuse the Algerian government of killing Matoub Lounès, but some of the Algerian government's figures accused the Islamist terrorists of this crime.|$|E
