5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen {{as early as the}} second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape,</b> mostly downhill, but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Okehampton Castle is {{a medieval}} motte and bailey castle in Devon, England. It was built between 1068 and 1086 by Baldwin FitzGilbert {{following}} a revolt in Devon against Norman rule, and formed {{the centre of}} the Honour of Okehampton, guarding a crossing point across the West Okement River. It continued in use as a fortification until the late 13th century, when its owners, the de Courtenays, became the Earls of Devon. With their new wealth, they redeveloped the castle as a luxurious hunting lodge, building a new deer park that stretched out south from the castle, and constructing fashionable lodgings that exploited the views <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b> The de Courtenays prospered and the castle was further expanded to accommodate their growing household.|$|E
5|$|Alto's Adventure is a side-scrolling endless runner snowboarding game. The player {{character}} moves automatically through procedurally generated landscapes {{towards the}} right side of the screen and the player can only control when to jump. The player taps the screen once to jump and holds the screen while the player character is midair to perform tricks. While the character moves <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape,</b> the player can complete some of the game's 180 goals, though they are given only three at a time. Goals include such things as traveling a set distance, rescuing runaway llamas, crossing dangerous gaps, grinding across rooftops of villages, and outsmarting the mountain elders. The player receives awards from completing goals, and can also collect coins that can be used to purchase upgrades. Players perform tricks in quick succession, or combos, to earn points towards a competitive high score. The game also tracks distance traveled and trick combos. Later in the game, players can use a wingsuit, which changes some elements of the game. The environments of Alto's Adventure change in lighting as time passes through the cycle of the day, and incorporate various weather effects. Player progress syncs between iPads and iPhones over iCloud, and the game uses Game Center leaderboards.|$|E

5|$|The three remain undetected for two days, {{even as a}} {{probe and}} a group of the Martians {{themselves}} explore the basement. They also soon discover that the Martians are growing strange red-colored alien vegetation <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> and is quickly growing, covering trees and spreading into the basement, thus explaining the Martians' motives: to colonise Earth for their species, therefore making Earth a Mars-like planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping. Rachel is soon abducted by a nearby Tripod; Ray allows himself to be abducted, and is placed in the same cage with Rachel {{and a number of other}} prisoners. As the Tripod selects him for harvesting, Ray takes a belt of grenades into the machine in his place, having pulled out the pins. The Tripod is destroyed and releases the cage, with Ray and Rachel, and the other prisoners, making it out alive.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis {{prefers to}} eat {{crayfish}} and other crustaceans, but also takes aquatic insects and small fish. Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as abundance {{and types of}} prey depend on the both region and habitat. In Los Llanos, located {{on the border of}} Colombia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are insects, such as fly larvae and beetles. Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans, mostly crayfish. In the Everglades and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of crayfish, while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish. American white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs. The tactile nature of the ibis's probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill. In the Everglades, this means that crayfish make up {{a large part of the}} diet, but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas. Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises, prey switching to fish does occur if fish are found in great abundance. It is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfishâ€”normally, fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis's bill more easily. Fish are a more energy-rich source of food for the American white ibis. In the breeding season, American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish, than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young. This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.|$|E

25|$|The Belgian UFO wave {{began in}} November 1989. The events of 29 November were {{documented}} by over thirty {{different groups of}} witnesses, and three separate groups of police officers.

25|$|Prior to European {{settlement}} in the 19th century, the vegetation consisted of tallgrass prairie and bur oak savanna on ridgetops and dry upper slopes, sugar maple-basswood-oak forest on moister slopes, sugar maple-basswood forests in protected valleys and on north-facing slopes, wet prairies along the rivers and some mesic prairie on the floodplain farther back from the river. There were probably also oak forests that contained no sugar maple. Marsh and floodplain forests were also common on river flood plains. Prairie was restricted primarily to the broader ridge tops, which were unfavorable sites for trees due to thin soils and shallow bedrock, rapid drainage, and desiccating winds; all these conditions were also good for carrying fires <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b> Prairies also occurred on steep slopes with south or southwest aspect (see goat prairie). Natural fire, which has long been vigorously suppressed, was essential for the regeneration of such prairies.|$|E
25|$|A main {{concept in}} {{landscape}} ecology is scale. Scale represents {{the real world}} as translated onto a map, relating distance on a map image and the corresponding distance on earth. Scale is also the spatial or temporal measure of an object or a process, or amount of spatial resolution. Components of scale include composition, structure, and function, which are all important ecological concepts. Applied to landscape ecology, composition refers {{to the number of}} patch types (see below) represented on a landscape and their relative abundance. For example, the amount of forest or wetland, the length of forest edge, or the density of roads can be aspects of landscape composition. Structure is determined by the composition, the configuration, and the proportion of different patches <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape,</b> while function refers to how each element in the landscape interacts based on its life cycle events. Pattern is the term for the contents and internal order of a heterogeneous area of land.|$|E
