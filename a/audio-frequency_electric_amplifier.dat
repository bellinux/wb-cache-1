50|$|The Syntok {{equipment}} {{had proved}} to be unsatisfactory, it was both unreliable and had poor sound quality. Consequently, it {{was replaced by a}} new Western Electric sound-on-film sound system. This consisted of standard Western Electric soundheads together with the Western <b>Electric</b> 4A <b>amplifier</b> system. The 4A was the smallest of the Western <b>Electric</b> cinema <b>amplifier</b> systems available at the time and was intended for small cinemas. Two Western Electric 12A full-range horn loudspeakers were employed, hung from a substantial wooden structure behind the screen. The high efficiency of these speakers made the most of the limited output power (about 5 watts) of the 4A amplifier system. At the same time the two Gaumont projectors were replaced by new Kalee model 7 machines.|$|R

5000|$|Magnetic pickups. Magnetic pickups, {{as applied}} in {{electric}} guitars, register the vibrations of nickel or steel strings in a magnetic field. They {{have the advantage}} {{that they can be}} connected directly to an (<b>electric</b> guitar) <b>amplifier,</b> but in combination with a steel-string acoustic guitar the sound tends to be electric.

40|$|A new {{expression}} of the amplification factor is derived. Amplitude characteristics of the recorder are soon anticipated with the calculated diagram. This paper is a synthesis of considerations of those problems which {{have been published in}} Japanese by. the present author. 1. At the time of the GEOPHYSICAL YEAR many seismic observatories are being equipped wit 9 - the electromagnetic seismo-meter. But the amplification factor hitherto derived is not bene-ficial for understanding total actions of the recorder. This implies that the design {{and the use of the}} seismometer are often unsuitable!) for one's purpose. In spite of COUI,O IB'S recent publication" there-fore, it is proposed to derive another new {{expression of}} the ampli-fication which will be, the author believes, the final One for the electromagnetic recorder having no <b>electric</b> <b>amplifier.</b> 2. At first let there be assumed, for simplicity, second order linear differential equations for the respective motions of the pendulums of the seismometer as well as of the galvanometer, when the electrical circuit is open between them. In this case one has the next two sets of simultaneous equations'). F J =-Ajlj+zjVj...|$|R
40|$|The power {{consumption}} {{of a conventional}} photoreceiver is dominated by that of the <b>electric</b> <b>amplifier</b> connected to the photodetector (PD). An ultralow-capacitance PD can overcome this limitation, because it can generate sufficiently large voltage without an amplifier when combined with a high-impedance load. In this work, we demonstrate an ultracompact InGaAs PD based on a photonic crystal waveguide with a length of only 1. 7  μm and a capacitance of less than 1  fF. Despite {{the small size of}} the device, a high responsivity of 1  A/W and a clear 40  Gbit/s eye diagram are observed, overcoming the conventional trade-off between size and responsivity. A resistor-loaded PD was actually fabricated for light-to-voltage conversion, and a kilo-volt/watt efficiency with a gigahertz bandwidth even without amplifiers was measured with an electro-optic probe. Combined experimental and theoretical results reveal that a bandwidth in excess of 10  GHz can be expected, leading to an ultralow energy consumption of less than 1  fJ/bit for the photoreceiver. Amplifier-less PDs with attractive performance levels are therefore feasible and a step toward a densely integrated photonic network/processor on a chip...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1923, record numbers {{attended}} rallies of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana. On June 16, 1923, 75,000 attended a Klan rally in Terre Haute. On June 21 Argos held the largest rally it had ever seen. On June 26 a large Klan rally was held in Alexandria. All of this was merely a prelude to the rally planned for Kokomo. Conceived as a [...] "monster tristate conclave," [...] {{it was intended to}} charter 93 Indiana klans representing more than 300,000 members. Some doubted the prospect of 200,000 attendees, claiming in would be [...] "without parallel in history"; others predicted attendance of 300,000. Extensive preparations for that number were made, including the scheduling of 1,000 interurban cars from around Indiana to Kokomo. The Union Traction Company, in addition to supplying 50 cars, transported three cars of white horses to Kokomo for the parade. The Kokomo Klan rented the fields surrounding its own large lot for parking, and <b>electric</b> <b>amplifiers</b> were obtained to allow the large crowd to hear the speeches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{philosophy}} of the lawine torrèn's mastermind is that choreography cannot be constricted; moreover, {{it is all about}} the feeling of how movement is perceived, every movement. It was due to our sense for kinaesthesia and our ability for being empathetic that we fully understood our teddy bears - today, we admire the elegance of a crane. The increased upright - the genuine axis of the wish for elevation in dance - forms the basis for [...] "artful elevation". Conducted by humans, cars, diggers, cranes, aeroplanes, snow cats, ships, whichever vehicles, become the <b>electric</b> <b>amplifier</b> of a dance that erupts like rock 'n' roll from the stifling air of the theatre, its space self-referential and formatted too tightly. Drama is understood as an evolutionary creature; art works on the basis of memetic processes: copy, variation and selection form the algorithm of the system called art, which unremittingly saves beauty anew, without signification and orientation. Lawine torrèn sees itself as an attention-industrial formation that functions as a catalyst in and of global economy, steering processes instead of destructing them.|$|R
2500|$|For <b>electric</b> guitar <b>amplifiers,</b> {{there is}} often a {{distinction}} between [...] "practice" [...] or [...] "recording studio" [...] guitar amps, which tend to have output power ratings of less than one watt to 20 watts and [...] "performance" [...] or [...] "stage" [...] amps, which are generally 30 watts or higher. Traditionally, these have been fixed-power amplifiers, with some models having a half-power switch to slightly reduce the listening volume while preserving power-tube distortion.|$|R

50|$|Armstrong {{moved to}} London {{in the early}} 1970s where he {{developed}} {{a new line of}} <b>electric</b> instruments, <b>amplifiers</b> and effects boxes. The Dan Armstrong London instruments were made of solid Honduran mahogany with sliding low impedance pickups, available as a six string guitar, short scale and long scale guitars. Armstrong also marketed a line of tube guitar and bass amplifiers and effects boxes, the Blue Clipper, Yellow Humper, Red Ranger, Purple Peaker, Green Ringer and Orange Squeezer.|$|R
25|$|The first <b>electric</b> {{instrument}} <b>amplifiers</b> {{were not}} intended for electric guitars, but were portable PA systems. These {{appeared in the}} early 1930s when the introduction of electrolytic capacitors and rectifier tubes enabled economical built-in power supplies that could plug into wall sockets. Previously, amplifiers required heavy multiple battery packs. People used these amplifiers to amplify acoustic guitar, but electronic amplification of guitar first became widely poplular in the 1930s and 1940s craze for Hawaiian music, which extensively used amplified lap steel guitars.|$|R
50|$|A {{few large}} brand names still use {{terminal}} strip-type point-to-point boards, but usually for special product lines. <b>Electric</b> guitar <b>amplifier</b> manufacturer Marshall have reissued {{some of their}} older models, using this type of construction as a design feature, although their standard products have long used PCBs.

50|$|The {{chorus effect}} can be {{simulated}} by signal processing equipment. The signal processor may be software running on a computer, software running in a digital effect processor, or an analog effect processor. If the processor is hardware-based, it may be packaged as a pedal, a rack-mount module, a table-top device, or built into an instrument amplifier (often an acoustic guitar <b>amplifier</b> or an <b>electric</b> guitar <b>amplifier).</b> Some keyboard instruments have an electronic chorus effect built in, such as some electronic pianos and some Hammond organs.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, pentodes {{were widely}} used in TV receivers, {{particularly}} the successor to the EF50, the EF80. Vacuum tubes were replaced by transistors during the 1960s.
