40|$|Uniaxial {{compression}} test of cement asphalt (CA) mortar specimens, due to drying <b>and</b> <b>wetting</b> cycle of 0, 2, 4 and 8 times, {{is carried out}} by using the electronic universal test machine, with the strain rate ranging from 1 × 10 − 5 [*]s− 1 to 1 × 10 − 2 [*]s− 1. The effects of strain rate <b>and</b> drying <b>and</b> <b>wetting</b> cycle time on the compressive strength, elasticity modulus, and stress-strain full curve are investigated. Experimental {{results show that the}} strain-stress full curve of CA mortar is affected obviously by strain rate <b>and</b> drying <b>and</b> <b>wetting</b> cycle time. The compressive strength and elasticity modulus increase with the strain rate under the same drying <b>and</b> <b>wetting</b> cycle time. The compressive strength and elasticity modulus decrease with the increase of drying <b>and</b> <b>wetting</b> cycle time in the same strain rate. The lower the strain rate is, the greater the compressive strength and elasticity modulus of CA mortar decrease. When the strain rate is 1 × 10 − 5 [*]s− 1 <b>and</b> drying <b>and</b> <b>wetting</b> cycle time is 8, the largest reduction of average compressive strength of CA mortar is 40. 48 %, and the largest reduction of elasticity modulus of CA mortar is 35. 51 %, and the influence of drying <b>and</b> <b>wetting</b> cycle on the compressive strength of CA mortar is greater than its influence on the elasticity modulus...|$|R

5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes.

Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
5|$|Average annual {{precipitation}} ranges from , {{though it is}} generally unpredictable. More than 85% of annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which constitutes the warm season. In contrast, the winter months are dry. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. Precipitation is highly variable {{from year to year}} and appears to follow a cycle between dry <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> years in periods of about 2, 4–5, 6–8, and 16–22 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger, causing moisture to flow towards this region; during dry years, these winds are weaker.|$|E

5|$|Once {{males and}} females are both sexually mature, mating is spread over a few weeks.

Once fertilized, females B. rufimanus lay eggs on developing pods of faba beans. Rain, wind and temperatures below 20°C put on hold the oviposition process. Eggs are laid predominantly on the lowest parts of the plant. Eggs are small (< 2mm diameter), white-yellowish. A maximum of ten eggs per pod is observed. Females lay between 50 and 100 eggs. Rain might increase egg mortality.|$|E
