A trial of using new coach screws and plates to fix the rails to the sleepers was undertaken in September 1988 at Woody Bay, attempting to solve issues with gauge creep and rail joint movement. The trial proved the benefits of this system, with the Haste Hill extension laid entirely with coach screws on pre <b>assembled</b> <b>track</b> panels.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} robust and {{efficient}} approach to video stabilization that achieves high-quality camera motion {{for a wide}} range of videos. In this article, we focus on the problem of transforming a set of input 2 D motion trajectories so that they are both smooth and resemble visually plausible views of the imaged scene; our key insight is that we can achieve this goal by enforcing subspace constraints on feature trajectories while smoothing them. Our approach <b>assembles</b> <b>tracked</b> features in the video into a trajectory matrix, factors it into two low-rank matrices, and performs filtering or curve fitting in a low-dimensional linear space. In order to process long videos, we propose a moving factorization that is both efficient and streamable. Our experiments confirm that our approach can efficiently provide stabilization results comparable with prior 3 D methods in cases where those methods succeed, but also provides smooth camera motions in cases where such approaches often fail, such as videos that lack parallax. The presented approach offers the first method that both achieves high-quality video stabilization and is practical enough for consumer applications...|$|R
50|$|This band {{released}} {{ten more}} albums between 1972 and 1987. Many {{of these were}} released both in Hungarian and in English, {{in the hopes of}} generating wider interest in their music. However, the contents of the English albums often differed from their Hungarian counterparts, sometimes <b>assembling</b> <b>tracks</b> from several different albums and nearly always changing the song order. The band dissolved in 1987, but reformed again in 1994, with former member Gábor Presser joining them, following a thawing in relations between Omega and Locomotive GT, at concerts and contributing several tracks to 1995's Trans And Dance. Since the band's reformation the line-up has often been augmented by guitarist Tamás Szekeres, bassist Miklós Küronya, and keyboardist Zsolt Gömöry, as substitutes for Molnár, Mihály, and Benkő, respectively, on occasions where the official band members have been unable to commit to the band for personal reasons. The involvement of these musicians' has been principally for live purposes, but has sometimes extended to recording sessions; regardless of this, Benkő, Mihály, and Molnár all remain official members' of Omega.|$|R
