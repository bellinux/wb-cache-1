40|$|Although huge {{research}} {{efforts have been}} devoted to wear analysis of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) in hip and knee implants, shoulder prostheses have been studied only marginally. Recently, the authors presented a numerical wear model of reverse total shoulder arthroplasties (RTSAs), and its application for estimating the wear coefficient k from experimental data according to different wear laws. In this study, such model and k expressions are exploited to investigate the sensitivity of UHMWPE wear to implant size and <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance.</b> A set of 10 different geometries was analysed, considering nominal diameters in the range 36 - 42 mm, available on the market, and a cup <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance</b> of + 0. 2, - 0. 0 mm (resulting in a diametrical clearance ranging between 0. 04 - 0. 24 mm), estimated from measurements on RTSAs. Since the most reliable wear law and wear coefficient k for UHMWPE are still controversial in the literature, both the Archard law (AR) and the wear law of UHMWPE (PE), as well as four different k expressions were considered, carrying out a total of 40 simulations. Results showed that the wear volume increases with the implant size and decreases with the <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance</b> for both the wear laws. Interestingly, different trends were obtained for the maximum wear depth vs. clearance: the best performing implants should have a high conformity according to the AR law but low conformity for the PE law. However, according to both laws, wear is highly affected by both implant size and <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance,</b> although {{it is much more}} sensitive to the latter, with up to a twofold variation of wear predicted. Indeed, <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance</b> directly alters the clearance, and therefore the lubrication and contact pressure distribution in the implant.

First, the dimensions of the mechanism are computed by means of an appropriate robustness index, which is used to minimize the sensitivity of its performances to variations. These robust dimensions are obtained independently of the amount of variations, and tolerate globally the largest variations. Thus, knowing the acceptable performance error of the mechanism, the second step aims at computing the optimal <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the mechanism by means of the new tolerance synthesis method. This method is used to find the best distribution of the error between the dimensions of the mechanism. Two serial manipulators are studied to illustrate the theory...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The McTronX {{research}} {{group at the}} North–West University designs and develops Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs). The group’s focus shifted to the design and development of AMB supported drive systems. This includes the electromagnetic and mechanical design of the electric machine, AMBs, auxiliary bearings {{as well as the}} development of the control system. The {{research group}} is currently developing an AMB supported high speed Induction Machine (IM) drive system that will facilitate tests in order to verify the design capability of the group. The research presented in this thesis describes the mechanical design and manufacturing of a high speed IM rotor section. The design includes; selecting the IM rotor topology, material selection, detail stress analysis and selecting appropriate manufacturing and assembly procedures. A comprehensive literature study identifies six main design considerations during the mechanical design of a high speed IM rotor section. These considerations include; magnetic core selection, rotor cage design, shaft design, shaft/magnetic core connection, stress due to operation at elevated temperatures and design for manufacture and assemble (DFMA). A critical overview of the literature leads to some design decisions being made and is used {{as a starting point for}} the detail design. The design choices include using a laminated cage rotor with a shrink fit for the shaft/magnetic core connection. Throughout the detail design an iterative process was followed incorporating both electromagnetic and mechanical considerations to deliver a good design solution. The first step of the iterative design process was, roughly calculating the material strengths required for first iteration material selection followed by more detailed interference fit calculations. From the detail stress analysis it became apparent that the stress in the IM rotor section cannot be calculated accurately using analytical methods. Consequently, a systematically verified and validated Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model was used to calculate the interferences required for each component. The detail stress analysis of the assembly also determined the <b>allowable</b> manufacturing <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances.</b> From the detail stress analysis it was found that the available lamination and squirrel cage material strengths were inadequate for the design speed specification of 27, 000 r/min. The analysis showed that a maximum operating speed of 19, 000 r/min can be achieved while complying with the minimum factor of safety (FOS) of 2. Each component was manufactured to the prescribed <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances</b> and the IM rotor section was assembled. With the failure of the first assembly process, machine experts were consulted and a revised process was implemented. The revised process entailed manufacturing five small lamination stacks and assembling the stack and squirrel cage afterwards. The end ring/conductive bar connection utilises interference fits due to the fact that the materials could not be welded. The process was successful and the IM rotor section was shrink fitted onto the shaft. However, after final machining of the rotor’s outer diameter (OD), inspections revealed axial displacement of the end rings and a revised FEA was implemented to simulate the effect. The results indicated a minimum FOS 0. 6 at very small sections and with further analytical investigation it was shown that the minimum FOS was reduced to only 1. 34. Although the calculations indicated the FOS was below the minimum prescribed FOS ? 2, the rotor spin tests were scheduled to continue as planned. The main reasons being that the lowest FOS is at very small areas and is located at non critical structural positions. The fact that the rotor speed was incrementally increased and multiple parameters were monitored, which could detect early signs of failure, further supported the decision. In testing the rotor was successfully spun up to 19, 000 r/min and 27 rotor delevitation test were conducted at speeds of up to 10, 000 r/min. After continuous testing a secondary rotor inspection was conducted and no visible changes could be detected. The lessons learnt leads to mechanical design and manufacturing recommendations and the research required to realise a 27, 000 r/min rotor design. Master...|$|R

40|$|A task {{is set to}} {{determine}} <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances</b> of matching elements of a long line to meet requirements for transmission signal mode. The line {{is characterized by the}} standing wave ratio (SWR) while the matching element is characterized by the reactive conductivity. In full matching SWR is equal to unit. Changing conductivity of an element leads to SWR change. An approximate relationship between these changes in vicinity of full matching mode is derived. The approximation error is estimated. At the same time, the matching element design and dimensions define its conductivity. Therefore a SWR deviation from the unit can be expressed through the <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances.</b> The appropriate calculation is performed for a rectangular waveguide with a diaphragm as a matching element. Symmetric diaphragms of inductive and capacitor types are considered. Such diaphragms contain only one varied size, i. e. window width. Besides, an important condition for matching is the choice of a point where the matching element is installed in the line. Therefore a variation of the diaphragm coordinate in the waveguide also was taken into account. The paper derives a relationship of the SWR deviation from the unit with <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance</b> of window and error of coordinate. Relation analysis showed that the limiting values of tolerance and error drastically depend both on the initial value of SWR before matching, and on its final value after the installation of matching diaphragm. Both types of diaphragms are compared with each other. It is found that the inductive diaphragm is characterized by a greater <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance</b> of window than the capacitive one. The results of the work can be used in designing the microwave lines with high requirements for matching...|$|R
