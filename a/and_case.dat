5|$|Among {{the lighter}} metalloids, alloys with {{transition}} metals are well-represented. Boron can form intermetallic compounds and alloys with such metals {{of the composition}} MnB, if n > 2. Ferroboron (15% boron) is used to introduce boron into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys <b>and</b> <b>case</b> hardening compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, most importantly with the coinage metals.|$|E

His next famous case was Chudleigh's Case, a dispute over the interpretation of the Statute of Uses, followed by Slade's Case, a dispute between the Common Pleas and King's Bench over assumpsit now regarded as a classic example of the friction between the two courts and the forward movement of contract law; Coke's argument in Slade's Case formed the first definition of consideration.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} received by critics. Jeffrey Rosen, who reviewed {{the book for}} The New York Times, {{was surprised by the}} author's departure from traditional civil libertarian views. Rosen pointed out that Lewis did not support absolute protection for journalists from breaking confidentiality with their anonymous sources, even in situations involving criminal acts. Nat Hentoff called the book an engrossing and accessible survey of the First Amendment.

5|$|There {{have not}} been any {{controlled}} studies on meth mouth, and several of its aspects are unclear.

5|$|The Indian Act, various {{treaties}} <b>and</b> <b>case</b> {{laws were}} established to mediate relations between Europeans and native peoples. Most notably, {{a series of}} eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between the indigenous and the reigning Monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921. These treaties are agreements with the Canadian Crown-in-Council, administered by Canadian Aboriginal law, and overseen by the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Development. The role of the treaties and the rights they support were reaffirmed by Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982. These rights may include provision of services, such as health care, and exemption from taxation. The legal and policy framework within which Canada and First Nations operate was further formalized in 2005, through the First Nations–Federal Crown Political Accord.|$|E
