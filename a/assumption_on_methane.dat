40|$|The {{effects of}} {{essential}} oils (EO) and condensed tannin (CT) <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> production and fermentation were evaluated under in vitro conditions. Experiment one screened {{the effects of}} ten different EO at 500 mg/L of culture fluid <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> production in a 24 hr rumen batch culture. Based on the results from experiment one, four EO (clove oil (CLO), cinnamon oil (CNO), white thyme oil (WTO), and anise oil (ANO)) were selected and tested at three different dose levels (125, 250, and 500 mg/L of culture fluid) for their effects <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> production and fermentation in a 24 hr batch culture (experiment two). Methane production was significantly reduced with the four EO at the 500 mg/L dose but at 250 mg/L; only CLO and CNO reduced methane production. The reduction in methane production with the 500 mg/L dose was also associated with reductions in dry matter (DM) digestibility and total volatile fatty acids (VFA). In the third experiment, the effect of CT at 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 % of diet DM <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> production was also tested in a 24 hr batch culture. Results from this experiment showed no effect of CT <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> production although methane production tended to be lower at 7. 5 % CT. In conclusion, the reduction in methane production with EO most likely resulted from EO negative effects on DM digestibility and fermentation...|$|R

40|$|A Lean, Premixed, Prevaporized (LPP) {{combustion}} {{technology has}} been developed that converts liquid fuels into a substitute for natural gas. This fuel can then be burned with low emissions in virtually any combustion device in place of natural gas. This technology offers {{the possibility of using}} unprocessed oil-field Natural Gas Condensate (NGC) for local or export power generation using a DLN-equipped gas turbine rather than flaring, as is common practice in some regions. The ability to run a turbine on natural gas condensate with NOx and CO emissions comparable to those of natural gas has been demonstrated using a surrogate fuel made up from a mixture of naphtha (representing C 4 and greater) and methane (representing <C 4). The naphtha was vaporized using an LPP system, mixed with methane, and used to generate power in a 30 kW Capstone C 30 microturbine. The LPP Gas ™ was tailored to match the modified Wobbe Index (MWI) of methane.

40|$|The {{comparative}} {{and combined}} effects of nitric oxide (NO) and higher alkanes <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> oxidation were examined by experimentation and kinetic modeling. Experiments were conducted using fuel-lean, lower-alkanes mixtures with NO (0 - 400 ppm v/v) in an atmospheric flow reactor at residence time of 2 s over the temperature range of 820 - 950 K. NO {{was found to}} greatly promote methane conversion, and its sensitizing effect strengthened with the increasing concentration that {{was added to the}} system. The promoting effect of higher alkanes <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> conversion was also evident, particularly at zero or low NO concentrations. A strong dependency of the sensitizing effect on the concentration of higher alkanes present was also observed. The kinetic mechanism from Le Cong et al., performed reasonably well in reproducing the experimental trends. However, the sensitizing propensity of higher alkanes in the presence of NO could not be unambiguously ranked under all conditions. Modification to the kinetic mechanism of Le Cong et al., was attempted. Specifically, the submechanism of C(3) peroxy radicals was added, but the modeling results indicated a lower impact <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> conversion than was initially expected. The most sensitive reactions were revealed, and the generalized reaction pathways for methane oxidation sensitized by higher alkanes, with or without the presence of NO, were also proposed, following detailed sensitivity analysis...|$|R

However, if one also factors in the gains to society of the FEOGA budget rebates, then all losses disappear, and in fact net financial gains occur.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of fertiliser application <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> oxidation and nitrous oxide emissions. During this study a combination of 13 C-CH 4 and 15 N stable isotope techniques were applied to laboratory soil incubations and traditional gas flux methodologies were applied to culture incubations. It was found that fertiliser application rate and soil pH were major influences <b>on</b> both <b>methane</b> oxidation and nitrous oxide emissions from an arable soil. Profiles of the main nitrous oxide producing processes were obtained, and it was shown that nitrification was the predominant source of nitrous oxide from most aerobic soil incubations and that soil acidification greatly reduced nitrous oxide emissions from nitrification. Additionally denitrification was shown to not be restricted to anaerobic conditions. Similar profiles were obtained for 13 C soil incubations {{and the effect of}} increasing fertiliser concentrations <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> oxidation was determined. Methane oxidation was inhibited by fertiliser concentrations up to 20 g N m - 2. However, above 20 g N m - 2 inhibition declined and there was no apparent effect of increasing fertiliser concentration <b>on</b> <b>methane</b> oxidation. Culture incubations aimed to determine the contribution of methane oxidising bacteria to nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia oxidation. Ammonia oxidation was observed in all methylotrophic bacterial cultures. Nitrous oxide production was only observed in Methylomicrobium chloromethanicum and Methylocystis parvus and {{it was not possible to}} determine if this nitrous oxide was produced via ammonia oxidation, nitrate reduction or via the reduction of nitrite produced during ammonia oxidation, in a process similar to nitrifier denitrification that has been observed in autotrophic ammonia oxidising bacteria.
