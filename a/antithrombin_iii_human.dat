40|$|Heparin, {{located in}} mast cells and baso-philic granulocytes, {{is widely used}} as an anticoagulant. It belongs to a class of linear polysaccharides called glycosami-noglycans (GAGs). Using phage display technology, we have {{selected}} 19 unique human antiheparin antibodies. Some anti-bodies react almost exclusively with hep-arin, others also react with the structur-ally related heparan sulfate, and some with chondroitin sulfate. In all cases, sul-fate groups are essential for binding. For activity of some antibodies, O-sulfation {{is more important than}} N-sulfation. Antibod-ies are reactive with heparin in mast cells. Each antibody showed a defined staining pattern on cryosections of rat kidney, pancreas, and testis. Enzymatic diges-tion with glycosidases on tissue sections further indicated that the antibodies are specific for GAGs. All antibodies recog-nize a unique epitope. The effect of the antibodies on heparin as an anticoagu-lant was also studied. There were 3 anti-bodies that were very effective inhibitors of heparin action in the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) clotting as-say, and their effect was related to the amount of heparin bound. Some antibod-ies reacted strongly with the pentasaccha-ride, which interacts with <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III.</b> The <b>human</b> antibodies selected represent unique tools to study the structure, loca-tion, and function of heparin and related GAGs, and some may be used as block-ing agents.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} the thrombin inhibitory capacity of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> in the inflamed human joint.  METHODS—Thrombin inhibitory capacity was measured, using a kinetic spectophotometric method, in matched plasma and synovial fluid samples {{of patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (n= 22) and osteoarthritis (n= 16), together with normal control plasma samples (n= 13). In the same samples, the concentration of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> was also determined by the method of radial immunodiffusion. The combination of these measurements allowed the calculation of the specific thrombin inhibitory capacity of these samples.  RESULTS—An increased concentration of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> in rheumatoid compared with osteoarthritic synovial fluid was noted (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Heparin <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> binding was {{studied by}} crossed immunoelectrophoresis. In plasma and {{purified}} <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> standard, multicomponent patterns were obtained with low concentrations of mucosal heparin. There {{is evidence that}} <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> may bind more than one heparin molecule. At high heparin concentration (> 16 U/ml), single symmetrical peaks were obtained. Serum samples showed two <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> peaks due to a decreased heparin binding of the slower peak (2. 1 - 3. 9 times), which was probably antithrombin III-activated procoagulant complexes. Heparin analogue (A 73025) also bound <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> in vitro but the mobility of the peak was slower than with mucosal heparin and only a single peak was obtained in serum samples. Radioimmunoassay showed a decreased binding of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> antibody to heparin-antithrombin III complex.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{describe}} the clinical use of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> concentrate in 53 patients who were found, {{in the operating room}} before cardiopulmonary bypass, to be heparin resistant. Method: Resistance to heparin was determined to be present when greater than 600 U/kg body weight of heparin failed to prolong the kaolin-activated clotting time to more than 600 seconds in 53 aprotinin-treated patients. Blood samples were obtained for subsequent <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> activity determination. Patients were then administered 500 U of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> concentrate, and the activated clotting time was remeasured. If the activated clotting time remained less than 600 seconds, a second 500 -U dose was given. Results: Of the 53 patients, 45 (85 %) had subnormal measured <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> activity, and the mean plasma <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> activity level for the entire group was 67 % (normal 80 %- 120 %). Administration of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> concentrate (500 U in 45 patients and 1000 U in 8 patients) resulted in prolongation of the mean activated clotting time from 492 to 789 seconds without additional heparin. The mean heparin dose response increased from 36. 5 to 69. 3 s·U– 1 ·mL– 1 with <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> treatment. Only one patient did not achieve the target activated clotting time, despite administration of greater than 600 U/kg heparin and 1000 U of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> concentrate, and was treated with fresh-frozen plasma. Conclusions: On the basis of the criterion used in this report, most of the patients defined as being heparin resistant had subnormal plasma <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> activity. Treatment with <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> concentrate resulted in potentiation of the heparin effect to meet predetermined activated clotting time thresholds and allow for cardiopulmonary bypass...|$|R
40|$|Context: Activation of the {{coagulation}} {{system and}} depletion of endogenous anticoagulants are frequently found {{in patients with}} severe sepsis and septic shock. Diffuse microthrombus formation may induce organ dysfunction and lead to excess mortality in septic shock. <b>Antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> may provide protection from multiorgan failure and improve survival in severely ill patients. Objective: To determine if high-dose <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> (administered within 6 hours of onset) would provide a survival advantage in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Design and Setting: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial in patients with severe sepsis (the KyberSept Trial) was conducted from March 1997 through January 2000. Patients: A total of 2314 adult patients were randomized into 2 equal groups of 1157 to receive either intravenous <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> (30000 IU in total over 4 days) or a placebo (1 % human albumin). Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality 28 days after initiation of study medication. Results: Overall mortality at 28 days in the <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> treatment group was 38. 9 % vs 38. 7 % {{in the placebo group}} (P=. 94). Secondary end points, including mortality at 56 and 90 days and survival time in the intensive care unit, did not differ between the <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> and placebo groups. In the subgroup of patients who did not receive concomitant heparin during the 4 -day treatment phase (n= 698), the 28 -day mortality was nonsignificantly lower in the <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> group (37. 8 %) than in the placebo group (43. 6 %) (P=. 08). This trend became significant after 90 days (n= 686; 44. 9 % for <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> group vs 52. 5 % for placebo group; P=. 03). In patients receiving <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> and concomitant heparin, a significantly increased bleeding incidence was observed (23. 8 % for <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> group vs 13. 5 % for placebo group; P<. 001). Conclusions: High-dose <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> therapy had no effect on 28 -day all-cause mortality in adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock when administered within 6 hours after the onset. High-dose <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> was associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage when administered with heparin.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of innate immune activation granulocytes and macrophages produce hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid (HOCl) via secretion of myeloperoxidase (MPO) {{to the outside of}} the cells, where HOCl immediately reacts with proteins. Most proteins that become altered by this system do not belong to the invading microorganism but to the host. While {{there is no doubt that}} the myeloperoxidase system is capable of directly inactivating HIV- 1, we hypothesized that it may have an additional indirect mode of action. We show in this article that HOCl is able to chemically alter proteins and thus turn them into Idea-Ps (Idea-P = immune defence-altered protein), potent amyloid-like and SH-groups capturing antiviral weapons against HIV- 1. HOCl-altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) have the capacity to bind efficiently and with high affinity to the HIV- 1 envelope protein gp 120, and to its receptor CD 4 as well as to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Idea-PP was able to inhibit viral infection and replication in a cell culture system as shown by reduced number of infected cells and of syncytia, resulting in reduction of viral capsid protein p 24 in the culture supernatant.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various well-characterized heparin {{preparations}} on the inactivation of human Factor XIa by <b>human</b> <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> was studied. The heparin preparations used were unfractionated heparin and four heparin fractions obtained after anion-exchange chromatography. Inactivation of Factor XIa was monitored with S 2366 as chromogenic substrate and followed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics under all reaction conditions tested. Enhancement {{of the rate}} of inhibition of Factor XIa {{in the presence of}} unfractionated heparin correlated to the binding of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> to heparin. From the kinetic data a binding constant of 0. 1 microM was inferred. The maximum rate enhancement, achieved at saturating heparin concentrations, was 30 -fold. The rate enhancement achieved in the presence of each of the heparin fractions could also be correlated to the binding of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> to the heparin. The binding constant inferred from the kinetic data varied from 0. 10 to 0. 28 microM and the number of binding sites for <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> varied from 0. 06 to 0. 74 site per heparin molecule. The maximum rate enhancements, achieved at saturating heparin concentrations, were strongly dependent on the type of heparin used and varied from 7 -fold for fraction A to 41 -fold for fraction D. Therefore, although the stimulation of Factor XIa inactivation by <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> could be quantitatively correlated to the binding of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> to heparin, the heparin-catalysed inhibition of Factor XIa is dependent not only upon the degree of binding of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> to heparin but also upon the type of heparin to which <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> is bound...|$|R
50|$|Inhibition of Factor Xa {{prevents}} thrombin activation, thereby preventing clot formation. Thus, Factor Xa {{is used as}} both {{a direct}} and indirect target of several anticoagulant drugs. For example, the drug Fondaparinux is an indirect inhibitor of Factor Xa. Fondaparinux binds to <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> and activates the molecule for Factor Xa inhibition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> (AT III) is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor that inhibits thrombin and the activated forms of factors X, VII, IX, XI and XII. Transgenic expression of therapeutic proteins in animal systems has gradually matured from laboratory scale to industrial practice, demanding efficient and scalable purification processes. The purification and characterization of recombinant <b>human</b> <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> (rhAT III) from transgenic goat milk are described here...|$|R
40|$|Patients with fulminant hepatic failure {{have severe}} circulatory {{disturbances}} {{which may be}} due to fibrin and cellular plugs in micro-vessels which are a consequence of intravascular coagulation and which can lead to multiorgan failure. Since <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> supplementation {{has been shown to be}} beneficial in animal models of septic shock with disseminated intravascular coagulation, a controlled study was performed to investigate the effect of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> supplementation in fulminant hepatic failure. Twenty-five patients in grade III or IV coma were selected on the basis of evidence of sepsis, intravascular coagulation and a high risk of developing multiorgan failure. Thirteen patients received 3000 units of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> (Kybernin P; Behringwerke), followed by a further 1000 units every 6 h. <b>Antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> activity increased from 0. 26 +/- 0. 04 SE U/ml to 0. 82 +/- 0. 07 U/ml at 3 h post infusion (normal range 0. 80 - 1. 20 U/ml) and remained greater than 0. 80 U/ml throughout the study without any apparent increase in the frequency of bleeding. However, survival was not improved and markers of intravascular coagulation remained similar between the two groups. Thus, although the <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> deficiency in fulminant hepatic failure can be corrected by supplementation with <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> concentrate, its use in the prevention of intravascular coagulation and to avoid microvessel plugging needs to be studied at an earlier stage in the disease...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> {{deficiency}} (abbreviated ATIII deficiency) is a [...] of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III.</b> It {{is a rare}} hereditary {{disorder that}} generally comes to light when a patient suffers recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and repetitive intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). Inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, though a few recessive cases have been noted.|$|R
40|$|<b>Antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} inhibitor of coagulation proteinases such as thrombin and factor Xa. Inherited deficiency of <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> is a well recognised risk factor for the early development of venous thromboembolism. The gene for <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> is located at chromosome 1 q 23 - 25 and its structural organisation has been described. A database of mutations of the <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III</b> gene has been compiled and a recent update lists 184 entries. These entries are listed according to subtype of deficiency and to nucleotide sequence number. There are 68 reports of type I 'classical' and 116 reports of type II 'variant' deficiencies. This summary considers the entries {{in terms of the number}} of unique molecular events, the nature of the genetic defects and the role of CpG dinucleotides in deficiency. Sample listings of type I and II deficiency entries are provided...|$|R
