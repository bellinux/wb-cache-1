5|$|Investigators {{also found}} that the deicing {{procedures}} at LaGuardia were substandard. While the jet encountered a delay of up to 35 minutes, they found that the deicing fluid that was being used <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport,</b> <b>and</b> by the majority of commercial airlines across the United States, was effective for only fifteen minutes. The accident led to a number of studies into the effect that ice has on aircraft, and several recommendations into prevention techniques.|$|E

In September 1948, Blamey {{paid a visit to}} Japan, where he was warmly greeted on arrival at Iwakuni by Horace Robertson, the commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, who also provided an RAAF honour guard. MacArthur sent his own aircraft, the Bataan, to collect Blamey and bring him to Tokyo, where he met Blamey <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>and</b> gave him another warm greeting. In the late 1940s Blamey became involved with The Association, an organisation similar to the earlier League of National Security, which was established to counter a possible communist coup.

5|$|September 28, 2004- The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Jeanne, combined with two cold fronts, produce heavy rainfall peaking at 8.01inches (203mm) in Newark. The precipitation leads to rising rivers, including the Red Clay Creek which crests at 13.59feet (4.14m) The rainfall also floods {{roads in the}} northern portion of the state, resulting in trapped vehicles. The {{remnants of}} Jeanne also spawn an F2 tornado in northern New Castle County. The tornado's 5mile (8km) path includes moving through the New Castle Airport and several buildings. The tornado damages numerous planes and buildings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>and</b> injures five people. Damage totals to around $1million (2004USD).|$|E
5|$|The Abbot-Emeritus of the Abbey of New Clairvaux, Fr.Thomas X.Davis, OCSO, {{first saw}} the stones and pictured them {{reassembled}} as a monastery on September 15, 1955—his first day in California.

The monastery belonged to Trappists of the order known as Cistercians of the Strict Observance. The monks farmed and worshiped on land once used by Leland Stanford to grow wine grapes. Davis's superior met him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>and</b> drove him through Golden Gate Park where he stopped to show Davis the stones sitting among the weeds. From time to time in subsequent years, Davis inspected the stones only to find them in increasingly poor condition.|$|E

A 1986 study from the Puget Sound Council of Governments and Metro recommended {{the construction of a}} light rail system between Federal Way and Lynnwood serving the airport and Downtown Seattle. A regional transit authority (RTA) was formed in the early 1990s to study a regional light rail system, first proposing a $6.7 billion plan in 1995 with service to Sea-Tac Airport via International Boulevard. The proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, leading to a smaller, $3.9 billion proposal approved by voters the following year, with stations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>and</b> South 200th Street.|$|E

5|$|The SASR {{played a}} key role in the Australian-led {{international}} peacekeeping force (INTERFET) in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. In the days prior to the commencement of INTERFET, the SASR was involved in the RAAF evacuation of United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) staff, Australians and refugees from East Timor following increasing violence by Indonesian military-backed militia after the East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. The SASR subsequently provided the initial INTERFET forces to secure the point of entry <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>and</b> seaport in Dili. 3 Squadron, along with Allied Special Forces elements from the NZ SAS and British SBS, formed INTERFET's special forces element, known as Response Force (RESPFOR). The SASR spearheaded most operations conducted by the international force during the early days of the intervention in East Timor and, as in Vietnam, served as the eyes and ears of the force, patrolling extensively through militia-controlled areas in vehicles and on foot as INTERFET expanded to take control of the rest of East Timor. It was involved in a number of significant contacts with pro-Indonesian militia, including at Suai on 6 October 1999 during which two SASR soldiers were wounded, and later at Aidabasalala on 16 October 1999. On 22 October 1999, the SASR conducted a combined air insertion in Black Hawk helicopters and an amphibious landing from HMAS Brunei into the Oecusse Enclave to secure the beachhead ahead of an amphibious assault by the main force, after the insertion of Navy Clearance Divers by submarine the previous night to conduct a reconnaissance and survey of the amphibious landing site. It was reported that the SASR also conducted covert patrols in the Enclave before the landings. Other tasks included VIP protection and other special forces tasks as required by the task force commander. 3 Squadron was later awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation on 25 March 2000. 1 Squadron replaced 3 Squadron in December 1999, and completed its tour in February 2000.|$|E
