25|$|Risk is the {{likelihood}} that something bad will happen that causes harm to an informational asset (or {{the loss of the}} <b>asset).</b> <b>A</b> vulnerability is a weakness {{that could be used to}} endanger or cause harm to an informational <b>asset.</b> <b>A</b> threat is anything (man-made or act of nature) that has the potential to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|Forwards do {{not have}} a standard. They may transact only on the {{settlement}} date. More typical would be for the parties to agree to true up, for example, every quarter. The fact that forwards are not margined daily means that, due to movements in the price of the underlying <b>asset,</b> <b>a</b> large differential can build up between the forward's delivery price and the settlement price, and in any event, an unrealized gain (loss) can build up.|$|E
25|$|Once an asset's {{expected}} return, , {{is calculated}} using CAPM, the future cash flows of the asset can be discounted to their present value using this rate {{to establish the}} correct price for the <b>asset.</b> <b>A</b> riskier stock will have a higher beta and will be discounted at a higher rate; less sensitive stocks will have lower betas and be discounted at a lower rate. In theory, an asset is correctly priced when its observed price {{is the same as}} its value calculated using the CAPM derived discount rate. If the observed price is higher than the valuation, then the asset is overvalued; it is undervalued for a too low price.|$|E

25|$|Whenever possible, Mongol commanders {{found the}} highest ground available, {{from which they}} could make {{tactical}} decisions based on the best view of the battlefield as events unfolded. Furthermore, being on high ground allowed their forces to observe commands conveyed by flags more easily than if the ground were level. In addition, keeping the high command on high ground made them easier to defend. Unlike the European armies, which placed enormous emphasis on personal valor, and thus exposed their leaders to death from anyone bold enough to kill them, the Mongols regarded their leaders as a vital <b>asset.</b> <b>A</b> general such as Subutai, unable to ride a horse in the later part of his career due to age and obesity, would have been ridiculed out of most any European army of the time.

After the ICA is reformed, 47 is tasked by his new handler, Benjamin Travis, a high level official within the ICA, to kill Diana for her betrayal and retrieve an important Agency <b>asset,</b> <b>a</b> teenage girl named Victoria, from her mansion in Chicago. 47 sneaks into her mansion and shoots Diana, but rather than finishing her off, 47 comforts his dying friend and asks her why she betrayed the ICA. Diana discovered Victoria was genetically-engineered to become an assassin for the ICA, and not wishing to see Victoria suffer the same fate as 47 she betrayed the ICA and escaped with her. As Diana's final request, 47 agrees to protect Victoria, for which Travis brands him a traitor.|$|E
25|$|The ETF {{tracking}} error {{is the difference}} between the returns of the ETF and its reference index or <b>asset.</b> <b>A</b> non-zero {{tracking error}} therefore represents a failure to replicate the reference as stated in the ETF prospectus. The tracking error is computed based on the prevailing price of the ETF and its reference. It is different than the premium/discount which {{is the difference between}} the ETF’s NAV (updated only once a day) and its market price. Tracking errors are more significant when the ETF provider uses strategies other than full replication of the underlying index. Some of the most liquid equity ETFs tend to have better tracking performance because the underlying is also sufficiently liquid, allowing for full replication. In contrast, some ETFs, such as commodities ETFs and their leveraged ETFs, do not necessarily employ full replication because the physical assets cannot be stored easily or used to create a leveraged exposure, or the reference asset or index is illiquid. Futures-based ETFs may also suffer from negative roll yields, as seen in the VIX futures market.|$|E

The Tom Hooper-directed film focused on Clough's disastrous 44-day tenure {{as manager of}} Leeds United and marked Sheen's fifth collaboration with writer Peter Morgan. The actor has said Clough is the real-life character he enjoyed playing most. The Guardian, writing in 2009, declared it the [...] "best performance of his big-screen career" [...] while The Times found him [...] "magnificent". USA Today praised [...] "Sheen's masterful performance" [...] while the Los Angeles Times felt he played the role with [...] "a cheeky, dark panache" [...] and [...] "skillful verve". Entertainment Weekly asserted that, despite American audiences' unfamiliarity with Clough, [...] "what's lost in translation is recovered easily enough in Michael Sheen's astonishing performance". Variety noted that his [...] "typically scrupulous channeling of Clough gets the tics and mannerisms right, but also carves a moving portrait of a braggart suddenly out of his depth". Also in 2009, Sheen reprised {{his role as a}} werewolf in , a prequel to the original film. Of his decision to take part, Sheen has said: [...] "My rule of thumb is that I want to do things I'd like to go and see myself." [...] The New York Times felt he was [...] "the movie's greatest <b>asset</b> ... <b>a</b> lively break from his usual high-crust duties to bring wit, actual acting and some unexpected musculature to the goth-horror flick". Variety said he hit [...] "all the right notes in a star-powered performance that will amuse, if not amaze, anyone who only knows the actor as Tony Blair or David Frost" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time noted that he [...] "tries bravely to keep a straight face" ...|$|E

2500|$|In finance, a futures {{contract}} (more colloquially, futures) is a standardized forward contract, a legal agreement {{to buy or}} sell [...] something at a predetermined price at a specified time [...] in the future. The asset transacted is usually a commodity or financial instrument and the transaction is usually done on the trading floor of a futures exchange. [...] The predetermined price the parties agree to buy and sell the asset for [...] is known as the forward price. The specified time in the future -- which is when delivery and payment occur -- is known as the delivery date. Because it is a function of an underlying <b>asset,</b> <b>a</b> {{futures contract}} is a derivative product.|$|E
2500|$|When {{dealing with}} one's own business, one must set up various {{accounts}} to record all transactions {{that may take}} place. When {{the owner of a}} business refers to their bank account, they are referring to the business's account, not to their personal account. In addition, all accounts referred to in bookkeeping belong to the business, not to other businesses, regardless of their title. For instance, if a business expects to receive money from another person or company and the account is labelled [...] "Receivable A", this does not imply that the account in question belongs to [...] "Receivable A". [...] It is merely a recording of a current <b>asset</b> (<b>a</b> receivable) of one's own business. Therefore, when assessing any transaction, the transaction is {{from the point of view}} of one's own business or the business in question.|$|E
2500|$|In mathematics, a {{negative}} number {{is a real}} number that is less than zero. [...] Negative numbers represent opposites. [...] If positive represents movement to the right, negative represents movement to the left. [...] If positive represents above sea level, then negative represents below level. [...] If positive represents a deposit, negative represents a withdrawal. [...] They are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency. [...] A debt that is owed may {{be thought of as}} {{a negative}} <b>asset,</b> <b>a</b> decrease in some quantity may {{be thought of as a}} negative increase. [...] If a quantity may have either of two opposite senses, then one may choose to distinguish between those senses—perhaps arbitrarily—as positive and negative. [...] In the medical context of fighting a tumor, an expansion could be thought of as a negative shrinkage. [...] Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero, such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales for temperature. [...] The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic. [...] For example, − − 3 = 3 because the opposite of an opposite is the original thing.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{beneficiaries}} of a trust, or those owed fiduciary duties, will ordinarily wish to sue trustees first for breach of obligations, the trustee may have disappeared, or become insolvent, {{or perhaps the}} beneficiaries will desire to have a specific asset returned. In all these situations, the law allows a limited remedy if a person that received trust property is not [...] "equity's darling": the [...] "bona fide purchaser" [...] of the <b>asset.</b> <b>A</b> bona fide purchaser of property, even if property is received after a breach of trust, has long been held to take free of any claims by prior owners, if they acted in good faith, committed no wrong, and they have paid for the property. When the value in assets is traced, this process is technically said to be [...] "genuinely neutral as to the rights" [...] a claimant may have. Only if recipients have committed additional wrongs, through some form of negligence, knowledge or dishonesty, will they liable, with a good claim {{at the end of}} the tracing process. However, the law is unsettled on what is needed, and divides between a traditional common law or equity approach, on the one hand, and a more modern unjust enrichment and tort law analysis on the other hand. In all cases, however, the recipient must have received property for their [...] "own use and benefit". This means that in cases where solicitors, and potentially banks, or other parties that merely act as conduits, that receive money simply to pass it onto someone else, they have not been regarded as a liable recipient.|$|E
