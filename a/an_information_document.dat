40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of a decision-making aid with <b>an</b> <b>information</b> <b>document</b> from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) with regard to decisions about hormone replacement therapy (HRT). DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Quebec city region. PARTICIPANTS: Menopausal Francophone women 45 to 69 years old. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were given a manual and an audiocassette describing a six-step approach to making a decision about HRT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Amount of anxiety over the decision (main outcome), general knowledge of {{the risks and benefits}} of HRT, personal expectations and values concerning these risks and benefits, and women's views on HRT. RESULTS: Anxiety levels were significantly reduced in both groups, but the difference between the effectiveness of the two interventions was not significant (P =. 77). Percentages of women whose general knowledge increased and of women with realistic expectations were significantly higher in the experimental group (P <. 003 and P <. 0001, respectively). Congruence between personal values and decisions about HRT increased significantly more in the experimental group (P < or =. 003). CONCLUSION: The six-step approach to decision making was more helpful than the SOGC's information document in increasing subjects' knowledge of the risks and benefits of HRT, in creating more realistic expectations of HRT, and in increasing the congruence between subjects' personal values and their decisions on HRT...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hearing loss {{among young}} adults {{is on the}} {{increase}} largely because of greater exposure to recreational noise.

The reasons for this are unclear; neither {{is the extent to which}} tinnitus is experienced in this population. Objectives: The study aimed to describe the awareness and experience of tinnitus among young adults, with regard to its existence, causes, effects and management. Methods: A descriptive study design was employed using an electronic survey that targeted students within a selected school at a university in KwaZulu-Natal. There were 75 participants between 18 years and 30 years. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. To raise awareness about tinnitus, on completion of the questionnaire, all participants were given access to <b>an</b> <b>information</b> <b>document</b> about tinnitus, its causes and management. Results: The majority of participants (69. 86 %) were not aware of the existence of tinnitus. Thus, most of the participants did not know about the causes or effects of tinnitus. Tinnitus was experienced by 13. 51 % of participants themselves and 12. 16 % knew someone who suffered from it. Conclusions: The general lack of awareness of what tinnitus was, its causes and effects, has implications for audiologists who are involved in hearing health care across the age span. Hearing health promotion programmes targeted at young adults should include information on hearing loss as well as tinnitus and its management. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{prepared}} as {{a contribution to}} analysis and discussion surrounding {{the development of an}} international regime on access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing under the Convention on Biological Diversity (Decision VII/ 19). The paper provides a review and assessment of the implications of trends in relation to genomics, proteomics and biotechnology for the development of an international regime. The results of the review are also relevant to the ongoing work of the WIPO Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore, the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, and other relevant bodies. It is divided into two sections. Section I examines the challenges and potential opportunities represented by the growth of bioinformatics and international electronic transfers of genetic data for the development of an international regime. The review reveals {{that by the end of}} 2003 the international DNA sequence depositary known as GenBank contained 30, 968, 418 DNA sequences from an estimated 130, 000 organisms. The review concludes that further attention could be paid to the potential of bioinformatics and "open source" models to provide alternative forms of benefit-sharing directed towards conservation and development objectives and the cost-effective regulation of biopiracy. However, the relevance of bioinformatics to the needs of developing countries and substantive issues surrounding the human rights and ethical dimensions of bioinformatics merit careful analysis and evaluation. Section II considers the challenges involved in tracking intellectual property claims in relation to genetic material on the global level. The review presents the results of a search of available patent publications from 73 national patent offices, four regional patent offices, and WIPO contained within the European Patent Office esp@cenet worldwide database between 1990 and 2003 using a working definition of biotechnology developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This is followed by a detailed analysis of the implications of patent claims arising from the sequencing of the rice genome. The paper concludes by considering the wider implications of patent activity for the international regime.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Shoulder {{dysfunction}} {{is common}} and pathology of the rotator cuff tendons and subacromial bursa {{are considered to}} be a major cause of pain and morbidity. Although many hypotheses exist there is no definitive understanding as to the origin of the pain arising from these structures. Research investigations from other tendons have placed intra-tendinous neovascularity as a potential mechanism of pain production.

As such the primary aim of this pilot study was to investigate if neovascularity could be identified and to determine the prevalence of neovascularity in the rotator cuff tendons and subacromial bursa in subjects with unilateral shoulder pain clinically assessed to be rotator cuff tendinopathy. The secondary aims were to investigate the association between the presence of neovascularity and pain, duration of symptoms, and, neovascularity and shoulder function.

The ultrasound scans were performed by one of two radiologists who recorded their findings and the final assessment was made by a third radiologist blinded both to the clinical examination and the ultrasound examination.
