50|$|The Strowger switch uses two telegraph-type keys on a {{telephone}} set for dialing. Each key requires a separate wire to the exchange. The keys are tapped to step the switch in two stages. The {{first set of}} incoming pulses raises the <b>armature</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electromagnet</b> to move a shaft which selects the desired level of contacts, by engaging a pawl with the upper ratchet. Another pawl, pivoting on the frame, holds the shaft at that height as it rotates. The second set of pulses, from the second key, operates another electromagnet. Its pawl engages the (hidden) vertical teeth in the lower ratchet to rotate the shaft to the required position. It is kept there against spring tension by a pawl pivoted on the frame. When the switch returns to its home position, typically when a call is complete, a release magnet disengages the pawls that hold the shaft in position. An interlock ensures that the spring on the shaft rotates it to angular home position before it drops to its home position by gravity.|$|E

Introduction The optimization of the shape <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electromagnet</b> is one <b>of</b> the classical problems in shape optimization which has been considered by several authors (see [3], [1] and the references therein).

40|$|Time and the {{stopping}} {{distance of the}} electric drive with frequent starting-and-braking modes that contain embedded asynchronous motor with a recessed combined braking device depend on the moment <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electromagnet</b> disinhibition. At the same time other important criteria are taken into the account, i. e. wear resistance of the brake device and the smoothness of the deceleration of the electric drive. In general such an asynchronous motor contains asynchronous engine with squirrel-cage rotor, electromechanical normally-closed brake, electromagnetical slip clutch and control circuit. The mechanical characteristics of the deceleration of asynchronous motor with recessed combined brake device at different moments <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electromagnet</b> disinhibition are presented.  The mathematical model is featured and the transients in such a motor are presented.  Formation models for computer research were {{carried out in the}} Fortran 2008 programming language. Calculation of the system of differential equations was fulfilled by the Runge – Kutta method. The deceleration of the electromechanical brake at various speeds caused different time values and {{stopping distance}}s. The plots of stopping distance and the braking time at various moments <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electromagnet</b> disinhibition are demonstrated.  The optimum moment <b>of</b> switching on <b>an</b> electromechanical brake, providing small stopping distance and the braking time is the time when the speed wвкл = 0, 6 – 0, 8 of the nominal. In this case the acceptable number of brake applications for friction linings (compared with mechanical braking) will increase by 1. 6 – 2. 8 times.
