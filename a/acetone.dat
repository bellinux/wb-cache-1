5|$|In the 16th-century German alchemist Andreas Libavius {{described}} {{the production of}} <b>acetone</b> from the dry distillation of lead acetate, ketonic decarboxylation. The presence of water in vinegar has such {{a profound effect on}} acetic acid's properties that for centuries chemists believed that glacial acetic acid and the acid found in vinegar were two different substances. French chemist Pierre Adet proved them identical.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketone bodies}} are {{possibly}} anticonvulsant in themselves; in animal models, acetoacetate and <b>acetone</b> protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism {{that increase the}} energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, {{and the number of}} mitochondria is increased. This may help the neurons to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a neuroprotective effect.|$|E
5|$|With a {{molecular}} formula of C3H4Cl2F2O and a condensed structural formula of CHCl2CF2OCH3, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for methoxyflurane is 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-1-methoxyethane. It is a halogenated ether {{in form of}} a clear, colorless liquid, and its vapor has a strong fruity aroma. It is miscible with ethanol, <b>acetone,</b> chloroform, diethyl ether, and fixed oils. It is soluble in rubber.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to <b>acetone.</b> In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E
5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding {{the surface of the}} coal ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then <b>acetone,</b> are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and <b>acetone</b> (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as {{the major source of}} fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell's mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this for fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and <b>acetone.</b> These ketone bodies enter the brain and substitute for glucose. Medium-chain fatty acids octonoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetone</b> is {{produced}} as a by-product. Compared to most other processes, the cumene process uses relatively mild synthesis conditions, and relatively inexpensive raw materials. However, to operate economically, {{there must be}} demand for both phenol, and the <b>acetone</b> by-product. In 2010, worldwide demand for <b>acetone</b> was approximately 6.7 million tonnes, 83 percent of which was satisfied with <b>acetone</b> produced by the cumene process.|$|E
25|$|Nail polish remover has {{the ability}} to enter bodies of water and soil after {{entering}} landfills or by precipitation, such as rain or snow. However, due to acetone's high volatility, most of it that enters the bodies of water and soil will evaporate again and re-enter the atmosphere. Not all of the <b>acetone</b> molecules will evaporate again, and so, when <b>acetone</b> remains in the bodies of water or soil, a reaction will occur. Nail polish remover evaporates easily because acetone's intermolecular forces are weak. An <b>acetone</b> molecule can't attract other <b>acetone</b> molecules easily because its hydrogens are not slightly positive. The only force that holds <b>acetone</b> molecules together is its permanent dipoles which are weaker than hydrogen bonds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetone</b> {{peroxide}} is {{an organic}} peroxide and a primary high explosive. It {{is produced by}} the oxidation of <b>acetone</b> to yield a mixture of linear monomer and cyclic dimer, trimer, and tetramer forms. The trimer is known as triacetone triperoxide (TATP) or tri-cyclic <b>acetone</b> peroxide (TCAP). <b>Acetone</b> peroxide {{takes the form of}} a white crystalline powder with a distinctive bleach-like odor and can explode if subjected to heat, friction, or shock. As a non-nitrogenous explosive, TATP has historically been more difficult to detect, and it has been used as an explosive in several terrorist attacks since 2001.|$|E
25|$|Some {{natural and}} {{volatile}} interfering compounds do exist, however. For example, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{has found that}} dieters and diabetics may have <b>acetone</b> levels hundreds or even thousands of times higher than those in others. <b>Acetone</b> {{is one of the}} many substances that can be falsely identified as ethyl alcohol by some breath machines. However, fuel cell based systems are non-responsive to substances like <b>acetone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{nail polish}} remover is a solvent, it will {{dissolve}} in water. When <b>acetone</b> dissolves in water, it hydrogen bonds with water. The more nail polish remover that enters the hydrosphere {{will increase the}} concentration of <b>acetone</b> and then increase the concentration of the solution created when <b>acetone</b> and water bonds. If enough nail polish remover is disposed, it can reach the lethal dose level for aquatic life.|$|E
25|$|Crude <b>acetone</b> is {{hydrogenated}} in {{the liquid}} phase over Raney nickel or {{a mixture of}} copper and chromium oxide to give isopropyl alcohol. This process is useful when coupled with excess <b>acetone</b> production, such as the cumene process.|$|E
25|$|Nail polish remover {{can also}} enter the {{lithosphere}} by landfills and by precipitation. However, {{it will not}} bind to the soil. Microorganisms in the soil will decompose <b>acetone.</b> The consequence of microorganisms decomposing <b>acetone</b> is the risk it has to cause oxygen depletion in bodies of water. The more <b>acetone</b> readily available for microorganism decomposition leads to more microorganisms reproduced and thus oxygen depletion because more microorganisms use up the available oxygen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetone</b> {{peroxide}} (specifically, triacetone triperoxide) {{was discovered}} in 1895 by Richard Wolffenstein.|$|E
25|$|The word ketone {{is derived}} from Aketon, an old German word for <b>acetone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Weizmann lectured in {{chemistry}} at the University of Geneva between 1901 and 1903, and later {{taught at the}} University of Manchester. He became a British subject in 1910, and while a lecturer in Manchester he became known for discovering how to use bacterial fermentation to produce large quantities of desired substances. He {{is considered to be}} the father of industrial fermentation. He used the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum (the Weizmann organism) to produce <b>acetone.</b> <b>Acetone</b> was used in the manufacture of cordite explosive propellants critical to the Allied war effort (see Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath). Weizmann transferred the rights to the manufacture of <b>acetone</b> to the Commercial Solvents Corporation in exchange for royalties.|$|E
25|$|SalvinorinA is soluble {{in organic}} {{solvents}} such as ethanol and <b>acetone,</b> but not especially so in water.|$|E
25|$|Eugène Soubeiran {{obtained}} the compound by {{the action of}} chlorine bleach on both ethanol and <b>acetone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arthur M. Hillery got {{a patent}} in 1945. Arthur M. Hillery {{suggested}} {{the use of}} <b>acetone</b> as working fluid.|$|E
25|$|However acetyl-CoA can be {{converted}} to acetoacetate, which can decarboxylate to <b>acetone</b> (either spontaneously, or by acetoacetate decarboxylase). It can then be further metabolized to isopropanol which is excreted in breath/urine, or by CYP2E1 into hydroxyacetone (acetol). Acetol can {{be converted}} to propylene glycol. This converts to formate and acetate (the latter converting to glucose), or pyruvate (by two alternative enzymes), or propionaldehyde, or to L-lactaldehyde then L-lactate (the common lactate isomer). Another pathway turns acetol to methylglyoxal, then to pyruvate, or to D-lactaldehyde (via S-D-lactoyl-glutathione or otherwise) then D-lactate. D-lactate metabolism (to glucose) is slow or impaired in humans, so most of the D-lactate is excreted in the urine; thus D-lactate derived from <b>acetone</b> can contribute significantly to the metabolic acidosis associated with ketosis or isopropanol intoxication. L-Lactate can complete the net conversion of fatty acids into glucose. The first experiment to show conversion of <b>acetone</b> to glucose was carried out in 1951. This, and further experiments used carbon isotopic labelling. Up to 11% of the glucose can be derived from <b>acetone</b> during starvation in humans.|$|E
25|$|Extractive {{distillation}} {{is similar}} to azeotropic distillation, except {{in this case the}} entrainer is less volatile than any of the azeotrope's constituents. For example, the azeotrope of 20% <b>acetone</b> with 80% chloroform can be broken by adding water and distilling the result. The water forms a separate layer in which the <b>acetone</b> preferentially dissolves. The result is that the distillate is richer in chloroform than the original azeotrope.|$|E
25|$|Dehydration – or {{replacement}} {{of water with}} organic solvents such as ethanol or <b>acetone,</b> followed by critical point drying or infiltration with embedding resins. Also freeze drying.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol) {{are obtained}} by hydrogenating over a catalyst (e.g., Raney nickel) the corresponding ketones (e.g., <b>acetone,</b> methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone).|$|E
25|$|Some {{printable}} polymers such as ABS, {{allow the}} surface finish to be smoothed and improved using chemical vapor processes based on <b>acetone</b> or similar solvents.|$|E
25|$|Isopropyl {{alcohol is}} {{oxidized}} to form <b>acetone</b> by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver, but has occasionally been abused by alcoholics, {{leading to a}} range of adverse health effects.|$|E
25|$|Energy Environment International {{developed}} {{a method for}} producing butanol from biomass, which {{involves the use of}} two separate micro-organisms in sequence to minimize production of <b>acetone</b> and ethanol byproducts.|$|E
25|$|In semibullvalene (C8H8), one {{ethylene}} arm {{is replaced}} by a single bond. The compound was first prepared by photolysis of barrelene in isopentane with <b>acetone</b> as a photosensitizer in 1966.|$|E
25|$|More than 1/7 the {{capacity}} of the cylinder should not be used per hour. This causes the <b>acetone</b> inside the acetylene cylinder {{to come out of the}} cylinder and contaminate the hose and possibly the torch.|$|E
25|$|Aldol {{condensation}} of <b>acetone</b> and {{ethyl acetoacetate}} gave β-keto-ester 3. A Grignard reaction involving methylmagnesium bromide provided alcohol 4, which {{was subjected to}} acid catalyzed elimination to give diene 5. Reduction and acylation gave diene 7 (Scheme 3, compound 1).|$|E
25|$|In 1994, 1.5 {{million tonnes}} of {{isopropyl}} alcohol {{was produced in}} the United States, Europe, and Japan. This compound is primarily produced by combining water and propene in a hydration reaction. It is also produced by hydrogenating <b>acetone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine that is {{structurally}} {{related to}} loxapine. It is slightly soluble in water, soluble in <b>acetone,</b> and highly soluble in chloroform. Its {{solubility in water}} is 188.9mg/L (25°C). Its manufacturer, Novartis, claims a solubility of <0.01% in water (<100nbsp&mg/L).|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Standard Oil first {{produced}} {{isopropyl alcohol}} by hydrating propene. Its major {{use at the}} time was not rubbing alcohol but for oxidation to <b>acetone,</b> whose first major use was in World War One for the preparation of the smokeless propellant, cordite.|$|E
25|$|The {{plotters}} {{planned to}} use peroxide-based liquid explosives, the Metropolitan Police said that the plot involved <b>acetone</b> peroxide, (TATP), which is sensitive to heat, shock, and friction, and can be initiated with fire or an electrical charge, and {{can also be used}} to produce improvised detonators.|$|E
25|$|Beginning around June 2009, {{he began}} looking for {{ingredients}} to make bombs. He conducted several internet searches for hydrochloric acid. He made some <b>acetone</b> peroxide {{for use as a}} detonator. He went to New York, where he reportedly had planning sessions with other conspirators.|$|E
