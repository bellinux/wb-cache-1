All these <b>access</b> <b>schemes</b> were designed at CNUCE, where the simulation tool used for the comparison was also developed. FODA/IBEA was developed and tested on several satellites (Olympus, Eutelsat and Italsat), and used in a project of LAN interconnection (1). The two distributed control <b>access</b> <b>schemes</b> have been studied and simulated to analyse the behaviour of the capacity assignment algorithm, while the recovery procedures needed for the network stability are presented in [6] and [7].

These three scheduling <b>access</b> <b>schemes</b> assist to allocate slots to heterogeneous nature of a patient’s data. The nature of patient’s data is divided into three classes as aforementioned. However, the classifications of a patient’s data into three classes are not justifiable because these classifications do not discuss low and high threshold values of vital signs and delay-sensitive data. In fact, the existing literature classifies the patient’s data into four to five classes [25, 30].
