5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst,</b> using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E

25|$|While {{this may}} be true, trying to {{separate}} Haq's actions from {{the larger context of}} the war on terrorism is tunnel vision <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst.</b> It is not just hate that motivates such acts, but ideology. One needn't be a bona fide member of an Islamic terrorist group to share their outlook.|$|E

25|$|This {{reaction}} is <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst</b> when the urea solution is heated at low pressure, which {{happens when the}} solution is concentrated for prilling or granulation (see below). The reaction products mostly volatilize into the overhead vapours, and recombine when these condense to form urea again, which contaminates the process condensate.|$|E

At other times there were long periods of peace and prosperity.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of affairs for Parliament was perhaps <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst</b> in January. The Royalist successes of November and December, the ever-present dread of foreign intervention, and {{the burden of}} new taxation—which Parliament now felt compelled to impose—disheartened its supporters. Disorder broke out in London, and, while the more determined of the rebels {{began to think of}} calling in the military assistance of the Scots, the majority were for peace on any conditions.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} day 190,000 {{vehicles}} moved into or within the zone during charging hours, a decrease of around 25% on normal traffic levels, partly due to it also being the half-term school holiday. A report from the Bow Group stated that historically, London congestion is <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst</b> during the morning rush hour, and that {{the early days of}} congestion charging had little impact on that critical time, the main effect occurring after 11am. Just over 100,000 motorists paid the charge personally, 15–20,000 were fleet vehicles paying under fleet arrangements, and it was believed around 10,000 liable motorists did not pay the due charge.|$|E
25|$|He was apprenticed {{for short}} periods to several medical practitioners: at 13 to his {{brother-in-law}} John Cooke in Coventry, who passed him on to Thomas Chandler, notable for his experiments using mesmerism for medical purposes. Chandler's practice was in London's Rotherhithe amidst the squalor endured by the Dickensian poor. Here Thomas would have seen poverty, crime and rampant disease <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst.</b> Next, another brother-in-law took him on: John Salt, his eldest sister's husband. Now 16, Huxley entered Sydenham College (behind University College Hospital), a cut-price anatomy school whose founder, Marshall Hall, discovered the reflex arc. All this time Huxley continued his programme of reading, which {{more than made up}} for his lack of formal schooling.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, WNEW {{became more}} of an adult {{contemporary}} radio station, mixing in very few pop standards. Williams stated that the {{during the period from}} 1965 to 1978, WNEW was <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst,</b> but finally came to its senses. By then, the Make Believe Ballroom title was dropped from Williams' show, although he continued to host in the late morning and early afternoon. In the fall of 1979, much to Williams' happiness, WNEW began restoring the standards format on weekends, middays, and late nights, leading off with a revived Make Believe Ballroom on October 6. In January 1981, WNEW dropped the adult contemporary format (which by then was only heard on weekday mornings and late afternoons) altogether, adopting the standards format full-time.|$|E

25|$|The burgeoning {{population}} of Salt Lake City {{and the surrounding}} metropolitan area, combined with its geographical situation, has led to air quality becoming a top concern for the populace. The Wasatch Front is subject to strong temperature inversions during the winter, which trap pollutants and lower air quality. The Utah Division of Air Quality closely monitors air quality and issues alerts for voluntary and mandatory actions when pollution exceeds federal safety standards. Protests have been held at the Utah State Capitol and Democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation in the Utah State Legislature to make public transportation free during January and July, when air quality is usually <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst.</b> The {{population of}} the Salt Lake City metropolitan area is projected to double by 2040, putting further pressure on the region's air quality.|$|E
25|$|Enthused by {{the speech}} of Jathedar Tehal Singh, the entire Shaheedi Jatha {{followed}} him. By this time, another horseman messenger, Bhai Ram Singh, arrived. In vain did he too try to persuade Jathedar Tehal Singh and the Jatha to return. The Jatha soon entered Darshni Deohri of the Gurdwara and shut the main door from inside. While some of the devotees took their seats inside the Prakash Asthan, others sat on the platform and the Baran dari. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali sat on Guru's tabia. Mahant Narayan Das came to know of the situation through the Jaikaras (victory slogans) of the Shaheedi Jatha. At first, he was utterly shocked thinking that {{the game was over}} but he soon recovered and ordered his mercenaries to kill everyone in the Jatha. They fired bullets at the Sangat in Gurdwara hall. Several bullets pierced through Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The hired gundas wielded swords, spears, hatchets and other lethal weapons to mercilessly slaughter the peaceful and unprovocative Sikhs within the very premises of the Gurdwara. The dead and dying Singhs were then dragged to a pile of logs which had been collected earlier and consigned to flame. By the time the police and local Sikhs came on the scene, all the dead men had been consumed by the fire. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali who was wounded with a gunshot was tied to a Jand tree and burnt alive. It was a butchery <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst</b> form.|$|E
500|$|After {{the damage}} was {{discovered}} on 3 February 1997, legal actions were initiated by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate requiring remedial measures to halt the leakage. <b>At</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst,</b> the rate of leakage into the tunnel was [...] of water per minute. The Rhoca-Gil proprietary sealant process was used to stop the leaks. On investigation, Rhoca-Gil was revealed to contain a toxic substance called acrylamide, which caused health problems for the tunnel workers. The removal of Rhoca-Gil and its replacement with concrete resulted in additional delays. In addition, an extensive permanent pumping system was installed to restore and maintain lake levels in Østmarka.|$|E
40|$|This book {{explores the}} {{representation}} of the warrior in relation to the king in early north-west Europe. These essays, by scholars from the areas of Norse, Celtic and Anglo-Saxon studies, examine how medieval writers highlighted the role of the warrior in relation to kings, or to authority, and to society as a whole. The warrior who fought for his people was also a danger to them. How was such a destructive force to be controlled? The Christian church sought to challenge the ethos of the pagan tribal warrior and to reduce the barbarism of warfare (<b>at</b> least <b>its</b> <b>worst</b> excesses). We can follow this struggle in the medieval literature produced in the areas under study...|$|R

5000|$|The 1855 Paris World Fair's jury {{accepted}} {{eleven of}} Courbet's {{works for the}} Exposition Universelle, but The Painter's Studio was not among them. In an act of self promotion and defiance, Courbet, {{with the help of}} Alfred Bruyas, opened his own exhibition (The Pavilion of Realism) close to the official exposition; this was a forerunner of the various Salon des Refusés. Very little praise was forthcoming, and Eugène Delacroix {{was one of the few}} painters who supported the work. Of the painting, Courbet stated that The Painter's Studio [...] "represents society <b>at</b> <b>its</b> best, <b>its</b> <b>worst,</b> and <b>its</b> average." ...|$|R
500|$|The Wehrmacht {{began to}} reorganize itself along a {{defensive}} front {{known as the}} Siegfried Line. [...] Eisenhower felt that he could relieve the supply problem by using Antwerp to unload supplies in Europe; however, German troops held the Scheldt estuary and consequently Allied shipping could not get through to the Belgian port city. In an effort to open the Scheldt estuary, Eisenhower approved Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's Operation Market Garden, which was launched on 17 September. However, by 21 September the operation had failed to dislodge German defenders from the southern Netherlands and open the seaway to Antwerp; the supply problem was <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst.</b>|$|E
500|$|John Pierce also {{regarded}} Dragon's Egg as {{hard science}} fiction at its best, while Forward's later novel Martian Rainbow (1991) was the genre <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst.</b> Both novels have cardboard human characters, {{but this does}} not matter in Dragon's Egg, where {{the focus is on the}} deeper personalities of the cheela characters. The novel even makes readers care about the fate of an unsympathetic cheela ruler, whose rejuvenation [...] treatment fails catastrophically. Pierce wrote that the best works of this genre create a literary experience, but one of an unusual kind. Instead of offering a metaphor for a reality the reader already recognizes, they create new realities in which the reader is caught up.|$|E
500|$|Benzodiazepines are {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} treatment of acute anxiety, as they bring about rapid and marked or moderate relief of symptoms in most individuals; however, they are not recommended beyond 2–4 weeks of use due to risks of tolerance and dependence and a lack of long-term effectiveness. As for insomnia, they may also be used on an irregular/"as-needed" [...] basis, such as in cases where said anxiety is <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst.</b> Compared to other pharmacological treatments, benzodiazepines {{are twice as likely to}} lead to a relapse of the underlying condition upon discontinuation. Psychological therapies and other pharmacological therapies are recommended for the long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Antidepressants have higher remission rates and are, in general, safe and effective in the short and long term.|$|E
50|$|Forbes {{played in}} only one game, against Oregon State, in 1987, and only two games in 1988. But he played an important, if infamous, role {{in the last of}} those 1988 games. In the final game of the season, against in-state rival Texas A&M, Texas had come back from a 28-point deficit to trail by only 4 with 4 minutes left. With Texas {{threatening}} to score again, Forbes was brought into the game with Texas on the Aggies 34 yard line and 3:20 left in the game. On a 3rd down option play, Forbes made a bad pitch which the Aggies recovered, and Texas never got the ball back again. Texas finished the season <b>at</b> 4-7, <b>its</b> <b>worst</b> record since 1956.|$|R

Jeremy Parish, writing for 1UP.com, found the game to be boring and archaic if well-crafted.|$|R
500|$|The media {{coverage}} of the allegations was criticized for using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, for accepting stories of Jackson's alleged criminal activity in return for money, for accepting confidential leaked material from the police investigation in return for money, for deliberately using pictures of Jackson's appearance <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst,</b> for a lack of objectivity and for using headlines that strongly implied Jackson's guilt.

500|$|Amra Ademovic is a Bosnian nurse {{working in}} a {{hospital}} in Afghanistan {{after the fall of}} the Taliban. She cares for and later adopts Roshi, a critically wounded Afghan orphan. Amra, according to Hosseini, was created to represent the foreign aid workers serving in Afghanistan. While visiting the country in 2003, he had encountered a number of people who had left comfortable lifestyles to help provide relief aid, and he had wanted to pay tribute to them through the portrayal of Amra. Hosseini described the character as one of his favorites and said, [...] "She has seen humanity <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst,</b> having worked in war zones most of her career, and yet she has retained great capacity for compassion and mercy.

The International Herald Tribune noted the work of Delors {{at the end of}} his second term in 1992: [...] "Mr. Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums. He arrived when Europessimism was <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>worst.</b> Although he was a little-known former French finance minister, he breathed life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission. In his first term, from 1985 to 1988, he rallied Europe to the call of the single market, and when appointed to a second term he began urging Europeans toward the far more ambitious goals of economic, monetary and political union".|$|E

In another positive review, Irving Tan of Sputnik Music believes [...] "If" [...] contains [...] "very introspective lyrics that end up making a memorable outing", but also believed the track was not as well-written as some of his later and earlier pieces. Tan also believed the track was reminiscent of [...] "Grantchester Meadows", another Waters-penned track from Ummagumma a year before.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new data declustering scheme, GRS, for range queries on uniform data.
