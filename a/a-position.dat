40|$|Deuterium, {{the stable}} heavy isotope of hydrogen, has twice the {{relative}} mass of hydrogen; as a consequence, the vibrational frequency of a carbon-deuterium bond {{is lower than}} that for the corresponding bond to hydrogen. The energy requirement for cleavage of a carbondeuterium bond is greater than that for a carbon-hydrogen bond; therefore, chemical bonds involving deuterium will generally be more stable than those involving hydrogen. Where cleavage of a bond is rate-determining, substitution of deuterium for hydrogen in this position will result in an isotope effect. Thus, {{it may be possible}} to enhance the half-life of a drug, and hence its duration of action, through deuterium substitution. Monoamine oxidase catalyses the oxidative dealnination of various amines by removal of the amine group, in a reaction that involves the formation of an imine intermediate. The production of the imine, which involves the removal of a hydrogen from the a-side chain carbon atom, is rate limiting for this reaction and, consequently, deuterium labelling on the a-carbon atom may be expected to attenuate the rate of oxidative metabolism by monoamine oxidase. The monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine is inactivated by monoamine oxidase in a reaction that is analogous to that of amine oxidation. This research was directed towards examining the effects of deuterium substitution in DL-dopa, dopamine, and phenelzine and to investigate whether deuterium labelling of the <b>a-positions</b> of these drugs attenuates their metabolism by monoamine oxidase and hence enhance their behavioural and neurochemical activity. Since DL-dopa and phenelzine are clinically effective -idrugs used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease/syndrome and atypical depression, respectively,substitution of deuterium for hydrogen on the <b>a-positions</b> of these drugs may effectively increase their clinical efficacy. Our results are consistent with earlier observations that DL-dopa induces a stereotyped behavioural syndrome in rats with a concomitant increase in striatal dopamine levels and no change in hypothalamic noradrenaline concentrations. Deuterium substitution in the a,B,Bpositons of DL-dopa did not influence the ability of this drug to elicit behavioural activation or to alter central catecholamine levels. :!. !!. vi vo, sugges ti ng that deuteri urn-l abe 11 i ng does not protect the subsequently formed [2 U 3]-dopamine from metabolism by monoamine oxidase or dopamine- 8 -hydroxylase. Despite the observation that dopamine induces a dose-dependent contraversive circling, with a simultaneous elevation in striatal dopamine concentration, in rats with unilateral 6 - 0 HDA lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway, deuterium sUbstitution does not influence the behavioural or neurochemical activity of this drug. In contrast, the replacement of deuterium on the a,a, 8, 8 -positions of phenelzine profoundly increases the behavioural activation of this drug at a time period 2 - 12 hours after drug administration. This increased behavioural excitation, 6 hours after drug treatment, seems to be more closely associated with elevations in central phenylethylamine and tryptamine levels than to increases in brain dopamine, noradrenaline, or serotonin concentrations. The ability of deuterium substitution to -i ienhance the activity of phenelzine appears to be related to an attenuation of the metabolic inactivation of [2 H] 4 -phenelzine by monoamine oxidase. Deuterium substitution in the <b>a-positions</b> of phenelzine may, therefore, provide a means by which the clinical efficacy of this drug can be enhanced. ...|$|R

Other significant differences between HI and LI, such as the classes of verbs which support these two constructions respectively, and the differential behavior of HI and LI with respect to adverbial placement, provide support for interpreting HI as a case of Heavy NP Shift applying to subject constituents. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore {{the nature and}} {{properties}} of scrambling in Korean. Contrary to the widely accepted view that scrambling is truly optional, I propose that scrambling {{is a consequence of}} case-driven obligatory movement, a proposal consistent with the 2 ̆ 2 last resort 2 ̆ 2 condition on movement in [Chomsky 1991] and [Chomsky 1992]. I assume that scrambling is adjunction and defend this view in Ch. 5. In Ch. 2 and Ch. 3 based on binding facts and scope reconstruction, I claim that scrambling is best analyzed as A-movement. Scrambling either creates a binding relation which does not obtain in the base order, or destroys a binding relation which obtains in the base order. A scrambled element undergoes optional reconstruction for scope interpretation. All these properites are consistent with those of standard A-movement. In Ch. 4, I propose that scrambling is a consequence of case-driven movement. 	On the basis of case and word order possibilities in event nominal clauses, I first establish that in Korean nominative case is licensed by INFL, and accusative case by a complex category formed by the head raising of VERB-to-INFL. Under the VP-internal Subject Hypothesis, all the arguments have to move out of VP to be assigned case. As long as the case licensing conditions are met, arguments may be arranged in any order, and therefore, scrambling is a consequence of case driven movement. The combination of the assumption that scrambling is adjunction with the proposal that scrambling is A-movement leads to the conclusion that adjoined positions are <b>A-positions,</b> contrary to the view in [Chomsky 1986] that adjoined positions are A 2 ̆ 7 -positions. In Ch. 5, I defend the conclusion that adjoined positions are <b>A-positions</b> in Korean, on the basis of facts involving case assignment to adverbials, binding by a nominative adjunct NP in multiple nominative constructions, and absence of island effects in scrambling out of a scrambled clause. In Ch. 6, I examine island effects and discourse constraints on scrambling. I argue that islandhood of various clause types is determined by the selectional properties of the clause, as argued by [Cinque 1990] for wh-movement. I also argue that the relevant discourse notion characterizing the scramblability of an element is 2 ̆ 2 presuppositionality 2 ̆ 2 as defined in [Diesing 1990], rather than specificity as various authors including [Moltmann 1990], [Mahajan 1990] and [Enc 1991] advocate...|$|R

These materials show high solubility in common organic solvents. Sexithiophene derivatives with short PEO chains attached at the <b>a-positions</b> have been synthesised as model {{systems for the}} above sexithiophene polymer. PEO side-chains as short as pentaethylene glycol had a good solubilising effect on the otherwise insoluble sexithiophene. All compounds prepared exhibited surface activity, as shown by monolayer experiments on a Langmuir trough. Sexithiophene model compounds with short PEO side-chains could be compressed to form a two-dimensional condensed phase. X-ray diffraction of melt cast films of the oligothiophene polymers showed that a minimum oligothiophene block-length of five thiophenes (pentathiophene) was necessary to fully disturb PEO crystallisation. The sexithiophene polymer formed regions of crystalline/aggregated sexithiophene in the bulk. UV/Vis and fluorescence studies in solution indicated that the oligothiophene segments were molecularly dissolved in good solvents like chloroform. Aggregation of the oligothiophenes occurred in THF/water mixtures, which was consistent with observed shifts of the UV absorption maxima towards the blue and quenching of the fluorescence. An oligothiophene length of four thiophenes (quaterthiophene) was necessary to observe this aggregation phenomenon.

40|$|This article revisits the (non) configurationality {{debate of}} the 80 s and early 90 s {{concerning}} Hungarian, a `free word order' language, which was shown {{during that period}} to be characterized by an articulate and, crucially, hierarchical preverbal domain, with A-bar positions dedicated to discourse functions such as topic and focus. What this debate did not conclusively settle, however, is the question {{whether or not the}} structure of <b>A-positions</b> in Hungarian is also configurational. The most prevalent, and indeed empirically most well-argued and elaborated analysis that has emerged is that of É. Kiss's (1987 a, b; 1991, 1994 a, 2002, 2003), according to which the answer is negative: arguments are base-generated in the verb phrase in a free order in a flat structure. The present paper challenges this view by demonstrating systematically that the arguments put forward to back it up are inconclusive, and in fact it fails descriptively as well. The alternative proposed here is based on a hierarchical verb phrase (vacated by the raised verb) and a Japanese-type local scrambling movement that operates in the post-verbal domain of the clause. The scrambling movement analysis, besides being theoretically more desirable than the nonconfigurational verb phrase approach, makes available a superior descriptive coverage by accounting for a varied set of structural symmetries and asymmetries holding between subject and object. Modulo scrambling, Hungarian is configurational all the way down. ...|$|R
40|$|Investigations of atom {{transfer}} {{reactions of}} amino acid derivatives {{are described in}} this thesis. Reaction of N-benzoylvaline methyl ester (29 a) with sulphuryl chloride gave the β-chlorovaline derivative (30 a) and lesser amounts of diastereoisomers of the r-chlorovaline derivative (31 a). Studies of reactions of the valine derivatives (29 a-c) with sulphuryl chloride, and of the photolyses of the corresponding N-chlorovaline derivatives (39 a-c) {{have shown that the}} reaction of (29 a) with sulphuryl chloride and the photolysis of (39 a) involve regioselective intermolecular transfer of the respective β-valinyl hydrogens. There is no evidence of reaction at the corresponding <b>a-positions.</b> These reactions establish the chemical validity of a regiospecific hydrogen atom transfer proposed in penicillin biosynthesis and in the β-hydroxylation of valine residues in peptides. Factors affecting the production of amidocarboxy-substituted radicals have been investigated by examining reactions of derivatives of valine, alanine and glycine with a number of reagents. The variation in the regioselectivity of reactions of these compounds is typified by the reactions of (29 a) with sulphuryl chloride and N-bromosuccinimide. Whereas the reaction of (29 a) with sulphuryl chloride involves hydrogen atom abstraction from the β-position of (29 a) with subsequent chlorine atom incorporation to give (30 a), the reaction with Nbromosuccinimide proceeds via hydrogen atom abstraction from the α-position of (29 a) and yields the dibromovaline derivative (76). The studies indicate that amidocarboxy-substituted radicals such as (34 a) are considerably more stable than, for example, the tertiary alkyl radical (32 a), but hydrogen atom transfer reactions may afford the less stable products if electrophilic radicals are involved in the hydrogen atom abstraction and if there is little development of radical character in the transition state of the reaction. The preferential reactivity of glycine residues in free radical reactions of proteins, peptides and other amino acid derivatives has been investigated by examination of reactions of derivatives of valine, alanine, glycine, methyl pyroglutamate and proline with NBS. The previously unexplained reactivity of glycine derivatives has been rationalised in terms of steric interactions and their effect on the conformation of the amidocarboxy-substituted captodative radical (41). The selective reactivity of glycine derivatives has been exploited synthetically. Reaction of the α-bromoglycine derivative (112 a), prepared by reaction of the glycine derivative (93 a) with NBS, with hexabutylditin under strictly anhydrous conditions gave the diasteroisomers of the glycine dimer (131). Otherwise the major products were the ethers (132 a) and (132 b). Selective functionalisation of the dipeptide (126 a) at the α-glycyl position was achieved by reaction with NBS.

40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) is a {{high power}} density test reactor specializing in fuel and {{materials}} irradiation. For more than 45 years, the ATR has provided irradiations of materials and fuels testing along with radioisotope production. Originally operated primarily {{in support of the}} Offcie of Naval Reactors (NR), the mission has gradually expanded to cater to other customers, such as the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), private industry, and universities. Unforeseen circumstances may lead to the decommissioning of ATR, thus leaving the U. S. Government without a large-scale materials irradiation capability {{to meet the needs of}} its nuclear energy and naval reactor missions. In anticipation of this possibility, work was performed under the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program to investigate test reactor concepts that could satisfy the current missions of the ATR along with an expanded set of secondary missions. This work can be viewed as an update to a project from the 1990 ’s called the Broad Application Test Reactor (BATR). In FY 2012, a survey of anticipated customer needs was performed, followed by analysis of the original BATR concepts with fuel changed to low-enriched uranium. Departing from these original BATR designs, four concepts were identified for further analysis in FY 2013. The project informally adopted the acronym MATRIX (Multiple-Application Thermal Reactor for Irradiation eXperiments). This report discusses analysis of the four MATRIX concepts along with a number of variations on these main concepts. Designs were evaluated based on their satisfaction of anticipated customer requirements and the “Cylindrical” variant was selected for further analysis of options. This downselection should be considered preliminary and the backup alternatives should include the other three main designs. The baseline Cylindrical MATRIX design is expected to be capable of higher burnup than the ATR (or longer cycle length given a particular batch scheme). The volume of test space in IPTs is larger in MATRIX than in ATR with comparable magnitude of neutron flux. In addition to the IPTs, the Cylindrical MATRIX concept features test spaces at the centers of fuel assemblies where very high fast flux can be achieved. This magnitude of fast flux is similar to that achieved in the ATR <b>A-positions,</b> however, the available volume having these conditions is greater in the MATRIX design than in the ATR. From the analyses performed in this work, it appears that the Cylindrical MATRIX design can be designed to meet the anticipated needs of the ATR replacement reactor. However, this statement must be qualified by acknowledging that this design is quite immature, and therefore any requirements currently met must be re-evaluated as the design matures. Also, some of the requirements were not strictly met, but are believed to be achievable once features to be added later are designed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} syntactic {{conditions under}} which complement clauses constitute a phase in Japanese. Since CPs {{are assumed to be}} phasal (Chomsky 2000; 2001), it is predicted by the Phase Impenetrability Condition that phrasal extraction out of a CP complement must transit through the edge of the complement, i. e., Spec CP. As Spec CP is an <b>Ā-position</b> and movement through an <b>Ā-position</b> must create a uniform Ā-chain, phrasal extraction out of a phasal complement is expected to create an Ā-chain. However, evidence from Japanese suggests that long distance A-scrambling is permissible out of some complement clauses that are headed by an overt complementizer (Uchibori 2000). It follows therefore that the category CP is not sufficient to characterize clausal phases. In search for an alternative definition of clausal phases, I argue that main clause phenomena such as thematic topics and exhaustive foci are allowed only in phasal complements in Japanese. Assuming that Top and Foc are licensed by Force (Haegeman 2006 a), I propose that phasal complements project up to Force in their clausal left periphery, independently of a complementizer. I further argue that the correlation between phasehood and the clausal left periphery can be captured if we assume that uninterpretable topic and focus features must originate on the phase head Force...|$|E

40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} and oligomers {{have been}} widely studied based on their wide range of useful properties and applications. Given the importance of self-assembly and charge transfer {{in the development of}} conjugated materials for use in electronic applications, it is crucial to: (i) prepare functional materials by molecular design, (ii) evaluate the structure-property relationships of new materials, and (iii) develop fundamental understanding of electronic structure and charge transport behavior. 	The use of conjugated polymeric materials in electronic applications relies on control of the assembly and orientation of the polymer chains in the solid state. Conjugated polymers with liquid crystalline behavior could be used to implement an additional level of control over orientation and resultant properties. Substitution of the conjugated polythiophene backbone with semifluoroalkyl side chains (i. e., the diblock -(CH 2) m(CF 2) nF) has afforded materials with unusual properties. The mutual immiscibility of the aromatic backbone, the alkyl side-chain segments, and the fluoroalkyl side-chain termini provides control over supramolecular packing. A series of eight polymers has been synthesized, in which the lengths of the alkyl (m) and fluoroalkyl (n) segments are varied. One regiorandom analogue and two poly(3 -alkylthiophene) s were also synthesized for comparative purposes. The structure, molecular weight, and regioregularity of the polymers were evaluated using a variety of techniques. 	The semifluoroalkyl-substituted polymers have been systematically studied to determine the effect of side chain length and m:n block ratios on their solution state, liquid crystalline, and solid state properties. The effect of side chains on conjugation was determined, where solubility allowed, by solution-state UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. The thermal and liquid crystalline properties of the homopolymers were evaluated by DSC, variable-temperature X-ray diffraction, and polarized optical microscopy. Several semifluoroalkyl-substituted polythiophene homologues show liquid crystalline behavior. 	Molecular packing and charge transport are key factors governing the use of conjugated materials in electronic applications. A wide variety of oligomers have been studied as models for charge migration in conjugated polymers. One-dimensional models do not adequately represent two-dimensional charge transport; thus, a variety of two-dimensional, covalently-linked models have been developed. Previous work by our group, and others, led to the proposal of bis(oligothienyl) compounds as models to study the interaction of the ð-conjugated chains. Previous reports by other researchers described the synthesis and characterization of hydrogen-terminated analogues of 1, 8 -bis(oligothienyl) naphthalenes. However, these materials proved to be unsuitable for use as charge transport models, as they were subject to irreversible polymerization upon oxidation. Installation of methyl groups at the terminal <b>a-positions</b> of 1, 8 -bis(oligothienyl) naphthalenes allowed us to create a series of models in which conjugated chains are held in close proximity.

40|$|International audienceAn {{enantioselective}} cyclopropanation of a-substituted a,b-unsaturated aldehydes with bromomalonate {{has been}} successfully developed through a domino Michael/alkylation strategy. The method allows the efficient formation of cyclopropanes bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter at the <b>a-position</b> of the aldehydes by using iminium/enamine catalysis and gives a nice extension on the organocatalytic cyclopropanation of bromomalonate and a,b-unsaturated aldehydes previously reported by other groups. Very good yields (up to 81 %) and enantioselectivities (up to 97 % ee) have been obtained. The optically active cyclopropane derivatives are of high synthetic interest as useful targets for further elaboration into more complex structures...|$|E

Application of HPLC/APCI-MS {{to the analysis of}} soybean oil allowed thirty nine triacylglycerols and seven diacylglycerols to be positively identified. The compounds present were quantified and the distribution of fatty acids in the <b>â-position</b> calculated. This distribution compared favourably with that obtained using a more conventional regiospecific lipase degradation of the oil.

40|$|Various {{languages}} allow {{instances of}} external possession-possessive encoding without a possessive structure in DP. The {{analysis of these}} cases {{has long been a}} battleground of raising versus control. I provide a new argument from Nez Perce in support of possessor raising of a type thematically parallel to raising to subject. The possessor phrase moves from a possessum-DP-internal position to an athematic <b>A-position</b> within vP. Like raising to subject, this movement is obligatory and does not result in the assignment of a new role to the moving element. A case-driven treatment of possessor raising is proposed. © 2013 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{origin of}} the isotope-induced diastereomeric enrichment in helical supramolecular polymers consisting of trialkylbenzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxamides (BTAs) is studied using plane-wave DFT calculations. We demonstrate {{that the creation of}} a chiral center at the <b>a-position</b> of the alkyl chains of a BTA by H–D exchange leads to a small but notable preference for the formation of supramolecular hydrogen bonded structures with a particular helicity. The bias for one helical sense preference is caused by the orientation of the vibrational eigenmodes of the C–H and C–D stretching frequencies at the chiral center and by hyperconjugative destabilization of the anti C–H orbital...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} an alternative strategy to A´-movement in both German and Dutch where the extracted constituent is preceded by a preposition and a coreferential pronoun appears in the extraction site. The construction has properties of both binding and movement: Whereas reconstruction effects suggest movement out of the embedded clause, there is strong evidence that the operator constituent is linked to an <b>A-position</b> in the matrix clause; this paradox is resolved by assuming a Control-like approach that involves movement from the embedded clause into a theta-position in the matrix clause with subsequent short A´- movement. The coreferential pronoun is interpreted as a resumptive heading a Big-DP which hosts the antecedent in its specifier...|$|E
40|$|Poly(delta-valerolactone) [poly(deltaVL) ] of high {{molecular}} weight (similar to 40 000) and low polydispersity index (similar to 1. 05) was prepared by activated monomer cationic ring-opening polymerization of delta-VL initiated by the alcohol/HCl. Et 2 O system. A series of functional alcohols, e. g., 9 -anthracenemethanol, 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate, 3 -buten- 1 -ol, 2 -bromoethanol, and 5 -norbornene- 2 -metbanol, were successfully used to prepare asymmetric telechelic poly(deltaVL), i. e., chains end-capped by the functional group of the alcohol in <b>a-position</b> and by an w-hydroxyl group. Ring-opening polymerization of delta-VL {{in the presence of}} alpha-methoxy-w-hydroxylpoly(ethylene oxide) and poly(ethylene glycol) led to amphiphilic di- and triblock copolymers, respectively. The polydispersity index of all these (co) polymers was low (similar to 1. 10). Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Anaphors, in the government-binding framework, are nominal {{expressions}} {{which must}} be related to an antecedent in an argument-position (<b>A-position).</b> The relation between the anaphoric expression and its antecedent is contrained by the binding principles which define an opaque domain in which these anaphors must be bound-i. e. must have an antecedent. In this work, we will suggest the existence of another kind of anaphoric relations; the anaphoric relation which holds between an anaphor and an antecedent in an non-argument posi-tion (K-position). We will refer to anaphors which need an antecedent in an argument-position as A-anaphors and anaphors which need an antecedent in a non-argument position as N-ana-phors. It is possible to show that {{for each type of}} A-anaphors there existsa corresponding T-anaphor. Two anaphoric system...|$|E
