500|$|It took Levi {{approximately}} {{one year to}} record all of his dialogue {{due in part to}} his busy schedule. Levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time, recording each of his lines at least twice. The actor's voice ultimately helped shape and develop Flynn's character. Howard explained, [...] "He's so smart and clever, and his adlibs are so great, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> him straight away ... he brings that to Flynn." [...] On Levi's own influence on his character, the actor explained that Flynn's [...] "voice was really just a slight variation of [...] own". Wanting to sound [...] "more appropriate" [...] for the film's medieval setting, Levi [...] "cleaned up [...] own diction and made things a little bit more polished", referring to Flynn's accent as Mid-Atlantic. Describing Tangled as a [...] "very family friendly" [...] version of Romancing the Stone (1984), Levi studied and channelled the film's star, American actor Michael Douglas, and English legend Robin Hood. However, when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film's release, the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance, explaining, [...] "I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up," [...] likening the experience to hearing one's voice played back on an answering machine.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbitt {{believed}} that country music was [...] "Irish music" [...] and that [...] "the minor chords in [...] music gave it that mystical feel." [...] Although {{he did not}} strive to produce pop music, his songs helped influence the direction of country music, leading to the Urban Cowboy era during the 1980s. Critic Harry Sumrall of the San Jose Mercury News said that Rabbitt was [...] "like a hot corn dog: nothing fancy, nothing frilly. You know what you're getting <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it...never a country purist, Rabbitt nonetheless makes music that is plain and simple, {{with all of the}} virtues that make good country good. [...] might be brisk, but they are also warm and familiar, like the breeze that wafts in over the fried artichokes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lange {{made her}} {{professional}} film debut in 1976's King Kong, beating out actresses Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn {{for the role}} of damsel in distress. [...] Despite being a box-office success – it became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1976 – and receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Special Effects, the film and her performance were widely panned. However, renowned film critic Pauline Kael praised her, noting, [...] "The movie is sparked by Jessica Lange's fast yet dreamy comic style. [...] has the high, wide forehead and clear-eyed transparency of Carole Lombard in My Man Godfrey, [...] one liners so dumb that the audience laughs and moans at the same time, yet they're in character, and when Lange says them she holds the eye <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> her, the way people liked Lombard." [...] Lange {{went on to win the}} 1976 Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. She would remain a favorite of Kael's, who would later comment, [...] "She has a facial structure that the camera yearns for, and she has talent, too." ...|$|E
