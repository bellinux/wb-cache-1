25|$|Many PID loops {{control a}} {{mechanical}} device (for example, a valve). Mechanical maintenance {{can be a}} major cost and wear leads to control degradation {{in the form of}} either stiction or a deadband in the mechanical response to an input signal. The rate of mechanical wear is mainly a function of how often a device is activated to make a change. Where wear is a significant concern, the PID loop may have an output deadband to reduce the frequency of activation of the output (valve). This is accomplished by modifying the controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband before the <b>actual</b> <b>output</b> will change.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the <b>actual</b> <b>output.</b> The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E
25|$|The Wankel {{engine is}} a type of {{internal}} combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion. In contrast to the more common reciprocating piston designs, the Wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity, smoothness, compactness, high revolutions per minute, and a high power-to-weight ratio primarily {{due to the fact that}} it produces three power pulses per rotor revolution compared to one per revolution in a two-stroke piston engine and one per two revolutions in a four-stroke piston engine (although at the <b>actual</b> <b>output</b> shaft, there is only one power pulse per revolution, since the output shaft spins three times as fast as the actual rotor does, as can be seen in the animation below, making it roughly equivalent to a 2-stroke engine of the same displacement; this is also why the displacement only measures one face of the rotor, since only one face is working for each output shaft revolution). The engine is commonly referred to as a rotary engine, although this name also applies to other completely different designs, primarily aircraft engines with their cylinders arranged in a circular fashion around the crankshaft. All parts rotate consistently in one direction, as opposed to the common reciprocating piston engine, which has pistons violently changing direction. The four-stage cycle of intake, compression, ignition, and exhaust occur each revolution at each of the three rotor tips moving inside the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing, enabling the three power pulses per rotor revolution. The rotor is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle with sides that are somewhat flatter.|$|E
30|$|Due to the {{uncertainty}} and intermittency of wind power, when the dispatched power {{is less than}} the <b>actual</b> minimum <b>output</b> power, the output power of wind farm will be constant; when the predicted average output power is greater than the <b>actual</b> average <b>output</b> power, there will be a transient power sag; when the predicted average output power is between the <b>actual</b> average <b>output</b> power and the <b>actual</b> minimum <b>output</b> power, there may be a power sag which is related to the wind conditions. During power system restoration, a transient power sag represents uncertainty: it is difficult to precisely predict the start time and the duration of transient power sags. Therefore, it’s necessary to optimize the dispatched power to ensure the security of the restored system.|$|R

500|$|Bede's account {{indicates}} that Cædmon {{was responsible for}} the composition of a large [...] of vernacular religious poetry. In contrast to Saints Aldhelm and Dunstan, Cædmon's poetry {{is said to have been}} exclusively religious. Bede reports that Cædmon [...] "could never compose any foolish or trivial poem, but only those which were concerned with devotion", and his list of Cædmon's output includes work on religious subjects only: accounts of creation, translations from the Old and New Testaments, and songs about the [...] "terrors of future judgment, horrors of hell, … joys of the heavenly kingdom, … and divine mercies and judgments." [...] Of this corpus, only his first poem survives. While vernacular poems matching Bede's description of several of Cædmon's later works are found in London, British Library, Junius 11 (traditionally referred to as the [...] "Junius" [...] or [...] "Cædmon" [...] manuscript), the older traditional attribution of these texts to Cædmon or Cædmon's influence cannot stand. The poems show significant stylistic differences both internally and with Cædmon's original Hymn, and there is nothing about their order or content to suggest that they could not have been composed and anthologised without any influence from Bede's discussion of Cædmon's oeuvre: the first three Junius poems are in their biblical order and, while Christ and Satan could be understood as partially fitting Bede's description of Cædmon's work on future judgment, pains of hell and joys of the heavenly kingdom, the match is not exact enough to preclude independent composition. As Fritz and Day have shown, indeed, Bede's list itself may owe less to direct knowledge of Cædmon's <b>actual</b> <b>output</b> than to traditional ideas about the subjects fit for Christian poetry or the order of the catechism. [...] Similar influences may, of course, also have affected the makeup of the Junius volume.|$|E

40|$|A partial test oracle is {{proposed}} {{to verify the}} <b>actual</b> <b>outputs</b> in access testing on XML data. The considered software under test is a query program which receives as input an XML document obtained from an XML repository of any kind, and produces XML data as output. To deal with the <b>actual</b> <b>outputs</b> from this testing process, the partial oracle evaluates the correctness of the test executions according to: (1) a loose specification provided by the tester, and (2) a set of predefined constraints that describe invariant properties of the expected outputs. By means of the loose specification, the oracle can particularize the constraints to the concrete behaviour of the query program to test. This approach enables the oracle to give automatically a response about the correctness of the program under test with a certain precision at feasible cost. To illustrate {{the usefulness of the}} approach a case study is presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid approach {{to enhance the}} performance of the data-based Pattern Classification Techniques (PCTs) used for Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) of nonlinear dynamic noisy processes. The method combines kriging metamodels with PCT (e. g. Support Vector Machines). The metamodels are used in two different ways; first, they are used as Multivariate Dynamic Kriging(s) (MDKs) which estimate the process dynamic behavior/outputs, second, as classical static models which are used for smoothing noise and imputing missing values of the process <b>actual</b> <b>outputs</b> measurements. So during the process operations, the estimated and the smoothed <b>actual</b> <b>outputs</b> are compared, and residual/error signals are generated that is used by the classifier to detect and diagnose the process possible faults. The method is applied to a benchmark case study, showing a high enhancement in such PCTs due to the introduction of the process dynamics information to these PCTs via the MDKs, and by smoothing the noise and imputing the missing measurements using the static kriging.

2500|$|Feedback voltage {{regulators}} operate {{by comparing the}} <b>actual</b> <b>output</b> voltage to some fixed reference voltage. Any difference is amplified and used to control the regulation element {{in such a way}} as to reduce the voltage error. This forms a negative feedback control loop; increasing the open-loop gain tends to increase regulation accuracy but reduce stability. (Stability is avoidance of oscillation, or ringing, during step changes.) There will also be a trade-off between stability and the speed of the response to changes. [...] If the output voltage is too low (perhaps due to input voltage reducing or load current increasing), the regulation element is commanded, up to a point, to produce a higher output voltage–by dropping less of the input voltage (for linear series regulators and buck switching regulators), or to draw input current for longer periods (boost-type switching regulators); if the output voltage is too high, the regulation element will normally be commanded to produce a lower voltage. However, many regulators have over-current protection, so that they will entirely stop sourcing current (or limit the current in some way) if the output current is too high, and some regulators may also shut down if the input voltage is outside a given range (see also: crowbar circuits).|$|E
