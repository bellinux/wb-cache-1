5|$|Following President John F. Kennedy's September 1962 speech, {{in which}} he {{described}} his goal of accomplishing a manned space flight to the moon {{by the end of}} the decade, the space program grew in importance <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> in Central Florida because of its proximity to Cape Canaveral. Prominent residents and local leaders began lobbying the Florida State Legislature to increase access to higher education on the Space Coast. With the help of former State Senate President William A. Shands and Senator Beth Johnson, the legislature passed and Governor Farris Bryant signed into law Senate Bill No. 125 on June 10, 1963, which authorized the Florida Board of Regents to create a new state university in East Central Florida. The university was founded as a non-segregated and coeducational university, with the mission of educating students for promising space-age careers in engineering and other technological professions.|$|E

He was posted to Japan in March 1947, becoming Brigadier-in-Charge of Administration for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in July. The size <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> {{of the occupation}} declined considerably during his tour, which finished in October 1949. Approximately 2,400 Australians, most from the 67th Battalion, remained by late 1948, compared to 11,000 in October 1946. In December 1949, Garrett resumed command of the Staff College, Queenscliff. Promoted temporary major general, he was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Western Command, which covered the state of Western Australia, in August 1951. He became Deputy Chief of the General Staff in February 1953.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner quickly {{expanded}} the activities <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of his office, building a parallel state. This soon started {{a conflict with}} Puricelli. Instead of being fired, Kirchner resigned and accused the governor of reducing the funds for social-welfare. He ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987, and won by the slim margin of 110 votes. Kirchner's friend, Rudy Ulloa Igor, helped him to victory by registering some groups of Chilean immigrants to vote (immigrants were allowed to vote in mayoral elections), and persuading them to vote for Kirchner. Julio de Vido and Carlos Zannini began working with Kirchner at this time. Kirchner used the state-owned media to promote his activities. The Peronist Ricardo del Val was elected governor that year, and the province was impacted by inflation in 1989. Kirchner became the main opponent of del Val, who was impeached and removed from office in 1990 due to the inflation crisis.|$|E

The remaining, including one unfinished at his death, were on sociology, international relations and the issues of war and how findings from psychology could be used to eradicate conflict between nations. Stratton considered these issues more salient to the application of psychology in the real world, though his ideas on this front did not produce a lasting impact in the field because of their subjective and non-experimental nature.|$|E

Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.|$|E

5|$|The {{complexity}} <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> {{of aboriginal}} assimilation and acculturation on Taiwan {{has led to}} three general narratives of Taiwanese ethnic change. The oldest holds that Han migration from Fujian and Guangdong in the 17th century pushed the Plains Aborigines into the mountains, where they became the Highland peoples of today. A more recent view asserts that through widespread intermarriage between Han and aborigines between the 17th and 19th centuries, the aborigines were completely Sinicized. Finally, modern ethnographical and anthropological studies have shown a pattern of cultural shift mutually experienced by both Han and Plains Aborigines, resulting in a hybrid culture. Today people who comprise Taiwan's ethnic Han demonstrate major cultural differences from Han elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Washington and the American {{command in}} Saigon {{considered}} the operation a great success, {{both as a}} test of the new American policy of Vietnamization and in setting back any communist offensives planned against the Saigon area during the next year. The logistical haul overrun and captured by the allied forces in the Base Areas was indeed impressive. 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of munitions; 140,000 rockets and artillery shells; 435 vehicles; 29 tons of communications equipment; 55 tons of medical supplies; and 199,552 anti-aircraft rounds.

5|$|Churchill's {{return to}} the prime ministership meant Lord Cherwell's {{return to the}} post of Paymaster General. He was a strong {{supporter}} of the atomic energy programme, but while he agreed with its size <b>and</b> <b>scope,</b> he was critical of its organisation, which he blamed for slower progress than its Soviet counterpart. In particular, the programme had experienced problems with Civil Service pay and conditions, which were below those for comparable workers in industry. The Treasury had agreed to some flexibility in exceptional cases, but the procedure for doing so was absurdly slow. Hinton in particular was concerned at the low remuneration his senior staff were receiving compared with those with similar responsibilities at ICI. When he attempted to bring Frank Kearton in as his successor, the Treasury refused to adjust the salaries of his other two deputies to match. Rather than ruin his organisation's morale, Hinton had dropped the proposal to appoint Kearton. Nor could any reorganisation be carried out without Treasury approval. Within a month of assuming office, Cherwell had prepared a memorandum proposing that responsibility for the program be transferred from the Ministry of Supply to an Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E

5|$|The final straw was Henry's {{decision}} {{to give his}} youngest son John three major castles belonging to Young Henry, who first protested and then fled to Paris, followed by his brothers Richard and Geoffrey; Eleanor attempted to join them but was captured by Henry's forces in November. Louis supported Young Henry and war became imminent. Young Henry wrote to the pope, complaining about his father's behaviour, and began to acquire allies, including King William of Scotland and the Counts of Boulogne, Flanders and Blois—all of whom were promised lands if Young Henry won. Major baronial revolts broke out in England, Brittany, Maine, Poitou and Angoulême. In Normandy some of the border barons rose up and, {{although the majority of}} the duchy remained openly loyal, there {{appears to have been a}} wider undercurrent of discontent. Only Anjou proved relatively secure. Despite the size <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of the crisis, Henry had several advantages, including his control of a large number of powerful royal castles in strategic areas, control of most of the English ports throughout the war, and his continuing popularity within the towns across his empire.|$|E
5|$|Vkhutemas {{was a close}} {{parallel}} to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization <b>and</b> <b>scope.</b> The two schools {{were the first to}} train artist-designers in a modern manner. Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a Basic Course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, industrial design, and architecture. Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus, but it was less publicised and consequently, is less familiar to the West. Vkhutemas's influence was expansive however—the school exhibited two structures by faculty and award-winning student work at the 1925 Exposition in Paris. Furthermore, Vkhutemas attracted the interest and several visits from the director of the Museum of Modern Art, Alfred Barr. With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus. The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while Hinnerk Scheper of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, El Lissitzky's book Russia – an Architecture for World Revolution published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects. Both schools flourished in a relatively liberal period, and were closed under pressure from increasingly totalitarian regimes.|$|E
5|$|Within the week, {{they had}} a working game written in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2. The two agreed to {{complete}} it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the size <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that {{because they were not}} worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant end-user testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users to go through all the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveHedging is {{frequently}} {{used in both}} the biological literature and clinical notes to denote uncertainty or speculation. It is important for text-mining applications to detect hedge cues and their scope; otherwise, uncertain events are incorrectly identified as factual events. However, due {{to the complexity of}} language, identifying hedge cues <b>and</b> their <b>scope</b> in a sentence is not a trivial task. Our objective was to develop an algorithm that would automatically detect hedge cues <b>and</b> their <b>scope</b> in biomedical literature. MethodologyWe used conditional random fields (CRFs), a supervised machine-learning algorithm, to train models to detect hedge cue phrases <b>and</b> their <b>scope</b> in biomedical literature. The models were trained on the publicly available BioScope corpus. We evaluated the performance of the CRF models in identifying hedge cue phrases <b>and</b> their <b>scope</b> by calculating recall, precision and F 1 -score. We compared our models with three competitive baseline systems. ResultsOur best CRF-based model performed statistically better than the baseline systems, achieving an F 1 -score of 88 % and 86 % in detecting hedge cue phrases <b>and</b> their <b>scope</b> in biological literature and an F 1 -score of 93 % and 90 % in detecting hedge cue phrases <b>and</b> their <b>scope</b> in clinical notes. ConclusionsOur approach is robust, as it can identify hedge cues <b>and</b> their <b>scope</b> in both biological and clinical text. To benefit text-mining applications, our system is publicly available as a Java API and as an online application at [URL] To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available system to detect hedge cues <b>and</b> their <b>scope</b> in biomedical literature...|$|R
