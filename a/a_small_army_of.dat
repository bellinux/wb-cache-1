5|$|In {{response}} to Stephen's siege, Henry returned to England {{again at the}} start of 1153, braving winter storms. Bringing only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> mercenaries, probably paid for with borrowed money, Henry was supported in the north and east of England by the forces of Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod, and had hopes of a military victory. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and his advisers at Stockbridge shortly before Easter in April. Details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and would not expect the bishops to attend his court.|$|E
5|$|The barons of the Latin Empire then elected Peter II of Courtenay, {{a cousin}} of King Philip II Augustus of France, as the new Latin Emperor. Receiving news of his election, Peter {{assembled}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> 160 knights and 5,500 foot and horse, and set out from France. After being crowned by Pope Honorius III in Rome, he set sail from Brindisi in April 1217. Peter landed at Dyrrhachium, which he had promised to conquer and return to Venice, while his wife Yolanda of Flanders sailed on to Constantinople. As in the Norman invasion of William II of Sicily (r. 1166–89) in 1185, Peter intended (after capturing Dyrrhachium) to follow the ancient Via Egnatia to Thessalonica, wresting Albania and Macedonia from Epirote control in the process.|$|E
50|$|The Battle of Herat was a {{large scale}} {{military}} confrontation {{that took place in}} 484 between an invading force of the Sassanid Empire composed of around 100,000 men under the command of Peroz I and <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> the Hephthalite Empire under the command of Khushnavaz. The battle was a catastrophic defeat for the Sassanid forces who were almost completely wiped out. Peroz, the Sassanid king, was killed in the action.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{reservations}} {{of some of}} his senior ministers and governors, two months later, in January 811, al-Amin formally began the civil war when he appointed Ali ibn Isa governor of Khurasan, placed him at the head of an unusually large army of 40,000 men, drawn from the abnaʾ, and sent him to depose al-Ma'mun. When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan, he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al-Ma'mun and carry him back to Baghdad. The news of Ali's approach threw Khurasan into panic, and even al-Ma'mun considered fleeing. The only military force available to him was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> some 4,000–5,000 men, under Tahir ibn al-Husayn. Tahir was sent to confront Ali's advance, but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission, even by Tahir's own father. The two armies met at Rayy, on the western borders of Khurasan, and the ensuing battle (3 July 811) resulted in a crushing victory for the Khurasanis, in which Ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west.|$|E
5|$|In 1653–55 {{there was}} a major Royalist rising in the Highlands led by William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn (1610–64) and former Covenanter soldier John Middleton (1608–74). It was {{particularly}} threatening to the regime because it coincided with the First Dutch War (1652–54). Glencairn was given command of the Royalist forces in Scotland by Charles II. He convened a meeting of Scottish notables at Lochearn in August 1653. Among those present were John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, Archibald Campbell, eldest son of the Marquis of Argyll, Lord Loin, Donald MacDonell of Glengarry, Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, John Graham of Duchray and Colonel Blackadder of Tullyallan. These notables then mustered their vassals and supporters to form <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> about 60 horse, and a force of foot, made up of 60–80 Lowlanders and 150 Highlanders. The governor of Stirling Castle, Colonel Kidd, sallied out to suppress this force, but was defeated at Aberfoyle. This victory boosted morale and the rising gained some support from Lowland Scottish lords, forcing the Commonwealth government to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to these groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} StarCraft is {{presented}} through its instruction manual, the briefings to each mission and conversations within the missions themselves, {{along with the}} use of cinematic cutscenes at key points. The game itself is split into three episodes, one for the player to command each race. In the first segment of the game, the player and Jim Raynor are attempting to control the colony of Mar Sara {{in the wake of the}} Zerg attacks on other Terran worlds. After the Confederacy arrests Raynor for destroying Confederate property, despite the fact that it had been infested by the Zerg, the player joins Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal. Raynor, who is freed by Mengsk's troops, also joins and frequently accompanies the player on missions. Mengsk then begins to use Confederate technology captured on Mar Sara to lure the Zerg to Confederate installations and further his own goals. After forcing Confederate general Edmund Duke to join him, Mengsk sacrifices his own second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan, to ensure the destruction of the Confederacy by luring the Zerg to the Confederate capital Tarsonis. Raynor is outraged by Mengsk's true aims of obtaining power at any cost and deserts, taking with him <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> the former colonial militia of Mar Sara. Mengsk reorganizes what remains of the Terran population into the Terran Dominion, crowning himself as emperor.|$|E

25|$|For the Tibetan campaign, the Yongzheng Emperor sent {{an army of}} 230,000 led by Nian Gengyao {{against the}} Dzungars and their army of 80,000. Due to geography, the Qing army (although {{superior}} in numbers) was at first unable to engage their more mobile enemy. Eventually, they engaged the Dzungars and defeated them. This campaign cost the treasury at least eight million silver taels. Later in the Yongzheng Emperor's reign, he sent <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> 10,000 to fight the Dzungars again. However, that army was annihilated and the Qing Empire faced the danger of losing control of Mongolia. A Khalkha ally of the Qing Empire would later defeat the Dzungars.|$|E
25|$|Benavides was {{appointed}} to the Captaincy General of Yucatán when war with England flared up again.

He led <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> regulars, reinforced by the peasant militia, with orders to defend the coasts of Honduras and Tabasco, and to protect the ports chosen to supply the ships of the Royal Spanish Navy. The dispute was eventually settled by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, part of the wider settlement of the War of the Austrian Succession. With the Spanish implementation of the treaty, Benavides continued his efforts to repel the pirates and privateers preying on Spanish ships.|$|E

When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity.

25|$|Cuccia's {{careless}} remark {{has passed}} into {{history as the}} catalyst for Mussolini's war on the Mafia. Mussolini firmly established his power in January 1925; he appointed Cesare Mori as the Prefect of Palermo in October 1925 and granted him special powers to fight the Mafia. Mori formed <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> policemen, carabinieri and militiamen, which went {{from town to town}} rounding up suspects. To force suspects to surrender, they would take their families hostage, sell off their property, or publicly slaughter their livestock. By 1928, more than 11,000 suspects were arrested. Confessions were sometimes extracted through beatings and torture. Some mafiosi who had been on the losing end of Mafia feuds voluntarily cooperated with prosecutors, perhaps as a way of obtaining protection and revenge. Charges of Mafia association were typically leveled at poor peasants and gabellotti (farm leaseholders), but were avoided when dealing with major landowners. Many were tried en masse. More than 1,200 were convicted and imprisoned, and many others were internally exiled without trial.|$|E

After receiving their orders they took the road to Córdoba to confront Liniers. Similar to the armies in the French Revolution, they were accompanied by the Junta's representative (political command), Hipólito Vieytes as commissioner and for the army's comptroller Feliciano Chiclana, who reached the army later on 28 July at Fraile Muerto and continued to Salta with a small guard, where he was named governor of Salta and Tucumán. The military command was subject to the political representative and he to the Junta through the Secretary of War Mariano Moreno. Vieytes carried instructions to arrange in each province for elections so the people could designate their representative to the new Junta.|$|E
25|$|After {{hearing about}} the incident, the Douglas County sheriff Samuel L. Jones journeyed to Hickory Point to investigate. Jones was a pro-slavery {{advocate}} and so he let Coleman go free while he arrested Dow's affiliate, Jacob Branson, for disturbing the peace. Branson, however, was eventually rescued by Free-Staters, causing the pro-slavery faction to seethe with anger. Within a matter of days, {{the governor of the}} Kansas Territory, Wilson Shannon, called for the Kansas militia to settle the issue, but this resulted in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> 1,500 Missourians entering Kansas. The group, led by Jones, made their way to Lawrence, prepared to eradicate the free-staters. Meanwhile, the citizens of Lawrence, bracing for the impending battle, raised up a militia of 800 men. Dr. Charles Robinson was commander-in-chief of the city's troops, and the future state senator James Lane was appointed as his second-in-command. The citizens of Lawrence were also aided by the abolitionist John Brown and his sons. However, the Missourians never attacked, and the Lawrencians and the Missourians were encouraged by the governor to sign a peace treaty. Such an agreement was finally made in December of 1855, and eventually the Missouri army reluctantly left the area.|$|E

Nguyễn Huệ sent two other generals to suppress Vu Van Nham and recaptured Thăng Long. Meanwhile, Lê Chiêu Thống fled to the furthest north of Vietnam and refused Nguyễn Huệ's invitations to return. He gathered <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>army</b> <b>of</b> Lê dynasty loyalists and sent his family to China to seek aid from the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Empire. The Qianlong Emperor agreed and sent a massive army to north Vietnam. Under the banner of the Lê king, the large Qing army easily drove Tây Sơn out of north Vietnam and took over Thăng Long. After the Qing occupation of northern Vietnam, the Qing viceroy Sun Shiyi reinstalled Lê Chiêu Thống as a puppet ruler.
