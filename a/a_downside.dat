5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. This was particularly significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had <b>a</b> <b>downside,</b> in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E
25|$|Gravano's {{success was}} not without <b>a</b> <b>downside.</b> First, his quick rise up the Gambino {{hierarchy}} {{attracted the attention of}} the FBI, and he was soon placed under surveillance.

Nevertheless, Gravano claimed to be kicking up over $2million each year to Gotti out of his union activities alone.|$|E

25|$|Most {{countries}} have breed descriptions that {{say that the}} Irish Terrier should not be more than 48cm measured at the withers. However, {{it is not unusual}} to see females that are 50cm tall or dogs that are even 53cm (20in). Younger generations are closer to the ideal, but there is <b>a</b> <b>downside</b> to this: when an Irish Terrier is very small and light-boned, it loses the correct racy type.|$|E
25|$|During <b>a</b> <b>downside</b> regime, a {{large number}} of investors who have held {{positions}} in riskier assets such as equities or real estate may seek refuge in ‘safer’ investments such as cash or bonds. This is also known as a flight-to-quality effect and investors tend to exit their positions in riskier assets in large numbers {{in a short period of}} time. As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater on the downside as opposed to the upside and this may have disastrous effects on the economy.|$|E

500|$|The {{rules for}} the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the {{significance}} of achievements being recognized has been [...] "tested by time". In practice, {{it means that the}} lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. For example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s. As <b>a</b> <b>downside</b> of this approach, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a prize, as the discoverers die by the time the impact of their work is appreciated.|$|E
500|$|United Abominations {{received}} generally positive reviews, and {{was thought}} of as a return to form for Megadeth by critics. Don Kaye of Blabbermouth.net said the album [...] "is an unabashedly guitar-driven album, stuffed with riffs and leads coming from all directions. The sense of explosive instrumentation under precise control that was a hallmark of early Megadeth efforts is back, which means that Megadeth, in many ways, is back too." [...] About.com reviewer Chad Bowar stated the album [...] "is the best Megadeth album in at least a decade." [...] Greg Prato of AllMusic praised the album, stating [...] "Megadeth's crunchy, venomous thrash has remained intact. Megadeth were never afraid to show off their prog-worthy chops, and the 2007 lineup appears custom-made for tackling 'tricky bits'. Mustaine and company certainly sound reborn." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer Evan Serpick noted <b>a</b> <b>downside</b> to the album, stating it sounded too much like all of the band's previous albums. Ed Thompson of IGN praised the album and its political lyrics, saying it [...] "cranks out so much attitude, so much opinion, and so much firebranded speech that the album could be mistaken for a political rally." [...] Commenting on the Megadeth's new lineup, Jon Weiderhorn from MTV said [...] "Once again, the system is fully operational." [...] In a less enthusiastic review, BBC Music's Eamonn Stack wrote that even though the thrash musicianship is evident, the edge has been [...] "sacrificed for the sake of speed and technical playing". United Abominations was voted the best metal album of 2007 by the reader's poll in the June 2008 issue of Guitar World and the Brave Pick of 2007 by Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles.|$|E

2500|$|However, like anything, {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>downside.</b> [...] Implant {{dentures}} {{tend to be}} fairly expensive. A cost of $15,000 to $30,000 for complete upper and lower implant dentures is not uncommon. [...] Most dental insurance plans do not cover {{the total cost of}} implant dentures. Possible rejection of the implanted abutment can happen. If there is not enough bone, bone grafting may be required. Minimally invasive surgery may also be required.

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} World War II, as the need for armored {{vehicles}} was realized, designers were faced with {{the problem of how to}} power the vehicles, and turned to using aircraft engines, among them radial types. The radial aircraft engines provided greater power-to-weight ratios and were more reliable than conventional inline vehicle engines available at the time. [...] This reliance had <b>a</b> <b>downside</b> though: if the engines were mounted vertically, as in the M3 Lee and M4 Sherman, their comparatively large diameter gave the tank a higher silhouette than designs using inline engines.|$|E
2500|$|Forward stance: Suitable {{for most}} purposes, both feet are angled forward. Frequently the leading foot is angled roughly 15° to 21° and the {{trailing}} foot at 0° to 10°. <b>A</b> <b>downside</b> {{is that a}} rider's balance is notably different when riding in reverse compared to their forward stance. [...] This can be compensated for by learning how to ride backwards with this stance, also known as riding [...] "switch", or by choosing another stance such as Duck, or Flat stance. As riders become more experienced, they can experiment with different [...] "stances" [...] to feel {{what is best for}} them.|$|E

2500|$|In-ear {{monitors}} offer considerable isolation for {{the performer}} using them, {{meaning that the}} monitor engineer can craft a much more accurate and clear mix for the performer. With in-ear monitors, each performer can be sent their own customized mix; although {{this was also the}} case with monitor speakers, the in-ear monitors of one performer cannot be heard by the other musicians. <b>A</b> <b>downside</b> of this isolation is that the performer cannot hear the crowd or the comments other performers on stage that do not have microphones (e.g., if the bass player wishes to communicate to the drummer). [...] This has been remedied by larger productions by setting up a pair of microphones {{on each side of the}} stage facing the audience that are mixed into the in-ear monitor sends.|$|E

As <b>a</b> <b>downside</b> of this approach, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a Prize, as the discoverers may have died by the time the impact of their work is realized.

2500|$|An {{additional}} {{method of}} long-term ocean-based sequestration is to gather crop residue such as corn stalks or excess hay into large weighted bales of biomass and deposit {{it in the}} alluvial fan areas of the deep ocean basin. [...] Dropping these residues in alluvial fans would cause the residues to be quickly buried in silt on the sea floor, sequestering the biomass for very long time spans. [...] Alluvial fans exist {{in all of the}} world's oceans and seas where river deltas fall {{off the edge of the}} continental shelf such as the Mississippi alluvial fan in the gulf of Mexico and the Nile alluvial fan in the Mediterranean Sea. <b>A</b> <b>downside,</b> however, would be an increase in aerobic bacteria growth due to the introduction of biomass, leading to more competition for oxygen resources in the deep sea, similar to the oxygen minimum zone.|$|E
30|$|<b>As</b> another <b>downside</b> of our approach, {{so far only}} {{quadratic}} eigenvalue {{problems can}} be solved, for truly nonlinear problems with ω dependence in K the methods is not directly applicable. On the other hand, the method {{can be applied to}} fluid or structure subsystems separately, or to the complete coupled system, and it tolerates a singular mass matrix.|$|R
50|$|Software {{transactional}} memory provides transactional memory semantics in {{a software}} runtime library or the programming language, and requires minimal hardware support (typically an atomic compare and swap operation, or equivalent). <b>As</b> the <b>downside,</b> software implementations usually {{come with a}} performance penalty, when compared to hardware solutions.

Hayden said, [...] "There are those out there who can {{take a look at}} this... and maybe even attempt to turn it to their own purposes". In the same report, Sean McGurk, a former cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security noted that the Stuxnet source code could now be downloaded online and modified to be directed at new target systems.

2500|$|Oakey's {{first move}} was to invite guitarist and {{keyboard}} player Ian Burden from the tour back {{to join the}} band full-time. As a trained musician, not only were Burden's keyboard skills vastly superior to Oakey and Wright's but he instantly {{proved to be an}} adept songwriter and composer as well. Virgin had suggested that Oakey needed professional production and paired him with veteran producer Martin Rushent, an expert on emerging music technologies of the time. Because of the [...] "unhealthy" [...] atmosphere at Monumental Studios in Sheffield caused by the Human League sharing it with new band Heaven 17 (containing ex-Human League members Ware and Marsh), Rushent moved the band to his Genetic Sound Studios in Reading. In addition Rushent's studios were better-equipped for the type of music the band was making. <b>A</b> <b>downside</b> would be that the distance would cause problems for Sulley and Catherall who were taking their final school exams and had to be bussed down from Sheffield regularly.|$|E
2500|$|White {{offers a}} pawn {{to divert the}} black e-pawn. If Black accepts the gambit, White has two main plans. The first is to play d4 and Bxf4, regaining the gambit pawn with central domination. The {{alternative}} plan is to play Nf3 and Bc4 followed by 0-0, when the semi-open f-file allows White to barrel down onto the weakest point in Black's position, the pawn on f7. Theory has shown {{that in order for}} Black to maintain the gambit pawn, he may well be forced to weaken his , with moves such as ...g5 or odd piece placement (e.g. ...Nf6–h5). <b>A</b> <b>downside</b> to the King's Gambit is that White weakens his own king's position, exposing it to the latent threat of ...Qh4+ (or ...Be7–h4+). With a black pawn on f4, White cannot usually respond to the check with g3, but if the king is forced to move then it also loses the right to castle.|$|E
