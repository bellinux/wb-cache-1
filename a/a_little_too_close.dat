Though initially praising its visuals and setting, Mackey found the puzzles {{to be very difficult}} and [...] "there's simply too much going on to give me the proper feedback about what I'm getting wrong", suggesting that [...] "Blow was maybe <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to his work".|$|E
500|$|Other {{commentators}} {{discussed the}} more complex psychological causes of Brandon's murder. Halberstam commented on the complicated causes of the murder, and whether {{it was due to}} transphobia or homophobia: [...] "Ultimately in Boys , the double vision of the transgender subject gives way to the universal vision of humanism, the transgender man and his lover become lesbians and the murder seems instead to be the outcome of vicious homophobic rage." [...] Ebert called the film a [...] "sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the flame".|$|E
500|$|Kaspersky said {{anonymity}} on the Internet {{could be}} protected by using a proxy, whereby a responsible international body maintains a record of which online identities correspond to which real-world ones. For example, a person's identity would be revealed in cases of malicious activity. Some security experts believe that a centralized database of the real-world identities of Internet users would be [...] "a privacy disaster and a highly attractive target for thieves." [...] The Age said it [...] "sounds <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> for comfort to a Big Brother scenario" [...] and Wired said Kaspersky's views were highly aligned with the Russian government's agenda.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s the journal {{has been closed}} to {{unsolicited}} submissions. This policy was described by Jeffrey Williams, editor of Minnesota Review, as one that [...] "seems <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>closed,</b> and would go {{in the opposite direction}} of taking chances". boundary 2 has published special issues focusing on postmodernism in individual countries such as Greece or Canada, as well as a book of articles previously published in the journal. In an interview published in the Minnesota Review, Spanos describes the history of the journal, its financial and editorial problems, and the motivations for various changes over the years, including the journals practice of publishing articles by invitation only, refusing unsolicited submissions.|$|R
50|$|Some {{people who}} have seen the race feel that Dance in the Mood's loss may have in part been her jockey's error in judgement. Her jockey, Yutaka Take did not seem aware of the {{location}} of the Hollywood Park turf course finish line, and made a move that was just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the finish line to result in victory.|$|R

In all that requires something more than usual, a deficiency; in all that is deemed an average, better than common. The tendency is to raise every thing that is elsewhere degraded to a respectable height, when there commences an attraction of gravitation that draws all towards the centre; <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>closer</b> <b>too</b> than could be wished perhaps." ...|$|R
500|$|Still Alice {{is based}} on a novel of the same name {{published}} in 2007. The novel was written by Lisa Genova, a neuroscientist who was inspired by her grandmother's development of Alzheimer's disease to write about the disease from a firsthand perspective. British film producers Lex Lutzus and James Brown bought the rights to a film adaptation of the novel and pitched the project to their friends, filmmaking partners and married couple Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, in 2011. Glatzer and Westmoreland were initially hesitant to write and direct the film because Glatzer had just been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); they thought that writing about Alzheimer's disease, another neurodegenerative disease, [...] "may be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the bone". They ultimately took up the offer and wrote a screenplay based on Genova's novel in early 2012. Elements of the story were lifted from Glatzer's experience with ALS and Westmoreland's role as his primary caregiver.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} over Andrew Lincoln's performance. Despite citing {{that his}} accent was [...] "dodgy", Pierce lauded Lincoln's acting. [...] "his body language and expression here is totally different {{now than when}} we saw him before," [...] he opined. [...] "He's a fast learner." [...] Gilbert referred to his accent as [...] "spotty", while Goldman professed that Lincoln fit into character very well; [...] "For much of the pilot, he's {{on his own and}} exudes a lot of believable, shocked emotion, as Rick tries to process what he is seeing. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln's performance was one of the episode's drawbacks. He wrote: [...] "One drawback in [...] is that Lincoln plays his emotion <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to his deputy's badge. We're told– by him– that all he wants to do is find his wife and kid. His belief that they still are alive is the emotional drive of the story, but there's not enough deep pain that seeps up to coat the dialogue Lincoln delivers." ...|$|E
500|$|Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. James Bernard of Entertainment Weekly preferred the album's Southern hip hop over [...] "Arrested Development's suspiciously peppy, idealized version of down-home" [...] and stated, [...] "it's about time someone told today's weed-obsessed youth to 'get up, {{get out and}} get something/Don't spend all your time trying to get high.'" [...] Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times cited [...] "Git Up, Git Out" [...] as the album's highlight and commended the duo's [...] "sauntering, hard-core tales of the 'hood", writing that they [...] "bristle with clever humor and sharp insights rather than rage." [...] Rob Marriott of The Source complimented the duo's [...] "organic" [...] P-Funk influence and praised their lyrics' honesty, commenting that [...] "while their rhyme style may swing <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to Hiero for my comfort, what really makes this album so listenable is that... truthfulness reigns." [...] However, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] rating in his consumer guide for The Village Voice.|$|E
5000|$|Pauline [...] "Polly" [...] Emerson, {{portrayed by}} actress Sophia Di Martino from 2009 to 2011, is an {{ambulance}} technician. She's {{described by the}} BBC as: [...] "a superhero; she wants to save the world. The only problem is Polly is young, idealistic and needs {{to learn that the}} world is a complicated place and not everyone wants to be healed." [...] Di Martino had previously appeared in supporting roles in both Casualty and spin-off Holby City. She auditioned three times for the part, and had to cease studying for her Masters degree in Applied Theatre when cast. She commented on her casting: [...] "I feel very lucky to be joining such a long-running and well-established drama. I'm looking forward to Polly bursting onto screens, and hope viewers find her as much fun as I do." [...] Series producer Oliver Kent added: [...] "Sophia is a brilliant actress and we're very excited that she's joining us. We can't wait for the audience to see her - they're going to love her." [...] Di Martino describes Polly as [...] "very optimistic. She sees the best in everyone. She's fun, opinionated, brave and sometimes gets <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to her patients." [...] After the suicide of homeless man Alistair MacCormack, who was infatuated with Polly, Polly was suspended while a full inquiry into his death was undertaken, after evidence given against her by Alistair's best friend, Abe, who believed that Polly should lose something that she really loved - her job - as revenge.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{describes}} a narrator whose woman had recently {{walked out on}} him, wanting {{him to be a}} better man. The narrator keeps stating in his mind that he should have done something for the woman: [...] "I should've done this and I should've done that / I should've been there then she'd have never left / I should've been hangin' on to every word she ever had to say / But it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> late, she's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> gone / She's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> right, I'm <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> wrong / Now {{would be a good time}} to change / But it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> late." ...|$|R

500|$|Cold Feets {{cast and}} crew were {{frequently}} praised for their depiction of real-life social issues on the series. When Cold Feet began, Christine Langan stated, [...] "The real challenge was to overcome the traditional view {{that many of the}} issues we cover—jealousy, guilt, money, sexual problems, parental death—are ordinary issues, hardy perennials and, as such, not interesting enough for drama." [...] The fourth episode of the first series was controversial due to its depiction of the characters freely discussing their sex lives; in the left-wing New Statesman, Andrew Billen praised it as a homage to La Ronde and, despite the sex-talk, being [...] "intricately constructed as a farce". The right-wing tabloid Daily Mails critic wrote that the episode [...] "veered <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> last night towards the category of 'adult entertainment', with all its connotations of sleaze and smut" [...] and [...] "we found ourselves immersed in their sex lives on a level of embarrassing intimacy which most people would share only with their doctor". A complaint was made by a viewer to the Independent Television Commission—the commercial television regulator—about the depiction of sex, but it was not upheld.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers were {{positive}} towards the way Boys Don't Cry portrayed its subject matter. and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times listed Boys Don't Cry {{as one of}} the five best films of 1999, saying, [...] "this could have been a clinical movie of the week, but instead it's a sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the flame". Janet Maslin of The New York Times said the film was [...] "stunning" [...] and gave it four stars out of four stars. Maslin said, [...] "unlike most films about mind-numbing tragedy, this one manages to be full of hope". Kenneth Turan of The Los Angeles Times praised the lack of romanticization and dramatization of the characters, and wrote, [...] "Peirce and Bienen and the expert cast engage us in the actuality of these rootless, hopeless, stoned-out lives without sentimentalizing or romanticizing them" [...] and that [...] "Boys Don't Cry is an exceptional—and exceptionally disturbing film". Mike Clarke of USA Today commended Peirce's depth of knowledge of the case and the subject matter, writing, [...] "Peirce seems to have researched her subject with grad-school-thesis intensity".|$|E
2500|$|Reviews {{were mainly}} positive, praising the band for the album's {{progression}} and originality {{in the midst}} of declining creativity in contemporary metal. Moreno was quoted as saying, [...] "It's all on record. We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't going to be with them". In reviewing Deftones, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "Hexagram", the album's opener, [...] "hits hard—harder than they ever have, revealing how mushy Staind is, or how toothless Linkin Park is". He also went on to say, however, that the album [...] "sticks <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to familiar territory". The A.V. Club similarly called the album [...] "less rewarding than its predecessor, though its peaks rival any in the genre".|$|E

5000|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the album consisted of mixed reviews, a negative one by Kenneth Nguyen from The Age, stating the album [...] "comes across as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> old-fashioned, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> polite, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> - may I say it? - too Hilary Duff." ...|$|R
5000|$|John Ottinger III from Black Gate {{comments}} that [...] "Greenwood has played <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> long and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> roughly {{with his best}} character.

2500|$|The {{attraction}} drew {{criticism in}} the press for being in poor taste due to the region's experience with mine disasters. Washington Post writer Peter Galuszka (author {{of a book on}} the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster) said that the attraction [...] "hits <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to home for me" [...] since [...] "The idea of abandonment is a difficult topic for miners. At Kings Dominion, the suggestion of living miners left to die is meant to inject some enjoyable dramatic tension", while in the Washington Monthly, Kathleen Geier decried that [...] "agonizing deaths are being served up for fun and profit to the gawking, peanut-crunching masses" [...] and asked [...] "What next— a thrill ride based on the Rana Plaza factory disaster in Bangladesh? Auschwitz: The Theme Park?".|$|E
2500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today {{wrote that}} {{unlike many other}} HBO productions, [...] "Temple is an {{incredibly}} joyous and often humorous film." [...] While praising the direction and the strong supporting cast of Catherine O'Hara, David Strathairn, and Julia Ormond, Bianco declared that [...] "as good as everything is around them, Temple Grandin belongs to two women: the real Temple, {{who appears to be}} a spectacular human being, and Danes, who is clearly a spectacular actor." [...] The A.V. Club's Noel Murray, himself the father of an autistic son, wrote that [...] "some of the movie's aesthetic choices border on the cliché. The pulsing minimalism of Alex Wurman's score has become as much a shorthand for 'intellectual mystery' as Arabic wailing has for 'Danger! Terrorists!,' and Temple Grandins illustrative animated sequences run <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to A Beautiful Mind for my taste." [...] However, Murray gave the film an A-, in part for Danes' success in portraying Grandin as a full-fledged personality instead of [...] "a checklist of symptoms gleaned from a medical journal." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sartre cites a café waiter, whose {{movements}} and conversation are <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> [...] "waiter-esque". His voice oozes with an eagerness to please; he carries food rigidly and ostentatiously; [...] "his movement is quick and forward, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> precise, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> rapid". His exaggerated behaviour illustrates {{that he is}} play acting as a waiter, as an object in the world: an automaton whose essence {{is to be a}} waiter. But that he is obviously acting belies that he is aware that he is not (merely) a waiter, but is rather consciously deceiving himself.|$|R

5000|$|Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress rated it 2.5/5 {{stars and}} called it [...] "a slickly produced, low-budget, faith-based thriller that's light on the thrills and heavy on the faith". [...] In rating it 5/10 stars, George Tiller of PopMatters wrote, [...] "So what we wind up with is a muddled bit of Southern Gothic lite that somehow manages {{to be a pretty}} enjoyable movie." [...] David Cornelius of DVD Talk rated it 2/5 and criticized the film's {{transition}} from drama to supernatural thriller. Cornelius described it as [...] "always just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> melodramatic, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> hokey, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> saccharine".|$|R
