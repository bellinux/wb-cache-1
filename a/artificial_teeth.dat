500|$|In the 1950s {{research}} was being conducted at Cambridge University in England on blood flow in living organisms. These workers devised {{a method of}} constructing a chamber of titanium which was then embedded into the soft tissue of the ears of rabbits. In 1952 the Swedish orthopaedic surgeon, Per-Ingvar Brånemark, was interested in studying bone healing and regeneration. During his research time at Lund University he adopted the Cambridge designed [...] "rabbit ear chamber" [...] {{for use in the}} rabbit femur. Following the study, he attempted to retrieve these expensive chambers from the rabbits and found that he was unable to remove them. Brånemark observed that bone had grown into such close proximity with the titanium that it effectively adhered to the metal. Brånemark carried out further studies into this phenomenon, using both animal and human subjects, which all confirmed this unique property of titanium. Leonard Linkow, in the 1950s, {{was one of the first}} to insert titanium and other metal implants into the bones of the jaw. <b>Artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> were then attached to these pieces of metal. In 1965 Brånemark placed his first titanium dental implant into a human volunteer. He began working in the mouth as it was more accessible for continued observations and there was a high rate of missing teeth in the general population offered more subjects for widespread study. He termed the clinically observed adherence of bone with titanium as [...] "osseointegration".|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of purified human plasma fibronectin (Fn) with bacteria was studied {{with a variety}} of oral streptococci. Each of the strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis tested was aggregated by Fn to various degrees, depending on the concentration of Fn added to the test mixtures. Binding assays performed with radiolabeled Fn and various strains of streptococci demonstrated various capabilities to bind Fn, and the amount of Fn bound by each strain was paralleled by its Fn-induced aggregation, with S. mutans 6715 giving the highest values in both assays. Because of the avid binding of Fn by certain strains of potentially cariogenic streptococci, we investigated the possibility that Fn may be present in human saliva and may be adsorbed from saliva onto <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> pellicles. Immunoreactive Fn was detected in paraffin-stimulated whole saliva by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of saliva adsorbed onto gelatin-coated cuvettes and by immunoelectroblots (Western blots) of salivary components separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gels. Furthermore, immunoreactive Fn was found to be present in <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> pellicles formed by incubating hydroxyapatite beads with whole human saliva. These results demonstrate that certain strains of oral streptococci bind to and are aggregated by Fn. The presence of Fn in <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> pellicles suggests that this macromolecule {{may play a role in}} the attachment of potentially cariogenic and other oral streptococci to dental tissues...|$|R

Failures of implant–abutment connections are relatively frequent clinical problems. So there is a need of analysis of dental implant abutment.

50|$|Researchers {{produced}} an <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> whose microstructure mimicked {{that of a}} real tooth. The outer layers, corresponding to enamel, were hard and structurally complex.

Hardness and durability approximated that of both the enamel and dentine of a tooth.|$|R
40|$|The modern dental endosseous {{implants}} {{include some}} parts {{which can be}} mounted at successive time steps of the tooth replacement. Due to their different requirements - mechanical, aesthetic or related to the comfort -the parts can be profitably constituted by different materials, homogeneous or composite. A crucial component is the abutment connecting the "artificial root" integrated into the bone to the artificial tooth: it is subjected high to axial and transversal loads and preferably it must be clear or semi-transparent because the <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> is not completely opaque. Some composite materials have been tested and compared with the classic components made of titanium alloy. Preliminary in vivo long term analysis on the bone surrounding the implants show that the bone re-absorption rate decreases for the implants equipped with some composite abutments.
