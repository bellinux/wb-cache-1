5|$|Langdon Brown Gilkey {{explained}} religious language <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> {{terms of}} symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which {{distinguish it from}} other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of John Douglas junior's school education. He gained {{knowledge}} <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> his father's building yard and workshop which were attached to the family house. In the mid or late 1840s he was articled to E. G. Paley, of Sharpe and Paley, architects in Lancaster, Lancashire. When his articles were completed, Douglas became Paley's chief assistant. In either 1855 or 1860 he established his own office at No.6Abbey Square, Chester.|$|E

That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two problems at the LJS: first, he felt that the students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and second, he felt that the students did not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E

This dissertation examined mothers' and fathers' perceptions of early (prenatal and postnatal) attachment in relationship to expectations for <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> childbirth as a variable for successful learning. The participants were obtained from three area hospitals, Evanston Northwestern, Sherman, and Rockford Memorial, and consisted of 65 couples who were primarily Caucasian, middle-class, and between 26 and 34 years of age. The study examined differences between mothers' and fathers' perceptions of early attachment expectations <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> childbirth. It also examined relationships between early attachment and expectations for <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> childbirth for mothers and for fathers separately. Finally, differences between primipara parents (parents with one child) and multipara parents (parents with more than one child) in regard to early attachment <b>and</b> expectations <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> childbirth were studied. The participants completed questionnaires during their third trimester consisting of a demographic questionnaire, Cranley's Maternal/Paternal Fetal Attachment Scale, and the Childbirth Expectations Questionnaire. After delivery they completed the Childbirth Experiences Questionnaire. Finally, when the infant was six-weeks old they filled out the My Baby Scale. Results indicated that there were differences for mothers and fathers with regard to prenatal attachment <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> childbirth. There were positive relationships between prenatal and postnatal attachment, between expectations for <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> childbirth, <b>and</b> between <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> childbirth <b>and</b> postnatal attachment for both mothers and fathers. There was a positive correlation for mothers between prenatal attachment <b>and</b> their <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> childbirth. There were differences between primiparas and multiparas as it related to expectations for childbirth only. This study has implications for practice. The results suggest that parents' expectations for childbirth may enhance their <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> childbirth. This in turn may increase postnatal attachment and the development of secure infant/young child and parent attachment relationships. Secure attachment has been linked to positive outcomes for children in the area of socioemotional learning such as peer cooperation and less aggressive behaviors and cognitive learning such as memory retention, emergent literacy, and information processing...|$|R
5|$|In mid-December, as Totti began regaining form post-injury, {{he started}} playing more regularly, {{often in a}} {{creative}} role as an attacking midfielder. On 12 December, he set up Daniele De Rossi's opening goal in a 1–1 home draw against eventual league champions Juventus, although Totti missed a second-half penalty during the match. He provided several more assists that season, notably for Dani Osvaldo's goal in Roma's 3–1 win over Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 18 December 2011, and also set up De Rossi's goal against Catania at the Massimino stadium. Playing in a deeper position on the pitch, the Roma talisman did not seek to score goals as often, opting rather to play more of a supporting role by bridging the gap between attack and midfield, using his presence, leadership <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> games to offer some much needed depth to the team.|$|E
5|$|Nasr was a {{military}} leader with long service <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> Khurasan. As early as 705 he participated in a campaign along the upper Oxus River, led by Salih, the brother of Qutayba ibn Muslim, the general who had been tasked with subduing Transoxiana. For his service during this campaign, Nasr was awarded an entire village in this region. Despite the successes of Qutayba, much of Central Asia east of the Oxus remained outside effective Arab control; while garrisons had been established in places like Samarkand, Balkh, or Bukhara, the Caliphate largely relied on cliental relationships with the multitude of local rulers, who became tributary to the Umayyads. In addition, clashes with the Chinese-backed Turgesh, the ambiguous policy followed regarding conversion of the native population (mass conversions would lessen the taxable population and hence the amount of tribute received) and increasing inter-Arab tribal factionalism weakened Umayyad control over the region and necessitated increased military activity.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{evolved from}} plane to spatial geometry, to ruled geometry. These {{constructional}} forms are highly {{suited to the}} use of cheap materials such as brick. Gaudí frequently used brick laid with mortar in successive layers, as in the traditional Catalan vault, using the brick laid flat instead of on its side. This quest for new structural solutions culminated between 1910 and 1920, when he exploited his research <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> his masterpiece, the Sagrada Família. Gaudí conceived the interior of the church {{as if it were a}} forest, with a set of tree-like columns divided into various branches to support a structure of intertwined hyperboloid vaults. He inclined the columns so they could better resist the perpendicular pressure on their section. He also gave them a double-turn helicoidal shape (right turn and left turn), as in the branches and trunks of trees. This created a structure that is now known as fractal. Together with a modulation of the space that divides it into small, independent and self-supporting modules, it creates a structure that perfectly supports the mechanical traction forces without need for buttresses, as required by the neo-Gothic style. Gaudí thus achieved a rational, structured and perfectly logical solution, creating at the same time a new architectural style that was original, simple, practical and aesthetic.|$|E

5|$|In Fire Emblem Fates, {{the player}} begins by {{customizing}} the main character. Their gender, appearance, and name {{can be changed}} to the player's preference. At the game's beginning, there are three difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Lunatic. There are also modes that dictate the fate of characters in battle should they be defeated. In Classic Mode, a fallen unit is subject to permanent death, a recurring mode in the Fire Emblem series that removes fallen characters {{from the rest of}} the game. Casual Mode enables units to be revived at the end of a battle. The new Phoenix mode revives units on the following player turn. Each version of Fates is focused around a different gameplay style. The gameplay of Birthright is similar to the prior installment Fire Emblem Awakening and features opportunities to gain extra gold <b>and</b> <b>experience.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, Conquest rewards players limited experience and currency per completed map. Also included are additional objectives in battle such as defending a base or suppressing enemy forces, and some levels have a limited number of turns. Revelation uses a mixture of elements from Birthright and Conquest: while offering opportunities for gold and experience as with Birthright, it provides varied objectives and strategic elements similar to Conquest.|$|E
