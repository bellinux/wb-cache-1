5|$|On September 23, 2012, Smith {{lost his}} 19-year-old brother {{due to a}} {{motorcycle}} accident. Tevin Chris Jones was riding on Route 672 in Westmoreland County, Virginia, when he ran off {{the right side of}} the roadway and struck a utility pole, according to the Virginia State Police. Jones was pronounced dead at the scene. He was wearing a helmet, and <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> not a factor. The accident is still under investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of prohibition of <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> {{a major issue}} in South Carolina during Tillman's governorship. Tillman opposed banning alcohol, but was careful to speak well of temperance advocates, many of whom were women. The concern Tillman had with alcohol issues was that they divided the white community, leaving openings for black Republicans to exploit.|$|E
5|$|The temperance movement, {{which had}} been absorbed into the moralistic system of the Nonconformist chapels, caused a shift in social attitudes in the mid- to late-19th- and early-20th century Rhondda. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>was</b> looked down upon and so were the {{increasingly}} violent sports such as rugby, so young men looked for different and more acceptable pastimes. Voice choirs were a natural progression from chapel society, and brass bands would eventually gain acceptance by the movement.|$|E
5000|$|Denatured <b>alcohol</b> <b>is</b> a (relatively) environmentally-friendly {{fuel that}} does not leave a residue or soot. Denatured <b>alcohol</b> <b>is</b> {{commonly}} available at camping outfitters and hardware stores. Denatured <b>alcohol</b> <b>is</b> toxic to drink.|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, it became {{apparent}} that the facilities at Hampden were in need of renewal. As an amateur club, Queen's Park could not possibly fund the works, while Glasgow District Council withdrew funding and the UK Government decided not to fund it either. Queen's Park considered selling Hampden, but a public appeal and minor repair work kept Hampden open during the 1980s. The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, as <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> banned from football stadia in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Olds' {{fondness for}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> well known. John Darrell Sherwood, {{in his book}} Fast Movers: Jet Pilots and the Vietnam Experience, posits that Olds' heavy {{drinking}} hurt his post-Vietnam career. On July 12, 2001, Olds was arrested for {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol and resisting arrest near his home in Steamboat Springs. Olds, briefly hospitalized during the incident for facial cuts, pleaded guilty in return for charges of weaving and felony vehicular eluding being dropped. Olds was placed on one year probation, and ordered to pay almost $900in fines and costs, attend an alcohol education course, and perform 72hours of community service.|$|E
5|$|Substance misuse, {{dependence}} and withdrawal {{are associated with}} self-harm. Benzodiazepine dependence as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal is associated with self-harming behaviour in young people. Alcohol is a major risk factor for self-harm. A study which analysed self-harm presentations to emergency rooms in Northern Ireland found that <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> a major contributing factor and involved in 63.8% of self-harm presentations. A recent study in the relation between cannabis use and deliberate self-harm (DSH) in Norway and England found that, in general, cannabis use {{may not be a}} specific risk factor for DSH in young adolescents.|$|E

5|$|The brief {{appearance}} of Dr. Daumière, who warns Haddock to cease drinking <b>alcohol,</b> <b>was</b> {{an allusion to}} Hergé's own physician, Dr. Daumerie. Hergé made a comical reference to the French comedian Sacha Guitry in the story by advertising a play by Guitry titled Me in which Guitry himself plays every role.

5|$|The {{widespread}} {{consumption of}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> {{recognized as a}} problem by Dr. Eli Todd in 1812. In a conversation with Edward Hooker on March 30, 1812, he stated {{that there was no}} single solution to alcoholism. “He advised a 3-pronged attack that was as follows: there should be an association of respectable men who would make it unfashionable to take ardent spirits; work houses of ‘idle, drinking persons’ after their third conviction for drunkenness; and heavy taxes on imported and domestic liquor”.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E
50|$|All rubbing <b>alcohols</b> <b>are</b> unsafe {{for human}} consumption: {{isopropyl}} rubbing alcohols {{do not contain}} the ethyl alcohol of alcoholic beverages; ethyl rubbing <b>alcohols</b> <b>are</b> based on denatured <b>alcohol,</b> which <b>is</b> a combination of ethyl alcohol and one or more bitter poisons that make the substance toxic.|$|R
40|$|Background: Fatty <b>alcohols</b> <b>are</b> {{widely used}} in {{industrial}} chemicals. The biosynthetic pathways for fatty <b>alcohols</b> <b>are</b> diverse and widely existing in nature.

5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of <b>alcohol,</b> <b>was</b> suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, tens of {{thousands}} of tourists and residents were evacuated from the beach resorts in and around Cancún, the Riviera Maya, and Cozumel. Hotel guests were evacuated on Saturday afternoon, and staff on Sunday afternoon. Though some hotel guests in second floor rooms and above were given the option to be bussed into the center of Cancun to safe houses and shelters or to stay and wait out the storm in only the modern built hotels and resorts. Most of the remaining guests were restricted to their rooms and were not allowed out on the beach areas. No <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> sold in Cancun for 36hours prior to the arrival of the storm, in an attempt to avoid drunken tourists being injured during the night. Two helicopter pilots were killed when their aircraft crashed while evacuating offshore oil platforms operated by Pemex. A German resident was electrocuted while on his roof in Playa del Carmen.|$|E
5|$|Police {{raids on}} gay bars were frequent—occurring on average {{once a month}} for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to {{facilitate}} resuming business {{as quickly as possible}} if <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.|$|E
50|$|In {{many social}} {{situations}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>is</b> {{more than likely}} available. It <b>is</b> expected that <b>alcohol</b> <b>be</b> available at numerous social events including household parties, pubs, clubs, sporting events, during meals, celebrations and even funerals.|$|R
50|$|Alcoholic beverages, {{containing}} psychoactive ethyl <b>alcohol,</b> <b>are</b> produced legally {{throughout the}} world. Their production supports a commercial alcohol industry. Consumption of <b>alcohol</b> <b>is</b> subject to regulation in most countries, namely {{by means of}} age restrictions.|$|R
50|$|Sedatives and <b>alcohol</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} combined recreationally or carelessly. Since <b>alcohol</b> <b>is</b> {{a strong}} depressant that slows brain function and depresses respiration, the two substances compound each other's actions and this combination can prove fatal.|$|R
5|$|In 634 CE Gaza was {{besieged by}} the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As {{following}} the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It {{was captured by}} Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by 'Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, although its Byzantine garrison was massacred. The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city), which was later rebuilt by Sultan Baibars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century, {{a large segment of}} the population swiftly adopted Islam, Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i religious code, one of the four major Sunni Muslim schools of law (fiqh). Security, which was well-maintained during early Muslim rule, was the key to Gaza's prosperity. Although <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain wine production, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported mainly to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The first {{engagement}} that Australian {{troops were}} involved in during the Second World War came at Bardia, a major Italian military outpost {{in the north of}} Libya. The 16th Brigade broke through Bardia's western defensive perimeter at dawn on 3 January 1941, when the 2/1st Battalion breached the wire defences and swung left before advancing. The 2/2nd Battalion followed suit, swinging to the right, and the 2/3rd then moved straight through the breach. Late in the day, a counter-attack by Italian tanks threatened the 2/3rd Battalion's headquarters, until a hastily organised defensive action led by the commanding officer, England, and a platoon of anti-tank guns restored the situation. Meanwhile, the 17th Brigade led a diversion to the south. Although the 16th Brigade was able to capture Bardia in the late afternoon of 4 January, resistance continued, and fighting did not cease until the next morning. Over 40,000 Italians were captured along with significant amounts of equipment and material– including food and ammunition– which was in short supply. A significant amount of <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> also captured by the Australians in Italian dugouts inside the 2/3rd's position around Wadi-el-Ghereida. During this period, the 2/3rd lost five officers and 56 men killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized <b>alcohol</b> <b>was</b> an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E
