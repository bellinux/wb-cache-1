5|$|During the innings, Bill Edrich was on four when he edged Ray Lindwall to Johnson {{at first}} slip. Johnson got {{both hands to}} the ball <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> but dropped it. However, the dropped catch was not costly, as Edrich was {{dismissed}} for 18.|$|E
5|$|McCain was a {{prisoner}} of war in North Vietnam for {{five and a half years}} until his release on March 14, 1973. His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

5|$|His head {{hangs in}} exhaustion, {{and his hands}} bleed from the {{puncture}} wounds suffered during his nailing to the cross. His arms are placed higher <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and strain to carry {{the weight of his}} body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, the result of the contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.|$|E
5|$|His {{shooting}} accuracy {{combined with}} his long seven-foot frame and unique shooting mechanics, such as having a release point <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> makes contesting his jump shots very difficult. Before {{the start of the}} 2011 NBA Finals, LeBron James called Nowitzki's one-legged fadeaway the second most unstoppable move ever, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook.|$|E

60|$|So {{he spoke}} from on high, shaking <b>his</b> clenched fists <b>above</b> <b>his</b> hoary <b>head,</b> and was gone. Then the executioners unbound the limbs of the ex-king, and {{he rose from}} the stone of death.|$|R
50|$|In 1814 he was {{appointed}} Master of the Jewel Office in the Tower of London, a position he held until 1852. During his time there (in October, 1817) {{he claimed to have}} seen a ghostly apparition floating <b>above</b> <b>his</b> wife's <b>head</b> at dinner.|$|R

5|$|As Reyes brings William back to Scully's apartment, Comer's {{artifact}} flies over William and hovers <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Scully, realizing {{something is}} wrong, plans to drive William to somewhere safe. At the same time, Doggett notices the Overcoat Woman watching them nearby. As Scully and Reyes drive away, Doggett confronts {{the woman at}} gunpoint, but she runs him over. Scully places William {{under the care of}} The Lone Gunmen, but they are soon ambushed by the Overcoat Woman. With Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) incapacitated, the woman opens {{the back door of the}} van to find John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) holding William. The woman puts a gun to Byers' head.|$|E
5|$|Its {{main body}} is solid {{sterling}} silver and silver gilt, while its plinth {{is made of}} malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E
5|$|The Nandi in Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur is seen placed {{off centre}} as a {{testimony}} of Nandanar's devotion and the miracle. A stone {{image of the}} saint is worshipped in the temple. The Dvarapalas (gate-keeper sculptures) are depicted with his heads leaning downwards, {{said to be in}} honour of Nandanar. In 1959, a shrine was created outside the Shiva temple, from where the stone image of Nandanar looks eternally at Shiva. Nandanar is depicted with his hands joined <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> praying to Shiva. Scenes of Bharati's opera and the local legend of Nandanar and Ganesha digging the temple tank are seen on the shrine.|$|E

5000|$|Napoleon I (1769-1821), is standing, {{dressed in}} {{coronation}} robes {{similar to those}} of Roman emperors. Others are merely passive spectators. In the actual painting it is possible to see the outline of what was originally painted: Napoleon holding the crown <b>above</b> <b>his</b> own <b>head,</b> as if placing on himself.|$|R
60|$|His {{face was}} wet with the mist, {{and he had}} {{apparently}} oft wiped it with his hand or sleeve, for great streaks of dirt marked his cheeks and forehead, giving him a curious satanic expression, whilst his short lank hair obviously roughed up by impatient fingers, bristled <b>above</b> <b>his</b> square-built <b>head</b> like the coat of a shaggy dog.|$|R
5|$|The statue {{depicts a}} doughboy walking through {{shattered}} tree stumps strung with barbed wire, his rifle {{in his left}} hand and his right hand held high <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> clutching a hand grenade. The aggressive design and affordability of the statue made it extremely popular, and more than 150 copies of it were created for municipal memorials across the nation. The Smithsonian American Art Museum currently lists 159 locations. Of that number, 134 currently existing originals have been independently authenticated, and several have been identified as copies by other artists (notably Over the Top by John Paulding). Viquesney's actual brochures quoted a figure of over 300 by the late 1930s, claiming at least one in every state of the Union, but this is believed to be an inflated figure.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Harvey scored {{seven and}} struggled {{in contrast to}} the rest of the Australians, who prospered to total 632, laying the foundation for an innings victory. Harvey took three catches in the match, including two leaping catches in the second innings with his hands <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> His feats prompted the local spectators to say that such acrobatic catches had never been seen at The Oval. The home team's captain Stuart Surridge lofted a drive down the ground, and Harvey ran 25m from wide long-on and leapt in the air to catch the ball, which would have cleared the boundary. Harvey managed only 16 before being run out while batting with Bill Brown as Australia piled on 4/414 declared and defeated Cambridge University by an innings in the following match.|$|E
5|$|During {{the lunch}} interval, heavy rain fell, {{before the sun}} began to dry the pitch, making the ball skid through upon England's {{resumption}} at 13/1. Miller beat Washbrook's bat twice in one over soon after the resumption, {{but was unable to}} extract an edge. Lindwall reached his peak speed and Edrich edged to first slip, where Ian Johnson got both hands to the ball <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> but failed to hold on. Edrich was on four at the time and this was part of a 20-minute passage of play during which England was unable to score. The next ball from Lindwall, Washbrook was caught on the run by Brown on the fine leg boundary after attempting to hook a bouncer pitched on the line of leg stump. It was to be the first of several times that Washbrook was dismissed while hooking, attracting substantial criticism. Washbrook's fall left England at 15/2 after 41 minutes of batting and brought Compton to the crease to join Edrich. Compton square drove Miller to the boundary for four, which prompted a retaliatory bouncer and a negative crowd reaction. Edrich was not scoring quickly but he defied the bowling of Miller and Lindwall as the English pair took the score to 46. Likewise, Compton was restraining his natural inclination to attack in an attempt to rebuild the innings after the two early wickets. During this period Brown made a series of one-handed run-saving stops in the field. The rain had also softened up the pitch and as a result, the playing surface did not offer much bounce.|$|E
60|$|Hearing {{his mother}} speak with such strange passion, the baby howled. Mrs. Hughs stopped, {{and took him}} up. Pressing him close to her thin bosom, she looked <b>above</b> <b>his</b> little dingy <b>head</b> at the two young people.|$|R

Moti Guj knew well that it was the dearest thing on earth to Chihun. He swung out his trunk with a fascinating crook at the end, and the brown baby threw itself shouting upon it. Moti Guj made fast and pulled up till the brown baby was crowing in the air twelve feet <b>above</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>head.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Malagasy on the ship, {{seeing the}} signal fires, cut the anchor cable, {{allowing}} Meermin to drift shorewards, where she grounded on a sandbank. Crew member Rijk Meyer, who had earlier been thrown overboard and swum around {{the ship to}} the safety of the gunroom, now swam from the ship to the shore and was brought to Le Sueur. He informed Le Sueur that the Malagasy on the ship had told him to find out whether the earlier landing party was there, but that he had secretly arranged with the other crew members that, if help was available on shore, he would signal back to the ship by waving a handkerchief <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Six Malagasy and another crew member also left Meermin in a canoe, but a unit of the militia immediately surrounded the party when they landed. One Malagasy was shot dead and three others taken prisoner; the dead Malagasy was later identified by one of the ship's crew as the mutiny's overall ringleader, but his name was not recorded. Of the remaining two, one swam away and the other was believed either to have swum back to the ship or drowned in the attempt. Enraged by the crew's deception, the Malagasy still on Meermin launched an attack on the crew which lasted for three hours, but the crew were able to defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of listed {{structures}} in the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, including the 1720 wellhouse that supplied water to the hall until the 1860s, and the early-18th-century ornamental sundial in front of the hall, depicting a black slave clad in leaves, carrying the sundial <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The stable buildings, the slaughterhouse, the deer house, the orangery, and an ashlar shelter {{to the west of the}} hall, all date from the 17th or 18th century. Barn Cottages date from at least 1751. The cottages were originally a single barn, which was converted in the 19th century. Other grade II listed structures in the grounds of the hall include: the lakeside wall (18th century); two small piers south of the garden forecourt (18th century); a pier north west of the garden forecourt (18th century); the gateway opposite the kitchen (1750); the piers at the south of forecourt garden topped with lions (18th century); and an obelisk erected by George, 2nd Earl of Warrington, in 1714 in memory of his mother. Near the hall there is a Grade II* listed sawmill, probably built in 1616.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} traditions {{associated}} with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to {{the captain of the}} winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving the Cup, to hoist it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have a better view of the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted <b>above</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Art {{historian}} Alice Taylor describes Mesrop's work as [...] "less lively" [...] {{than other}} contemporaneous Khizan painters, but his [...] "settings {{are charged with}} life and energy". In one such painting, The Baptism of Christ, Jesus Christ is featured stepping {{on the head of}} a dragon that is swimming in a river. The scene around the baptized Christ is beneath a sky that appears to be melting, and a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, entering the soul of Christ from <b>above</b> of <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
50|$|When in {{possession}} of the Space Gem, Pip could theoretically access virtually incalculable powers, but chose to use it merely for transportation and teleportation. The gem gave him the ability to teleport to places he knows of. This he often used for his own ends, stealing the Fantasticar and other objects. When forced into battle, he tends to appear directly <b>above</b> <b>his</b> adversary's <b>head,</b> intending to deliver a powerful blow. He has since lost the Space Gem, but his long-term exposure to it has given him the innate ability to teleport.|$|R
5000|$|Pericles is {{depicted}} as an adult man with a Corinthian helmet. The helmet symbolised his military role as strategos. The Berlin copy is especially carefully executed. The helmet is cocked back, with short curly hair bursting out at the temples. The beard is tightly cropped with many small, well-ordered curls. Broad, even eyelids ring the eyes and eyebrows are carved <b>above.</b> <b>His</b> full lips are slightly open. Behind the eyeholes of his helmet, further hair can be seen (as {{in two of the}} three other copies). This hair, far <b>above</b> where <b>his</b> <b>head</b> would be expected to end, might hint at Pericles' unusually shaped head, which is occasionally referenced in Attic Comedy by the abusive nickname [...] "Leek-head." [...] This deformity was said to be the reason why Pericles was always depicted in a Corinthian helmet, since this would conceal the height of <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The presence of the hair in the eyeholes should probably therefore be seen as the addition of a learned sculptor.|$|R

5000|$|The Prosecutor is a {{caricature}} of the Victorian times attorney. He is short and rotund, wearing a long navy gown which trails behind him, at points <b>above</b> <b>his</b> own <b>head,</b> such as when he leaps onto the [...] "wall" [...] (depicted as being composed of white bricks, as in the album's cover). His facial features are occasionally greatly exaggerated; depending on what he is saying. For instance, when he describes Pink's charges, during saying that Pink has experienced [...] "feelings... feelings of an almost human nature," [...] his face moves close to the camera and assumes a grotesque expression of disgust and contempt.|$|R
5000|$|Servo {{normally}} has a condescending {{personality and}} at times can make literary and technical references that are <b>above</b> <b>his</b> companion's <b>heads.</b> He frequently attempts to seem physically imposing to others, once acquiring [...] "lifts" [...] for his hover skirt to increase his size (accused by Mike of suffering [...] "short man's disease") and on another occasion showing off a small arsenal he had acquired while drifting through space. Almost invariably, however, any attempts at confronting danger or displaying his intellectual skill cause him such frustration that he ends up crying, often needing consolation from Joel or Mike.|$|R
50|$|In the Ju 88 G-6 night fighter, {{which was}} both fast and manoeuvrable, the Revi 16N gunsight was {{modified}} {{to allow the}} pilot to aim at the target, by placing a reflecting mirror <b>above</b> the <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> parallel to a similar mirror placed behind the gunsight (where the eye would normally be), which was further to the rear, functioning together {{in the manner of}} a periscope. The Ju 88 G-6 was guided into position from sighting and final approach by commands from the radar operator, with the pilot only taking over when visual contact was made just prior to firing.|$|R
