25|$|<b>Athletic</b> <b>shoes</b> are {{specifically}} designed to be worn for participating in various sports. Since friction between the foot and the ground is an important force in most sports, modern <b>athletic</b> <b>shoes</b> are designed to maximize this force, and materials, such as rubber, are used. Although, for some activities such as dancing or bowling, sliding is desirable, so shoes designed for these activities often have lower coefficients of friction. The earliest <b>athletic</b> <b>shoes</b> {{date back to the}} mid 19th century were track spikes— leather shoes with metal cleats on the soles to provide increased friction during running. They were developed by J.W. Foster & Sons, which later become known as Reebok. By the end of the 19th century, Spalding also manufactured these shoes as well. Adidas started selling shoes with track spikes in them for running and soccer in 1925. Spikes were eventually added to shoes for baseball and American football in the 20th century. Golfers also use shoes with small metal spikes on their soles to prevent slipping during their swing.|$|E
25|$|Athletic {{accessories}} were {{a massive}} {{trend in the}} early 1980s, and their popularity was largely boosted by the aerobics craze. This included leg warmers, wide belts, elastic headbands, and <b>athletic</b> <b>shoes</b> known as 'sneakers' in the US or 'trainers' in the UK.|$|E

25|$|Depending on the {{activity}} {{for which they}} are designed, some types of footwear may fit into multiple categories. For example, Cowboy boots are considered boots, but may also be worn in more formal occasions and used as dress shoes. Hiking boots incorporate many of the protective features of boots, but also provide the extra flexibility and comfort of many <b>athletic</b> <b>shoes.</b> Flip-flops are considered casual footwear, but have also been worn in formal occasions, such as visits to the White House.|$|E
25|$|Supporters included, {{but were}} not limited to, media {{companies}} and industry associations such as the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America and the Entertainment Software Association. Supporters generally identified a need to have more effective laws to combat the illegal domestic sales of products and services, the counterfeiting and sale of products (such as prescription drugs, <b>athletic</b> <b>shoes,</b> and cosmetics), and worldwide copyright infringing activities which were problematic to prevent inasmuch as they originated outside the United States.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{different}} types of shoes. Most types of shoes are designed for specific activities. For example, boots are typically designed for work or heavy outdoor use. <b>Athletic</b> <b>shoes</b> are designed for particular sports such as running, walking, or other sports. Some shoes are designed to be worn at more formal occasions, and others are designed for casual wear. There are also {{a wide variety}} of shoes designed for different types of dancing. Orthopedic shoes are special types of footwear designed for individuals with particular foot problems or special needs. Other animals, such as dogs and horses, may also wear special shoes to protect their feet as well.|$|E

Skate shoes have also been {{designed to provide a}} comfortable, flexible and durable shoe for the sport of skateboarding. Climbing shoes are rubber-soled, tight-fitting shoes designed to fit in the small cracks and crevices for rock climbing. Cycling shoes are similarly designed with rubber soles and a tight fit, but also are equipped with a metal or plastic cleat to interface with clipless pedals, as well as a stiff sole to maximize power transfer and support the foot.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} rubber-soled <b>athletic</b> <b>shoes</b> {{date back}} to 1876 in the United Kingdom, when the New Liverpool Rubber Company made plimsolls, or sandshoes, designed for the sport of croquet. Similar rubber-soled shoes were made in 1892 in the United States by Humphrey O'Sullivan, based on Charles Goodyear's technology. The United States Rubber Company was founded the same year and produced rubber-soled and heeled shoes {{under a variety of}} brand names, which were later consolidated in 1916 under the name, Keds. These shoes became known as, [...] "sneakers", because the rubber sole allowed the wearer to sneak up on another person. In 1964, the founding of Nike by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman of the University of Oregon introduced many new improvements common in modern running shoes, such as rubber waffle soles, breathable nylon uppers, and cushioning in the mid-sole and heel. During the 1970s, the expertise of podiatrists also became important in athletic shoe design, to implement new design features based on how feet reacted to specific actions, such as running, jumping, or side-to-side movement. <b>Athletic</b> <b>shoes</b> for women were also designed for their specific physiological differences.|$|E

2500|$|Since the mid-20th Century, {{advances}} in rubber, plastics, synthetic cloth, and industrial adhesives have allowed manufacturers to create shoes that stray considerably from traditional crafting techniques. Leather, {{which had been}} the primary material in earlier styles, has remained standard in expensive dress shoes, but <b>athletic</b> <b>shoes</b> often {{have little or no}} real leather. Soles, which were once laboriously hand-stitched on, are now more often machine stitched or simply glued on. Many of these newer materials, such as rubber and plastics, have made shoes less biodegradable. It is estimated that most mass-produced shoes require 1000 years to degrade in a landfill. [...] In the late 2000s, some shoemakers picked up on the issue and began to produce shoes made entirely from degradable materials, such as the Nike Considered.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{academic}} {{administrators have}} discussed the correlation between economics, college choice, and the rankings. David McGrath, emeritus professor of English, College of DuPage, discussed his own decision to attend Chicago State University in the 24 July 2007 Chicago Tribune article, Ode to a fourth-tier college. Of this decision, he noted that, [...] "I qualified for admission elsewhere, but CSU was close to my part-time job, and it was cheap [...] I never required a student loan since I earned enough as a grocery bagger to pay tuition and fees in 1970 that totaled $300 per year. All told, a pretty good value, even for a fourth-tier school." [...] McGrath considered it a [...] "good value," [...] because, [...] "CSU eventually led to a teaching career, and my working alongside professors from Princeton, Northwestern, and the University of Chicago. I earned the same ample salary and benefits as they, and, more important, was privileged {{to engage in the}} same kind of fulfilling work." [...] He also referenced the 2000 Krueger-Dale study (which compared groups of students who received the same SAT scores, attended both high and low-income schools, and found no difference in post-graduation success rates [...] ) and noted that, [...] "too often, it seems, students choose colleges the way they choose jeans or <b>athletic</b> <b>shoes.</b> They would rather bust the family budget than be caught dead in sweats bearing an unrecognizable school logo. But it's their ability, work ethic and dedication that determine the height of their achievement." ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>athletic</b> <b>shoe</b> midsole {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{contributors}} that lead to a generation of end-of-life waste because it is composed of polymeric foams based on ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is a polyolefin copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate that provides durability and flexibility, making it the most commonly used material found in <b>athletic</b> <b>shoe</b> midsoles. Although the synthetic polymer is a useful material for the <b>athletic</b> <b>shoe</b> industry, it has become an environmental concern because of its poor biodegradability. EVA goes through an anaerobic decomposition process called thermal degradation that often occurs in landfills resulting in releases of volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) into the air. VOC’s “contribute to the formation of tropospheric ozone, which is harmful to humans and plant life.” Thermal degradation of EVA is temperature dependent and occurs in two stages; in the first stage acetic acid is lost, followed by the degradation of the unsaturated polyethylene polymer.|$|R
2500|$|Sports shoes {{had been}} worn as casual wear before, {{but for the}} first time they became a high-priced fashion item. Converse shoes were popular in the first half of the 1980s. In 1984, Nike {{introduced}} the first ever Air Jordan sneaker, the Air Jordan 1 (named for basketball player Michael Jordan). Although most believe this shoe was banned by the NBA due to the sneaker being too flashy and distracting, others believe it was actually, the predecessor, the Nike Air Ship that was under scrutiny. Nike used this controversy between Air Jordan and the NBA to market the sneaker. The Air Jordan 1 was released in the royal blue color way to the public in 1985 and was an immediate success, still retaining its value in the fashion world today. Soon, other manufacturers introduced premium <b>athletic</b> <b>shoes.</b> Adidas sneakers took the decade by storm, becoming popular among teenage boys and young men. The growth of pop-culture and hip-hop influence allowed Run-D.M.C. to make the Adidas Superstar (commonly known as the shell toe) one of the most sought-after shoes of the 1980s. After their song My Adidas, Adidas reportedly gave them an endorsement deal of $1 million. Nike had a similar share of the market, with the Air Max and similar shoes such as the Air Force One which released in 1982. High-tops, especially of white or black leather, became popular. Reebok released their iconic silhouette The Pump, Converse released the Cons and New Balance had the Worthy 790. The sneaker industry was booming and the hip-hop culture fully embraced it. In the early 1980s, long and white athletic socks, often calf-high or knee-high, were worn with sneakers. As the decade progressed, socks trended shorter, eventually topping out just above the height of the shoe. Run-D.M.C. and other hip-hop groups were also able to influence the apparel industry. Wearing track suits and large chains, they made sportswear companies such as FILA, Puma, Reebok, Nike, Avia and Adidas fashionable. Individuals in the culture also frequently wore bucket hats, oversized jackets and t-shirts, and high contrast colors. Fashion in Hip-Hop was a way to surpass the poverty that surrounded the community. According to Chandler and Chandler-Smith (2008), rap and hip-hop were not one specific style, but rather a mix between high-end luxury fashion and what was on the street. Dapper Dan embodied this concept by redesigning luxury products and making them available to those who wouldn't typically associate themselves with it. Dapper Dan was most famous for cutting up a Louis Vuitton garment and turning it into his signature jacket. He reconstructed garments for many music icons and celebrities in the 1980s before getting shut down by lawyers in the early 1990s. This interest in luxury apparel expanded past Dapper Dan; Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, and Nautica were expanding rapidly and embraced by the hip-hop culture as a sign of status and relief from their financial realities.|$|E
