5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play. Young men would gather around the gandingan <b>and</b> <b>gossip</b> about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds of dirty words could be heard penetrating the night air.|$|E

A while later Rapaport reveals his concern and urge for change, to which Skylark agrees. Skylark discovers that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is a fan of Skylark Tonight, prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview. Rapaport travels to a place outside Dandong, China to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, the North Korean chief propagandist, and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim, on behalf of Skylark.|$|E
5|$|Matthews' {{drinking}} {{had long}} {{been reported in the}} tabloids <b>and</b> <b>gossip</b> columns, and she entered rehab in mid-2001 for drinking and smoking. The tour to support Paper Scissors Stone was cancelled, and a month later, the band announced that they were breaking up. Matthews has subsequently released solo albums, while Powell has become a radio presenter and joined the supergroup The Stand to release a charity single. Critics have highlighted the use of metaphors in Catatonia's work, and songs have been compared to poetry by critics. Writing duties had been shared across the band, although had been led by Matthews and Roberts. They disagreed with being labelled an indie band, with Powell saying they had only ever sought to write pop music.|$|E
5|$|Bill Werde {{was named}} {{editorial}} director in 2008, and {{was followed by}} Janice Min in January 2014, who is also responsible for editorial content at The Hollywood Reporter. The magazine has since been making changes {{to make it more}} of a general interest music news source, as opposed to solely an industry trade. It started covering more celebrity, fashion, <b>and</b> <b>gossip.</b> Min hired Tony Gervino as the publication's editor, which was different than Billboard's historical appointments, in {{that he did not have}} a background in the music industry. Tony Gervino was appointed editor-in-chief in April 2014. An item on NPR covered a leaked version of Billboards annual survey, which it said had more gossip and focused on less professional topics than prior surveys. For example, it polled readers on a lawsuit pop-star Kesha filed against her producer alleging sexual abuse.|$|E

5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, <b>and</b> <b>gossip</b> by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{and other}} members of the {{imperial}} family, including Grand Dukes Alexander, George, Nicholas and Dmitri and Grand Duchess Elizabeth, warned of the growing public unrest, and of the perception that Nicholas was governed by his German-born wife Alexandra and the self-styled holy man Rasputin. Nicholas and Alexandra refused to listen. In December 1916, Dmitri and four of his friends killed Rasputin. Michael learned of the murder at Brasovo, where he was spending Christmas with his family. On 28 December, according to the French ambassador, there was a failed attempt to assassinate Alexandra; the lone assailant was caught and hanged the next day. The Duma President Mikhail Rodzianko, Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna and British ambassador Buchanan joined calls for Alexandra to be removed from influence, but Nicholas still refused to take their advice. Plots <b>and</b> <b>gossip</b> against Nicholas and Alexandra continued to build.|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean Carnival is an {{important}} part of Dominican culture. Originally featuring masquerade songs (chanté mas) and other local traditions, traditional Carnival, Mas Domnik, came to be dominated by imported calypso music and steel bands in the early 1960s; calypso appealed to Carnival-goers because the lyrical focus on local news <b>and</b> <b>gossip</b> was similar to that of chanté mas, despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation which contrast sharply with traditional Dominican Mas Domnik music. After a fire in 1963, the traditional Carnival was banned, though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity. Modern Carnival on Dominica takes place on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, and is a festive occasion during which laws against libel and slander are suspended. The modern Dominican Carnival is heavily based on the Trinidadian celebration, but is not as commercialized due to a lack of corporate sponsorship.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} Suetonius {{was born}} in about AD70, and started writing around AD100. He was a child {{at the time of}} the games, but it is possible that he was born and raised in Rome, so he may have witnessed the inaugural games first-hand. His De Vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars, known also as The Twelve Caesars or Lives of the Twelve Caesars) probably completed around AD117 to 127, includes some detail on the opening days of the games. Later in his history of Titus he reveals further information about the games. Suetonius' histories of the early Caesars have been criticised for being based on rumour <b>and</b> <b>gossip</b> rather than accurate historical sources, and he often reports from sources which contradict each other without attempting to analyse their quality or accuracy. However, he is generally regarded as a thorough scholar and has been praised for his balanced treatment of his subjects.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news <b>and</b> <b>gossip,</b> matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E
