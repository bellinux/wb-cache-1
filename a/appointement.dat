40|$|BACKGROUND: Although several {{investigators}} {{have suggested that}} the primary care setting has become the "de facto " mental health provider, few researchers have docu-mented the psychiatric referral practices of providers in these settings. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the psychiatric referral patterns of hospital-based outpa-tient clinics and the needs and characteristics of the referred patient population were examined. DESIGN: After a 4 -year retrospective log audit, 2, 678 written referrals were examined for patients 18 years of age and older from a large urban medical center’s outpatient clinics to the outpatient psychiatry clinic at the same site. RESULTS: Findings revealed a predominately middle-aged, white, female, Medicaid popu-lation referred by physician providers in primary care clinics for signs of depression and associated symptoms. However, of the patients scheduled in the psychiatry clinic, only 56 % actually had visits. The average number of visits was five or less. CONCLUSIONS: Early assessment and triage by advanced practice psychiatric nurses can minimize the length of time between psychiatric referral and intervention. By iden-tifying those persons in crisis and intervening in a timely fashion, failed <b>appointements</b> may be reduced. U Am PSYCHIATR NURSES Assoc [1995]. 1, 140 - 145...|$|R

40|$|O exercÃcio da amamentaÃÃo Ã extremamente {{relevante}} por proporcionar um contato Ãntimo da dÃade mÃe-bebÃ e por fornecer ao recÃm-nato uma fonte hÃdrica, energÃtica e protÃica no inÃcio da vida. Este estudo teve como objetivos: traduzir e adaptar a Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (BSES), aplicar a Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale - VersÃo Brasileira (BSES-VB), em gestantes, verificar a confiabilidade e a validade da BSES-VB para a detecÃÃo da auto-eficÃcia das mulheres e verificar a associaÃÃo entre os escores da BSES-VB e as variÃveis sociodemogrÃficas e obstÃtricas. Obteve-se autorizaÃÃo para utilizaÃÃo da BSES a qual foi submetida ao processo de adaptaÃÃo transcultural proposto por Beaton (1998), tendo sido submetida Ãs anÃlises psicomÃtricas (confiabilidade e validade). Desenvolveu-se um estudo metodolÃgico com abordagem quantitativa realizado em um centro de saÃde de Fortaleza. A amostra foi composta por 117 gestantes que foram entrevistadas antes ou depois da sua consulta prÃ-natal. A coleta de dados ocorreu no perÃodo de julho a outubro de 2007, tendo sido utilizada alÃm da BSES, um formulÃrio com informaÃÃes sociodemogrÃficas e obstÃtricas. ApÃs a adaptaÃÃo, obteve-se uma escala com 33 itens, cujas dificuldades no seu entendimento resultaram na inserÃÃo de exemplos em 12 itens. Um comitÃ de especialistas avaliou o conteÃdo da BSES-VB e a escala obteve um Ãndice de ValidaÃÃo de ConteÃdo de 0, 86. O alfa de Cronbach foi 0, 88, indicando alta consistÃncia interna, a qual foi ratificada pelo coeficiente de correlaÃÃo intraclasse que variou de 0, 83 a 0, 90. A estabilidade da escala foi avaliada pelo coeficiente de Spearman-Brown que se mostrou elevado (0, 80 e 0, 91), indicando alta estabilidade da BSES-VB. A validade de construto realizada pela anÃlise fatorial utilizando a anÃlise dos componentes principais com rotaÃÃo varimax sugeriu a retirada de alguns itens, contudo optou-se por mantÃ-los para posterior aplicaÃÃo do instrumento em uma amostra mais representativa dessa populaÃÃo e outras que possuam caracterÃsticas ainda nÃo avaliadas. A validade de construto por meio da comparaÃÃo dos grupos contrastados sugere que somente a experiÃncia pode nÃo ser relevante para que a mulher tenha maior auto-eficÃcia na amamentaÃÃo, mas que essa experiÃncia precisa ser satisfatÃria, gratificante para que a mulher tenha maior auto-eficÃcia na adoÃÃo desse comportamento. Concluiu-se, portanto que se obteve um instrumento confiÃvel, vÃlido e capaz de avaliar a percepÃÃo da mulher em relaÃÃo Ã sua auto-eficÃcia para a prÃtica da amamentaÃÃo e recomenda-se que a BSES-VB seja aplicada tanto para pesquisa como na prÃtica obstÃtrica, pois ela permite identificar os fatores relacionados Ã amamentaÃÃo que requerem uma atenÃÃo direcionada e efetiva por parte do profissional que lida com a amamentaÃÃo. The breastfeeding {{practice is}} remarkably important {{to provide a}} close contact of the mother-baby dyad and to offer to the newborn a water, energy and protein nutritional source in the early post-natal life. This study had as objectives: translate and adapt the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (BSES), apply the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale- Brazilian version (BSES-BV) to pregnant women, verify the BSES-BV reliability and validity in order to detect women self-efficacy and to verify the association between the BSES-BV scores and the sociodemographic and obstetric variables. In this regard, a copy-right authorization was obtained to use the BSES, which underwent a transcultural adaptation process as indicated by Beaton (1998), and submitted to psycometric analyses (reliability and validity). In order to do this, a methodological study was developed using a quantitative approach held at a Health Center in Fortaleza. The sampling includes 117 pregnant women whom were interviewed {{before or after the}} prenatal <b>appointement.</b> The data collection was done during July to October, 2007, using not only the BSES-BV but also a field form to gather sociodemographic and obstetric information. Following the adaptation, a 33 item-scale was achieved, in which, misunderstanding issues resulted in the insertion of examples within 12 itens. A committee of experts evaluated the BSES-BV content and found a Content Validation Index of 0. 86 to the scale and a Cronbach alpha of 0. 88, pointing out to high internal consistency, corroborated by the intra-class correlation coefficient ranging from 0. 83 to 0. 90. The scale stabillity was evaluated by the Spearman-Brown coefficient, which was shown to be high (0. 80 and 0. 91) indicating high stability of the BSES-BV. The construct validity evaluated by the factorial analysis, undergoing major component analysis with varimax rotation, suggested the withdrawal of some items; however, we decided to keep them to furture instrument use in a more representative sampling of this population and others that exhibit characteristics yet not addressed. The construct validity by means of contrasted group comparisons suggests that only the experience might not be relevant to reach womenâs breastfeeding self-efficacy, hence breastfeeding experience must be previously satisfactory and gratifying in order to reach a greater self-efficacy during the later breastfeeding behavior. In conclusion, we have obtained a reliable and valid instrument, enabling the evaluation of the womenâs self-efficacy perception regarding the breastfeeding practice and herein we recommend that the BSES-BV should be applied to either research or to the obstetric practice, since it allows the identification of factors related to breastfeeding that deserves appropriate and effective attention from the breastfeeding professionals...|$|E
