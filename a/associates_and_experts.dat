40|$|A {{three year}} Esprit project - ProCure - is {{ultimately}} aiming {{to take a}} significant but achievable step forward {{in the application of}} available information and communication technology (ICT) to the large scale engineering (LSE) construction industry. The ProCure consortium consists of five industrial partners supported by four <b>associated</b> research <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> partners. The project combines leading expertise from three member states to support ICT deployment by three industrial collaborative groups, i. e. UK, Germany and Finland. The basis of the project is in the partners' belief that sufficient ICT is now available to achieve deployment, with care, in real projects, with an acceptable risk of failure. This paper presents work undertaken within the project to investigate the various metadata standards that exist in order to define a minimum metadata set based on these standards for the implementation of two demonstrators for XML based automated document exchange between a simulation of a corporate document management system and a simulation of a collaborative construction project Web site...|$|R

All multicellular animals, plants and fungi are included in the checklist, with the exception of species under direct supervision of humans (e. g. pets) and species not recorded since 1758 (i. e. subfossil and fossil species). The checklist includes available synonyms and preferred Dutch name and higher classification, including <b>associated</b> source <b>and</b> <b>expert.</b> Furthermore, all species and lower taxa are assigned a standardized code for their occurrence status within the Netherlands. The Dutch Species Catalog is coordinated and hosted by Naturalis Biodiversity Center in close collaboration with European Invertebrate Survey (EIS) - the Netherlands.

40|$|ERP {{clients and}} vendors {{necessarily}} estimate their project interventions {{at a very}} early stage, before the full requirements to an ERP solution are known and often before a contract is finalized between a vendor/ consulting company and a client. ERP project estimation at the stage of early requirements in a contractual setting has been challenging as it requires the inclusion and the availability of multiple experts, each being a specialist in a particular domain, e. g. solution architect, technical architect, consultant project manager. Today’s highly volatile and customized ERP landscape demands a new approach to estimate effort by leveraging ERP professionals’ tacit knowledge <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> judgments, as well as information from historical project databases (if available). This paper presents three ERP Service estimation strategies that leverage the strengths of both Functional Size Measurement (FSM) and expert-judgment-based estimation techniques. These strategies use a more structured approach to reduce the effects of <b>expert</b> bias <b>and</b> avoid common pitfalls <b>associated</b> with FSM <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> judgment-based estimation...|$|R

30|$|Like {{many other}} {{developing}} {{cities in the}} world, major cities in South Korea have experienced a massive expansion over the past decades. Many reasons can be accounted for this, but during the 1990 s {{it was obvious that}} the Korean government mainly focused its national strategy on economic growth [32, 36]. Since 1950 when the Korean War ended, it was undoubtedly clear that the socioeconomic status of South Korea was in its deepest downturn. As a response, government officials <b>and</b> <b>associated</b> <b>experts</b> dedicated themselves to improving economic status and concentrating on quantitative growth [37]. This type of approach works mainly for the major cities where the necessary socioeconomic infrastructure is maintained. For that reason, national growth strategy was heavily geared toward large cities across the country.|$|R

40|$|Negativity {{towards the}} {{institutions}} of formal politics is currently a concern {{across much of the}} democratic world. It is generally agreed that such negativity increased among British citizens {{during the second half of}} the twentieth century. In this paper, we analyse a novel dataset not previously used to study this topic: Mass Observation’s General Election diaries. Since diarists wrote mostly about politicians, political campaigns, <b>and</b> <b>associated</b> media coverage, we ask specifically what the diaries can tell us about increased negativity towards politicians and its relationship to developments in political communication. We take a postholing approach to sampling of the diaries, enabling comparative-static analysis between the middle and end of the twentieth century. We view the diaries in a geographical framework derived from contextual theories of social action. This gives us a focus on spaces of political encounter, modes of political interaction, performances by politicians, and judgements by citizens. We argue that prominent spaces of political encounter changed over the period from long radio speeches and rowdy political meetings to televised debates <b>and</b> <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> commentary. We demonstrate how these latter settings for political interaction afforded less opportunity for politicians to perform virtues to citizens, and for citizens to calibrate judgements of politicians...|$|R

30|$|An {{alternative}} to ROC analysis is kappa analysis.

The weighted kappa coefficients between {{each pair of}} <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> between RENEX <b>and</b> each <b>expert</b> also ranged from 0.61 to 0.73 [10]; this close agreement of kappa coefficients suggested that RENEX was performing similarly to an expert. However, kappa analysis {{does not provide a}} framework for evaluating the pattern of agreement across different categories. In our analysis, we found that RENEX has better agreement with consensus <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> in obstructed <b>and</b> non-obstructed categories, but not in the equivocal category.|$|R
