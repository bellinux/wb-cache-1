40|$|AbstractWith the {{development}} of agriculture in China, the productions of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> increase rapidly. The occurrence of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> was unique in the different areas. The agricultural straw and livestock excrement {{are considered to be}} potential resources. Improper disposition of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> not only result in environmental pollution, but also waste a lot of valuable biomass resources. The recycling and utilization of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> are considered to be the important step in environmental protection, energy structure and agricultural development. However, the problem in China's current <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> recycling impeded the achievement of scale ecological functions. The objectives of this study were to illuminate the potential environmental risk, recycling and utilization pathway, influencing factors and policy suggestions in the recycling and utilization progress of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes.</b> The survey provided {{the development}} mode of industrialization and scale of <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> recycling. The recycling and utilization pathway of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> were also analyzed. The crucial suggestions were proposed, such as cultivating new industry, building economy incentive standard, improving laws and regulations, and creating rural market strengthening medium and long-term plans of <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> recycling. The resource consumption, ecological crisis and other issues caused by <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> were evaluated. It will provide more comprehensive fundamental information for the recycling and utilization of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> during the modernization and urbanization of China...|$|R

30|$|Using <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> as peat {{substitute}} {{can benefit}} the waste producers, growers and the environment. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> producers can transform the liability of waste disposal into {{a source of}} income by marketing their waste as a valuable horticultural product (Raviv 2005). Local <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> are generally less expensive for growers than peat (Raviv 2005; Restrepo et al. 2013), which is produced in cold, northern regions and must be shipped long distances to more temperate horticultural areas (Roberston 1993). Growers who use <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> as peat substitutes can market their plants as sustainable and command a higher price. Replacing peat with <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> is environmentally sound because nutrients from wastes can be recycled into plant growth thus reducing fertilizer needs and environmental impacts of peat production can be reduced by reducing the demand for peat.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. At {{the present}} time the demand for energy, goods and {{materials}} is surging because of advanced technology and population growth. However, the resources on earth are limited. For this reason, the issues concerning using the resources effectively and changing them into energy are important. Taiwan creates {{a vast amount of}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> every year. Traditionally, the <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> would be burned and buried. It is not only the fact that we can’t reuse and recycle the <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste,</b> but also the problem of air pollution when they were burned. Therefore, it is necessary to create a solution that can recycle and reuse the <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste,</b> and change them into energy. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> is full of wood fiber, and it can be reduced by a microorganism method. This study will use a common <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> which is cane because {{it is one of the}} main agricultural products in Taiwan. The wood fiber in cane will be added to the thermostable cellulolytic bacterial Geobacillus thermoleovorans T 4 which is found from in sugar refinery wastewater found often in Southern Taiwan. The results showed that T 4 can increase the rate of reducing sugar. The reduced sugar can then transform into energy. This method can help to recycle and reuse <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste,</b> and it will decrease environmental pollution...|$|R

40|$|Five {{different}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> {{were used}} for this study. Three experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 determined the chemical composition of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes.</b> Experiment II determined the coefficient of preference of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes.</b> In experiment III the nutritive value of the selected <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> was assessed by in vitro gas fermentation (IVGP) to predict organic matter digestibility (OMD), metabolizable energy (ME) and short chain fatty acid (SCFA). The dry matter (DM) ranges significantly (P< 0. 05) from 66. 79 in cassava peel to 96. 44 g/ 100 g DM in cowpea testa. Crude protein (CP) and Neutral Detergent fibre (NDF) also varied significantly (P< 0. 05) ranging from 1. 09 in cassava sievate to 14. 02 g/ 100 g DM in cowpea husk and 64. 01 in dried plantain peel to 86. 50 g/ 100 g DM in cassava seivate respectively.

30|$|The {{integrated}} use of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> and NPK {{improved the}} soil chemical {{status and the}} growth and yield characteristics of maize. These observations were consistent with earlier reports of Agele et al. (2011). Improvements in the soil properties in the cited reports were attributed to the enhancement of soil organic matter by the residues applied. Soil chemical properties in organically amended soil were improved over the unamended plots. Soil organic matter, N, P, Ca, and Mg, and pH increased with the application of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> or in combination with NPK over the unamended plots. Adeniyan and Ojeniyi (2005) indicated that the application of poultry manure alone or in combination with reduced rates of NPK fertilizer significantly improved the soil chemical properties and nutrient uptake. Soils of the experimental site were deficient in organic matter, N and P. Following the organic amendment, there were improvements in soil chemical properties, {{and they can be}} attributed to the mineralization of SOM from decomposing <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes.</b> Combined application of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> and NPK fertilizer irrespective of the types of waste and levels of NPK fertilizer application has improved soil chemical properties. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> has been found to increase the contents of nutrients in the soil and its uptake by maize (Adeniyan and Ojeniyi 2005) and tomato (Agele et al. 2011). Seed yield increased under combined use of poultry manure and NPK fertilizer which was significantly higher than the sole application of NPK or <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> and the unamended control. Percentage increases in yield of NPK fertilizer plus <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> alone were 25.8 % and 29.4 %, respectively, in 2008 and 2009. This result implies that integrated application of both <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> and NPK fertilizer would enhance maize yields over sole NPK and organic wastes.|$|R

For this purpose, <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> (sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA) and rice husk ash (RHA)) were acquired from a sugar industry and a brick kiln. Burnt clay bricks were manufactured in an industrial kiln by incorporating SBA and RHA in various dosages (i. e. 5 %, 10 % and 15 %) by clay weight. Physico-mechanical and thermal properties of brick specimens incorporating <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> were studied. It was observed that lighter weight bricks can be produced using <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes,</b> which are helpful in reducing both the cost and overall weight of the structure. Addition of <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> in burnt clay bricks resulted into reduced compressive strength. However, brick specimens incorporating SBA and RHA up to 15 % satisfied the minimum requirement for compressive strength according to different standards for masonry construction. Increase in apparent porosity with decrease in thermal conductivity was also observed with increasing content of SBA and RHA in burnt clay bricks. Substitution of clay by 15 % SBA and RHA in the production of burnt clay bricks reduced the thermal conductivity by 31 % and 29 %, respectively.
