5|$|In early 2015, the two again began {{showing signs}} of tension between them - with Stardust {{becoming}} further entrenched in his gimmick, leaving Goldust to {{have to try to}} communicate with his brother, Cody; through his new entity. Stardust would respond to this by walking out on Goldust before their match had concluded on the February 5 episode of SmackDown. On the February 16th edition of Raw - {{for the first time since}} their debut, Dusty Rhodes returned to speak to his sons as a way to commiserate and smooth out the problems they were having. Though at first Cody seemed to be in agreement with his family, after Goldust took the loss for his team against The New Day, Stardust hit his old finisher Cross-Rhodes thus dissolving their partnership entirely. After, when Dusty approached Stardust backstage, Stardust claimed that it was he and his brother that were responsible for the pressure Cody was subjected to from a young age. He then stated that Cody, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>his</b> own family, were dead to him. A match between the two was set for Fastlane with Goldust promising to vanquish Stardust once and for all and to reclaim his brother and rekindle their partnership and brotherhood. Due to their father asking Goldust not to cause any real harm to Cody, Goldust won their first encounter via roll-up. Backstage, Stardust viciously assaulted Goldust and again proclaimed it was his family's fault for his mental decline.|$|E

It had been thought that one day he would be made a bishop, but his earlier breakdown <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>his</b> entering religious life, ended any possibility of entering the episcopate. After more than two years as a postulant, he took his religious vows and officially became a monk on 1 January 1972. Having been the Dean of Trinity College when Prince Charles studied there, he was invited to the wedding of Charles and Diana in 1981.

500|$|Nathan Drake is the playable {{character}} of the series. He has a shady past, in which he associated {{with a number of}} thieves and black market salesmen in order to obtain various valuable items.

[...] Scully examines his neck and finds an incision exactly like the one she received when she was abducted. Upon leaving, Scully finds The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in her car. The Smoking Man tells her that {{he was the one who}} saved Jason's life, and that since he is dying he wants to atone his previously evil behavior by giving the cure to Scully. Scully leaves, but not before The Smoking Man gives her his phone number. Scully traces the number to The Smoking Man's office address. He explains that he is dying of a cerebral inflammation that developed after his surgery (...)

500|$|The Communist Party of India demanded {{stringent}} {{action against}} those inciting violence and asked democratic forces {{to launch a}} united struggle against such elements. The party also accused the media, particularly the electronic media, of encouraging anti-national and parochial forces by giving them [...] "undue publicity". According to a resolution adopted at its 20th national Congress at Hyderabad, no adequate action was against those who indulge in chauvinistic slogans and perpetuate hooliganism, and the ruling Congress-led coalition and the opposition BJP utilised these forces for their local political gains. The resolution also said, [...] "Opportunistic, parochial and chauvinistic" [...] forces like Shiv Sena and MNS have exploited the situation for narrow electoral gains and demanded compensation for those affected by the violence. The resolution stated that in 1966, Bal Thackeray gave anti-South Indian slogans <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>his</b> nephew wants to repeat that experience by giving anti-North Indian slogans. The All India Minorities Front (AIMF) threatened to launch a nationwide agitation against Raj {{if he did not}} mend his ways and avoid targeting North Indians and non-Maharashtrians.|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>his</b> suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where I see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E
500|$|On 28June 1855 James Loch, the Superintendent, {{died and}} was succeeded by Hon. Algernon Fulke Egerton, Lord Ellesmere's third son. [...] He was then aged 29, {{and had been}} educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford; he had been destined for a {{political}} life and had no experience of managing coal mines or canals. [...] Since James Loch had been appointed, he had been mainly {{in control of the}} management of the Trustees, assisted by his son George Loch. [...] During this time the role of Fereday Smith had been diminished; initially appointed as Deputy Superintendent, his position was reduced to that of Principal Agent in 1845. [...] With the arrival of the inexperienced Algernon Egerton, Fereday Smith had a much greater say in the management. [...] During the previous four years the Lochs had been reluctant to invest in improvements to the canal or Runcorn Dock, despite the increasing demand for the passage of goods through the dock, and the profits made during these years became stagnant. [...] Fereday Smith had been keen on expansion <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>his</b> opportunity came. [...] He first reduced the top-heavy administration of the Trust, and then took on the planning of the expansion of the business. [...] The steamers owned by the Trustees had been neglected and were in a poor state; these were repaired or sold.|$|E

[...] When Xu Zhigao had the senior generals Li Decheng (Li Jianxun's father) and Zhou Ben submit petitions for such a transition, to further try to put on a display that this transition {{was the result of a}} consensus, Song commented to Li Jianxun, [...] "Your honored father was a great contributor to Taizu , <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>his</b> reputation is dumped on the ground." [...] Still, around this time, Xu Zhigao did agree to a suggestion of Song's — to establish friendly relations with Khitan, to plan a possible invasion of the Central Plains (then ruled by Later Jin).

2500|$|Melson is Jewish, and {{was born}} in Orange County, California as his father was {{stationed}} in Orange County while serving on Active Duty in the United States Army.

This backfired, as Huxley had already delighted Darwin by speculating on [...] "pithecoid man" [...] (ape-like man), and was glad of the invitation to publicly turn the anatomy of brain structure into a question of human ancestry. Darwin egged him on from Down, writing [...] "Oh Lord what a thorn you must be in the poor dear man's side". Huxley told Darwin's friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, [...] "Owen occupied an entirely untenable position... The fact is he made a prodigious blunder in commencing the attack, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>his</b> only chance is to be silent and let people forget the exposure. I do not believe that in the whole history of science there is a case of any man of reputation getting himself into such a contemptible position.

The canvas falls off the ship's figurehead, revealing the strung-up skeleton of Alexandro Aranda.

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the year, the war had {{developed}} {{in such a way that}} the new SAS detachment would not be needed in Persia. General Wilson was being transferred to Middle East Command, and Maclean extracted a promise that the newly trained troops would go with him, as their style of commando raids were ideal for southern and eastern Europe. [...] Frustrated by the abandoning of plans for an assault on Crete, Maclean went to see Reginald Leeper, [...] "an old friend from Foreign Office days, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>His</b> Majesty's Ambassador to the Greek Government then in exile in Cairo". Leeper put in a word for him, and very soon Maclean was told to go to London to get his instructions directly from the prime minister. Churchill told him to parachute into Jugoslavia (now spelled Yugoslavia) as head of a military mission accredited to Josip Broz Tito (a shadowy figure at that point) or whoever was in charge of the Partisans, the Communist-led resistance movement. Mihajlovic's royalist Cetniks (now spelled Chetniks), which the Allies had been supporting, did not appear to be fighting the Germans very hard, and indeed were said to be collaborating with the enemy. [...] Maclean famously paraphrased Churchill: [...] "My task was simply to help find out who was killing the most Germans and suggest means by which we could help them to kill more." [...] The prime minister saw Maclean as [...] "a daring Ambassador-leader to these hardy and hunted guerillas".|$|E
