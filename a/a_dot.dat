5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlays, the Odyssey came with dice, poker chips, score sheets, play money, and game boards much like a traditional board game. One peripheral controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game light gun. Named the Shooting Gallery, the rifle-shaped device registered a hit when pointed at a light source such as <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> on the television screen. Four shooting-based games were included with the light gun.|$|E
5000|$|In {{compound}} meter, even-numbered tuplets can {{indicate that}} a note value is changed {{in relation to the}} dotted version of the next higher note value. Thus, two duplet eighth notes (most often used in [...] meter) take the time normally totaled by three eighth notes, equal to <b>a</b> <b>dotted</b> quarter note. Four quadruplet (or quartole) eighth notes would also equal <b>a</b> <b>dotted</b> quarter note. The duplet eighth note is thus exactly the same duration as <b>a</b> <b>dotted</b> eighth note, but the duplet notation is far more common in compound meters [...] A duplet in compound time is more often written as 2:3 (<b>a</b> <b>dotted</b> quarter note split into two duplet eighth notes) than 2: (<b>a</b> <b>dotted</b> quarter note split into two duplet quarter notes), even though the former is inconsistent with a quadruplet also being written as 4:3 (<b>a</b> <b>dotted</b> quarter note split into two quadruplet eighth notes) [...]|$|R

5|$|The {{artifact}} shows {{a number}} of idiosyncrasies that raise questions concerning its authenticity. The numbering systems used in the codex conflict. The Maya bar-and-dot system is used to mark units, but the central Mexican dot system is used to mark multiples of twenty (for example by using 11 dots instead of 2 bars and <b>a</b> <b>dot,</b> as {{would be the case}} in the bar-and-dot system where a bar indicates 5 and <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> indicates 1). Some bar-and-dot numbers are placed within a cartouche decorated with a knot at the top. The only other instance of such a cartouche being used with numbers is in the Dresden Codex, where the cartouche has a very specific function, indicating a negative date count from the zero year of the great cycle of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar (roughly equivalent to the function of BC in the Gregorian calendar). In the Grolier Codex, where the numbers mark intervals between stations of Venus, the use of this cartouche appears meaningless, although it is suggested that it means that the codex may be read both from the front and from the back.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell and Dabney {{began to}} design custom {{hardware}} {{to run the}} game's functions, and they soon discovered that the cost to build the whole game's computing systems would be much lower. As a result, they would not need to have multiple instances of the game running on the same machine {{in order to be}} profitable. On the other hand, however, the custom hardware was not as powerful as the more expensive Nova computer, which meant that the pair needed to make gameplay modifications. Spacewar was a two-player game featuring dogfights around the gravitational field of a central star; neither of these features could be run on the dedicated circuits the pair were making, so the game was cut down to a single-player game wherein the player would fight against two computer-controlled spaceships in open space. By January 1971, the pair had built some basic hardware which could connect to a monitor, with plans to continue expanding it to make a game now named Cosmic Combat, but they were still far away from turning what was then <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> moving on a screen into a full Spacewar-like game cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within a quarter of a mile. The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E

50|$|N.B.: {{in modern}} {{compound}} meters the beat is <b>a</b> <b>dotted</b> note value, such as <b>a</b> <b>dotted</b> quarter, because {{the ratios of}} the modern note value hierarchy are always 2:1. Dotted notes were never used in this way in the mensural period; the main beat unit was always a simple (undotted) note value.|$|R

5|$|The {{basic number}} system {{consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 {{using a combination of}} these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E
5|$|The film {{returns to}} the {{traditional}} gun barrel opening shot, which was altered into {{part of the story}} for Casino Royale where it was moved {{to the beginning of the}} title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise, and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's Stranger than Fiction and The Kite Runner, MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> motif based on the gunbarrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with graphical user interface, including the electronic table MI6 use, and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{originated with}} a tech demo by Naka, who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> matrix. Naka's prototype was a platform {{game with a}} fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long, winding tube, and this concept was fleshed out with Ohshima's character designs and levels by Yasuhara. Yasuhara originally intended {{to work on the}} game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War, but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year. His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design. The game's color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki, and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California.|$|E

50|$|In Western musical notation, <b>a</b> <b>dotted</b> note is <b>a</b> {{note with}} <b>a</b> small <b>dot</b> written after it. In modern {{practice}} the first dot increases {{the duration of}} the basic note by half of its original value. <b>A</b> <b>dotted</b> note is equivalent to writing the basic note tied to a note of half the value; or with more than one dot, tied to notes of progressively halved value. The length of any given note <b>a</b> with n <b>dots</b> is therefore given by the geometric seriesMore than three dots are highly uncommon but theoretically possible; only quadruple dots have been attested.|$|R
25|$|Later, vowel {{signs and}} hamzas were added, {{beginning}} {{some time in}} {{the last half of the}} 6th century, at about the same time as the first invention of Syriac and Hebrew vocalization. Initially, this was done using a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned by an Umayyad governor of Iraq, Hajjaj ibn Yusuf: <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> above = a, <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> below = i, <b>a</b> <b>dot</b> on the line = u, and doubled dots giving tanwin. However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted. The system was finalized around 786 by al-Farahidi.|$|E
