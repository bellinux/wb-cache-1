5|$|Further work on {{the model}} has shown that a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce completely different results.

Secondly, {{to find out what}} the effect of export entrepreneurship is on business results. The relationships proposed are clearly reflected in a conceptual model which will be verified from a multisectorial sample of 212 Spanish exporting firms. The results reveal that: <b>a)</b> <b>export</b> entrepreneurship positively depends on export commitment and the resources associated with experience and structure; b) there is a positive effect of the level of export entrepreneurship on business results.

5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} {{size of the}} market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity.

Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed <b>an</b> <b>export</b> pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory.

5|$|One of the {{by-products}} at Rjukan was {{the production}} of heavy water—a key component in nuclear weapons, and necessary for the Germany designs as a moderator. The hydrogen plant at Vemork was the first mass producer of heavy water, and in 1939 IG Farben, who owned 25% of Norsk Hydro at the time, asked to import five liters of heavy water, but was denied {{due to lack of}} <b>an</b> <b>export</b> license. In 1939–40 production at Vemork was 20 kilograms, by 1942 production had increased to five kilograms per day.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by {{the governments of the}} respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – <b>an</b> <b>export</b> tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, <b>an</b> <b>export</b> tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and {{insurance}} companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade. The bank created its own sugar beet factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported <b>an</b> <b>export</b> business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.|$|E

In 1988, {{the first part of}} the Kirkenes plant was closed, and the mining company drastically reduced production because its owner, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, would no longer subsidize operations.
