5|$|The Virginia Lottery is an {{independent}} agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It was created in 1987 when Virginians {{voted in favor of}} a state lottery.

In Fiscal Year 2017, the Lottery's profits totaled well over <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>billion</b> dollars, accounting for approximately 9 percent of school funding in Virginia. That brought total Lottery profits in Virginia (from 1989 to June 2017) to more than $11 billion.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{reactions}} led to {{the first}} self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. <b>A</b> <b>half</b> <b>billion</b> years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.|$|E

5|$|The {{interdisciplinary}} state commission includes {{officials from}} the Bulgarian ministries of defence, economy and finance and, according to the caretaker government's deputy prime minister and minister of defence Stefan Yanev, {{the main reason for}} choosing the Swedish contestant is the favourable financial terms offered by Saab, including a lease option and offset agreements. In his words, the Swedish offer accounts for about one billion BGN for the aircraft alone ($834 million), while the US/Portuguese one accounts a price of about one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>billion</b> BGN for the aircraft alone. The decision is pending the approval of the next regular Bulgarian government and, more importantly, of the Bulgarian Parliament. The second-place offer is to be retained as a back-up option, should the negotiations with Saab not be concluded successfully, as the financial resources for this program are budgeted until the end of 2017. The new fighters are to replace both the MiG-29 fighters of Graf Ignatievo Air Base and the Su-25 attack aircraft of Bezmer Air Base, as well as to fill the gap left by the retirement of the country's dedicated Su-22 reconnaissance airplanes.|$|E

25|$|With {{the help}} of {{increasing}} oil revenues, Saddam diversified the largely oil-based Iraqi economy. Saddam implemented a national infrastructure campaign that made great progress in building roads, promoting mining, and developing other industries. The campaign helped Iraq's energy industries. Electricity was brought to nearly every city in Iraq, and many outlying areas. Before the 1970s, most of Iraq's people lived in the countryside and roughly two-thirds were peasants. This number would decrease quickly during the 1970s as global oil prices helped revenues to rise from less than <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>billion</b> dollars to {{tens of billions of}} dollars and the country invested into industrial expansion.|$|E

500|$|Harrisburg {{reached its}} peak {{population}} of 15,659 in 1930, making it the 20th most populated city outside the Chicago Metropolitan Area, in Illinois, and the most populous city in Southern Illinois outside the metro-east. If the city combined the service communities bordering Harrisburg such as Ledford and Muddy, the population {{would have been even}} greater at 26,000, and Saline county as a whole reached nearly 40,000 people. Even with the economic downturn during the Great depression, with business owners and industrial firms closing shop, the city continued to thrive due to its enormous coal industry. On June 17, 1936, Eleanor Roosevelt visited Harrisburg to observe work of the WPA and delivered a speech in the packed High School gymnasium. The heyday ended quickly when the Ohio River flood of 1937 left 4,000 within the city homeless and 80% of the city inundated. Many flooded mines were deemed condemned which left the local economy crippled.

I contented myself with jotting down an impression of incivility and paid no further attention to my fellow traveller other than to read the labels on his lug gage and to peruse the headings of his newspaper by peeping over his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|And now {{notice the}} {{peculiar}} relation that {{is set up}} between the monopolist's production and the satisfaction of human wants. In proportion as the quantity produced is increased the lower must the price be set in order to sell the whole output. If the monopolist insisted on turning out {{more and more of}} his goods, the price that people would give would fall until it barely covered the cost, then till it was less than cost, then to a mere fraction of the cost and finally to nothing at all. In other words, if one produces a large enough quantity of anything it becomes worthless. It loses all its value just as soon as there is enough of it to satisfy, and over-satisfy the wants of humanity. Thus if the world produces three and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>billion</b> bushels of wheat it can be sold, let us say, at two dollars a bushel; but if it produced twice as much it might well be found that it would only sell for fifty cents a bushel. The value of the bigger supply as a total would actually be less than that of the smaller. And if the supply were big enough it would be worth, in the economic sense, just nothing at all. This peculiarity is spoken of in economic theory as the paradox of value. It is referred to in the older books either as an economic curiosity or as a mere illustration in extreme terms of the relation of supply to price. Thus in many books the story is related of how the East India Companies used at times deliberately to destroy a large quantity of tea in order that by selling a lesser amount they might reap a larger profit than by selling a greater.|$|E
