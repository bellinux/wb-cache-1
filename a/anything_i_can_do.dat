500|$|The 2013 World Championships in Athletics, held at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium in August 2013, were {{overshadowed by}} {{comments}} and protests over {{the law by}} athletes. After winning a silver medal at the event, U.S. runner Nick Symmonds stated that [...] "whether you're gay, straight, black, white, we all deserve the same rights. If there's <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to champion the cause and further it, I will, shy of getting arrested."

However, Tregaro was forced to re-paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated {{the rules of the}} IAAF. In response, she re-painted them red as a symbol of love. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country, stating in a press conference that [...] "we have our law which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules. We are not trying to set our rules over there. We are just trying to be respectful." [...] After Isinbaeva's remarks were characterized as being homophobic, she argued that her choice of words had been misinterpreted by the media, and that she was against the discrimination of gays.|$|E
