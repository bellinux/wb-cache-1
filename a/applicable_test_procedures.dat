40|$|Over-fitting is a dreaded foe in challenge-based competitions. Because {{participants}} rely {{on public}} leaderboards {{to evaluate and}} refine their models, {{there is always the}} danger they might over-fit to the holdout data supporting the leaderboard. The recently published Ladder algorithm aims to address this problem by preventing the participants from exploiting willingly or inadvertently minor fluctuations in public leaderboard scores during model refinement. In this paper, we report a vulnerability of the Ladder that induces severe over-fitting of the leaderboard when the sample size is small. To circumvent this attack, we propose a variation of the Ladder that releases a bootstrapped estimate of the public leaderboard score instead of providing participants with a direct measure of performance. We also extend the scope of the Ladder to arbitrary performance metrics by relying on a more broadly <b>applicable</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> based on the Bayesian bootstrap. Our method makes it possible to use a leaderboard, with the technical and social advantages that it provides, even in cases where data is scant...|$|R
40|$|Three gas-liquid chromatographic (G. L. C.) {{procedures}} discussed {{have been}} designed around the four "esses" of detection tests [...] speed, sensitivity, simplicity, and specificity. These techniques are admirably applicable to the very low plasma drug levels encountered in blood testing under pre-race conditions. The methods are equally <b>applicable</b> to post-race <b>testing</b> <b>procedures,</b> where both blood and urine samples are tested. Drugs can only rarely be detected by the electron capture detector (E. C. D.) without a prior derivatization step, which conveys to the drug(s) high electron affinity. Because of broad applicability, two derivatizing agents, heptafluorobutyric (HFBA) and pentafluorpropionic (PFPA) anhydrides are employed. The three techniques, allowing broad coverage of various drug classes are: 1) direct derivatization of drugs to form strongly electron capturing amides and esters. 2) reductive fragmentation of drugs with lithium aluminum hydride to form alcohols, with conversion to ester derivatives. 3) oxidative fragmentation of drugs with potassium dichromate to form derivatizable groups, followed by direct derivatization...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Collector and System Testing Group (CSTG) of the European Community has {{developed}} a <b>procedure</b> for <b>testing</b> the performance of solar water heaters. This procedure treats a solar water heater as a black box with input-output parameters that are determined by all-day tests. In the present study we carry out a systematic analysis of the accuracy of this procedure, in order to answer the question: what tolerances should one impose for the measurements and how many days of testing should one demand under what meteorological conditions, {{in order to be}} able to guarantee a specified maximum error for the long term performance? Our methodology is <b>applicable</b> to other <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> as well. The present paper (Part 1) examines the measurement tolerances of the current version of the procedure and derives a priori estimates of the errors of the parameters; these errors are then compared with the regression results of the Round Robin test series. The companion paper (Part 2) evaluates the consequences for the accuracy of the long term performance prediction. We conclude that the CSTG <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> makes it possible to predict the long term performance with standard errors around 5 % for sunny climates (10 % for cloudy climates). The apparent precision of individual test sequences is deceptive because of large systematic discrepancies between different sequences. Better results could be obtained by imposing tighter control on the constancy of the cold water supply temperature and on the environment of the test, the latter by enforcing the recommendation for the ventilation of the collector...|$|R

40|$|Online {{evaluation}} methods, such as A/B and interleaving experiments, {{are widely}} used for search engine evaluation. Since they rely on noisy implicit user feedback, running each experiment takes a considerable time. Recently, the problem of reducing the duration of online experiments has received substantial attention from the research community. However, {{the possibility of using}} sequential statistical <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> for reducing the time required for the evaluation experiments remains less studied. Such sequential <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> allow an experiment to stop early, once the data collected is sufficient to make a conclusion. In this work, we study the usefulness of sequential <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> for both interleaving and A/B testing. We propose modified versions of the O'Brien &# 38; Fleming and MaxSPRT sequential <b>tests</b> that are <b>applicable</b> for <b>testing</b> in the interleaving scenario.

In particular, for A/B experiments, the average experiment durations can be reduced by up to 66 % in comparison with a single step <b>test</b> <b>procedure,</b> and by up to 44 % in comparison with the O'Brien &# 38; Fleming test.

Asymptotic, normality of the proposed test statistic is derived under the null hypothesis and under a large class of fixed alternatives. The proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> is shown to be consistent against a large class of alternatives. For a sequence of local alternatives, which, converges to the null hypothesis at the rate of n(- 1 / 4), the proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with three existing <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> (i. e. the Greenwood-type <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> proposed in (4), which is known to be locally most powerful among all <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> based symmetrically on spacings, a procedure due to (5) and a procedure due to (3)), in terms of the Pitman asymptotic relative efficiency.

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of testing s null {{hypotheses}} simultaneously. In {{order to deal with}} the multiplicity problem, the classical approach is to restrict attention to multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> that control the familywise error rate (FWE). The closure method of Marcus et al. (1976) reduces {{the problem of}} constructing such procedures to one of constructing single tests that control the usual probability of a Type 1 error.

40|$|Residential {{two-stage}} gas furnaces {{account for}} {{almost a quarter of}} the total number of models listed in the March 2005 GAMA directory of equipment certified for sale in the United States. Two-stage furnaces are expanding their presence in the market mostly because they meet consumer expectations for improved comfort. Currently, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> serves as the method for reporting furnace total fuel and electricity consumption under laboratory conditions. In 2006, American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) proposed an update to its <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> which corrects some of the discrepancies found in the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and provides an improved methodology for calculating the energy consumption of two-stage furnaces. The objectives of this paper are to explore the differences in the methods for calculating two-stage residential gas furnace energy consumption in the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and in the 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and to compare test results to research results from field tests.
