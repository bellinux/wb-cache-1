These <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>separation</b> processes depend upon diffusion driven by pressure gradients, as does the gas centrifuge. They in general have the disadvantage of requiring complex systems of cascading of individual separating elements to minimize energy consumption. In effect, aerodynamic processes {{can be considered as}} non-rotating centrifuges. Enhancement of the centrifugal forces is achieved by dilution of UF6 with hydrogen or helium as a carrier gas achieving a much higher flow velocity for the gas than could be obtained using pure uranium hexafluoride. The Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa (UCOR) developed and deployed the continuous Helikon vortex separation cascade for high production rate low enrichment and the substantially different semi-batch Pelsakon low production rate high enrichment cascade both using a particular vortex tube separator design, and both embodied in industrial plant.

The main {{aim of this study}} was to measure and compare the aerodynamic characteristics of these materials to provide the data and to facilitate the design and adjustment of machines that perform separation of pomegranate arils from rind and locular septa based on aerodynamic characteristics (terminal velocity, drag coefficient and Reynolds number). To achieve this objective, Ashraf variety pomegranate fruit during its maturity stages was studied. The obtained results showed that the variation in maturity stage significantly influenced the terminal velocity, drag coefficient and Reynolds number (P< 0. 05). During the fruit maturity, the terminal velocity of locular septa, rind and pomegranate aril increased from 1. 05 to 1. 16, 3. 16 to 3. 73 and 5. 89 to 6. 70 ms− 1, respectively. The corresponding value of drag coefficient of the three studied materials decreased from 0. 92 to 0. 79, 0. 75 to 0. 59 and 0. 53 to 0. 36, respectively with advancing fruit maturity.

40|$|Wind turbine {{acoustic}} noise {{has been the}} subject of significant research in recent decades due to rapid growth in the wind energy industry. Available space with a reliable wind resource and that does not reside near populated areas is becoming extremely scarce, particularly in Europe. This decline in available space then results in a heightened need for wind turbine designs to be optimized for both acoustic emission and power-performance. Due to highly variable operating conditions, wind turbine {{acoustic noise}} emission may deviate from design levels, causing irritation to local residents and requiring reduced power production of the contributing turbines. The objective of this dissertation is to investigate two parameters that contribute to this variability [...] atmospheric turbulence in the inflow field, and <b>aerodynamic</b> flow <b>separation</b> [...] such that they may be more fully understood and properly accounted for in design. Results are achieved through an extensive experimental campaign on a full-scale turbine equipped with a thorough sensor network. Several novel flow characterization methods are developed, including a method of in-situ turbulence measurement using blade-mounted accelerometers. Turbulent inflow noise is shown to dominate the low frequency portion of the emitted spectrum for normal turbine operation and increases levels by as much as 6 dB for the conditions observed at the research facility. Experimental observations are typically within 2 - 3 dB of a commonly implemented noise prediction model. Finally, a study into the effects of high angle of attack operation shows that <b>aerodynamic</b> flow <b>separation</b> [...] detected using static pressure sensors along one blade of the turbine [...] -can increase overall noise levels by more than 10 dB, thus dominating turbulent inflow noise at low frequencies.

40|$|Miners {{are exposed}} to silica-bearing dust {{which can lead to}} silicosis, a {{potentially}} fatal lung disease. Currently, airborne silica is measured by collecting filter samples and sending them to a laboratory for analysis. Since this may take weeks, a field method is needed to inform decisions aimed at reducing exposures. This study investigates a field-portable Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) method for end-of-shift (EOS) measurement of silica on filter samples. Since the method entails localized analyses, spatial uniformity of dust deposition can affect accuracy and repeatability. The study, therefore, assesses the influence of radial deposition uniformity on the accuracy of the method. Using laboratory-generated Minusil and coal dusts and three different types of sampling systems, multiple sets of filter samples were prepared. All samples were collected in pairs to create parallel sets for training and validation. Silica was measured by FTIR at nine locations across the face of each filter and the data analyzed using a multiple regression analysis technique that compared various models for predicting silica mass on the filters using different numbers of "analysis shots. " It was shown that deposition uniformity is independent of particle type (kaolin vs. silica), which suggests the role of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>separation</b> is negligible. Results also reflected the correlation between the location and number of shots versus the predictive accuracy of the models. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the models when predicting mass of validation samples was 4 %- 51 % depending on the number of points analyzed and the type of sampler used, which affected the uniformity of radial deposition on the filters. It was shown that using a single shot {{at the center of the}} filter yielded predictivity adequate for a field method, (93 % return, CV approximately 15 %) for samples collected with 3 -piece cassettes.

40|$|Real-time {{identification}} and quantitative analysis of volatile and semi-volatile chemical vapors {{are critical for}} environmental monitoring. Currently available portable instruments lack the sensitivity for routine air quality monitoring, so preconcentrators are employed as front-ends for miniaturized chemical sensors. However, commonly used techniques for sensitivity enhancement have a time constant associated with adsorption/desorption or permeation of gas molecules being concentrated. Little work has been reported on fast-response concentrating techniques for gas sensing applications. 	This research {{is devoted to the}} development of a fast-response microfluidic gas concentrating device with appropriate flow dynamic shapes and pressure gradients based on the <b>separation</b> <b>nozzle</b> method. It is capable of concentrating heavy gas molecules diluted in light ones when they are flowing at high speeds, thus maintaining the measurement system response time. This is promising for developing real-time preconcentrators to improve the sensitivity of miniature chemical sensors. 	In the initial phase of this work, linear test structures were used to characterize viscous effects in microfluidic devices. Unit processes were developed to fabricate encapsulated micronozzles with through-hole inlets and outlets. The mass flow efficiency of the test structures was measured to be in the range of 0. 36 - 0. 81, increasing with rising Reynolds number as a result of the decreasing influence of boundary layers. 	 Single-stage gas concentration devices were designed and fabricated on the basis of the test structures. A gas separation experimental setup and a mass spectrometric analysis apparatus were developed to evaluate the performance of the devices. Analytical and finite element analyses were conducted to better understand and verify the experimental results. As a proof-of-concept, gas separation experiments with two different inert gas mixtures were carried out in conjunction with mass spectrometric analysis. More than two-fold enrichment of SF 6 molecules with a response time on the order of 0. 01 ms was demonstrated through the device. The effects of design parameters and operating conditions on the separation factor were determined experimentally and compared to the numerical simulation results.

40|$|Meteors with peak {{magnitudes}} fainter than + 2 {{are typically}} called faint meteors, {{resulting from the}} atmospheric entry and ablation of meteoroids less massive than 10 - 4 kg. The processes of luminous wake formation and fragmentation, which occur during ablation, are poorly understood for faint meteors, and are important constraints for models of meteoroid structure. The goal of this work is to improve understanding of these processes through analysis of high-resolution intensified video observations, and creation of a detailed meteoroid ablation model. In {{the first part of}} this work, thirty faint meteors observed with the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) are analysed, revealing meteor trails with widths up to 100 m at heights above 110 km. These widths vary with height as the inverse of the atmospheric density, suggesting that formation of the wake is related to collisions between evaporated meteoric atoms and atmospheric molecules. Next, nine fragmenting faint meteors captured with CAMO are examined. Fragments from eight of the nine meteors are found to have transverse speeds up to 100 m s- 1. These speeds are not explained by <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>separation</b> theory typically used for brighter meteors that fragment at lower heights. Instead, fragment separation by rotational breakup of the meteoroid or electrostatic repulsion are considered, giving meteoroid strength estimates up to 1 MPa. These strengths are typical of meteorite-producing meteoroids and are larger than expected for small meteoroids. Finally, a single-body ablation model, based on modelling collisions between the meteoroid, meteoric atoms, and atmospheric molecules, is devised to explain wake formation. Synthetic meteor trail widths and lengths, as well as light curves and deceleration profiles, are compared to observations of nine meteors from {{the first part of this}} thesis. The widths of simulated meteor wakes show good agreement with observations, but simulated wake lengths are too short. This suggests that collisional de-excitation of meteoric particles is a plausible process for wake formation, but also that meteoroid fragmentation likely increases the length of the meteor wake. Compared to observations, simulated light curves are longer, and simulated meteoroids experience less deceleration, suggesting that meteoroid fragmentation should be investigated in the next iteration of the model...|$|R
