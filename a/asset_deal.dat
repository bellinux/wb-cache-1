50|$|In {{the context}} of a merger or {{acquisition}} transaction, asset purchase agreements have a distinct set of advantages and disadvantages compared to using an equity (or stock) purchase agreement or a merger agreement. In an equity or merger acquisition, the purchaser is guaranteed to receive all of the target's assets without exception, but also automatically assumes all of the target's liabilities. An asset purchase agreement, alternatively, allows not only for a transaction where only some of the assets are transferred (which is sometimes desired) but also allows the parties to negotiate which liabilities of the target are expressly assumed by the purchaser, and allows the purchaser to leave behind those liabilities it does not wish to accept (or does not know about). A disadvantage of an asset purchase agreement is that it can often result in a greater number of change of control issues. For example, contracts held by a target, and acquired by a purchaser, will often require the consent of the counterparty in {{the context of}} an <b>asset</b> <b>deal,</b> whereas it is less common that such consent will be needed in connection with an equity sale or merger agreement.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis "Contract of sale under {{business}} law" is to compare changes of the contract of sale, which occurred {{as a result of}} the newly adopted Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., Civil Code. The aim of this thesis is to simultaneously take into account the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a Common European Sales Law (Common European Sales Law, CESL). The thesis also focuses on selected provisions of the purchase - especially rules governing the acquisition of ownership from unauthorized (and the related principle of good faith) under the new Civil Code. Rules governing the acquisition of ownership were significantly changed. Thesis attepmts to specify rules which are applied in the case one of the contracting parties is in the possition of a consumer. Specific features of contracting process must be taken in consideration due to the protection of consumers and or small and medium- sized enterprises. The thesis is focused on selected aspects of the contract of sale, thus the purchase of property, <b>asset</b> <b>deal</b> or liability for defects are mentioned only in passing.

The main objective {{of this paper is}} to compare the legal performance of M&A in France and in the United States. The purpose is to quantify the impact of both legal systems on the long-term performance of M&A transactions. To carry out this research, a specific methodology was developed and the results of which are evaluated. Two legal structures for M&A transactions were retained: the purchase of shares (share deal), and the purchase of assets (<b>asset</b> <b>deal).</b> Each of these acquisition structures was then subdivided into eleven steps composing the process, for example from preliminary information, letter of intent, due diligence, stock or asset purchase agreement, closing, to litigation with formal summons. Performance was then measured by taking into account time, cost, and satisfaction factors. The time factor was broken down into person-days and the number of days, weeks, or months required to complete each step. French and U. S. respondents were asked to fill out a questionnaire with reference to a specific acquisition project. A typical question was for instance: What is your estimate of working days to complete this step (person-days) ? Radar charts were used to compare the mean of each performance factor.

In order to check for correlations among the performance factors, an inter-factors analysis (regression) was carried out. The research findings are presented in this paper. Results show that a share deal in France is generally cheaper and participants indicate a significantly greater amount of satisfaction than in the U. S. However, for the time factor, the results vary. The conclusion is that the application of Civil Law rules rather than their Common Law counterparts does not reveal substantial differences as far as M&A transactions are concerned. One reason is that in both France and the U. S. these transactions are carried out following standard procedures in compliance with common contractual practices...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there are}} many methods to {{accomplish}} reorganisations, and these methods {{may be used in}} combination, there are broadly speaking two categories of such transactions. First, two or more companies may merge. At least one of the merging companies is dissolved and both of the undertakings form part either of a newly formed company, or of the merging company, which does not cease to exist. Second, an undertaking may be purchased. There are two methods to achieve this: control over a company can be established by a takeover of its undertaking ('asset deal') or by obtaining enough shares in a company to control it in general meeting ('share deal'). Unlike share deals and mergers, asset deals do not remodel or vary membership rights. When referring to an 'undertaking' my intention is to refer to the company's enterprise as such in all its components. As of today there are no comprehensive provisions in the South African Companies Act ('CA') 1 that regulate the transfer of assets and liabilities in a pure <b>asset</b> <b>deal.</b> The only provision referring to asset deals is s 228 CA. Said section is mainly concerned with the authority of directors to dispose of assets or part of an undertaking where such transactions are of a certain size. Further, s 197 of the Labour Relations Act 2 and s 34 of the Insolvency Act 3 may apply if a company alienates business assets. With the coming into effect of the Swiss Merger Act ('SMA') 4 on July 1 2004, a new mechanism for 'the transfer of assets and liabilities' respectively the transfer of a company's undertakings was created. It applies to any entity or person registered in the Commercial Registry. 5 The major advantage of this new instrument is that all assets and liabilities are transferred to the transferee by operation of law upon registration of said transaction with the I will conclude with a comparison of the transfer of assets and liabilities under the SMA and under s 313 CA. The latter provision deals with reconstructions and amalgamations and involves rearrangement of membership rights as such it {{is beyond the scope of}} pure asset deals. Nevertheless, the comparison is an interesting one, especially as the prospective Companies Bill, 20078 seems to adopt a similar model to implement pure asset deals...|$|E
