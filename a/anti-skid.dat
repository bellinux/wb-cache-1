500|$|Additionally, due to {{the high}} average {{take-off}} speed of , Concorde needed upgraded brakes. Like most airliners, Concorde has <b>anti-skid</b> braking– a system which prevents the tyres from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll-out.

The use of carbon over equivalent steel brakes provided a weight-saving of [...] Each wheel has multiple discs which are cooled by electric fans.

500|$|Because {{of the way}} Concorde's delta-wing {{generated}} lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually {{strong and}} tall {{to allow for the}} angle of attack at low speed. At rotation, Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots indicated airspeed), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage {{in a way that was}} initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign. Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes.

40|$|Abstract: The {{electric}} traction drive systems on {{basis of the}} induction motors fed by the static converters have lead to remarkable performances for the urban electric trains, concerning both the train dynamics and the environment issues. Moreover, the power converters {{on the basis of}} high techniques in the control electronics and the efficient <b>anti-skidding</b> systems have ensured the optimum traction characteristics and the minimum of the energy consumption. But, in case of the underground electric metro operation it is necessary to estimate the environmental impacts of the mechanical brake unrecovered energy, particularly the amount of the material developed (the brake blocks wear) in the mechanical brake process. Because this mechanical braking energy can be considered equal (as value) to the electrical energy (the active component) of the starting process, in the paper had been simulated a transient starting regime, using MATLAB software and SIMULINK-Sim Power Systems Extensions. Consequently, it had been evaluated the active braking material wear (the brake shoes wear) in the underground metro mechanical braking process, which has important environmental impacts.

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis {{is how to}} realistically model driver {{behavior}} in computer simulations of safety critical traffic events, an increasingly important tool for evaluating automotive active safety systems. By means of a comprehensive literature review, {{it was found that}} current driver models are generally poorly validated on relevant near-crash behavior data. Furthermore, competing models have often not been compared to one another in actual simulation. An applied example, concerning heavy truck electronic stability control (ESC) on low-friction road surfaces (<b>anti-skidding</b> support), is used to illustrate the benefits of simulation-based system evaluation with a driver model, verified to reproduce human behavior. First, a data collection experiment was carried out in a moving-base driving simulator. Then, as a complement to conventional statistical analysis, a number of driver models were fitted to the observed steering behavior, and compared to one another. The best-fitting model was implemented in closed-loop simulation. This approach permitted the conclusion that heavy truck ESC provides a safety benefit in unexpected critical maneuvering, something which has not been previously demonstrated. Furthermore, ESC impact could be analyzed at the level of individual steering behaviors and scenarios, and this impact was found to range from negligible, when the simulated drivers managed well without the system, to large, when they did not. In severe skidding, ESC reduced maximum body slip in the simulations by 73 %, on average. Some specific ideas for improvements to the ESC system were identified as well. As a secondary applied example, an advanced emergency brake system (AEBS) is considered, and a partially novel approach is sketched for its evaluation in what-if resimulation of actual recorded crashes. A number of new insights and hypotheses regarding driver behavior in near-crash situations are presented: When stabilizing a skidding vehicle, drivers were found to employ a rather simple and seemingly suboptimal yaw rate nulling strategy. Collision avoidance steering was found to be best described as an open-loop steering pulse of constant duration, regardless of amplitude. Furthermore, by analysis of data from test tracks as well as real-life crashes and near-crashes, it was found that detection of a collision threat, and also the timing of driver braking or steering in response to it, may be affected by a combination of situation kinematics and processes of neural evidence accumulation. These ideas have been tied together into a modeling framework, describing driving control in general as constructed from intermittent, ballistic control adjustments. These, in turn, are based on overlearned sensorimotor heuristics, which allow near-optimal, vehicle-adapted performance in routine driving, but which may deteriorate into suboptimality in rarely experienced situations such as near-crashes...|$|R

2500|$|The Trident was {{routinely}} able {{to descend}} at rates {{of up to}} 4500ft/min (23m/s) in regular service. In emergency descents it was permissible to use reverse thrust of up to 10,000ft/min. Below 280kn IAS, it was also possible to extend the main landing gear for use as an airbrake. The Trident's first version, Trident 1C, had the unusual capability of using reverse thrust prior to touchdown. The throttles could be closed in the flare and reverse idle set to open the reverser buckets. At pilot discretion, up to full reverse thrust could then be used prior to touchdown.

2500|$|On 29 August, the ATSB gave {{an update}} {{confirming}} further {{aspects of the}} initial investigation.

[...] The ATSB noted that there was no risk of the door being opened by this movement, with the door systems performing as designed. [...] All three of the aircraft's instrument landing systems as well as the <b>anti-skid</b> braking system were unavailable for the landing; the pilots subsequently landed the aircraft without using those systems.

2500|$|The {{commission}} {{found that}} the approach and landing were normal with natural variations but that the spoilers were not deployed when the pilot pulled the lever. No conclusion to the cause was found, although the commission believed it must either have been a mechanical fault in the spoiler lever mechanism or a fault {{in two of the}} four thrust lever micro switches. The pilots received warning of the failure of deployment and also noticed the lack of sufficient retardation, but failed to connect the two issues, instead focusing on the wheel brakes. This caused the removal of the <b>anti-skid</b> system, which caused hydroplaning and subsequently reduced braking effect. The lack of runway grooving was decisive for the hydroplaning to take place. The aircraft was estimated to travel at [...] {{at the time of the}} overrun. Had optimum braking taken place the aircraft would probably have come to a stop on the runway. The massive damage was not caused by the overrun as such, but rather the steep slopes on the side of the runway.|$|E

This offered several advantages over wood: it was cheaper, it saved weight, it required fewer man-hours to apply and it was less likely to interfere with air operations in the event of minor damage.

But by far the most striking change to the RS was the new unique front end treatment, nicknamed Tekkamen (...) or Iron Mask by fans for its distinctive look.

2500|$|To {{withstand}} {{the stresses of}} no-flare landings, Saab made extensive use of aluminium in the airframe of the Viggen, which was constructed using a bonded metal honeycomb structure; the entire rear section of the fuselage, downstream of the engine nozzle, formed a heat-resistant ring composed of titanium. The main landing gear, manufactured by Motala Verkstad, was highly strengthened as well; each leg held two small wheels fitted with <b>anti-skid</b> brakes placed in a tandem arrangement. [...] The design requirements imposed by the large anti-ship missiles employed upon the Viggen necessitated that both the undercarriage and vertical stabilizer be quite tall. To accommodate this, and to allow the main landing gear to be stowed outside of the wing root, the undercarriage legs shortened during retraction. The vertical stabilizer could also be folded via an actuator in order that the aircraft could be stored in smaller hangars, hardened aircraft shelters, and underground hangars, the latter of which were employed by the Swedish military to limit the damage of preemptive attacks.|$|E
2500|$|Electricity was {{provided}} via a bleed air-driven turbine {{housed in the}} rear fuselage, which in turn drove an AC alternator and DC generator; the approach was considered unusual at the time due to most aircraft using driveshaft-driven generators/alternators for electrical energy. A 28V DC battery provided emergency backup power. Aviation author Kev Darling stated of the Lightning: [...] "Never before had a fighter been so dependent upon electronics". Each engine was equipped {{with a pair of}} hydraulic pumps, one of which would provide pressure for the flight-control systems and the other, pressure for the undercarriage, flaps, and airbrakes; switchable hydraulic circuits were used for redundancy {{in the event of a}} leak or other failure. A combination of Dunlop Maxaret <b>anti-skid</b> brakes on the main wheels and an Irvin Air Chute braking parachute slowed the aircraft during landing; a tailhook was also fitted. Accumulators on the wheel brakes performed as backups to the hydraulics, providing minimal braking. Above a certain airspeed a stopped engine would 'windmill', i.e., continue to be rotated by the air flowing through it in a similar manner to a ram air turbine, sufficiently to still generate adequate hydraulic power for the powered controls during flight.|$|E
