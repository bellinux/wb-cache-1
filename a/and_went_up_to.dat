25|$|In the {{original}} 1925 {{plan for the}} U.S. Highway System, US9 was designated along {{the west bank of}} the Hudson River from the New Jersey line to Albany, utilizing then-NY10. North of Albany, US9 mostly followed NY6 to Canada. The lone deviation was from Elizabethtown to Keeseville, where US9 was routed on a previously unnumbered highway to the east instead. NY6 east of the Hudson (up to Rensselaer) and a further extension to Glens Falls via Troy, Mechanicville, and Schuylerville was designated as US109. The alignment of US9 within New York remained unchanged in the final system alignment approved on November11, 1926. However, when US9 was commissioned in New York in 1927, the US109 designation had been dropped and was signed instead as US9E, but only up to Waterford. The segment on {{the west bank of the}} Hudson from New Jersey to Waterford was redesignated as US9W, with the split routes meeting in Waterford. From there, unsuffixed US9 began (still along NY6) <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Canadian border via Rouses Point as planned in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{argued that}} the {{tabernacle}} ran horizontally toward the most sacred area, Mount Sinai went up vertically to the summit, and the sacrificial pile started with the head underneath <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the entrails, and one can interpret each by reference to the others. Douglas noted that in mystical thought, “upper” and “inner” can be equivalent. The pattern is always there throughout creation, with God in the depths or on the heights of everything. Likening the tabernacle to a body, the innards corresponded to the Holy of Holies, for the Bible locates the emotions and thought in the innermost parts of the body; the loins are wrung with remorse or grief; God scrutinizes the innermost part; compassion resides in the bowels. The Tabernacle was associated with creation, and creation with fertility, implying that the innermost part of the Tabernacle was a Divine nuptial chamber, depicting the union between God and Israel. Douglas concluded that {{the summit of the}} mountain was the abode of God, below was the cloudy region that only Moses could enter, and the lower slopes were where the priests and congregation waited, and analogously, the order of placing the parts of the animal on the altar marked out three zones on the carcass, the suet set around and below the diaphragm corresponding to the cloud girdling the middle of the mountain.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} release of Jose Luis Real as coach in October 2011, Chivas {{struggled}} to maintain form finding themselves with 9 coaches being hired and released in the past 3 years. The club was in danger of being relegated to the second division {{for the first time in}} their history. In February 2012, Johan Cruyff was hired as the team's advisor. Nine months later the club sacked him, mainly due to the fact that the team was not improving. On 22 November 2013 Guadalajara placed multiple important players on the transfer list: Marco Fabián, Miguel Ponce, and veterans Luis Michel and Héctor Reynoso. On 25 November 2013, it was confirmed that Jose Luis Real would return to C.D. Guadalajara as head coach. Real showed improvement in the squad but was soon released after the team lost 4–0 at home to rivals Club América. On 2 April 2014, veteran manager Ricardo La Volpe was appointed as head coach. He was immediately released on 30 April 2014 supposedly due to having inappropriate conduct with a female staff member who later took legal action against him. On 12 May 2014, Carlos Bustos was appointed as head coach. On 2 October 2014, Bustos resigned after a 3–1 loss to Club Toluca. He left the team with two wins, four draws, and four losses. On 7 October 2014, former Mexico national team manager José Manuel de la Torre was appointed as head coach. The club started the 2015 season with a 2–1 loss against Chiapas, and this result caused them to become tied in the last position of the Liga MX relegation table with Puebla. The very next week the club showed better character after a 2–1 win at home against Pumas UNAM in front of a very supportful, sold out crowd of fans. By game 12 of the 2015 Clausura season, Guadalajara managed to earn 21 points after winning crucial matches against teams such as Monterrey and relegation rivals Puebla. José Manuel de la Torre's strategic 4–2–3–1 formation proved effect during matches despite the fans' constant requests to use two strikers in the starting line-up. In game 13 of the season, Guadalajara defeated Club León in the Estadio Omnilife's 100th official match <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1st place with 24 points. José Manuel de la Torre's effectiveness rose to 62.1%, the highest rate in the Clausura 2015 season. The club finished the 2015 Clausura in fifth place with the third best defense of the season, thus, qualifying to the playoffs for the first time since 2012. The team started the 2015 Apertura season with 4 points in 6 games and a squad plagued with injuries. On 14 September 2015, the club announced they had released De la Torre.|$|E

2500|$|The Hermann Monument in New Ulm {{dominates the}} Minnesota River valley from a hill {{overlooking}} the city. Inspired by a similar monument called Hermannsdenkmal near Detmold, Germany, this figure {{served as a}} symbol {{for members of the}} Sons of Hermann, a fraternal organization of German Americans. In 1885, the 362 Sons of Hermann lodges across the country committed themselves to the construction of a monument representing their cultural heritage. Through the efforts of Minnesota’s 53 Sons of Hermann lodges, the monument was built in New Ulm, home to many German immigrants. The sculptor chosen for this project was a German sculptor from Ohio, Alfons Pelzer. A delegation from New Ulm visited Ulm in 2009 <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Teutoburger Forest and Detmold in the North of Germany to commemorate the 2000 year anniversary of the Varus battle, when Arminius, a chieftain of the Germanic Cherusci, defeated a Roman army in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.{cn} ...|$|E

Viewers were regularly exposed to his knowledge, insights and dry sense of humour during broadcasts, bringing him a whole new fan base. He was famous for 'rubbishing' drivers he did not think were trying hard enough – during the BBC's live broadcast of the 1989 Monaco Grand Prix he described René Arnoux's comments that non-turbo cars didn't suit the Frenchman's driving skills as [...] "bullshit". He also had a reputation for speaking out against back-markers who held up race leaders and not holding back on any of his commentaries - {{in sharp contrast to the}} gentlemanly Walker.|$|E

It was during this time India toured England. In the fourth match of the series, Baig was [...] "summoned" [...] to play for India, replacing the injured Vijay Manjrekar. Aged 20 years and 131 days, Baig became the youngest Indian cricketer to score a century on debut when he made 112 in India's second innings.

The play debuted on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on April 1, 2013 after 33 previews.

2500|$|In 1867 Parry left Eton <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Exeter College, Oxford.

His musical concerns took second place during his time at Oxford, though during one summer holiday, acting {{on the advice of}} S S Wesley, he went to Stuttgart and studied with Henry Hugo Pierson. As Parry recalled, Pierson's prime aim appeared to be [...] "to disabuse me of Bach and Mendelssohn", and he set Parry the task of reorchestrating works by Weber, Rossini and Beethoven, {{as well as some of}} Parry's own works. Parry came back to England much more critical of Mendelssohn's music, and discovered more adventurous repertoire through attending concerts at London's Crystal Palace: he was particularly taken by Schumann's Second Symphony, with its [...] "wildly glorious" [...] Scherzo and the slow movement's [...] "delicious" [...] orchestration and [...] "most wonderful ... modulation". He went into raptures about Beethoven's Sixth and Eighth symphonies, confessing in his diary: [...] "I can hardly bear to hear or smell a large work by Mendelssohn in the same week as a great work of dear old Beet." [...] Yet, as Dibble notes, Mendelssohn's influence on Parry's own music persisted.|$|E
