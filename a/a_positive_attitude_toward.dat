25|$|Conservative Judaism is {{characterized}} by a commitment to traditional Jewish laws and customs, including observance of Shabbat and kashrut, a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts. Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses. Conservative Judaism holds that the Oral Law is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.|$|E

Methods Seventy-five youths with chronic arthritis aged 8 – 18 years were administered a semi-structured interview assessing illness-related and nonillness-related stressors in important life domains. Children also completed measures of <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> illness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Parents com-pleted a measure of child psychosocial adjustment. Results Higher levels of illness-related and nonillness-related stress were associated {{with higher levels of}} anxiety and depressive symp-toms and parent-reported adjustment problems, while <b>a</b> more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> illness was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> illness moderated the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms.

40|$|To deepen our {{understanding}} of young adults’ sibling relationships in the Italian context, this study examines {{the psychometric properties of}} the Italian adaptation and validation of the Lifespan Sibling Relationship Scale (LSRS) in a sample of 350 Italian university students (68. 6 % females, 31. 4 % males; ages 19 - 30 yr., M = 23. 6, SD = 3. 2). Confirmatory factor analysis showed the expected six-factor structure and a close correlation between factors and scales. Internal consistency was adequate and correlation analysis with the Adult Sibling Relationship Questionnaire (ASRQ) confirmed the theoretical relations among the constructs. The findings confirm the transcultural validity of the LSRS. Moreover, results are consistent with research findings, indicating that: women show <b>a</b> more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> sibling relationships, especially when reporting their relationship with sisters; older siblings show <b>a</b> more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> sibling relationships; perception of current maternal and paternal partiality is related to negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sibling relationships...|$|R

The PowerPoint developed introduced and educated participants on the Assistive Dining Device. Participants completed a demographic form, the Survey of Technology Use and the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology. Participants also to rated their satisfaction with the information presented. Results showed 98 % of the participants were satisfied with the information presented and 95 % of the participants were satisfied with their acquired knowledge base to recommend the device for client use. Master of occupational therapy students were similar in personal characteristics to occupational therapists but were both more satisfied with the Assistive Dining Device characteristics and had <b>a</b> more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> technology.

Methods: A within-subject design was used in which participants were exposed to 8 different movie clips containing alcohol (positive or negative context) or no alcohol portrayals in a controlled laboratory setting. A total of 159 college students (84 males and 75 females) ages 18 to 30 participated in the experiment. Transportation and <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> the movie were measured after each movie clip.
