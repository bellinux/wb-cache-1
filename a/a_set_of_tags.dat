40|$|AbstractThe {{search for}} the {{association}} between complex disease and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes has recently received great attention. Finding <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> SNPs for haplotyping in {{a great number of}} samples is an important step to reduce cost for association study. Therefore, it is essential to select tag SNPs with more efficient algorithms. In this paper, we model problem <b>of</b> selection <b>tag</b> SNPs by MINIMUM TEST SET and use multiple ant colony algorithm (MACA) to search <b>a</b> smaller <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> SNPs for haplotyping. The various experimental results on various datasets show that the running time of our method is less than GTagger and MLR. And MACA can find the most representative SNPs for haplotyping, so that MACA is more stable and the number <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> SNPs is also smaller than other evolutionary methods (like GTagger and NSGA-II).

40|$|Urdu is a {{language}} of the Indo-Aryan family, widely spoken in India and Pakistan, and an important minority language in Europe, North America, and elsewhere. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} computer-based system for part-of-speech <b>tagging</b> <b>of</b> Urdu texts, consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tagset, <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tagging</b> guidelines for manual tagging or post-editing, and the tagger itself. The tagset is defined in accordance with <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> design principles, derived from a survey of good practice in the field of tagset design, including compliance with the EAGLES guidelines on morphosyntactic annotation. These are shown to be extensible to languages, such as Urdu, that are closely related to those languages for which the guidelines were originally devised. The description of Urdu grammar given by Schmidt (1999) is used as a model of the language for the purpose of tagset design. Manual tagging is undertaken using this tagset, by which process <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tagging</b> guidelines are created, and <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> manually <b>tagged</b> texts to serve as training data is obtained. A rule-based methodology is used here to perform tagging in Urdu. The justification for this choice is discussed. A suite of programs which function together within the Unitag architecture are described. This system (as well as a tokeniser) includes an analyser (Urdutag) based on lexical look-up and word-form analysis, and a disambiguator (Unirule) which removes contextually inappropriate <b>tags</b> using <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 274 rules. While the system's final performance is not particularly impressive, this is largely due to a paucity of training data leading to a small lexicon, rather than any substantial flaw in the system.

40|$|Tag SNP {{selection}} {{is an important}} problem in computational biology and genetics because <b>a</b> small <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> SNP markers may help {{reduce the cost of}} genotyping and thus genome-wide association studies. Several methods for selecting <b>a</b> smallest possible <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> SNPs based on different formulations <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> SNP selection (block-based or genome-wide) and mathematical models of marker correlation have been investigated in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new model of multi-marker correlation for genome-wide tag SNP selection, and a simple greedy algorithm to select <b>a</b> smallest possible <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> SNPs according to the model. Our experimental results on several real datasets from the HapMap project demonstrate that the new model yields more succinct tag SNP sets than the previous methods. 1...|$|R

5000|$|For most tagging systems {{the total}} number of tags in the {{collective}} vocabulary is much less than {{the total number}} of objects being tagged. Given this multiplicity of tags to documents, a question remains: how effective are the tags at isolating any single document? Naively, if we specify a single tag in this system we would uniquely identify lots of documents - thus the answer to our question is [...] "not very well!". However this method carries a faulty assumption; not every document is equal. Some documents are more popular and important than others, and this importance is conveyed by the number bookmarks per document. Thus, we can reformulate the above question to be: how well does the mapping of tags to documents retain about the distribution of the documents? Information theory provides a natural framework to understand the amount of shared information between two random variables. The conditional entropy measures the amount of entropy remaining in one random variable when we know the value of a second random variable. Work done by Chi and Mytkowicz show that the entropy of documents conditional on tags, H(D|T), is increasing rapidly. What this means is that, even after knowing completely the value of a tag, the entropy of the set of documents is increasing over time. Conditional Entropy asks the question: [...] "Given that I know <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tags,</b> how much uncertainty regarding the document set that I was referencing with those tags remains?" [...] The fact that this curve is strictly increasing suggests that the specificity of any given tag is decreasing. That is to say, as a navigation aid, tags are becoming harder and harder to use. We are moving {{closer and closer to the}} proverbial [...] "needle in a haystack" [...] where any single tag references too many documents to be considered useful.|$|E
50|$|Another {{way to look}} at {{the data}} is to think about mutual information, which is a measure of {{independence}} between the two variables. Full independence is reached when I(D;T) = 0. Chi and Mytkowicz research on delicious social tagging data show that as a measure of usefulness of the tags and their encoding, there is a worsening trend in the ability of users to specify and find tags and documents when they are engaged in simple fact retrieval. This suggests that we need to build search and recommendation systems that help users sift through resources in social tagging systems, especially when we are engaged in more than simple fact retrieval as characterized by the information theory. In fact, although the number of documents associated with any given tag is increasing, there are many ways contextual information can help users to look for relevant information. This is in fact one of the major weakness of the simple information theory in explaining usefulness of tags - it ignores the fact that humans can extract meanings from <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tags</b> assigned to a document, and this semantic extraction process is exactly the reason why humans are able to communicate efficiently even though the size of our vocabulary is increasing ever since language was developed. For example, the work by Cattuto et al. (2007), published in PNAS, show that while the number of tags are increasing, the general growth pattern is scale-free - the general distribution of tag-tag co-occurrences follows a power-law. Cattuto also finds that the characteristics of this scale-free distribution are dependent on the semantics of the tag - tags that are semantically general (e.g., blogs) tend to co-occur with many tags, while semantically narrow tags (e.g., Ajax) tend to co-occur with few number of tags across a wide set of documents in a social tagging system. What this means is that the assumption of the information theory approach is too simple - when the semantics of the set of tags assigned to documents are taken into account, the predictive value of tags on contents of documents are relatively stable. This finding is important for development of recommender systems - discovering these higher level semantic patterns is important in helping people to find relevant information (also see semantic imitation model below).|$|E

An {{important element of}} collaborative tagging systems is the tag recommender, which proposes <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tags</b> to each newly posted resource.

The result is <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tags</b> related both to the resource and user.
