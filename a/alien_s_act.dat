Findings indicate that the historical contradictions of access and restriction of legal protections and opportunities for the undocumented continue with these policies and become lived in the daily experiences of the study participants. Longitudinal data includes a series of two interviews conducted in 2008 with 10 undocumented Chicana/Latina undergraduates, {{and a series of}} two additional follow-up interviews conducted in 2013 - 2014 with 9 of the original 10 participants, a total of 38 interviews. ...|$|R

We predicted that the <b>alien</b> species experience <b>s</b> relaxed herbivory pressure by specialist herbivores (enemy release hypothesis ERH) whereas it is still attacked by generalist herbivores. Impacts of two generalist (gastropods and rabbits) and one specialist (the caterpillar Tyria jacobaeae) herbivores were assessed with field observations and exclusion experiments. The generalist herbivores had a higher impact on the bio mass and survival of the seedlings of the <b>alien</b> <b>S.</b> inaequidens than on the native J. vulgaris. On the contrary, the spe cialist Tyria jacobaeae attacked exclusively the adults of the native species, supporting {{one of the main}} predictions of the ERH.

40|$|The {{question}} whether an employee is precluded from bringing a workmen 2 ̆ 7 s compensation action {{in one state}} because he has previously received payments under another state 2 ̆ 7 s statute arises where an injury or an employment relationship has ties with two or more states. This is a common problem because of existing differences in the various state compensation acts, and it is intensified because of increasing multistate business activities. The problem most frequently presented to the courts is whether the forum state will award second payments under its act when it authorizes a greater amount of compensation than the first state. Other facets of the problem have also been presented to the courts. For example, {{what happens when the}} employee has been denied compensation in the prior state; or when statutory differences exist relating to the employee 2 ̆ 7 s rights to bring actions outside the compensation act? The current importance of the question of applicability of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>act</b> after prior payments have been received is pointed up by the following facts. The effect of receiving prior payments under another state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>act</b> is not specifically provided for in Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>act.</b> Nor has the effect of receiving prior payments been decided by the Nebraska Supreme Court. The decisions of other courts are, to some extent, in conflict; and the practice of the Nebraska Workmen 2 ̆ 7 s Compensation Court is contrary to the result of recent cases decided by other state courts.

40|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} criminal law with respect to abortion is interesting {{not only because of}} its intimate connection with religious ideology and medical science: it also illustrates the interest which the criminal law has long had in exercising some control over the circumstances of human reproduction. The close relationship which the practice of abortion and infanticide share is also important to understand if one is interested {{in the nature of the}} involvement of the criminal law in human reproduction. All of these issues essentially came together in Lord Ellenborough 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Act,</b> 1803 as abortion at any stage of pregnancy became a statutory felony, although the ecclesiastically inspired distinction of quickening was retained to demarcate the graver offence. The Act also effected a change in the law concerning concealment of illegitimate birth by repealing an old and very punitive statute of 1623. The intention herein is to examine the state of the common law with respect to abortion before and after quickening, and the related issues of infant and maternal death resulting from the abortion attempt, with a view to understanding the basis of Lord Ellenborough 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Act</b> and the profound change in the law which it wrought...|$|R
