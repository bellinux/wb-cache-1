5|$|Steffi Grant {{introduced}} {{herself to the}} occult artist Austin Osman Spare in 1949, having learned about him while she was modelling for Herbert Budd, a tutor at St. Martin's School of Art who had studied alongside Spare. Steffi purchased two of Spare's artworks, which she gave to Kenneth as <b>a</b> <b>present</b> <b>for</b> his twenty-fifth birthday. She subsequently introduced her husband to Spare.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{depicted}} by Jacobites as an unfaithful daughter who destroyed her father {{for her own}} and her husband's gain. In {{the early years of}} their reign, she was often seen as completely under the spell of her husband, but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absences abroad, she was portrayed as capable and confident. Nahum Tate's <b>A</b> <b>Present</b> <b>for</b> the Ladies (1692) compared her to Queen Elizabeth I. Her modesty and diffidence were praised in works such as A Dialogue Concerning Women (1691) by William Walsh, which compared her to Cincinnatus, the Roman general who took on a great task when called to do so, but then willingly abandoned power.|$|E

5|$|Much {{the most}} {{prominent}} decoration on the cup is the cycle of scenes {{from the life of}} Saint Agnes, which is rarely depicted in such detail in art. However, there was one outstanding devotee of the saint in the period: King CharlesV of France, Berry's older brother and Charles VI's father. CharlesV was born in 1338 on Saint Agnes' feast day, January 21, and is recorded as owning at least 13 works of art featuring her, including a different gold cup enamelled with scenes from her life (both are recorded in the 1391 inventory). Until recent decades the generally accepted hypothesis was that Berry ordered the cup as <b>a</b> <b>present</b> <b>for</b> his brother in 1380, to be ready for his birthday in January 1381. When the king died in September 1380, Berry had retained it for a decade before presenting it to CharlesVI.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{attempts}} to conserve the huia, {{but they were}} few, poorly organised and poorly enforced legally: the conservation movement in New Zealand was {{still very much in}} its infancy. There were successive sharp declines in numbers of huia in the 1860s and in the late 1880s, prompting the chiefs of the Manawatu and the Wairarapa to place a rāhui on the Tararua Range. In February 1892, the Wild Birds Protection Act was amended to include the huia, making it illegal to kill the bird, but enforcement was not taken seriously. Island sanctuaries were set up for endangered native birds after this act, but the new bird sanctuaries, including Kapiti Island, Little Barrier Island and Resolution Island, were never stocked with huia. Although attempts were made to capture birds for transfer, no huia were ever transferred. The Kapiti Island attempt is documented as being particularly poorly managed. A live pair destined to be transferred to the island in 1893 was instead appropriated by Buller, who bent the law to take them back to England as <b>a</b> <b>present</b> <b>for</b> Lord Rothschild, along with the last collected live pair of laughing owls.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the episode, flashbacks {{depict a}} young Sam (Ford) and Dean (Canipe) on Christmas Eve of 1991; {{with their father}} out on a hunt, the {{brothers}} are staying alone in a motel room until he returns. As Sam wraps an object he obtained from Bobby Singer as <b>a</b> <b>present</b> <b>for</b> his father, he begins to question Dean about what their father is doing. Although Dean brushes him off, Sam reveals that he has read their father's hunting journal. Dean acquiesces, and confirms that their father hunts monsters. This revelation terrifies Sam, who is afraid that the monsters will come after them. Later that night, Dean wakes Sam up and claims that their father briefly returned and left presents. When Sam's gifts {{end up being a}} Barbie doll and a sparkly baton, Dean admits that he stole them from a nearby house. Despite this, Sam appreciates what Dean tried to do for him, and gives him the gift meant for their fatherthe amulet necklace that Dean has worn ever since.|$|E

5|$|Virgil (David Holliday) {{arrives in}} Thunderbird 2 and {{scatters}} the alligators with aircraft's vertical landing jets. Alan (Matt Zimmerman) and Gordon (David Graham) subdue {{two of the}} animals with heavy-duty tranquiliser guns. When the third returns to the house, Alan exits Thunderbird 2 on a hoverjet to lure the alligator away. He collides with a tree and falls from the hoverjet, but is saved by Gordon, who shoots the oncoming alligator before it can attack Alan. Culp threatens to empty the whole Theramine vial into the Ambro River unless he is granted safe passage upstream. Launching Thunderbird 4, Gordon encounters a fourth, far larger reptile that ravages Blackmer's boat and kills Culp. Virgil disposes of the creature with a missile fired from Thunderbird 2. Although it is feared at first that the vial has been smashed, Gordon retrieves it from the riverbed intact. Later, on Tracy Island, Jeff announces that Theramine {{will be subject to}} international security restrictions. Tin-Tin (Christine Finn) has been away on a shopping trip and has bought Alan <b>a</b> <b>present</b> <b>for</b> his upcoming birthday – a pygmy alligator.|$|E

The following day, Wednesday 1 April 1896, another child, named Harry Simmons, was taken to Mayo Road. However, with no spare white edging tape available, the length around Doris' corpse was removed and used to strangle the 13-month-old boy.|$|E

25|$|Several {{contemporary}} manuscripts {{from the}} 13th century, devoid of colophons have sometimes {{been attributed to}} Roslin. MS 8321, the mutilated remains of which were formerly at Nor Nakhichevan and now in Yerevan, was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as <b>a</b> <b>present</b> <b>for</b> his godchild prince Levon. Prince Levon's portrait was bound by mistake in MS 7690 and was returned to its original place. A dedicatory inscription which faced the portrait has been lost. The portrait shows the prince in his teens wearing a blue tunic decorated with lions passant in gold roundels with a jeweled gold band at the hem. Two angels, in light blue and pink draperies, hold their rhipidia (liturgical fans) above the prince's head. Stylistically these pieces are {{much closer to the}} ones painted by Roslin than those of other artists at Hromkla who were still active in the 1250s. Another mutilated manuscript, MS 5458 located in Yerevan is often assigned to Roslin. Thirty-eight vellum leaves from the Gospel of John have been incorporated into the manuscript in the late 14th or early 15th century in Vaspurakan.|$|E
25|$|While writing Busted's second album, <b>A</b> <b>Present</b> <b>for</b> Everyone, Fletcher {{was asked}} by the record label if he was {{available}} to film auditions for a new band, V. It was at this time that Danny Jones and Fletcher met for the first time; Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be an instrumental band rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing boyband, for which they were intended. Fletcher was impressed with Jones' unique style and so approached and invited him to write with himself and Bourne. When writing projects for Busted had come to an end, the two began collaborating for their own (yet unnamed) band and, eventually, moved into the InterContinental Hotel in London for two months, (while still receiving help from Bourne) to concentrate on writing together. Bassist Dougie Poynter and drummer Harry Judd were subsequently recruited via a classified advertisement in the NME magazine. The pair, both Essex lads, coincidentally turned up at the same audition and got to talking over their shared appreciation of the band The Starting Line, after Poynter noticed their name and logo was printed on Judd's T-shirt.|$|E

25|$|Examples of {{children}} raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt {{from a nearby}} city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as <b>a</b> <b>present</b> <b>for</b> them, the child will excitedly open it up and eat {{a few of the}} chocolates. Then the child will go over {{to the rest of the}} group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to always think about others. Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box in the middle of the room and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not want to be like most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.|$|E
25|$|After gaining {{experience}} from ring side, Cheerleader Melissa eventually {{had her first}} proper match on her 17th birthday against Lexie Fyfe in a losing effort at an outdoor carnival event. In 2001, she entered into Ultimate Pro Wrestling and lost a tag team match alongside Looney Lane {{which led to a}} feud between the two. The first lost in the tag team match would be her only one with the company as she went on to win a grudge match between the two followed by a succession of mixed tag matches, first with Shannon Ballard and then alongside both Ballard Brothers, beating Lane and Frankie Kazarian in the mixed tag team match as well as Nova in the final six-person intergender tag match. The following year, in the summer of 2002, Anderson was personally invited to wrestle and train for three months in Japan for the promotion Arsion. She was selected alongside Taylor Matheny who had recently received exposure in World Wrestling Entertainment's Tough Enough program, and thus Anderson received much internet attention by association. Among the rigorous training schedule she wrestled what she claims to be some of her favorite matches, particularly a 15-minute draw against Rie Tamada and her loss to Mariko Yoshida. Also as <b>a</b> <b>present</b> <b>for</b> her 20th birthday, she was allowed to tag team with veteran female wrestler Lioness Asuka.|$|E
