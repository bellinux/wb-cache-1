40|$|Recently, {{lignocellulosic}} biomass as {{the most}} abundant renewable resource has been widely considered for bioalcohols production. However, the complex structure of lignocelluloses requires a multi-step process which is costly and time consuming. Although, several bioprocessing approaches {{have been developed for}} pretreatment, saccharification and fermentation, bioalcohols production from lignocelluloses is still limited because of the economic infeasibility of these technologies. This cost constraint could be overcome by designing and constructing robust cellulolytic and bioalcohols producing microbes and by using them in a consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) system. This paper comprehensively reviews potentials, recent advances and challenges faced in CBP systems for efficient bioalcohols (ethanol and butanol) production from lignocellulosic and starchy biomass. The CBP strategies include using native single strains with cellulytic and alcohol production activities, microbial co-cultures containing both cellulytic and ethanologenic microorganisms, and genetic engineering of cellulytic microorganisms to be <b>alcohol-producing</b> or alcohol producing microorganisms to be cellulytic. Moreover, high-throughput techniques, such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, next generation sequencing and synthetic biology developed to explore novel microorganisms and powerful enzymes with high activity, thermostability and pH stability are also discussed. Currently, the CBP technology is in its infant stage, and ideal microorganisms and/or conditions at industrial scale are yet to be introduced. So, it is essential to bring into attention all barriers faced and take advantage of all the experiences gained to achieve a high-yield and low-cost CBP process...|$|E

In the Lepidoptera, {{members of the}} FAR gene family serve in the biosynthesis of sex pheromones involved in mate communication. We used a group of closely related species, the small ermine moths (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) as a model to investigate the role of FARs in the biosynthesis of complex pheromone blends. Homology-based molecular cloning in three Yponomeuta species led to the identification of multiple putative FAR transcripts homologous to FAR genes from the Bombyx mori genome. The expression of one transcript was restricted to the female pheromone-gland tissue, suggesting a role in pheromone biosynthesis, and the encoded protein belonged to a recently identified Lepidoptera-specific pgFAR gene subfamily. The Yponomeuta evonymellus pgFAR mRNA was up-regulated in sexually mature females and exhibited a 24 -h cyclic fluctuation pattern peaking in the pheromone production period. Heterologous expression confirmed that the Yponomeuta pgFAR orthologs in all three species investigated [Y. evonymellus (L.), Yponomeuta padellus (L.), and Yponomeuta rorellus (Hübner) ] encode a functional FAR with a broad substrate range that efficiently promoted accumulation of primary alcohols in recombinant yeast supplied {{with a series of}} biologically relevant C 14 - or C 16 -acyl precursors.

Compared to chemical production, microbial production of sugar alcohols has become attractive because of its environmentally friendly and sustainable characteristics. Our previous study identified the nonconventional yeast Pichia anomala TIB-x 229 as a potential producer of sugar alcohols from glucose. To further improve strain performance, we combined genome shuffling with optimized high throughput screening methods for the directed improvement of nonconventional yeast and complex phenotypes. Results: To accelerate strain improvement, a practical genome shuffling procedure was developed and success-fully applied in the nonconventional yeast P. anomala to increase sugar alcohol production. Through two rounds of genome shuffling, an improved P. anomala isolate GS 2 - 3 could produce 47. 1 g/L total sugar alcohols from 100 g/L glucose, which was 32. 3 % higher than the original strain. In this process, a simple and accurate colorimetric assay was optimized and used for high throughput screening of sugar <b>alcohol-producing</b> strains. Moreover, a fluorescence-activated cell sorting method was developed to efficiently screen protoplast fusions for genome shuffling of noncon-ventional yeast. Conclusion: An efficient genome shuffling procedure was developed and applied to enhance the sugar alcohol production of the nonconventional yeast P. anomala.

40|$|Wax esters are esters of {{long-chain}} {{fatty acids}} and long-chain fatty alcohols which are of considerable commercial importance and are produced {{on a scale}} of 3 million tons per year. The oil from the jojoba plant (Simmondsia chinensis) is the main biological source of wax esters. Although it has a multitude of potential applications, the use of jojoba oil is restricted, due to its high price. In this study, we describe the establishment of heterologous wax ester biosynthesis in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain by coexpression of a fatty <b>alcohol-producing</b> bifunctional acyl-coenzyme A reductase from the jojoba plant and a bacterial wax ester synthase from Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP 1, catalyzing the esterification of fatty alcohols and coenzyme A thioesters of fatty acids. In the presence of oleate, jojoba oil-like wax esters such as palmityl oleate, palmityl palmitoleate, and oleyl oleate were produced, amounting to up to ca. 1 % of the cellular dry weight. In addition to wax esters, fatty acid butyl esters were unexpectedly observed in the presence of oleate. The latter could be attributed to solvent residues of 1 -butanol present in the medium component, Bacto tryptone. Neutral lipids produced in recombinant E. coli were accumulated as intracytoplasmic inclusions, demonstrating that the formation and structural integrity of bacterial lipid bodies do not require specific structural proteins. This is the first report on substantial biosynthesis and accumulation of neutral lipids in E. coli, which might open new perspectives for the biotechnological production of cheap jojoba oil equivalents from inexpensive resources employing recombinant microorganisms...|$|E

This work aimed to verify the effect of chlorine dioxide, a well-known biocide for bacterial decontamination of water and equipments, against contaminant bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) from alcoholic fermentation, through the method of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), {{as well as its}} effect on the industrial yeast inoculum.

Alcohol dehydrogenase has been isolated from a strain (NRRL B 593) of C. beijerinckii producing isopropanol {{and from a}} strain (NRRL B 592) not producing isopropanol. Butanol-ethanol dehydrogenase activities were present in both strains, but isopropanol dehydrogenase activity was present only in the isopropanol-producing strain. The butanol-ethanol dehydrogenase of strain NRRL B 592 had Mr 66, 000 and a Km of 6 μM for butyraldehyde. In contrast, the butanol-ethanol-isopropanol dehydrogenase of strain NRRL B 593 had a Mr 100, 000 and Kms of 9. 5 and 1. 0 mM for butyraldehyde and acetone, respectively. In a purification by four different types of separatory methods (DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite, Sephacryl S- 300, and Matrex Gel Red A), butanol-ethanol-isopropanol dehydrogenase activities of strain NRRL B 593 were purified up to 200 -fold (10 to 30 % yield), and these activities were not separated. Gel electrophoresis followed by activity stain also revealed distinct mobilities for the butanol-ethanol dehydrogenase of strain NRRL B 592 and the butanol-ethanol-isopropanol dehydrogenase of strain NRRL B 593. In cell extracts from both strains, a higher alcohol dehydrogenase activity was measured with NADP(H) than with NAD(H). The 150 - to 200 -fold-purified alcohol dehydrogenase from strain NRRL B 593 did not show any NAD(H) -linked activities.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop novel and applicable methodologies to solve systematically problems along a roadmap of constructing a globally optimum biorefinery design. The roadmap consists of the following problems: (1) synthesis of conceptual biorefinery pathways from given feedstocks and products, (2) screening of the synthesized pathways to identify the most economic pathways, (3) development of a flexible biorefinery configuration, and (4) techno-economic analysis of a detailed biorefinery design. In the synthesis problem, a systems-based "forward-backward" approach was developed. It involves forward synthesis of biomass to possible intermediates and reverse synthesis starting with desired products and identifying necessary species and pathways leading to them. Then, two activities are performed to generate complete biorefinery pathways: matching (if one of the species synthesized in the forward step is also generated by the reverse step) or interception (a task is determined to take a forward-generated species with a reverse-generated species by identifying a known process or by using reaction pathway synthesis to link to two species.) In the screening problem, the Bellman's Principle of Optimality was applied to decompose the optimization problem into sub-problems in which an optimal policy of available technologies was determined for every conversion step. Subsequently, either a linear programming formulation or dynamic programming algorithm was used to determine the optimal pathways. In the configuration design problem, a new class of design problems with flexibility was proposed to build the most profitable plants that operate only when economic efficiency is favored. A new formulation approach with proposed constraints called disjunctive operation mode was also developed to solve the design problems. In the techno-economic analysis for a detailed design of biorefinery, the process producing hydrocarbon fuels from lignocellulose via the carboxylate platform was studied. This analysis employed many state-of-the-art chemical engineering fundamentals and used extensive sources of published data and advanced computing resources to yield reliable conclusions to the analysis. Case studies of <b>alcohol-producing</b> pathways from lignocellulosic biomass were discussed to demonstrate the merits of the proposed approaches in the former three problems.

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Yeasts {{produce a}} broad range of aroma-active {{volatile}} esters and higher alcohols during alcoholic fermentation. Some of these esters and higher alcohols are important for the fruity flavors and therefore the final quality of wine and other fermented beverages. Esters are produced and hydrolyzed by alcohol acetyltransferases and esterases, respectively. In yeast, ester-synthesizing activities are represented by two alcohol acetyltransferases encoded by the ATFI and ATF 2 genes, and by an ethanol hexanoyl transferase encoded by the EHTI gene. Atfl p and Atf 2 p appear responsible for the production of ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate, while Ehtl p synthesizes ethyl hexanoate from ethanol and hexanoyl-CoA. Although a fair amount of information is available regarding the ATF 1 gene, limited information is available on the remaining alcohol acetyltransferases. Only two genes that code for esterases have been identified in yeast, namely lAHI and TIPI. It has also been shown that the balance between alcohol acetyltransferases and esterases is important for the net rate of ester accumulation. Higher alcohols are synthesized from the a-keto-acids in the branched-chain amino acid metabolic pathway by decarboxylation and reduction. The transamination of the amino acid to the respective a-keto-acid is catalyzed by mitochondrial and cytosolic branched-chain amino acid transferases, which are encoded by the BATI and BAT 2 genes, respectively. In recent years, a strong scientific and industrial interest in the metabolism of flavoractive compounds has emerged, but information regarding the roles of specific enzymes and the physiological relevance of their metabolism remains limited. The aim of this project was to investigate the physiological and metabolic consequences of changes in the expression levels of some of the key enzymes involved in aroma compound production. The consequences of these changes on the chemical composition and the fermentation bouquet of wines and distillates were also investigated. The first part of the section on the results in this dissertation reports on the role and relative importance of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzymes involved in ester metabolism, namely Atflp, Atf 2 p, Ehtlp, Iahlp and Tiplp. The corresponding genes were overexpressed in a laboratory strain of S. cerevisiae, BY 4742, and in a widely used commercial wine yeast strain, VIN 13. Table wine and base wines for distillation were prepared with these VIN 13 transformed strains. The ester concentrations and aroma profiles of the wines and distillates were analyzed and compared. The data indicated that the overexpression of ATF 1 and ATF 2 increased the concentrations of ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, 2 -pheylethyl acetate and ethyl caproate, while the overexpression of JAHI resulted in a significant decrease in the concentrations of ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, hexyl acetate and 2 -phenylethyl acetate. The overexpression of EHTI resulted in a marked increase in the concentrations of ethyl caproate, ethyl caprylate and ethyl caprate, while the overexpression of TJP 1 did not decrease the concentrations of any of the esters. In most cases, there was a correlation between the increase in esters and the decrease in higher alcohols. The data suggest that yeast balances the amount of different esters produced through alcohol acetyltransferases and esterases, and that, in some cases, these enzymes appear to overlap in function and/or influence each other's activity. In {{the second part of the}} results section, the consequences of the deletion and the overexpression of two genes, BATl and BAT 2, which encode transaminases that contribute to the metabolism of higher alcohols, were investigated. The genes were both disrupted in a S. cerevisiae BY 4742, and overexpressed in both this laboratory strain and in the VIN 13 wine yeast strain. The effects of these modifications on the general physiology of the corresponding yeast strains and on higher alcohol metabolism were assessed in a range of growth conditions, including aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions, in the presence of glucose or raffinose as sole carbon source and growth in the presence of various concentrations of amino acids. Table wine and base wines for distillation were prepared with the modified industrial strains and the concentrations of the higher alcohols and the aroma profiles of the wine and distillates were analyzed and compared. Batl deletion seemed to be lethal under the conditions that were created, and therefore only the bat 2 !:!. strain, together with the BATI and BAT 2 overexpression strains, were investigated. These modifications did not appear to significantly affect the general physiology of the strains. The results obtained indicated that the overexpression of BATI increased the concentrations of isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate, and, to a lesser extent, the concentrations of isobutanol and isobutyric acid. The overexpression of the BAT 2 gene resulted in a substantial increase in the levels of isobutanol, isobutyric acid and propionic acid production, and a modest increase in the level of propanol and isovaleric acid. Interestingly, the overexpression of BAT 2 led to a decrease in isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate concentrations. Sensory analyses indicated that the wines and distillates produced with the strains in which the BATl and BAT 2 genes were overexpressed had more fruity characteristics (peach and apricot aromas) than the wines produced by the wild-type strains. This study offers new prospects for the development of wine yeast starter strains with optimized ester and higher <b>alcohol-producing</b> capability that could assist winemakers in their efforts to consistently produce wine to definable specifications and styles and a predetermined flavor profile. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Gedurende fermentasie produseer giste 'n wye verskeidenheid vlugtige aromatiese esters en hoër alkohole. Sommige van hierdie esters en hoër alkohole is belangrik vir die vrugtige geure en dra dus by tot die finale kwaliteit van wyn en ander gefermenteerde drankies. Esters word onderskeidelik deur alkoholasetieltranferases en esterases geproduseer en gehidroliseer. In giste word die ester-sintetiserende aktiwiteite deur twee alkoholasetieltransferases verteenwoordig wat deur die ATFI-en ATF 2 -gene, asook 'n etanolheksanoïeltransferase wat deur die EHTl-geen, gekodeer word. Dit blyk dat ATFlp en ATF 2 p verantwoordelik is vir die produksie van etielasetaat en isoamielasetaat, terwyl Ehtl p-etielheksanoaat vanaf etanol en heksanoïel-CoA sintetiseer. Alhoewel daar 'n redelike hoeveelheid inligting t. o. v die ATF I-geen beskikbaar is, is daar weinig inligting oor die res van die aloholasetieltransferases. Slegs twee gene wat vir esterases kodeer, is in gis geïdentifiseer, naamlik IAHI en TIPI. Daar is ook bewys dat 'n balans tussen die alkoholasetieltransferases en esterases baie belangrik is vir die netto-tempo van ester-akkumulasie. Hoër alkohole word gesintetiseer vanaf a-keto sure in die vertakte-ketting aminosuur metaboliese pad deur dekarboksilasie en reduksie. Die transaminasie van die aminosuur na die onderkeidelike a-ketosuur word deur vertakte-ketting aminosuur transferases, geleë in die mitochondrion en sitosol, en gekodeer deur BATl- en BAT 2 -gene, gekataliseer. In die laaste paar jare het daar 'n sterk wetenskaplike, asook industrïele, belangstelling in die metabolisme van aroma-aktiewe komponente te voorskyn gekom, maar inligting in verband met die rol van spesifieke ensieme en die fisiologiese belangrikheid van hul metabolisme is egter beperk. Die doel van hierdie projek was om die fisiologiese en metaboliese gevolge van veranderinge in die ekspressievlakke van sommige sleutelensieme betrokke by aromakomponent-produksie te ondersoek. Die gevolge van hierdie veranderinge op chemiese vlakke, asook hoe die fermentasie-aroma van die wyne en distillate beïnvloed word, is ook bestudeer. Die eerste gedeelte van die resultate rapporteer oor die rol en relatiewe belangrikheid van die Saccharomyces cerevisiae-ensieme betrokke by estermetabolisme, naamlik Atfl p, Atf 2 p, Ehtlp, Iahlp en Tiplp. Die gene was ooruitgedruk in 'n laboratoriurnras van S. cerevisiae, BY 4742, asook in 'n kommersïele wyngisras, VIN 13. Tafelwyne en basiswyne vir distillasie is gemaak met die getransformeerde VIN 13 -rasse. Die esterkonsentrasies en aromaprofiele van die wyne en distillate is ontleed en vergelyk. Die data het gewys dat die ooruitdrukking van ATFI- en ATF 2 -gene 'n verhoging in etielasetaat, isoamielasetaat, 2 -fenieletielasetaat en etielkaproaat veroorsaak het, terwyl ooruitdrukking van !AHI 'n betekenisvolle afname in etielasetaat-, isoamielasetaat-, heksielasetaat- en 2 -fenieletielasetaat-konsentrasies veroorsaak het. Die ooruitdrukking van EHTI het 'n duidelike verhoging in etielkaproaat, etielkaprilaat en etielkapraat veroorsaak en die ooruitdrukking van TIPIhet geen van die esterkonsentrasies verander nie. In die meeste gevalle was daar nie 'n korrelasie tussen die toename in esters en afname in hoër alkohole nie. Die data stelook voor dat die gis 'n balans tussen die verskillende esters handhaaf deur middel van die alkoholasetieltrasferases en esterases, en in sommige gevalle blyk dit dat die ensieme dieselfde funksies het en/of mekaar se aktiwiteit beïnvloed. In die tweede gedeelte van die resultate is die oorsake van delesie en ooruitdrukking van twee gene, BAT 1 en BAT 2, wat kodeer vir transaminases wat tot hoër alkohol metabolisme bydra, bestudeer. Die gene is uitgeslaan in S. cerevisiae BY 4742 en ooruitgedruk in BY 4742 en in die wyngisras VIN 13. Die effekte van hierdie modifikasies op die algemene fisiologie van die verskillende gisrasse en op hoëralkoholmetabolisme is onder 'n verskeidenheid kondisies bestudeer, naamlik aërobies en anaërobiese groeikondisies, in die teenwoordigheid van glukose of raffinose as die enigste koolstofbron, asook in die teenwoordigheid van 'n verskeidenheid konsentrasies aminosure. Tafelwyne en basiswyne vir distillasie is gemaak met die gemodifiseerde industrïele rasse en die konsentrasies van die hoër alkohole en aromaprofiele van die wyne en distillate is ontleed en vergelyk. Bat 1 -delesie was dodelik onder die kondisies, daarom is slegs die batlts-tes tesame met die BAT 1 en BAT 2 wat in die rasse ooruitgedruk is, bestudeer. Die modifikasies het nie 'n beduidende effek op die algemene fisiologie van die rasse getoon nie. Die data het wel getoon dat die ooruitdrukking van BAT 1 'n verhoging in isoamielalkohol- en isoamielasetaatkonsentrasies, en tot 'n mindere mate isobutielalkohol- en isobottersuur-konsentrasies, veroorsaak het. Die ooruitdrukking van BAT 2 het 'n beduidende toename in isobutanol-, isobottersuur- en propioonsuurkonsentrasies en 'n kleinere toename in propanol- en isovaleriaansuur veroorsaak. Die ooruitdrukking van BAT 2 het ook gelei tot 'n afname in isoamielalkohol- en isoamielasetaatkonsentrasies. Sensoriese analises het getoon dat die wyne en distillate wat geproduseer is met die rasse waarin die BAT 1 en BAT 2 gene ooruitgedruk is meer vrugtige eienskappe (perske- en appelkoos-aromas) getoon het as die wyne wat deur die wildetipe rasse geproduseer is. Die studie lewer nuwe vooruitsigte vir die ontwikkeling van wyngiste met geoptimiseerde ester en hoër alkohol produserende eienskappe wat die wynmakers in staat kan stelom wyne te produseer met gedefinieerde spesifikasies en style en 'n voorafbepaalde aromaprofiel...|$|E
