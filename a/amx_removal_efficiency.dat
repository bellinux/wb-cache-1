40|$|Introduction: Amoxicillin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} groups of pharmaceuticals that benefits humans and animals. However, antibiotics excertion in wastewaters and environment have emerged as a serious risk to the biotic environment, and their toxic effects can harm the organisms. Iron-based metallic nanoparticles have received special attention in regard with remediation of groundwater contaminants. In the typical nZVI-based bimetallic particle system, Fe acts as the reducing agent. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the synthesis and characteristics of nZVI in regard with degrading AMX. Methods: In this study, nZVI nanoparticles were synthesized using the liquid-phase reduction method by EDTA as a stabilizer material. Structure and properties of nanoparticles were characterized by BET, SEM, XRD and EDX analysis. A multi-variate analysis was applied using a response surface methodology (RSM) in order to develop a quadratic model as a functional relationship between <b>AMX</b> <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> and independent variables (initial pH values, dosage of nZVI, contact time and amoxicillin concentration). The four independent variables of solution pH (2 – 10), AMX concentration (5 - 45 mg/l), contact time (5 - 85 min) and nanoparticles dose (0. 25 – 1. 25 g) were transformed to the coded values. Results: The study results demonstrated that more than 69 % of AMX was removed by nZVI. The optimal AMX removal conditions using nZVI were found as 1. 25 g of nZVI, pH 4, contact time of 80 min and concentration of 30 mg/l. Conclusions: The ability of nZVI in degradation of AMX revealed that these materials can serve as a potential nano material with respect to the environmental remediation...|$|E

The O’Melia and Ali 1 model assumed that the particle removal is due to filter grains as well as the particles that are already deposited onto the filter grain.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the best <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of BOD 5 was 85.24 %. A study by Abdel-Shafy et al. (2014) on {{greywater}} treatment using a hybrid system {{showed that the}} <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> for BOD 5 was 70.6 %. Do Couto et al. (2015) studied greywater treatment via anaerobic filter system with UV disinfection. Their results revealed that BOD 5 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the output filter was 73 %. Saumya et al. (2015) used a constructed wetland system with a Heliconia angusta plant for raw greywater treatment, so <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of BOD 5 was 70 %. In a study by Abdel-Kader (2013) on the treatment of greywater by the RBC process and disinfection with UV light, it was shown that the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of BOD 5 was 93 – 96 %; furthermore, {{in a study by}} Hourlier et al. (2010), the BOD 5 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> from synthetic greywater was lower than that in real greywater. Therefore, we could conclude that synthetic greywater had low biodegradability capability as compared to real ‎greywater‎, and its removal values were lower than those of real greywater. Moreover, aerobic systems showed better performance in the removal of BOD 5 from greywater relative to anaerobic systems which might be due to the presence of surfactants in the input greywater and their the negative effects on anaerobic microorganisms (Ghunmi et al. 2010; Hernández Leal et al. 2010). As exhibited in Fig.  2, increase of OLR caused increase of BOD removal which reached its maximum value at an OLR of 0.44 gCOD/L.d. Next, with the OLR increased more, efficiency decreased. Consequently, ANOVA statistical test results showed {{a significant difference between the}} <b>removal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> at different OLRs (p ≤  0.001). By increasing the contact time of the greywater with microorganisms and allowing longer adaption, the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> also enhanced. Therefore, by increasing input BOD 5 and supplying more organic materials for microorganisms, the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> soared. But at OLRs of 0.88 and 1.3  gCOD/L.d, the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> decreased, so it could be argued that higher levels of BOD 5 in greywater, due to the xenobiotic substances, led to decrease of <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> (Jabornig and Favero 2013).|$|R

The observation of biofilm formation during iron corrosion was also reported before (Lee and Characklis 1993). As previously mentioned, the TN removal by heterotrophic denitrification should be lower than 12 % (the value in AnSBR-C) in AnSBR-Fe since the effluent COD of AnSBR-Fe was higher than that of AnSBR-C. Since the TN removal by waste iron shavings via chemical reaction could be negligible (Fig.  6 c), the TN <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> by autotrophic denitrification should be higher than 8 % in AnSBR-Fe considering the total TN <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 20 %.|$|R

The difference between the centre point experiments and the experiments in which no current was applied could be an effect of microbial degradation induced by the electric field, in line with previous findings (Dong et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2010).|$|R

In this work, {{simultaneous}} {{absorption of}} SO 2 and NO from N 2 -NO-SO 2 simulated flue gas using sodium chlorate as the additive and urea as the reductant was investigated experimentally in a rotating packed bed. In RPB, various rotational speeds, gas flow rates and liquid flow rates were studied {{by means of}} the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of SO 2 and NO. The experimental results showed that the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of SO 2 was higher than 99. 00 % under various experimental conditions and, at the same time, the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of NO exhibited different results under various experimental conditions. The simultaneous NO <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 82. 45 % and the SO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 99. 49 % could be obtained under the N 2 flow rate of 0. 5 m 3 /h, SO 2 flow rate of 6 mL/min, the NO flow rate of 4 mL/min, the rotational speed of 460 rpm and the absorbent flow rate of 40 L/h...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of some operating condition on the simultaneous removal of NO and SO 2 from simulated flue gas in the lab-scale agitated bubbling reactor. The experimental results showed that NO <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> increased {{with the increase in}} the molar ratio of O 3 /NO, while <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of SO 2 decreased. When absorption liquid changed from distilled water to Na 2 CO 3 solution, it is observed that <b>removal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of NO and SO 2 increase with the increase in the concentration of Na 2 CO 3 solution. At 0. 08 mol/L of Na 2 CO 3 solution, the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of SO 2 and NO are 100 % and 93 %, respectivel...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is aims to compare monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) solvents to achieve higher CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> in absorber column by varying some process parameters including amine concentration, lean solvent flow rate and temperature. Process model was developed using Aspen Plus v 12. 1 with the electrolyte property inserts for each amine using electrolyte-NRTL thermodynamic model. The rate-based Radfrac absorber column are model by using data adapted from pilot plant data Case 32 at University of Texas, Austin by Dugas (2006). From the results obtained, it showed {{shows that the}} CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> is increased with increasing of amine concentration for each amine. The CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> using the MEA solvent is the highest compared than DEA and MDEA solvent. Besides that, it is more realistic to used MEA concentration not more than 31. 5 wt. % as it can achieved 99. 8 % CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> and to avoid corrosion effect to equipment in real plant. As the lean solvent flow rate increases, the CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> for studied amines increases that can be arranged as the following order: MEA > DEA > MDEA. MEA shows high CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> because MEA is primary amine which has high CO 2 absorption capacity and reactivity than to DEA and MDEA. However, CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> was decrease as lean solvent temperature increase for all amines. This {{is due to the}} reduction of amine in lean solvent since it were vaporised before entering the absorber. MEA solvent can achieved approximately 99 % CO 2 removal at 1 kg/s lean solvent flow rate. While the DEA and MDEA can achieve 99 % CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> around 133 kg/s and 110 kg/s lean solvent flow rate respectively. It proved that the MEA can achieve very high CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> at low lean solvent flow rate and concentration compared to DEA and MDEA...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{absorption}} of CO 2 from a CO 2 /N 2 mixture is investigated using a membrane gas absorption process. In {{order to avoid}} any wetting problem and maintain optimal the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency,</b> composite membranes, with a porous support coated by a dense layer, are used. Two composite membranes are studied: Oxyplus® and a polypropylene (PP) porous fiber coated by poly(1 trimethylsilyl- 1 -propyne) (PTMSP). The influence of some parameters on the CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> is explored. A lower <b>removal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> is obtained with a PP-PTMSP fiber compared with Oxyplus® because of a PTMSP layer thickness four {{times larger than the}} dense layer of Oxyplus® fibers. Indeed, this dense layer is the key parameter which controls the membrane resistance. Experiments achieved validate the resistance of the membrane to the wettability. Increasing the liquid flow raises the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of at least 5 %. This one is higher than 90 %. In the Oxyplus® module case, similar <b>removal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are obtained, around 99 %, with the blend of methyldiethanolamine and triethylene tetramine (MDEA +TETA) and with monoethanolamine (MEA) for gas velocities lower than 0. 84 mdot operators− 1. A 363 K regeneration temperature of liquid phase and 2 bar is sufficient to maintain a 90 % CO 2 <b>removal</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|R
