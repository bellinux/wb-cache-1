5|$|After one {{additional}} lap had been run, IndyCar officials red-flagged the race as the track was {{not suitable for}} racing. In addition to the debris left by the fifteen cars involved in the wreck, the asphalt surface was damaged and the catch fencing needed repair. As the teams waited {{to see if they}} would resume racing, they also were waiting for word on Wheldon's condition <b>as</b> <b>word</b> had not been relayed to the track.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>word</b> {{increased}} of Bayh's intentions, {{political scientists}} opined on the detractions of a run. Citing {{the fact that}} his eight years as governor may be nullified by its distance in time and that his visibility in the Senate was low, critics pondered whether moderate voters may be more inclined to line with possible candidate Mark Warner of Virginia. However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with {{schizophrenia}} {{may experience}} hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech {{that is not}} understandable known <b>as</b> <b>word</b> salad. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.|$|E

30|$|If a given {{morpheme}} also functions <b>as</b> a <b>word,</b> then {{of course}} <b>as</b> a <b>word</b> it does fall into a syntactic class. Many words do consist of only one morpheme. But not all morphemes occur <b>as</b> <b>words</b> on their own. This point is often misunderstood, because in Old Chinese there were many more monomorphemic words; since their modern descendants are written with the same characters, {{it is easy to}} forget that they no longer occur <b>as</b> <b>words</b> in the modern language.|$|R

5|$|Finally {{the protests}} became an armed {{rebellion}}. The first {{shots were fired}} at the Oliver Miller Homestead in present-day South Park Township, Pennsylvania, about ten miles south of Pittsburgh. <b>As</b> <b>word</b> of the rebellion spread across the frontier, {{a whole series of}} loosely organized resistance measures were taken, including robbing the mail, stopping court proceedings, and the threat of an assault on Pittsburgh. One group disguised as women assaulted a tax collector, cropped his hair, coated him with tar and feathers, and stole his horse. Another group bombarded the estate of the tax collector John Neville, a friend of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|Hananu's revolt {{coincided with}} Turkish revolts against the French {{military}} presence in the Anatolian cities of Urfa, Gaziantep and Mar'ash. It also was related to Barakat's revolt in Antioch, which was captured and held by Arab guerrillas for a week starting on 13 March 1920. The French Air Force bombarded Antioch for 17 days until the rebels withdrew to Narlija. On 18 April, taking advantage of the diversion of French forces to Gaziantep where a major battle between French and Turkish forces was taking place, Hananu decided to attack the French garrison at Harim. With fifty of his irregulars, Hananu stormed the town. <b>As</b> <b>word</b> of his attack spread to nearby villages, his forces subsequently swelled to 400.|$|E

Jackson partnered with Republican Henry Hyde to push for a third Chicago airport. Jackson said Hyde was the right wing complement to his own left wing role in pursuing support for the airport. Jackson has withheld support for local Democrats who would not support the airport, such as 1998 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Glenn Poshard.|$|E
5|$|The aborigines signalled their {{surrender}} {{by sending}} {{a few of their}} best weapons to the Dutch, and then by bringing a small tree (often betel nut) planted in earth from their village as a token of the granting of sovereignty to the VOC. Over the next few months <b>as</b> <b>word</b> of the Dutch victory spread, more and more villages came to pay their respects at Fort Zeelandia and assure the VOC of their friendly intentions. However, the new masters of Mattau also inherited their enemies, with both Favorlang and Tirosen expressing hostility towards the VOC in the wake of their victory.|$|E
5|$|Three men {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for governor at the 1899 party convention in LouisvilleGoebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin {{appeared to be}} the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. <b>As</b> <b>word</b> of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone–Goebel alliance.|$|E

5000|$|One such {{language}} that does record simple C(V) forms <b>as</b> <b>words</b> is hieroglyphic Egyptian where signs for single consonants (with implied vowel) denoting <b>words</b> are marked <b>as</b> <b>words</b> {{with a short}} horizontal line: e.g. 3 ₵, which means vulture (or perhaps the bird); and [...] ₳, which means arm. Another early {{language that}} allows us to see simple CV forms <b>as</b> <b>words</b> is cuneiform (and earlier pictographic) Sumerian, in which, with some reservations based on the multiple readings of most signs, we can specify the final V: e.g. da, side; and sa, sinew. Some scientists, however, believe that Sumerian may have been a tonal language, which seems plausible given the number of homonyms in the language.|$|R

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>word</b> of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per {{cent of the}} Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would {{have a negative impact on}} the economy and the food supply. The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established to make use of the Jews as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E
5|$|Silver Reef's {{residents}} {{rebuilt the}} businesses {{that had been}} destroyed, but the town soon began to decline. In 1881, the Stormont Mining Company and the Barbee & Walker Mining Company had to decrease wages from $4 per day to $3.50 per day in all of their mines except the Savage mine (a Stormont property). In response to the decrease in wages, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed. In February 1881, union members began talking about striking the mines, and <b>as</b> <b>word</b> of this potential strike spread, the Stormont Mining Company discharged those of its miners {{who were part of}} the Miners Union. In response, the discharged union members escorted the company's superintendent, Washington Allen, out of Silver Reef. Allen immediately went to the Second District Court in Beaver and filed a lawsuit against the union members. Before they went to court, the union members held a meeting and decided to shut down the Savage mine. Led by Matthew O'Loughlin, the president of the Silver Reef Miners Union, they walked through Silver Reef in rows of two, and, upon arriving at the Savage mine, O'Loughlin and nine other men went into the hoisting works and ordered the engineer on duty to shut down the pumps that kept water from the water table out of the mine. After the pumps were shut down, the group of ten went into the Savage mine and ordered everyone out.|$|E
5|$|The anti-Khrushchev {{minority}} in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck {{at the heart of}} Malenkov's power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At a 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through Minister of Defense Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments. Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. <b>As</b> <b>word</b> leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the Anti-Party Group, accused of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client Dmitri Shepilov who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to Mongolia; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow.|$|E
