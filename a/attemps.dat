60|$|That I {{might be}} satisfied, whether {{it were not}} {{possible}} to make an Artificial pore {{as small as a}}ny Natural I had yet found, I made several <b>attemps</b> with small glass pipes, melted in the flame of a Lamp, and then very suddenly drawn out into a great length. And, by that means, without much difficulty, I was able to draw some almost as small as a Cobweb, which yet, with the Microscope, I could plainly perceive[7] to be perforated, both by looking on the ends of it, and by looking on it against the light which was much the easier way to determine whether it were solid or perforated; for, taking a small pipe of glass, and closing one end of it, then filling it half full of water, and holding it against the light, I could, by this means, very easily find what was the differing aspect of a solid and a perforated piece of glass; and so easily distingish, without seeing either end, whether any Cylinder of glass I look'd on, were a solid stick, or a hollow cane. And by this means, I could also presently judge of any small filament of glass, whether it were hollow or not, which would have been exceeding tedious to examine by looking on the end. And many such like ways I was fain to make use of, in the examining of divers other particulars related in this Book, which would have been no easie task to have determined meerly by the more common way of looking on, or viewing the Object. For, if we consider first, the very faint light wherewith the object is enlightened, whence many particles appear opacous, which when more enlightned, appear very transparent, so that I was fain to determine its transparency by one glass, and its texture by another. Next, the unmanageableness of most Objects, by reason of their smalness, 3. The difficulty of finding the desired point, and of placing it so, as to reflect the light conveniently for the Inquiry. Lastly, ones being able to view it but with one eye at once, they will appear no small obstructions, nor are they easily remov'd without many contrivances. But to proceed, I could not find that water, or some deeply ting'd liquors would in small ones rise so high as one would expect; and the highest I have found it yet rise in any of the pipes I have try'd, was to 21 inches above the level of the water in the vessel: for though I found that in the small pipes it would nimbly enter at first, and run about 6 or 7 inches upwards; yet I found it then to move upwards so slow, that I have not yet had the patience to observe it above that height of 21 inches (and that was in a pretty large Pipe, in comparison of those I formerly mentioned; for I could observe the progress of a very deep ting'd liquor in it with my naked eye, without much trouble; whereas many of the other pipes were so very small, that unless in a convenient posture to the light, I could not perceive them:) But 'tis very probable, that a greater patience and assiduity may discover the liquors to rise, at least to remain suspended, at heights that I should be loath now even to ghess at, if at least there be any proportion kept between the height of the ascending liquor, and the bigness of the holes of the pipes.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "Power Play", Spencer {{arrives at}} her barn only to stumble upon her father's belongings. Amongst Peter's luggage, she finds his {{passport}} and discovers that {{he arrived in}} Philadelphia {{at the same time}} as Veronica. Peter suddenly emerges and Spencer engages in a heated argument with her dad, questioning him as to why he chose to avoid his own daughter. Peter divulges that he was searching for Mary's whereabouts and trying to assure she wouldn't return to Rosewood to cause more damage to their family. He further explains that he wanted to find a way to redeem himself after the emotional rollercoaster he put his daughter and wife through. When Spencer asks him if he was able to successfully track down Drake, Peter replies that he's working with a private investigator in order to do so. Spencer rebukes her father for attempting to chase Mary away, and storms out. The following day, Hanna is hanging out at Spencer’s house when she spots the P.I.’s business card from Peter’s briefcase. She convinces Spencer to infiltrate the investigation in order to locate Drake, and theorizes that Mary might be able to help point them in the direction of “A.D.". Afterwards, Hanna picks up the phone and calls the P.I., pretending to be someone from Peter's office. After getting help from the P.I., Hanna and Spencer knock on several doors until they approach one house and much to their surprise, Pastor Ted Wilson (Hanna's former step-dad) opens the door. The girls show Ted a picture of Drake and ask him if he has seen her, to which Wilson informs them that he hasn’t. Hanna offers to grab coffee with Ted at the Radley later to catch up, and she also asks him to call her if he happens to spot Mary. As the Liars turn away to leave, Drake shows up in the doorway. Ted turns to Drake and questions her on what she's truly doing there. Later, he reaches out to Hanna to talk and they meet up at Lucas' loft, where Wilson reveals to have lied about Mary's visit. Ted further confesses that Drake is an ex-girlfriend of his back when he was a college student and that she met up with him to inform they had a child together. Things get even more intricate when Wilson discloses to Hanna that said offspring was Charlotte and that he knew his daughter prior to her sex change. It turns out that Ted used to run a summer camp for troubled boys, and Charles was a camper there. Wilson is disheartened when describing that he interacted with a [...] "soft-spoken, sweet" [...] boy without awareness they were related. Ted then showcases Hanna a picture of himself back when he worked at the camp, chaperoning Charles and Lucas Gottesman, whom he described as his son's [...] "only friend". This shocking revelation leaves Hanna stunned. Later, when Spencer arrives home, she is reprehended by her father, who is mad that she spent the entire day looking for Drake. Peter claims that Mary's behavior in the past suggests she's unhinged. When Spencer demands her father to expose whatever knowledge he has on Mary, Peter finally gives in and discloses that the last time he saw Drake was after Spencer came back from rehab. Peter was in the kitchen drinking a glass of wine when he spotted whom he presumed to be Jessica quietly descending the staircase and making her way to the front door. Just before she exited, Peter turned the lights on and confronted her, until the woman explained to her former lover that she needed to see their daughter, prompting him to realize that it was actually Mary. Peter further clarifies that Mary pursued retribution after Jessica told her that Charles committed suicide in order to withhold information about his transition into a woman. After Peter refused to aid Drake on her vendetta, Mary used Peter's heart medication pills to poison her sister and proceeded to bury her on the Hastings' backyard. At last, Spencer comprehends her father's concern, seeing as Drake wanted to blame Peter for Jessica's murder. That being said, Spencer is disappointed to learn that Peter knew about Charlotte's connection to their family prior to exposing herself as [...] "A". He then assures his daughter that despite her hard feelings, he'll always guard her from harm. Meanwhile, Emily reveals that Driscoll played them and left the device on a greyhound to Philidelphia.
