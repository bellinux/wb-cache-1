5|$|Clayman (IGN) {{reported}} that the game had no major technical issues, which was a major concern in the protracted run-up to the game's release. He also found that most of its levels {{did not appear to}} leverage the Xbox 360's advances in areas apart from graphics. Bramwell (Eurogamer), on the other hand, fought the controls and camera throughout the game. He lamented a particular issue in which the camera would spin 180 degrees when Kameo was hit, which made the path of retreat harder to see. Theobald (GameSpy) also lamented the camera. Kasavin (GameSpot) found Kameo to be technically outstanding, and praised its <b>automatic</b> <b>game</b> save features, short loading times, steady frame rates, and detailed display on both standard- and high-definition televisions. Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that Kameo was technically impressive to the point of overwhelming the gameplay.|$|E
