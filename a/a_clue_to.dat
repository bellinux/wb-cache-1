5|$|After Naomi (Marsha Thomason) parachuted {{onto the}} island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan who else {{would be on the}} freighter she came from. They wanted these new characters to be scientists, who would be interested in finding the island for their own personal reasons. They decided to create a character who would be interested in lost civilizations, and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C. S. Lewis, which Lost producer Damon Lindelof said was <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> the direction the show would be taking during season four.|$|E
5|$|The way {{in which}} the Vaikom Satyagraha events have been {{recorded}} provides <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> the image of the respective organisers.

5|$|Much of the {{development}} at this time consisted of new residential areas away from the old city centre. Queen Square was the first speculative development by John Wood, the Elder, who lived {{in one of the}} houses. The Circus consists of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> the design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. The most spectacular of Bath's terraces is the Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger John Wood. Gay Street links Queen Square to The Circus. All of which were designed by John Wood, the Elder in 1735 and completed by his son John Wood, the Younger.|$|E
5|$|The Circus {{consists}} of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> the design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. Like the Colosseum, the three façades have a different order of architecture on each floor: Doric on the ground level, then Ionic on the piano nobile, and finishing with Corinthian on the upper floor, {{the style of the}} building thus becoming progressively more ornate as it rises. Wood never lived to see his unique example of town planning completed as he died five days after personally laying the foundation stone on 18 May 1754.|$|E

5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> where he is headed.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{location}} of the Acra, critical to understanding Hellenistic Jerusalem, had {{been a matter of}} lengthy discussions. Historians and archaeologists had proposed various sites around Jerusalem, relying mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence. This approach began to change in the light of excavations which commenced in the late 1960s. New discoveries had prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources, Jerusalem's geography and previously discovered artifacts. Yoram Tsafrir had interpreted a masonry joint in the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount platform as <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> the Acra's possible position. During Benjamin Mazar's 1968 and 1978 excavations adjacent to the south wall of the Mount, features were uncovered which may have been connected with the Acra, including barrack-like rooms and a huge cistern. In November 2015 the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the likely discovery of the Acra in a different location, south-west of the Temple Mount and north-west of the City of David.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} places the player {{in control of}} either Jennifer or Helen, {{escaping}} from Scissorman within the university research building. The second chapter will have the player retrieve the Demon Idol, <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> the murder investigation. The scenario in which the idol is retrieved can change depending on choices made by the player earlier. Helen may search for it within the city library, or reporter Nolan Campbell or detective Stan Gotts will search {{for it in the}} home of a Barrows family butler. The final chapter occurs at Barrows Castle, putting the player in control of the same character they controlled in chapter one. Jennifer or Helen must use the Demon Idol to open a vortex in the castle basement and destroy Scissorman. Depending on the narrative followed and choices made along the way, 10 different endings can be seen.|$|E

25|$|Understanding the {{activity}} of {{different parts of the}} brain during sleep can give <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> the functions of sleep. It has been observed that mental activity is present during all stages of sleep, though from different regions in the brain. So, contrary to popular understanding, the brain never completely shuts down during sleep. Also, sleep intensity of a particular region is homeostatically related to the corresponding amount of activity before sleeping. The use of imaging modalities like PET and fMRI, combined with EEG recordings, gives <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> which brain regions participate in creating the characteristic wave signals and what their functions might be.|$|E
