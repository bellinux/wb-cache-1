40|$|The {{fast-food}} franchise {{industry has}} become one of the fastest growing and most successful segments of its retail sector. This study defines fast food as food that is prepared and served to the consumer in some form of a take-away package. According to the South African Customer Satisfaction Index (SAcsi*), South Africa's fast food industry is ranked second in the world, with a customer satisfaction score of 79 out of 100. South Africans have literally become fast-food junkies embracing large portions of affordable food that are readily accessible and available almost immediately, especially in major urban areas throughout South Africa, like those in Gauteng. The aim of this study was to determine and describe consumers perception of the quality of the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> of fast-food outlets (in general) and to determine how the <b>additional</b> <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> of this growing industry determine consumers patronage of fast-food outlets. Objectives were formulated to draw conclusions about consumers satisfaction with the service quality of fast-food outlets based on the expectations-confirmation paradigm in terms of selected demographic characteristics namely gender, age, education level, population group and monthly household income. The quantitative, correlational study was cross-sectional and reflected on perceptions at the specific time of the study and in a specific urban context. Survey data was gathered electronically from 447 respondents implementing a structured, self-administered questionnaire in which the established scale of Oyewole (1999) was used to provide insightful conclusions about consumers perceptions of specific dimensions of the service delivery, namely Hygiene and efficiency; Courtesy; Health consciousness; Child friendliness; Ease of complaint; Comfort; Orderliness; Availability; and Expeditiousness. Data analysis involved descriptive and inferential statistics. Exploratory factor analysis, specifically Principal Axis Factoring, using Oblimin rotation with Kaiser Normalization to determine the underlying factors associated with service quality in fast-food outlets. Confirmatory factor analysis was done using unweighted least squares (ULS) estimation to address multivariate non-normality. Good fit indices were achieved. Calculations of means, standard deviations, Cronbach s Alpha, Anova, t-tests and Post hoc Bonferroni tests were done to identify significant differences between and among different demographics categories for further interpretation. The study concluded that consumers expectations were higher than their perceptions for four of the eight factors, namely: Courtesy and efficiency; Hygiene and precision; Expeditiousness, and Availability. Confirmation of expectations was confirmed for three of the eight factors, namely Orderliness and ease of compliant; Healthiness, and Child friendliness. Positive disconfirmation occurred for only one of the eight factors namely Comfort. Findings indicate that there is ample opportunity for fast-food outlets to improve their <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> in terms of various dimensions and that they could even choose which elements they would want to excel in to achieve a competitive advantage in the Market place. Females have significantly higher expectations than men for five of the eight dimensions of the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> and therefore it would be more difficult to please females. Young consumers held significantly higher expectations about one of the eight factors namely child friendliness. Particularly interesting is that lower middle income consumers expectations seem significantly higher compared to upper income consumers about health related aspects. White consumers were significantly more concerned about hygiene and efficiency compared to black consumers, whereas the opposite was true for child friendliness. Black consumers expectations also seem significantly higher than white consumers in terms of the healthiness of fast foods. Fast food establishments should take note of the dimensions of the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> where consumers expectations are high, namely: Hygiene and precision; and Courtesy and efficiency to ensure confirmation as a non-negotiable mode of operation. Fast-food outlets could instigate consumers satisfaction with positive return intentions if they exceed consumers expectations with regards to service dimensions where expectations were not particularly high, for example Child-friendliness, and even Healthiness where consumers expectations are modest.

We also find that network capabilities enhance the effect of the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> on sales growth. For managers of manufacturing firms, the results imply that the active development of a comprehensive <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> should be implemented in conjunction with the development of organizational capabilities, such as network capabilities, to create value and promote improved performance.

40|$|Background: The {{selection}} of transport operators {{has become a}} complex decision making process with multi-criteria aspects. Deciding on which transport operator to use depends on various <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that can be different for each company. Retailers such as those from France, the Netherlands, Sweden and UK look to improve logistical performance {{in areas such as}} lead time, flexibility and reliability, and improve customer relations. In the past the main critical aspects of retailers were cost and <b>service</b> optimisation. An <b>additional</b> factor could play a role in their {{selection of}} transport operators and this is green <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b>   Research question: Which <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators? Sub question 1 : Are the retailers willing to use green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and why? Sub question 2 : Which of the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators?   Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to find out what the most important <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators. It also aims to determine if French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers are willing to use green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and explain why. Finally, it will attempt to identify which of the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators.   Method: This thesis was conducted by applying the deductive approach and is based on a quantitative research method. The sampling method used for this thesis is non-probability sampling. Data was collected through questionnaires with French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers. French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers have been selected for the sample population in order to find out how important green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> might be for them when they are purchasing the services of a transport operator. French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers from different sectors were chosen in order to achieve an objective overview of the retail industry from each country when selecting transport operators.         Conclusion: Traditional <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are more important than green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers that participated in this research paper. However, when looking at the results of the data, some green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> were perceived to be important. The authors therefore believe that when French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers are selecting transport operators their first focus is on the traditional <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that are very important to them. However, if a French, Dutch, Swedish or UK retailer is encouraged by the following motivators: customer expectations, measurable improvement or economic incentives. They might pursue the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that are important for their business activities...|$|R

40|$|Our {{research}} on Web Services is organized into two related projects. First, we develop Web <b>Service</b> <b>Offerings</b> Language (WSOL) for formal specification of various constraints and classes of service for Web <b>Services.</b> A <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> in WSOL is a formal representation of one {{class of service}} of one Web Service. It contains formal representation of various constraints: functional (pre-, post-, and future -conditions), non-functional (a. k. a. Quality of Service - QoS), and access rights. It also contains statements about price/penalty and management responsibility. The Web Service, its consumer, or one or more designated third parties (usually SOAP message intermediaries) can evaluate WSOL constraints. For easier specification of similar <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> WSOL enables specification of constraint groups (CGs) and constraint group templates (CGTs). We have also developed a format for representation of dynamic relationships between <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> WSOL <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are simple contracts and SLAs (Service Level Agreements) between Web Services...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. WSOL (Web <b>Service</b> <b>Offerings</b> Language) is an XML (Extensible Markup Language) {{notation}} {{compatible with}} the WSDL (Web Services De-scription Language) standard. While WSDL is used for describing operations provided by Web Services, WSOL enables formal specification of multiple classes of service for one Web <b>Service.</b> A <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> is a formal represen-tation of one class of service for a Web Service. As classes of service for Web Services are determined by combinations of various constraints, WSOL enables formal specification of functional constraints, some QoS (a. k. a., non-functional) constraints, simple access rights (for differentiation of service), price, and rela-tionships with other <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> of the same Web Service. Describing a Web Service in WSOL, in addition to WSDL, enables selection of a more ap-propriate Web <b>Service</b> and <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> for particular circumstances. Fur-ther, it supports dynamic adaptation and management of Web Service composi-tions using manipulation of <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend our}} {{previous}} research by determining whether, and how, {{the impact of}} managed care on substance abuse treatment (SAT) services differs by facility ownership. We use the 2000 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services that contains data on <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and other characteristics of 10, 513 SAT facilities. For each group of for-profit, not-for-profit, and public facilities, we estimate the impact of managed care (MC) on the number and types of SAT services offered (i. e., indicators {{of the quality of}} care). We use IVs to account for possible endogeneity between facilities' involvement in MC and <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> We find substantial differences in the magnitude and direction of the impact of MC by facility ownership. On average, MC causes for-profits to offer approximately four (out of 26) <b>additional</b> <b>services,</b> causes publics to offer approximately four fewer services, and has no impact on the number of services offered by not-for-profits. Our findings raise concerns that managed care may reduce the quality of care provided by public SAT facilities by limiting the range of services offered. On the other hand, for-profit clinics are found to increase their range of services; the societal impact of this is unclear for several reasons. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the effect of a complementary mobile and internet <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> around mobile devices on customer perceived value and consumer loyalty, as well as investigate if perceived value can predict consumer loyalty. Gender differences were also explored in both perceived value and loyalty. The study built on a review of existing literature in order to establish the constructs explored and develop the research structure and focus. A consumer study was conducted in the Singapore market and responses collected from 120 respondents to explore respondents’ value perception of the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> and their attitudinal loyalty. Gender differences were observed in both perceived value and loyalty, with females valuing the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> more than the males, and also indicating higher attitudinal loyalty toward the <b>service</b> <b>offering.</b> It was found that consumers who have experienced the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> indicated higher attitudinal loyalty, establishing that the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> contributes to increased consumer loyalty. It was also established that perceived value predicts loyalty, indicating that where value is perceived in the offering, consumers were more loyal. Limitations in the study restrict the generalization of the results across different markets. A more balanced age group distribution should ideally be conducted in a further study. The remaining dimensions of perceived value and loyalty should also be studied in future research to establish a more comprehensive measure of value and loyalty...|$|R
