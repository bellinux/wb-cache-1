25|$|Currently, a {{specialist}} physician in the United States may {{be described as}} <b>an</b> <b>internist.</b> Another term, hospitalist, was introduced in 1996, to describe US specialists in internal medicine who work largely or exclusively in hospitals. Such 'hospitalists' now make up about 19% of all US general internists, who are often called general physicians in Commonwealth countries.|$|E
25|$|To {{write the}} book, {{in his spare}} time, he {{collected}} {{a lot of information}} on Canton Hospital, scouring newspapers, books, journals published by the hospital, and annual reports written by the Canton Medical Missionary Society. He looked at every single report, which included all the names of those employed at the hospital, names of all the patients, what diseases they had, what surgeries took place, income and expense sheets, donations to the hospital, and more. In both China and the USA, he searched for and interviewed previous staff of the hospital and graduates of the University Medical School. Part of the inspiration for writing the book came from his idol William Osler, who was both <b>an</b> <b>internist</b> and writer.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{physicians}} holding certification by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology (ABAI) {{have successfully}} completed an accredited educational program and evaluation process, including a proctored examination to demonstrate knowledge, skills, {{and experience in}} patient care in allergy and immunology. Becoming an allergist/immunologist requires completion of at least nine years of training. After completing medical school and graduating with a medical degree, a physician will undergo three years of training in internal medicine (to become <b>an</b> <b>internist)</b> or pediatrics (to become a pediatrician). Once physicians have finished training {{in one of these}} specialties, they must pass the exam of either the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP), the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics (AOBP), the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), or the American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine (AOBIM). Internists or pediatricians wishing to focus on the sub-specialty of allergy-immunology then complete at least an additional two years of study, called a fellowship, in an allergy/immunology training program. Allergist/immunologists listed as ABAI-certified have successfully passed the certifying examination of the ABAI following their fellowship.|$|E

500|$|Caspersen {{had been}} battling kidney cancer before his death, and {{reportedly}} pursued regular chemotherapy treatment. Several sources described his health as deteriorating and the cancer severe. Others indicated that his medical condition led to depression, describing an uncertainty {{that left him}} [...] "sort of horrified about his medical outcome". [...] Bernard Davidoff, <b>an</b> <b>internist</b> from New Jersey apparently familiar with Caspersen's medical care, advised police that Caspersen [...] "suffered from severe depression and was taking antidepressant meds, heart meds, liver meds, kidney meds and diabetes meds". It was also reported that medical issues and chemotherapy treatments [...] "had severely hobbled him in recent years".|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of Chicago's Northwestern University Medical School, Turck was <b>an</b> <b>internist,</b> medical researcher in cell biology, inventor of cytost serum, {{and author of}} The Action of the Living Cell (1933) {{as well as many}} tracts on gastrointestinal diseases. [...] Turck was a direct descendant of Dr. Paschasius Turck, a sixteenth-century Dutch physician who treated William the Silent after he received severe wounds in a 1581 assassination attempt. During his return voyage to the United States, Turck [...] "began to feel guilty about the great cost of the statue" [...] and decided to keep the purchase hidden from his wife by storing the statue in the basement of his New York City laboratory at 428 Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan. [...] It remained in Turck's possession, stored in the laboratory basement, for eight years (1920–1928).|$|E
500|$|Under {{orders from}} Cuddy to recruit a new team, House {{considers}} 40 doctors. Season four's early episodes {{focus on his}} selection process, structured as a reality TV–style elimination contest (Jacobs {{referred to it as}} a [...] "version of Survivor"). House assigns each applicant a number between one and 40, and pares them down to seven finalists. He assesses their performance in diagnostic cases, assisted by Foreman, who returns to the department after his dismissal from another hospital for House-like behavior. While Foreman's return means only two slots are open, House tricks Cuddy into allowing him to hire three new assistants. He ultimately selects Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), a former plastic surgeon; Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), a sports medicine specialist; and Dr. Remy [...] "Thirteen" [...] Hadley (Olivia Wilde), <b>an</b> <b>internist</b> (nicknamed for her number in the elimination contest). In the season finale, Thirteen discovers she has, as she had long dreaded, inherited Huntington's disease from her mother, which is incurable.|$|E

2500|$|Deepak Chopra, <b>an</b> <b>internist,</b> endocrinologist, {{and speaker}} about mind–body {{intervention}} {{who was a}} friend of Jackson's for 20 years, expressed concern that, despite presumably having access to a large arsenal of drugs, Jackson appears to have been given no naloxone, a drug used to counteract the effects of an opioid overdose. Chopra also criticized what he saw as [...] "enabling" [...] by some Hollywood doctors: [...] "This cult of drug-pushing doctors, with their co-dependent relationships with addicted celebrities, must be stopped. Let's hope that Michael's unnecessary death is the call for action." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{philosophy of}} this model is to bring physician-centred definitive care to the patient, rather than bringing the patient to the care. [...] As a result, in addition to conventional ambulances, most communities have physicians (called Notarzt) who respond directly to every life-threatening call to provide care. [...] This system does not recognize emergency medicine as a medical specialty, {{in the sense that}} North Americans understand it. [...] In these cases, the 'emergency physician' is most commonly an anesthetist, or sometimes <b>an</b> <b>internist</b> or even a surgeon. [...] In most places, there appears to be little interest in the development of emergency medicine as a specialty, although recent developments in Italy suggest that this attitude may be changing. [...] In this model, long 'at scene' times are common, with the physician attempting to provide {{some or all of the}} intervention that is necessary in place, with transportation to hospital occurring only for those with a legitimate need of a hospital bed, and urgent transportation to hospital being extremely rare. [...] Many patients will never be transported to hospital. [...] In the French version {{of this model}}, even the triage of incoming requests for service is physician-led, with a physician, assisted by others, interviewing the caller and determining what type of response resource, if any, will be sent. [...] The German version of this model uses what we would recognize as 'conventional' dispatch processes, with the physician being sent to calls as requested by the EMS dispatcher.|$|E
