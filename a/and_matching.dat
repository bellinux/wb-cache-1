5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} {{a reputation as a}} fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> the guitar in loudness.|$|E

5|$|Like the Coronation Necklace, these {{earrings}} {{have been}} worn by queens regnant and consort at every coronation since 1901. Made for Queen Victoria in 1858 using the diamonds {{from an old}} Garter badge, they are of typical design: a large brilliant followed by a smaller one, with a large pear-shaped drop. The drops were originally part of the Koh-i-Noor armlet. After they had been made, Victoria wore the earrings <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> necklace in the painting Queen Victoria by the European court painter, Franz Winterhalter.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{was entered}} in the tournament's South region where it would play its first two games at The Palace of Auburn Hills in nearby Auburn Hills, Michigan.

5|$|The band {{is known}} for its attention-grabbing image; the members perform wearing unique, {{individual}} facemasks <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> uniforms—typically jumpsuits—while each member is typically assigned and referred to by number based on their role in the band (#0 through #8), although the latter practice has diminished following the death of Paul Gray.|$|E
5|$|To {{take another}} example, in his {{screenplay}} for The Signalman Andrew Davies adds {{scenes of the}} traveller's nightmare-plagued nights at an inn, and reinforces the ambiguity of the traveller-narrator by restructuring the ending <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> his facial features {{with those of the}} spectre. The film also makes use of visual and aural devices. For example, the appearance of the spectre is stressed by the vibrations of a bell in the signalbox and a recurring red motif connects the signalman's memories of a train crash with the danger light attended by a ghostly figure.|$|E

Several teeth from the Arundel Formation of Maryland have been described as almost identical to those of Acrocanthosaurus and may represent an eastern representative of the genus. Many other teeth and bones from various geologic formations throughout the western United States have also been referred to Acrocanthosaurus, but most of these have been misidentified; there is, however, some disagreement with this assessment regarding fossils from the Cloverly Formation.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new {{contract}} was signed between the Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) with a Lebanese company Inkript, a member of Resource Group Holding (RGH), to make the move for biometric passports. Inkript held {{a joint venture with}} French firm Gemalto, based in the Netherlands to participate in the tender. Jacques Seif, General Manager of Inkript, said: “We will handle all the programming and software development in-house, while Gemalto will be in charge of manufacturing the passports <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> the program’s interface with the coding machines.”. The contract’s term is three years, and Inkript will produce four million Lebanese biometric passports. The contract, valued at around 140 million US dollars, was funded by a Saudi grant. The Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) announced that it would be issuing biometric passports to all of its citizens starting from July 2016.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} off-season, Samuelsson {{was traded to}} the New York Rangers, along with fellow prospect Christian Gosselin, in exchange for veteran forward Adam Graves on June 24, 2001. He began the 2001–02 season with the Rangers' AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, but after notching nine points in eight games, he was recalled to the NHL on November 5. He scored his first two NHL goals on November 20 against goaltender Patrick Roy in a 5–3 win against the Colorado Avalanche. Samuelsson's first goal came short-handed and broke Roy's three-game shutout streak, which was in contention to tie the modern-day NHL record at the time of four games. Samuelsson remained with the Rangers {{for the rest of the}} season and recorded six goals and 16 assists over 67 games as an NHL rookie. He was utilized in primarily defensive roles during his time in New York, playing on the penalty kill <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> up against opposing teams' top offensive lines.|$|E

5|$|Later in the game, non-rotatable gems can be found, and {{the player}} is punished for {{rotations}} {{that do not}} lead to a match by having the enemy's gauge fill faster. The amount of damage that the player can take or deliver is dependent on the monster used in battle, and using a beast in battle earns experience points which can increase the power of that summon. Each monster has a corresponding color, <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> gems that are the same color as your chosen monster or the enemy makes your gauge fill faster or theirs slower. Enemy monsters can change gems on the board to skulls, which cause damage to the player if they are not lined up within a certain number of moves. After being defeated in a battle, enemy monsters are added to the list of creatures that the player chooses from when they start a stage. New monsters can also be found hidden in the stages, along with items that can be used during battles.|$|E

On the April 7, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, London and Kendrick defeated WWE Tag Team Champions MNM in a non-title match. They developed a winning streak over the champions, including singles victories for both Kendrick and London over Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury, respectively. London and Kendrick won the WWE Tag Team Championship at Judgment Day, marking consecutive victories for London and Kendrick over MNM. On August 11, K. C. James and Idol Stevens defeated the champions in a non-title match, igniting a feud between the two teams. During the rivalry, WWE Diva Ashley Massaro began accompanying London and Kendrick to the ring {{to act as a}} valet and combat the actions of James and Stevens' manager Michelle McCool.|$|E
5|$|The {{hotel has}} {{featured}} in several films, {{three of which}} starred Audrey Hepburn. In Stanley Donen's 1957 film Funny Face, Kay Thompson dances in the Ritz's entry driveway {{and in front of}} the hotel, accompanied by a group of dancers dressed as Ritz bellhops during the Bonjour, Paris! number. In Billy Wilder's 1957 comedy Love in the Afternoon, Hepburn initiates her romance with Gary Cooper in his suite in the hotel and much of the film is set there. The hotel is again seen in the 1966 movie How to Steal a Million, with a romantic scene between Hepburn and Peter O'Toole in the hotel's bar in which Hepburn wears an iconic Givenchy black lace eyemask <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> cocktail dress. In the Indian film Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, Abhishek Bachchan meets his fictional love (played by Lara Dutta) at Hotel Ritz.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of neurons {{in the deep}} nuclei have large cell bodies and spherical dendritic trees with a radius of about 400μm, and use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. These cells project {{to a variety of}} targets outside the cerebellum. Intermixed with them are a lesser number of small cells, which use GABA as a neurotransmitter and project exclusively to the inferior olivary nucleus, the source of climbing fibers. Thus, the nucleo-olivary projection provides an inhibitory feedback to match the excitatory projection of climbing fibers to the nuclei. There is evidence that each small cluster of nuclear cells projects to the same cluster of olivary cells that send climbing fibers to it; there is strong <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> topography in both directions.|$|E
5|$|The west door, {{actually}} in {{the south side of}} the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|On {{his first}} day of free agency on July 1, 2010, Malhotra signed a three-year, $7.5 million deal with the Vancouver Canucks that {{included}} a no-trade clause. Malhotra was named an alternate captain during away games for the Canucks before the season began. He scored his first goal as a Canuck on October 22, during a 5–1 win against the Minnesota Wild. Malhotra settled into to the Canucks' lineup as the team's third-line centre, often playing with wingers Raffi Torres and Jannik Hansen, while playing significant time on the penalty kill <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> up against opposing team's best forwards. His success as a defensive specialist earned him early consideration for the Selke Trophy as the league's best two-way forward. In {{an article on the}} NHL's website, he was chosen as the front-runner for the award at the mid-way point of the campaign. He was also credited with allowing the team to use Ryan Kesler in a more offensive role (Kesler was the team's previous shutdown centre); as a result, the second-line centre recorded career-highs in goals and points.|$|E
