5|$|During the 1895 South Carolina state {{constitutional}} convention, however, Tillman supported <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> that permitted the {{removal from office}} of sheriffs who through negligence or connivance permitted a lynching. He also supported <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> that held the county where the lynching occurred liable for damages of $2,000 or more {{to be paid to}} the heirs of the victim.|$|E
5|$|After {{considering}} the changed circumstances, the Archbishop of Goa, by <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> issued on 20 February 1795, appointed Minguel José Louis Mendes interim vicar {{of the four}} sub-districts of Mangalore, Barcoor, Onore and Moolki. Some other priests also came to Canara with the new vicar. Those from Goa retained their old prejudices and could not accept the rule of Tipu, openly advocating rebellion against him, writing offensive letters and making offensive speeches. As a result, in 1797, the brief repite enjoyed by the Christians ceased and their persecution recommenced.|$|E

5|$|After the Constitution of May 3, 1791, sejms {{were to be}} {{held every}} two years and last 70 days, with <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> for an {{extension}} to 100 days. Provisions for extraordinary sejms were made, {{as well as for}} a special constitutional sejm, which was to meet and discuss whether any revisions to the constitution were needed (that one was to deliberate every 25 years).|$|E
5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments included <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> {{to extend}} the protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E

Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was {{the winner of the}} 2009 Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award. In legislation, a conscience clause is <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical abortion) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> in the {{stimulus}} package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant AIG and other TARP recipients became a campaign issue. Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the outrage over the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded by insisting that {{the stimulus}} package was necessary for job creation.|$|E

5|$|Congress further {{weakened}} the acts in 1894 by removing <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> against conspiracy. In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes {{was elected president}} after a highly contested election, receiving support from three Southern states {{in exchange for a}} pledge to allow white Democratic governments to rule without federal interference. As president, he refused to enforce federal civil rights protections, allowing states to begin to implement racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws. A Federal Elections Bill was successfully filibustered in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Luka Ploče d.d. started {{developing}} a new bulk cargo terminal, a new container terminal and a distribution center, implementing IT systems throughout port facilities and operations, and enhancing logistical support to increase the competitiveness of the Ploče transport route.

Our findings support the call {{for the implementation of}} <b>a</b> dynamic <b>provisioning</b> system...|$|R

5|$|Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> of the Human Rights Act 1998 {{that enables}} the Act to take effect in the United Kingdom. The section {{requires}} courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which {{are also part of}} the Human Rights Act 1998. This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, {{additional}} piecemeal amendments {{have been}} added in response to federal developments. Amendments ratified by the voters reduced the voting age to eighteen to conform with the Twenty-sixth Amendment, removed residency requirements for voting, and conformed voter registration to the Motor Voter Act. A legislative session now may be called after a Governor's veto. Virginia joined thirty-two other states in 1996 by amending its Constitution to provide for rights of victims of crime.

50|$|In {{legislative}} procedure, a rider is <b>an</b> additional <b>provision</b> {{added to}} <b>a</b> bill or other measure under the consideration by a legislature, having little {{connection with the}} subject matter of the bill. Riders are usually created as a tactic to pass <b>a</b> controversial <b>provision</b> that would not pass as its own bill. Occasionally, <b>a</b> controversial <b>provision</b> is attached to a bill not to be passed itself but to prevent the bill from being passed (in which case it is called a wrecking amendment or poison pill).|$|R
5|$|The Nizam was {{prepared}} {{to enter into a}} limited treaty with India, which gave Hyderabad safeguards not provided for in the standard Instrument of Accession, such as <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> guaranteeing Hyderabad's neutrality {{in the event of a}} conflict between India and Pakistan. India rejected this proposal, arguing that other states would demand similar concessions. A temporary Standstill Agreement was signed as a stopgap measure, even though Hyderabad had not yet agreed to accede to India. By December 1947, however, India was accusing Hyderabad of repeatedly violating the Agreement, while the Nizam alleged that India was blockading his state, a charge India denied.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of San Stefano {{was signed}} on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire, and {{included}} <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> {{to set up}} an autonomous Bulgarian principality roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire. 3 March has since become Liberation Day, a public holiday in Bulgaria, though the holiday was suppressed and fell out of favour following the left-wing uprising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a state coat of arms or seal has {{generally}} been authorized by <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> in the state constitution or a legislative act.

Historically, this committee has consisted of notable members of society and elected officials.|$|E

50|$|Ackermann {{was persuaded}} by the {{submission}} of Advocate Wim Trengove (counsel for the appellants) that, {{as far as}} deference to the Legislature was concerned, there was no difference, in principle, between the court's rendering <b>a</b> statutory <b>provision</b> constitutional by removing the offending part by actual or notional severance, and the court's {{doing the same thing}} by reading words into <b>a</b> statutory <b>provision.</b> In both cases, the parliamentary enactment, as expressed in <b>a</b> statutory <b>provision,</b> was being altered by the order of the court—in the one case by excision and in the other by addition.|$|R
