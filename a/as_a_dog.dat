5|$|As in {{all other}} tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and {{surrounding}} musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds, {{as opposed to the}} vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles. The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> whine, are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> bark, are generally loud.|$|E
5|$|Friskies is a {{brand of}} wet and dry cat food and treats. It is owned by Nestlé Purina PetCare Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Nestlé. Friskies was initially introduced by Carnation Company in the 1930s <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> food brand. When Friskies cat food {{was introduced in the}} 1950s, it was the first dry pet food product specifically for cats. The brand was acquired by Nestlé in 1985. From the 1970s to the 2000s, variations in Friskies cat food proliferated as the competition for consumer spending intensified.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{intermediate}} host is eaten by the definitive host such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> or human, the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction within the gut to create macrogamonts and microgamonts. Most definitive hosts {{do not show}} any clinical sign or symptoms. Fusion of a macrogamont and a microgamont creates a zygote which develops into an oocyst. The oocyst is passed through the faeces completing the life cycle.|$|E
25|$|While hunting boar or bears, the Englische Dogge was a catch dog used {{after the}} other hunting dogs to seize the bear or boar and hold it in place until the huntsman was able to kill it.

The Englische Dogge became rare, and was kept only <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> of hobby or luxury.|$|E

25|$|The Golden Retriever is a large, {{strongly}} built breed with a dense, water-repellant wavy coat. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> with {{origins in}} pedigree breeding, {{and due to}} its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged in the breed; therefore, the three subtypes of the Golden Retriever reflect the typical variations in dimensions and coat. However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or gold in colour and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems.|$|E
25|$|Animal-assisted therapy, {{where an}} animal such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> or a horse becomes a basic {{part of a}} person's treatment, is a {{controversial}} treatment for some symptoms.

Reviews of published dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that DAT is a legitimate therapy or that it affords any more than fleeting improvements in mood.|$|E
25|$|Maudgalyāyana eased his mother's {{suffering}} by {{receiving the}} instructions of feeding pretas from the Buddha. The Buddha instructed Maudgalyāyana to place pieces of food {{on a clean}} plate, reciting a mantra seven times to bless the food, snap his fingers to call out to the deceased and finally tip the food onto clean ground. By doing so, the preta's hunger would be relieved. Through these merits, his mother {{was able to be}} reborn <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> under the care of a noble family.|$|E

It therefore proves to be an ideal aid for park rangers, or game wardens. It can also be trained <b>as</b> <b>a</b> police <b>dog</b> and possesses great physical strength and incredible agility.

25|$|Fleas and ticks {{of various}} species can be {{acquired}} and brought home by a dog, {{where they can}} multiply and attack humans (and vice versa). These two parasites are particularly important to note, now that tick-borne Lyme Disease has become endemic throughout a large area, {{in addition to other}} similar diseases such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Although dogs {{do not seem to be}} as susceptible to such diseases as humans, similar rickettsial diseases have been spread by dogs to humans through such mechanisms <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> killing an infected rabbit, then shaking itself off in the house near enough to its owners to fatally infect most of the family.|$|E
25|$|In July 1974, Flynt first {{published}} Hustler {{as a step}} forward from the Hustler Newsletter, which was advertising for his businesses. The magazine struggled for the first year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused to handle it as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around three million. The publication of nude paparazzi pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in August 1975 was a major coup. Hustler has often featured more explicit photographs than comparable magazines and has contained depictions of women that some find demeaning, such as a naked woman in a meat grinder or presented <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> on a leash– though Flynt later said that the meat grinder image was a criticism of the pornography industry itself.|$|E
25|$|The smallest, or Toy variety, was {{developed}} in England in the 18th century. Hunting and working dogs were typically of the standard variety, though some reports suggest that smaller varieties such as the miniature may have been popular for truffle hunting, as their feet {{were less likely to}} damage the delicate fungi. Miniature and Toy varieties tend to be bred primarily for companionship. In the mid to late 19th century, the trade in dyeing and affixing their fur to unusual proportions began with the need to compliment the Victorian and Georgian sensibilities of these women, to the point that their status <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> of the middle and upper classes was quite solid {{by the time of the}} founding of the Kennel Club in the 1870s as they were one of the first dog breeds registered.|$|E
