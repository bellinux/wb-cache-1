People don't relate to it, or just don't want to hear about it. But Mama told me to keep it alive, so I keep telling it... It's <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> <b>story,</b> but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to because the man told such <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> <b>story.</b> When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> <b>story.</b> She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E

60|$|There {{is not in}} {{all that}} bitter tragi-comic record of human frailty which we call History <b>a</b> <b>sadder</b> <b>story</b> than this of the Princess Anne, the natural {{daughter}} of the splendid Don John of Austria, natural son of the Emperor Charles V. and, so, half-brother to the bowelless King Philip II. of Spain.

500|$|After Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix was released, Nomura {{wanted to}} expand Roxas' {{role in the}} series to explain the events between his birth and his {{disappearance}} from Organization XIII. For Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, the staff thought that Roxas' role {{as a member of}} the group would be a suitable theme for the plot. Roxas was chosen as the game's protagonist as the staff thought that having a main character besides Sora would help to introduce gamers to the series' first Nintendo DS title. Co-director Tomohiro Hasegawa explained that Roxas' was originally shorter, and the staff decided he should grow taller as the game continued to develop. Nomura wanted to portray Roxas' activities differently from Sora's. In Sora's games, he is on a journey around the world, while Roxas always returns to Organization XIII after each mission. The staff constructed Roxas' interactions with the Disney characters differently from Sora's, as the Organization was meant to be secret in the game's story. Nomura told the writers that he wanted Roxas to learn something from each of his missions or just to have something to think about. Nomura later clarified that Roxas' personality was different from the one portrayed in Kingdom Hearts II, as he does not actively attempt to come into contact with other characters. With Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, Nomura wanted to reveal why Roxas left Organization XIII. Although Nomura found it <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> <b>story,</b> he considered Zack Fair's ending in [...] to be more tragic. Nomura felt Roxas' last words in the game were also the title's most significant, as he wanted them to connect to Kingdom Hearts IIs first scene, which is actually the same scene. Uchiyama expressed sadness when the game's development ended as he would not play the character for a long time.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{track on}} Siren Song of the Counter Culture is [...] "State of the Union", a short and {{aggressive}} song {{that contains the}} most screaming on the album.

Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic believes [...] "The First Drop" [...] is more toned down, and acts as a bridge to the third track [...] "Life Less Frightening". [...] "Life Less Frightening" [...] is a conventionally structured song, that Boy notes almost has an alternative rock sound, but keeps underlying punk rock traits. The fourth track, [...] "Paper Wings", tells <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> <b>story</b> about growing apart, backed by a guitar lick that lasts the entire song. [...] "Blood to Bleed" [...] features reflective lyrics about broken hearts, presented from a first-person perspective.|$|E
