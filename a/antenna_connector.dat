5000|$|The {{original}} FCC {{output power}} limitation for CB radios was [...] "5 watts DC input {{to the final}} amplifier stage", which was {{a reference to the}} earlier radios equipped with tubes. With solid state radios becoming more common in the 1970s, this specification was rewritten by the FCC {{at the same time the}} authorized channels were increased to 40. The current specification is simply [...] "4 watts output (AM) or 12 watts output (SSB)" [...] as measured at the <b>antenna</b> <b>connector</b> on the back of the radio. The old specification was often used in false advertising by some manufacturers who would claim their CB radios had [...] "5 watts" [...] long after the specification had changed to 4 watts output. The older 23-channel radios built under the old specifications typically had an output of around 3.5 to 3.8 watts output when measured at the <b>antenna</b> <b>connector.</b> The FCC simply rounded up the old [...] "5 watts DC input to the final amplifier stage" [...] specification to the new [...] "4 watts output as measured at the <b>antenna</b> <b>connector</b> on the back of the radio", resulting in a far simpler and easier specification.|$|E

30|$|Radiation {{patterns}} of all eight parallel 2 × 2 sub-arrays (antenna structure shown in Figs.  4 and 5) were measured in an antenna chamber by using A-info LB- 28 - 15 standard gain horn antenna {{as a reference}} antenna. Stepper motors and angular shift were used to rotate the antenna under test (AUT) and Keysight N 5247 A PNA-X to measure the S 21 between the horn antenna (connected to PNA port 1) and AUT ports (connected to PNA port 2) to each angle over the azimuth plane. The distance between the horn antenna and the AUT was set to 1.5 m. Full S-parameter calibration was performed up to the <b>antenna</b> <b>connectors,</b> and the known radiation pattern of the horn antenna was extracted out from the measurement data in post-processing. By summing together all the measured S 21 values of the sub-arrays, we can extract the full array pattern.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} localizing wireless nodes in an outdoor, open-space environment, using ad-hoc radio ranging measurements, e. g., 802. 11. We cast these ranging measurements {{as a set of}} distance constraints, thus forming an over-determined system of equations suitable for non-linear least squares optimization. However, ranging measurements are often subject to errors, induced by multipath signals and variations in path loss, unreliable hardware or <b>antenna</b> <b>connectors,</b> or imperfection in measurement models. Such potentially large, non-Gaussian errors in the measurement data ultimately produce inaccurate localization solutions. We propose a new error-tolerant localization method, called snapinducing shaped residuals (SISR), to identify automatically “bad nodes ” and “bad links ” arising from these errors, so that they receive less weight in the localization process. In particular, SISR snaps “good nodes ” to their accurate locations and gives less emphasis to other nodes. While the mathematical techniques used by SISR are similar to robust statistics, SISR’s exploitation of the snap-in effect in localization appears to be novel. We provide analysis on the principle of SISR, illustrate errors in real-world measurements, and demonstrate a working SISR implementation in field experiments on a testbed of 37 wireless nodes, as well as show the superior performance of SISR in simulation with a larger number of nodes...|$|R

30|$|There exists various coaxial RF {{connectors}} {{suitable for}} attaching an antenna. They include the N-Type, SMA, SMB, and SMC connectors. The N-Type <b>antenna</b> <b>connector</b> was however preferred to the R-SMA antenna (Reverse Sub-Miniature version A), which was considered {{earlier in the}} design process. Experience from various deployments showed that {{it is easier to}} break the R-SMA sockets. Hence, the N-Type <b>antenna</b> <b>connector</b> was used because it is more rugged.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{a new concept}} of a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) receiver which uses one active re-ceiving antenna and multiple parasitic elements. The parasitic elements give the possibility of creating a directive antenna beam which is rotated 360 degrees around within the duration of a symbol period. The received signal which is accessed at the <b>antenna</b> <b>connector</b> of the active antenna is expanded in frequency bandwidth compared to the transmitted signal. We show that each sub-band of the received signal consists of linearly independent combinations of the transmitted signals, and thus we have obtained a MIMO receiver. We give a few examples on how to implement this receiver and also explain the effects of sampling the wave-field at discrete angular directions. Index Terms—MIMO systems, transmission technology, transceiver design...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the attenuation introduced by the radio propagation in the 2.4 -GHz ISM band between the transmitter and the receiver, we utilize two adjustable microwave attenuators (the 8494 B [35] and 8496 B [36] models from Agilent). These manual step attenuators are able to operate from 0 to 18 GHz. The 8494 B model provides a calibrated attenuation level from 0 to 11 dB with an attenuation step of 1 dB. Similarly, the range and attenuation step of the 8496 B model are [0 - 110 dB] and 10 dB, respectively. As depicted in Figure 1, the two devices are coupled in series and connected with the SMA <b>antenna</b> <b>connector</b> of the transmitting BT board. Thus, a global adjustable signal attenuation of up to 121 dB with a resolution of 1 dB can be achieved.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{study was}} carried out between a wireless sensor node with a bare die flip-chip mounted and its reference board with a BGA packaged transceiver chip. The main focus is the return loss (S parameter S 11) at the <b>antenna</b> <b>connector,</b> which was highly depended on the impedance mismatch. Modeling including the different interconnect technologies, substrate properties and passive components, was performed to simulate the system in Ansoft Designer software. Statistical methods, {{such as the use}} of standard derivation and regression, were applied to the RF performance analysis, to see the impacts of the different parameters on the return loss. Extreme value search, following on the previous analysis, can provide the parameters 2 ̆ 7 values for the minimum return loss. Measurements fit the analysis and simulation well and showed a great improvement of the return loss from - 5 dB to - 25 dB for the target wireless sensor node...|$|E
