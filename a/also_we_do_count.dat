30|$|Our workload/staffing {{ratio was}} {{calculated}} on a unit basis rather than individual patient basis because this more closely reflects {{the way our}} nursing teams work. Our patients are largely nursed in open ward areas, and while there is one nurse with primary responsibility for each patient, the work is shared between the nurses. The choice of TISS score rather than newer scores such as the Nursing Activities Score [24] also reflects the work carried out by our nurses {{and the way we}} measured staffing. We measured staffing by counting the number of nurses involved in direct patient care, excluding those with predominantly managerial and administrative tasks. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not <b>count</b> the number of healthcare assistants (nurse assistants). Healthcare assistants are mainly responsible for carrying out tasks like washing patients, changing linen, special room cleansing procedures and patient positioning. Thus several of the additional tasks added to TISS to create the Nursing Activities Score [24] are not carried out by our bedside nurses.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of this {{unpublished}} work about counting in English. A related but different paper about counting in French has been later published in the journal Travaux de Linguistique, Vol 72 (2016). In a recent paper, Liebesman (2014) claims that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not “count by identity”. Counting some objects by identity is giving the cardinality of the plurality that has these objects as members. Under this conception, some objects are two just in case these objects comprise one object distinct from another and no other object. Liebesman presents two arguments for his claim: the bagel argument and the liter argument. In my reply, I focus on the bagel argument, which is the most important. Liebesman first purports to show that in (1) Two and a half bagels are on the table, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not <b>count</b> by identity. In particular he rejects possibilities like the following: the expression two and a half bagels would really be two bagels and a half bagel. He then argues that in (2) Exactly two bagels are on the table, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not <b>count</b> by identity either. Taking a uniform semanticsto be preferable, he concludes that we never count by identity. As I explain in this paper, I agree that in some cases, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not <b>count</b> directly and use some kind of measurement instead. But contra Liebesman, I argue that this is {{the exception rather than the}} rule. In normal cases, we just count (“by identity”). Moreover, I provide an explicit semantics of the relevant sentences. Finally, I argue that even when we measure, thisinvolves genuine counting...|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} has some limitations, {{which should be}} considered. First, the study sample size was small, thus there might be effects on {{generalization}} of our findings.

The kaolinite, illite and montmorillonite, which are minerals commonly presenting in quarries, were taken account of the contribution of clay-rich sand aggregate, in order to estimate the applicability by various clay properties. The result shows methylene blue test poorly indicates the water sensitivity of bitumen-clay bonding because of various clay properties. Therefore, a mineralogical analysis of clay-rich aggregates has to be considered as a compensated method beside MB test...|$|R
