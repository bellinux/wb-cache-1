40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} theoretical design, network simulation, implementation, {{and experimental}} studies of optical packet routing systems supporting variable-length packets. The optical packet switching network exploits unified contention resolution in core routers in three optical domains (wavelength, time, and space) and in edge routers by traffic shaping. The optical router controller and lookup table, implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), effectively incorporates the contention resolution scheme with pipelined arbitration of asynchronously arriving variable-length packets. In addition, real-time performance monitoring based on the strong correlation between the bit-error rates of the optical label {{and those of the}} data payload indicates its application in optical time-to-live detection for loop mitigations.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of the modern photonics is to develop all-optical devices enabling increased speed and energy efficiency for transmitting and processing information on an optical chip. It is believed that the recently suggested Parity-Time (PT) symmetric photonic systems with alternating regions of gain and loss can bring novel functionalities. In such systems, losses are as important as gain and, depending on the structural parameters, gain compensates losses. Generally, PT systems demonstrate nontrivial non-conservative wave interactions and phase transitions, which can be employed for signal filtering and switching, opening new prospects for active control of light. In this review, we discuss a broad range of problems involving nonlinear PT-symmetric photonic systems with an intensity-dependent refractive index. Nonlinearity in such PT symmetric systems provides a basis for many effects such as the formation of localized modes, nonlinearly-induced PT-symmetry breaking, and <b>all-optical</b> <b>switching.</b> Nonlinear PT-symmetric <b>systems</b> can serve as powerful building blocks for the development of novel photonic devices targeting an active light control.

40|$|Magnetization {{manipulation}} in {{the absence}} of an external magnetic field is a topic of great interest, since many novel physical phenomena need to be understood and promising new applications can be imagined. Cutting-edge experiments have shown the capability to switch the magnetization of magnetic thin films using ultrashort polarized laser pulses. In 2007, it was first observed that the magnetization switching for GdFeCo alloy thin films was helicity-dependent and later helicity-independent switching was also demonstrated on the same material. Recently, <b>all-optical</b> <b>switching</b> has also been discovered for a much larger variety of magnetic materials (ferrimagnetic, ferromagnetic films and granular nanostructures), where the theoretical models explaining the switching in GdFeCo films do not appear to apply, thus questioning the uniqueness of the microscopic origin of <b>all-optical</b> <b>switching.</b> Here, we show that two different <b>all-optical</b> <b>switching</b> mechanisms can be distinguished; a "single pulse" switching and a "cumulative" switching process whose rich microscopic origin is discussed.

40|$|Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) {{propagate}} {{along the}} interface between metal and dielectric, so that SPPs can propagate along the designed interface, spread to the specified region and convert back to light wave. Through this method, modulated light can be guided to setting area and the propagation direction can be changed. In this paper, a kind of <b>all-optical</b> <b>switch</b> composed of metallic isosceles triangle is introduced. The principle of the <b>all-optical</b> <b>switch</b> is this. Firstly, the modulated light is converted into SPPs in the metal triangle at the bottom corner. Then, SPPs propagate along designed interface between metal and dielectric. Finally, SPPs become scattered light in the vertex of triangle where the signal light also become scattered light. Two scattering light interfere cancellation to achieve the goal that the modulation with very low power light can control the signal light.
