30|$|To quantitatively {{assess the}} effect of ΔT on the {{observed}} increase in crevasse area, we calculated the increase in crevasse area between consecutive images, ΔS, and examined its relation to ΔT. Table 2 lists the five examined SAR data pairs and their <b>acquisition</b> <b>dates.</b> In {{the case that the}} period between <b>acquisition</b> <b>dates</b> for a pair includes the minimum temperature for the year, the largest ΔT is chosen for the pair. For example, pair 3 (<b>acquisition</b> <b>dates</b> of 21 August 1994 and 31 January 1997) includes three ΔTs (those for 1994, 1995, and 1996). Because the ΔT in 1996 was the largest among them, it is used to correlate with the ΔS of pair 3. The same procedure was applied to pairs 2 and 5, to which the ΔTs for 1992 and 1997 were assigned, respectively. For pairs 1 and 5, whose intervals are less than 1 year, ΔT was selected as the largest 2 -week increase in temperature after 21 October 1991 (pair 1) and the largest 2 -week increase in temperature in 2000, between the <b>acquisition</b> <b>dates</b> (pair 5).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Large area {{land cover}} mapping with Landsat data is {{affected}} by differing image spectral characteristics caused by factors such as solar, radiometric, atmospheric, and phenologic conditions. For mapping land cover, especially forested land cover with single <b>date</b> satellite imagery, <b>acquisition</b> of imagery is ideally undertaken during the peak growing periods {{during the summer months}}. Yet, during the summer months cloud cover may preclude the collection of suitable imagery. To enable the collection of imagery to compile a large area coverage, the range of acceptable <b>acquisition</b> <b>dates</b> must be extended from the optimal mid-summer period. The question is how far can the <b>acquisition</b> <b>dates</b> range before the spectral information in the imagery is no longer appropriate for land cover mapping. To address this issue we have classified Landsat imagery representing a range of within year and between year dates and have assessed the variability in spatial features developed and the spectral information contained in the imagery. To ensure consistent radiometric characteristics between scenes we applied a top of atmosphere radiometric correction and a dark target subtraction. Our data set consists of 7 images. To assess within year variability we obtained 5 images over a range of dates within 1999. To calibrate the within year differences, we obtained images to represent the previous (1998) and following year (2000) during an optimal image acquisition window. Our results have shown that differences in class area are highly variable over the range of image <b>acquisition</b> <b>dates.</b> Spatial metrics also illustrate that the composition of the resultant classification units are also variable. The spectral variability of the within year image set are found to exceed those found for the between year image set...|$|R

50|$|Under U.S. tax rules, the {{de minimis}} rule governs the {{treatment}} of small amounts of market discount. Under the rule, if a bond is purchased {{with a small amount}} of market discount (an amount less than 0.25% of the face value of a bond times the number of complete years between the bond's <b>acquisition</b> <b>date</b> and its maturity date) the market discount is considered to be zero. If the market discount is less than the de minimis amount, the discount on the bond is generally treated as a capital gain upon disposition or redemption rather than as ordinary income. Under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, the de minimis rule can also apply to any benefit, property, or service provided to an employee that has so little value that reporting for it would be unreasonable or administratively impracticable; for example, use of a company photocopier to copy personal documents - see de minimis fringe benefit. Cash is not excludable, regardless of the amount.|$|E
