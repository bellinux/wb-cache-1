50|$|Anthony Lister (1979 - present) is a {{contemporary}} Australian-born painter and installation artist, {{best known for}} his merging of “high” and “low” cultural imagery in his work he is looked to {{as one of the best}} painters in street art anywhere in the world. Born in 1979 in Brisbane, Australia, he studied at the Queensland College of Art. Lister helped pioneer the street art movement in his home city as a teenager and is considered Australia’s premier street artist. His scrawling, figurative style employs charcoal, acrylic, spray paint, and oil. “The first rule of painting is to take everyone else out of the equation,” he has said. “I am the viewer, so I don’t underestimate my viewers. They see everything <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to assume that they are me. I can’t paint for anyone else.” His exhibitions include those held at the New Image Art Gallery in Los Angeles, Robert Fontaine Gallery in Miami, Jonathan Levine Gallery in New York and Black Art Projects in Melbourne. Lister currently lives and works in Sydney, Australia.|$|E

And he'd say 'you think that'd work?' Then we'd sit on the fender of a truck, in this parking lot in Miami, and I'd often think, if people see this they won't believe it!" [...] With Time Out of Mind, Lanois [...] "produced perhaps the most artificial-sounding album in Dylan's canon," [...] says author Clinton Heylin, who described the album as sounding [...] "like a Lanois CV."

After researching, Dobrev discovered she would also play Elena's 534-year-old vampire doppelgänger Katherine Pierce whose characteristics are the [...] "complete opposite". Dobrev described this as [...] "one of the rarest, coolest opportunities in television, to play two people on the same medium". She had confessed that she enjoys playing Katherine more than Elena. Dobrev stated that she changes her appearance to distinguish Elena from her doppelgänger, Katherine; [...] "Changing my hair helps me transform," [...] she told Glamour. Additionally, she said [...] "I think I have one of the coolest characters on the show — I get to play two completely different people {{on opposite sides of the}} spectrum <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> so much fun doing it". Dobrev felt that her biggest challenge on The Vampire Diaries was distinguishing Katherine and Elena, and found it [...] "interesting" [...] to create a whole new character.

Williams entered the French Open having not won a match on clay. In the first round she faced Klára Zakopalová, who beat her in their last encounter. Williams was quick to take the lead was a set and a break-up; Williams squandered 5 match points in the ninth game and lost the second set in a tie-break. Williams then led the third with a break and had three match points in the eight game and had another three match points, but Zakopalová came back to get it on serve, just to lose her serve in the tenth game of the third set to hand the win to Williams in Williams' ninth match point. This ends Williams' four match losing streak. In the second round, Williams faced Virginia Ruano Pascual and unlike her first-round match, Williams cruised through, losing just two games including a bagel in the first set. In her next match she faced another Spaniard in María José Martínez Sánchez. Martínez Sánchez took the first set with a break, but with controversy as Williams fired in a powerful shot that appeared to graze Martínez Sánchez's hand as she looked to defend herself. The Spaniard denied that such happened, Martínez Sánchez got the break in that game and took the set. Williams came back and took the last two sets with a single break lead in each set. In the fourth round, she face Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak and won comfortably in straight sets in 53 minutes. In the quarterfinals, she faced Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, Kuznetsova took the first set in a tie-break after saving a set point on her own serve in the twelfth game. Kuznetsova served for the match in the ninth game of the second set, but Williams broke through and won the last four games to push it to a decider. Williams then led by an early break just to surrender it and the match to Kuznetsova when she got broken in the twelfth game of the third set. Williams later admitted that she got tight in the match.|$|E

Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the Financial Times found that Roberts had pushed her [...] "mainstream pop background to the limit". He explained that whilst many expected the worst from another Girls Aloud band member, he noted [...] "You expect the worst - well, not worse than Cole's terrible albums, but not good - only to discover that Cinderella’ s Eyes is actually very promising". Robert Copsey from Digital Spy found that without listening to the album the impact would be limited as she had a [...] "troubled start" [...] and [...] "limited solo spots" [...] with band Girls Aloud but after listening to the record he expressed that her transition to a [...] "trendy solo songstress is one discussed with admirable honesty throughout her debut offering".

Hermione Hoby of The Guardian gave the album four stars out of five, calling [...] "Beat of My Drum", [...] "infectiously bratty" [...] and positively responded to the track [...] "Porcelain Heart" [...] saying, [...] "her Florence-bothering bellow of [...] "heaaaaaart" [...] on the fearsome [...] "Porcelain Heart", Roberts sounds utterly self-assured." [...] Rick Pearson of the Evening Standard felt that her Cinderella-persona for the album concept was appropriate to her life story calling the record [...] "a glittering pop song furnished with yelping Kate Bush-isms - while Metronomy's Joseph Mount drops by to produce the haunting highlight Fish out of Water.

In the Girls Aloud 2008 biography Roberts expressed an interest in writing and recording her own material, wanting to experiment in the studio for better understanding of the process. She then started work in the recording studio, with producers such as; Dragonette, Diplo and Joseph Mount. Roberts after a year of recording announced that she would be releasing her debut album, Cinderella's Eyes. The first single [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] had an on-sale release meaning it had little promotion beforehand and commercially it peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom but critically it garnered acclaim from critics which Roberts described as [...] "amazing". A second single [...] "Lucky Day" [...] was released shortly after and whilst gaining positive reviews it failed to make an impact commercially peaking at number 40 in the UK. The album was then released on 23 September 2011, Roberts described the album as [...] "electronically led", and the album was inspired by her time performing with Girls Aloud - [...] "It would have been stupid for me to make an album that meant nothing" [...] she said. For Roberts the album was about making a risky record, where there wasn't a guaranteed commercial success, explaining to The Guardian: [...] "It's taken every last bit of confidence just to release this record, or maybe I've just brainwashed myself into feeling more confident. I don't know if it's good, or if I've just told myself it's good." [...] The album was released to universal positive reviews from critics, reviewers such as Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the Financial Times, James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph, Emily Mackay of NME, Hugh Montgomery of The Independent and others hailed it as the best solo record from a member of Girls Aloud. Commercially in the United Kingdom the album peaked at number 17 whilst on the Digital charts it peaked at number 13, in Scotland it charted at number 21 whilst in Ireland it peaked at number 48. In late 2012, Roberts admitted during a secret show at Carphones Warehouse on Oxford St, to a small pool of journalists, that she was content with and prepared for the potential commercial fallout of releasing an album that was 'unlike anything out there'. On 6 January a third single from the album was released, titled [...] "Yo-Yo" [...] the song was described as a [...] "shining example of her pop sensibilities".|$|E
