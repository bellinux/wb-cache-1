50|$|The (slightly over pressurized) {{trajectory}} {{works as}} a main <b>airduct</b> from which fresh air percolates to the offices to be drawn off via the double (plenum) facade. This ventilation concept {{is part of a}} strategy to integrate more functions into one element.|$|E
50|$|A {{social worker}} all his life, Khan {{was born to}} a poor family having three {{brothers}} and one sister. Khan became the sole breadwinner for his family after his father died in 1948. He also took care of his mother until she died in 1996. At the age of 16 {{he worked for the}} Trinidad Steam Laundry. He founded Century21 Janitorial and Caribbean <b>Airduct</b> services. He took up his passion for social work at a young age.|$|E
50|$|Thermal design - The BTX layout {{establishes}} a straighter path of airflow with fewer obstacles, resulting in better overall cooling capabilities. There is no dedicated CPU fan - instead, a large 12 cm case fan is mounted, drawing its air directly {{from outside the}} computer and cooling the CPU through an <b>airduct.</b> Another distinct feature of BTX is the vertical mounting of the motherboard on the left-hand side. This results in the graphics card heatsink or fan facing upwards, {{rather than in the}} direction of the adjacent expansion card.|$|E
5000|$|The TriPort <b>airducts</b> in {{this product}} consist of two air ducts {{in the large}} grille, and one [...] "stand-alone" [...] air duct {{on top of each}} earbud.|$|R
50|$|Ducts are {{conduits}} or passages used in heating, ventilation, and {{air conditioning}} (HVAC) to deliver and remove air. The needed airflows include, for example, supply air, return air, and exhaust <b>air.Ducts</b> commonly also deliver ventilation air {{as part of the}} supply air. As such, air ducts are one method of ensuring acceptable indoor air quality as well as thermal comfort.|$|R
30|$|Geometric {{optimisation}} of ducted {{flows in}} cars, like <b>airducts</b> for cabin climatisation, engine air intakes or exhaust systems, are commonly subject to severe packaging constraints. This {{gave rise to}} the development and adoption of topology optimisation methods for automotive applications. After a concise retrospective of these development efforts, it will be shown that especially for ducted flows, topology optimisation is a perfect complement to the classical shape optimisation.|$|R
5000|$|A nose whistle (also {{called a}} 'Noseflute') is a wind instrument, usually made in wood, but also {{available}} in plastic, clay and metal sheet, probably of South-American indigenous origin. In spite of its ethnic background, several models have been conceived and patented in the 19th and 20th Centuries. The nose blows air into the instrument's open nosepiece, from where it is channeled through an <b>airduct,</b> towards a rather sharp edge of a slit, positioned over the player's mouth opening. This edge helps creating a vortex that excites the acoustic field into the player's mouth cavity. Since the volume {{and shape of the}} mouth cavity can be widely and quickly controlled by the player, a wide range of playing frequencies are possible. This high playability of such sound instrument probably explains {{the fact that it is}} usually called [...] "Noseflute", rather than Nose Whistle.|$|E
40|$|Predicting and {{evaluating}} building performance {{plays an important}} role in the training of responsible architects. Building performance includes issues such as: structural stability, acoustic quality, natural lighting, thermal comfort, and ventilation and indoor air quality. These types of analyses are often laborious, non-intuitive, and non-graphical. As a result, these important issues do not arouse the enthusiasm of architecture students or building professionals. The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) research team proposes to explore and develop a long-term strategy to apply scientific visualization on teaching and research in environmental technology and building performance. This paper presents the development process and results of research projects for applying computational fluid dynamics (CFD) on building performance evaluation. CFD On-line Teaching project's aim is to develop a web-based training course for architecture students to apply CFD simulation on design problem solving. Each lesson not only illustrates basic principles regarding airflow in the building design, it also contains CFD sample files with predefined flow cells for students to test different concepts. GiLin Temple project's aim is to apply CFD simulation on investigating the wind resistance of Tong Dynasty heavy timber structure. Airflow information generated in the project includes the visual representation of the pressure distribution and velocity field on all slices through the temple, and the tracking of particles as they flow around or through a building. The China housing residential <b>airduct</b> study focuses on simulating the indoor airflow regarding the <b>airduct</b> design of China Experimental Urban Housing Scheme. The visual representation of the pressure distribution and velocity field in the airducts provides vital information for helping China Housing Research Center improve the current design...|$|E
40|$|A {{feedforward}} control algorithm for {{active noise control}} based on the recursive estimation of a generalized finite impulse response (F’IR) filter is presented in this paper. The {{feedforward control}} algorithm is applied to a commercial air ventilation silencer to provide active noise compensation in an <b>airduct</b> A generalized FIR filter has the same linear parameter S ~ N C ~ U R as a taped delay FIR filter that is favorable for (recursive) estimation purposes. However, {{the advantage of the}} generalized FIR fiten lies in the possibility to include prior knowledge of system dynamics in the tapped delay line of the filter. By comparison with a conventional FIR filter implementation it is shnwo that a significant improvement in noise cancellation is obtained...|$|E
40|$|In {{dwellings}} with {{mechanical ventilation}} systems {{the fresh air}} can easily be preheated by means of simple solar air systems. These can {{be an integral part}} of the building facade or roof and the costs are expected to be low. By means of computer experiments a large number of systems were evaluated. It was found that these systems can provide interesting energy gains providing the system is well dimensioned and has a storage. For this massive <b>airducts</b> are more effective than a massive absorber...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has a concrete framing (designed by A.D.N. van Gendt) covered by interchanged layers of brick and granite, which {{gave rise to}} its nickname De Spekkoek ("Layer Cake"). In the base, sevenite was used. To visually temper these horizontal elements, vertical elements {{were added to the}} building's facade. The building is centered on two light-courts, and its inner details bear some resemblance to works of American architects Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan. Almost all interior parts of the building, such as floor mosaics, frames of the <b>airducts,</b> telephone booths, room decorations, as well as its furniture, were also designed by de Bazel.|$|R
40|$|Results from a {{research}} project supported by the Swedish Council for Building Research are reported. The main task was to improve climate control technology. The work was focused on digital control. It was split up into three main tasks: model building, design of regulators, and fullscale experiments. Several rooms, <b>airducts,</b> and heat exchangers were modelled. Simple dynamic models have been derived from mass and energy balance equations. The correspondance with experimental models is rather crude. The main problem is to choose certain heat transfer coefficients. Several control experiments showed that the PI-regulator gives a good result in many cases. Adjustment of regulator parameters can be very time consuming. In some cases a solution {{is to use a}} self-tuning regulator. A simple self-tuning regulator, called the quotient regulator, has been developed. The computer technology makes it possible to implement better control principles. The experiments show that there is room for improvements of climate control systems and that substantial energy savings can sometimes be obtained. An interpretative process control language suitable for climate control is also described...|$|R
30|$|The adjoint {{method has}} long been {{considered}} as the tool of choice for gradient-based optimisation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It is {{the independence of the}} computational cost from the number of design variables that makes it particularly attractive for problems with large design spaces. Originally developed by Lions and Pironneau in the 70 ’s, the adjoint method has evolved towards a standard tool within the development processes of the aeronautical industries. Its uptake in the automotive industry, however, lags behind. The first systematic applications of adjoint methods in automotive CFD have interestingly not taken place in the classical shape design arena, but in a relatively young discipline of sensitivity-based optimisation: fluid dynamic topology optimisation. While being an established concept in structure mechanics for decades already, its transfer to fluid dynamics took place just ten years ago. We demonstrate that specifically for ducted flow applications, like <b>airducts</b> for cabin ventilation or engine intake ports, it constitutes a very powerful tool and has matured over the last years to a level that allows its systematic usage for various automotive applications. To drive adjoint-based shape optimisation to the same degree of maturity and robustness for car applications is the subject of ongoing research collaborations between academia and the car industry. Achievements and challenges encountered during these efforts are presented.|$|R
