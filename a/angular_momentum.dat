5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its <b>angular</b> <b>momentum</b> in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that <b>angular</b> <b>momentum.</b> The primordial binaries transfer some <b>angular</b> <b>momentum</b> by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to give {{explicitly}} all non-linear vacuum {{solutions to}} our non-linear field equations, and to define in a coordinate free manner the important subclass of non-linear solutions, {{which we call}} almost photon-like. By means of a correct introduction of the local and integral intrinsic <b>angular</b> <b>momentums</b> of these solutions, we saparate the photon-like solutions through the requirement their integral intrinsic <b>angular</b> <b>momentums</b> to be equal to the Planck's constant. Finally, we consider such solutions, moving radially to or from a given center, using standard spherical coordinates. Comment: 14 pages, LaTex, no figure...|$|R

2500|$|In de Broglie's double {{solution}} theory {{the particles}} of an entangled pair each {{have their own}} physical wave in the [...] "sub-quantum medium" [...] which, due to conservation of momentum when the pair are created, propagate with opposite <b>angular</b> <b>momentums.</b> In de Broglie's double solution theory, the particles do not have well defined spins prior to detection. Since the particles do not have well defined spins prior to detection there are no hidden variables in this scenario. During detection, the local collapse of the local wave gives the local particle its spin. Since the waves propagate with opposite <b>angular</b> <b>momentums,</b> they collapse as exact opposites which give their associated local particles opposite spins. Detecting one particle {{has no effect on}} the other. No [...] information transfer required.|$|R
5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total <b>angular</b> <b>momentum</b> {{of the system is}} conserved, but the <b>angular</b> <b>momentum</b> can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
5|$|Einstein and De Haas {{demonstrated}} that magnetization {{is due to}} the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's <b>angular</b> <b>momentum</b> changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the <b>angular</b> <b>momentum</b> associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.|$|E

They showed that such black holes have an equivalent description in terms of conformal field theory. The Kerr/CFT correspondence was later extended to black holes with lower <b>angular</b> <b>momentum.</b>|$|E

Can a Majorana spinor, whose entries are real functions of the space-time, describe the energy, linear and <b>angular</b> <b>momentums</b> of a free spin one-half particle? We show that it can. We show that the Majorana spinor is an irreducible representation of the double cover of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group and of the full Lorentz group.

5|$|The orbital <b>angular</b> <b>momentum</b> of {{electrons}} is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that {{is proportional to}} the <b>angular</b> <b>momentum.</b> The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons.

5|$|The {{physics of}} {{accretion}} disks encounters some problems. The {{most important one}} is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its <b>angular</b> <b>momentum.</b> One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfv√©n was that <b>angular</b> <b>momentum</b> was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding <b>angular</b> <b>momentum</b> is magnetic braking, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for {{the disappearance of the}} gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.|$|E

5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, <b>angular</b> <b>momentum</b> and projection of <b>angular</b> <b>momentum,</b> and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
