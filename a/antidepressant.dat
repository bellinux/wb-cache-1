5|$|Bupropion is a {{medication}} primarily {{used as an}} <b>antidepressant</b> and smoking cessation aid. It is marketed as Wellbutrin and Zyban among other trade names. It {{is one of the}} most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the United States and Canada, although in many countries this is an off-label use. It is an effective <b>antidepressant</b> on its own, but is also popular as an add-on medication in cases of incomplete response to first-line SSRI antidepressants. Bupropion is taken in tablet form and is available only by prescription in most countries.|$|E

40|$|Comorbidity of {{depression}} risks is common among cancer patients. The pharmacological treatment {{of depression}} is <b>antidepressants.</b> However, <b>antidepressants</b> may interact with anticancer drugs or cause adverse reactions. The prescription practice of <b>antidepressants</b> to cancer patients in Australia {{is not well}} documented. Our systematic review and meta-analysis identified that the overall prevalence rate of <b>antidepressants</b> was 15. 6 % varied widely by world-region and gender. A retrospective case-control study was undertaken to determine the recent prescription practice of <b>antidepressants</b> to cancer and non-cancer patients in Australia. Mirtazapine was the highly prescribed <b>antidepressants</b> to cases, whereas Desvenlafaxine was prescribed to controls. Considerable variation in the prescribing patterns of <b>antidepressants</b> was identified. Prospective {{studies are needed to}} ascertain whether patients are being treated optimally...|$|R
5|$|Various analgesics (painkillers) {{may be used}} in {{controlling}} the headaches of intracranial hypertension. In addition to conventional agents such as paracetamol, a low dose of the <b>antidepressant</b> amitriptyline or the anticonvulsant topiramate have shown some additional benefit for pain relief.|$|E
5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even though this is not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line <b>antidepressant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Drake {{suffered}} from major depression, {{and this was}} often reflected in his lyrics. On completion of his third album, 1972's Pink Moon, he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, {{at the age of}} 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed <b>antidepressant.</b> His cause of death was determined to be suicide.|$|E
40|$|<b>Antidepressants</b> are {{indicated}} in about 40 different disorders, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and other disorders. We propose to call these disorders antidepressani-responsive disorders (ARDs). We describe the clinical and biological criteria that differentiate the <b>antidepressants.</b> Although <b>antidepressants</b> {{share the same}} clinical efficacy in most ARDs, the configuration of adverse drug reactions varies widely. The recent <b>antidepressants</b> should be preferred to the tricyclic <b>antidepressants</b> as first-line treatment because of their lesser risk of severe adverse drug reactions. However, several recent <b>antidepressants</b> {{have been associated with}} severe complications such as the serotonin syndrome and the withdrawal syndrome. Patient characteristics should be included as a criterion to predict both unwanted and favorable effects...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Antidepressants</b> - {{there is}} {{evidence}} to support the use of SSRI and SNRI <b>antidepressants</b> in bipolar II. Indeed, some sources consider them {{to be one of the}} first line treatments. [...] However, <b>antidepressants</b> also pose significant risks, including a switch to mania, rapid cycling, and dysphoria [...] and so many psychiatrists advise against their use for bipolar.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence of clinically relevant anti-inflammatory effects of monoaminergic <b>antidepressants.</b> PubMed and Ovid databases were searched systematically {{for the use}} and efficacy of <b>antidepressants</b> in association with 5 common inflammatory skin disorders: chronic urticaria, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, other eczema, and alopecia areata. From January 1984 to June 2016, publications included a total of 1, 252 dermatological patients in 28 trials or case reports. These unambiguously reported a reduced burden of dermatological symptoms in relation to treatment with <b>antidepressants.</b> Several randomized controlled trials of first-generation <b>antidepressants</b> have been published, while studies of modern <b>antidepressants</b> are usually open-label, yet more informative, regarding patients’ characteristics and study procedures. These overall positive findings may indicate a rationale, beyond treating comorbid psychiatric disorders, {{for the use of}} <b>antidepressants</b> in dermatology. Further research into modern tolerable <b>antidepressants,</b> including selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, mirtazapine and bupropion, is required...|$|R

5|$|Horder {{prescribed}} her an <b>antidepressant,</b> a {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor, {{a few days}} before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse. Commentators have argued that because antidepressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.|$|E
5|$|The coroner {{reported}} that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol {{were found in}} Smith's system {{at the time of}} his death but did find prescribed levels of <b>antidepressant,</b> anxiolytic, and ADHD medications, including Clonazepam, Mirtazapine, Atomoxetine, and Amphetamine. There were no hesitation wounds, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To analyse {{the outcome}} of {{depression}} in the Swedish population as reflected by the detection of <b>antidepressants</b> in a national forensic toxicological screening programme of unnatural deaths. DESIGN [...] <b>Antidepressants</b> detected by the National Laboratory of Forensic Chemistry were related to data on use expressed in person years of exposure. SUBJECTS [...] All 7000 cases of unnatural death with results from forensic toxicological screening in 1990 - 1; this included 3400 (85 %) of the 4000 cases of suicide in Sweden. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Number of findings of <b>antidepressants</b> in the screening programme and number of findings of different <b>antidepressants</b> {{in relation to their}} use. RESULTS [...] <b>Antidepressants</b> were found in 585 screening tests, corresponding to 542 subjects or less than 16 % of the 3400 cases of suicide. Newer, less toxic <b>antidepressants</b> were found more often than the older compounds. Toxic concentrations of <b>antidepressants</b> were found in only 190 cases (5. 6 %). CONCLUSION [...] A consistent finding in surveys of suicide is that about half of the patients who commit suicide are depressed. The current data suggest that most depressed patients who commit suicide are not taking <b>antidepressants</b> immediately before death. Therapeutic failure may be a greater problem with <b>antidepressants</b> than toxicity as the results did not indicate any advantage of the newer, less toxic <b>antidepressants.</b> All causes of death should be included in risk analyses, thereby providing an estimate of effectiveness as well as toxicity of <b>antidepressants...</b>|$|R
25|$|Tetracyclic <b>antidepressants</b> (TeCAs) are a {{class of}} <b>antidepressants</b> that were first {{introduced}} in the 1970s.

25|$|Pharmacotherapies {{that have}} been used for ORS include <b>antidepressants,</b> (e.g. {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic <b>antidepressants,</b> monoamine oxidase inhibitors), antipsychotics, (e.g. blonanserin, lithium, chlorpromazine), and benzodiazepines. The most common treatment used for ORS is SSRIs. Specific <b>antidepressants</b> {{that have been}} used include clomipramine.|$|R
5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical <b>antidepressant,</b> different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} uncertainty about which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments {{of people who}} harm themselves are most effective. Psychiatric and personality disorders are common in individuals who self-harm {{and as a result}} self-harm may be an indicator of depression and/or other psychological problems. Many people who self-harm have moderate or severe depression and therefore treatment with <b>antidepressant</b> medications may often be used. There is tentative evidence for the medication flupentixol; however, greater study is required before it can be recommended.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and <b>antidepressant</b> properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies {{with healthy}} volunteers have {{demonstrated}} that <b>antidepressants</b> can improve immunoregulatory activity and thus {{they may have a}} potential to positively impact the disease course in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic and incurable condition.

5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into <b>antidepressant</b> properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{was invented}} by Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1969, and the US patent for it was granted in 1974. It was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an <b>antidepressant</b> on 30 December 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin. However, a significant incidence of epileptic seizures at the originally recommended dosage caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986. Subsequently, the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose-dependent, and bupropion was re-introduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum recommended daily dose.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the <b>antidepressant</b> nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E
40|$|<b>Antidepressants,</b> in {{addition}} to being effective therapeutic agents for depression, have also proved to be multifaceted drugs useful for treating a number of other psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Despite the widespread use of these drugs, much remains to be understood about their mechanisms of action and other important aspects, such as their metabolism and potential interactions with other drugs. This article reviews research conducted in the authors' laboratories on various aspects of <b>antidepressants,</b> including trace amines and <b>antidepressants,</b> gamma-aminobutyric acid and <b>antidepressants,</b> drug metabolism, development and application of rapid, sensitive assay procedures for <b>antidepressants</b> and their metabolites; and drug development based on analogues of the <b>antidepressants</b> phenelzine and tranylcypromine.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and <b>antidepressant</b> prescriptions.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an <b>antidepressant</b> may be justified.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its <b>antidepressant</b> effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
