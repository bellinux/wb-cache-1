For {{the rest of his}} life, Kennan continued to reiterate that the article did not imply an automatic commitment to resist Soviet [...] "expansionism" [...] wherever it occurred, with little distinction of primary and secondary interests. The article did not make it obvious that Kennan favored employing political and economic rather than military methods as the chief agent of containment. [...] "My thoughts about containment" [...] said Kennan in a 1996 interview to CNN, [...] "were of course distorted by the people who understood it and pursued it exclusively as a military concept; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that,</b> as much as any other cause, led to [...] 40 years of unnecessary, fearfully expensive and disoriented process of the Cold War".|$|E

Several outlets [...] now quoting me as [...] source for the unsupportable claim that ‘nuns starved 800 babies to death’ before dumping them in a septic tank. So just in case this needs clarification, I said nothing of the sort." [...] Boucher-Hayes also spoke of embarrassment felt by locals at the revelations: [...] "Talk to anybody else and there's a bit of hand wringing, there's a bit of chest beating {{and a lot of}} 'ah sure, those were the times, weren't they, what's the point in going and unearthing it now'. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is an embarrassment about our past that is probably replicated in so many places where there were industrial schools, where there were mother and baby homes and where there is now the suspicion in Cork, in Westmeath, in Tipperary that there are very, very large communal graves of unmarked bodies, unknown about, un-commemorated, discarded bodies." ...|$|E

In Santorum's case, on the other hand, the term [...] "santorum" [...] still points to a web page about a [...] "santorum"—which happens to be Savage's neologism instead of the Senator from Pennsylvania.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} entitled [...] "Ann Patchett Calls 'Commonwealth' Her 'Autobiographical First Novel'," [...] Patchett said, “My parents got divorced when I was young, {{and my mother}} married someone who had four children.

It's so complicated to figure out who you're going to spend Christmas with.” Noting that many authors’ first novels are based on their own experience, Patchett explained that she had started her career wanting “to prove that I had this great imagination. But the wonderful thing about publishing this book at 52 is that I know that I am capable of working from a place of deep imagination. Now I just feel like I own every part of myself and my life and my imagination and the rocky terrain of my own brain, and that feels really good.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The latest major film {{production}} by Kevin Sullivan was Guess Who (2005); {{the idea for}} the movie was originally a collaborative effort by Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac. As Ashton Kutcher explained in an interview about his choice of directors, [...] "I had a conversation with Kevin before we started the movie. And the reason that I liked Kevin—we picked Kevin to do the movie, Bernie and I did, because what he knew the movie needed was heart. And he was more concerned about the heart than the comedy". The movie focuses on a young white man (played by Ashton Kutcher) attempting to marry the African American woman, while trying to seek the approval of her overprotective father (played by Bernie Mac). Working with Sullivan did have its impact upon the film, as Kutcher explains, [...] "Well, working for Kevin Sullivan was a very different experience for me. Kevin didn't just let us go. At no point in time did Kevin just let us go... <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> brought a different performance for each of us from what we'd done before". The movie received mostly mixed reviews.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003 Infestum starts {{work on a}} {{new album}} [...] "Ta Natas". As Ion said {{it should have been}} [...] "more dense and tough music in all senses than {{previous}} works", and Skald described this album as a [...] "total bedlam". Album material was changed very long time unless it was released in 2007 by German label Blood Fire Death Productions. It has been dedicated to the memory of Alyona Zimnitskaya (16.10.1981 — 19.09.2006). This album was void of folk elements and gained new expressive vanguard forms. Black metal was complemented witch symphonic elements and synthesizer play. The album also featured artwork by Valdmar Smerdulak who had a great experience in creating that kind of stuff for bands at that time. With changing the style of music the band changes its appearance also. They don't wear chain armour anymore at their concerts but prefer more severe style of wearing. Two music videos were filmed at that period: [...] "Razor To Throat" [...] and [...] "Ta Natas". Bass player Thorngrim was engaged in creating music videos. [...] "Razor To Throat" [...] was very popular on metalvideo.com portal and ranked in top 10 of the portal chart. A young girl took credit in this video. Her name was Nokturna. She acted naked in that video. [...] "Ta Natas" [...] has frames with a lot of human skulls. That frames were taken from the documentary about Sedlec Ossuary (a place of interests in Czech Republic). [...] "Ta Natas" [...] was met by critics in different ways but most of reviews were positive or neutral. A lot of metal web-sites assessed [...] "Ta Natas" [...] with marks above medium. [...] "This album is full of anger, pain and despair", one of the critics said. Another critic said: [...] "the band manages to combine darkness, despair and melody <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is worth a compliment, as not many bands succeed in that!". Some critics found that the lack of this album was too over-processed, forced and screamed vocals. At the same time when album was released Divine Skald left the band. A new guitarist that replaced him was A\Vesh (Наша Вайна, Пярэварацень).|$|E
