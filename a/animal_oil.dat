2500|$|Henan is a semi-industrialized {{economy with}} an {{underdeveloped}} service sector. In 2009, Henan's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 277 billion RMB (US$40 billion), 1.097 trillion RMB (US$160 billion), and 563 billion RMB (US$82 billion), respectively. Agriculture {{has traditionally been}} a pillar of its economy, with the nation's highest wheat and sesame output and second highest rice output, earning its reputation as the breadbasket of China. Henan {{is also an important}} producer of beef, cotton, maize, pork, <b>animal</b> <b>oil,</b> and corn. Food production and processing makes up more than 14% of the output from the province's secondary industry, [...] and it is said that 90% of Chinese McDonald's and KFC ingredients comes from Henan.|$|E
2500|$|French fries are an {{invention}} of the Low Countries, and Belgian historian Jo Gerard mentions that they originated around 1680 in both Belgium and the Spanish Netherlands, specifically {{in the area of}} [...] "the Meuse valley between Dinant and Liège". The people of this region used to prepare meals with small amounts of fried fish, but when the river froze over and fishing became impossible, they would cut up potatoes and fry them in <b>animal</b> <b>oil.</b> French fries were introduced as a snack in American cafés during the early 19th century, but they did not become popular until large fast food companies such as McDonald's and Burger King incorporated them into their menus during the mid-20th century. The improvements in potato freezing technology made by J.R. Simplot of Idaho City in 1953, made the large scale production of French fries possible. Before the potatoes were frozen, however, they had still lost some of their flavor during frying, but new processes such as a further improved Simplot invention avoided this inconvenience by 1967, largely thanks to the use of a mixture of cow tallow and soybean oil. This allowed Simplot and McDonald's founder Ray Kroc to collaborate, resulting in ready-peeled potatoes from Simplot's farms being delivered directly to McDonald's kitchens, where they were fried and served to customers. Initially, however, there were safety concerns raised over some fries and the kitchens in which they were prepared, leading some companies, such as White Castle, to remove them from their menus during the 1950s.|$|E

This enterprise, backed by the Martineau family, set out to produce vitriol, but as Taylor & Martineau became widely diversified. One of Taylor's interests was sugar refining, for which {{he took out a}} patent in 1815 for a pressure method for separation of sugar from molasses. The use of heated <b>animal</b> <b>oils</b> in sugar processes disclosed the production of naphtha. Taylor took out another patent in 1815, for decomposing <b>animal</b> <b>oils</b> into gas. This discovery led Taylor & Martineau into 1823 to what Philip Taylor's son later wrote of as [...] "the battle of the gases": the commercial contest between gas lighting derived from coal and from oils. John Taylor's direction in the 1820s, however, was back into mining.|$|R

50|$|Plants ware {{prepared}} as remedies {{in a number}} of ways. Leafy branches are often placed over a fire while the patient squats on top and inhaled the steam. Sprigs of aromatic leaves might be crushed and inhaled, inserted into the nasal septum, or prepared into a pillow on which the patient sleeps. To make an infusion, leaves or bark are crushed and soaked in water (sometimes for a very long time), which is then drunk, or washed over the body. Ointment is prepared by mixing crushed leaves with animal fat. Other external treatment includes rubbing down the patient with crushed seed paste, fruit pulp or <b>animal</b> <b>oil,</b> or dripping milky sap or a gummy solution over them. Most plant medicines are externally applied.|$|E
5000|$|A {{large share}} of farmers' income were {{collected}} for him. Crops were divided between landowner and farmer; the base rent was one-third the yield from irrigated lands and one-fourth from dry land. Additionally there were collections of <b>animal</b> <b>oil,</b> butter, sheep, and cheese for the landlords, which oppressed Zonouz' farmers. [...] "The poem of harvest which is written by Eftekhari about oppressed farmers of Zonouz is the best evidence". Land reform was undertaken by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1963, and the living conditions of farmers were improved {{with the end of}} feudalism. During the Pahlavi period, the total ownership of Zonouz was 90 shares. Each farmer had to buy his own share from successors of Mortazavi (Abdolvah hab). By buying out the landlord, feudalism gradually disappeared from Zonouz society.|$|E
50|$|The USDA National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research {{developed}} an Estolide lubricant technology made from vegetable and <b>animal</b> <b>oils.</b> Estolides have shown great promise {{in a wide}} range of applications, including engine lubricants. Working with the USDA, a California-based company Biosynthetic Technologies has developed a high-performance “drop-in” biosynthetic oil using Estolide technology for use in motor oils and industrial lubricants. This biosynthetic oil American Petroleum Institute (API) has the potential to greatly reduce environmental challenges associated with petroleum. Independent testing not only shows biosynthetic oils to be among the highest-rated products for protecting engines and machinery; they are also bio-based, biodegradable, non-toxic and do not bioaccumulate in marine organisms. Also, motor oils and lubricants formulated with biosynthetic base oils can be recycled and re-refined with petroleum-based oils.

Dippel attempted to purchase Castle Frankenstein in exchange for his elixir formula, which he claimed he had recently discovered; the offer was turned down. There are also rumours that during his stay at Frankenstein Castle, Dippel practiced not only alchemy but also anatomy and may have performed experiments on dead bodies that he exhumed. There are rumours that he dug up bodies and performed medical experiments on them at the castle and that a local cleric would have warned his parish that Dippel had created a monster that was brought to life by a bolt of lightning. There are local people who still claim today that this actually happened and that this tale was related to Shelley's stepmother by the Brothers Grimm, the German ethnologists. However, none of these claims have been proven to this date, and some local researchers doubt any connection between Mary Shelley and Frankenstein Castle.|$|E
5000|$|Internally, well-steeped tray {{ceilings}} {{replaced the}} open-beamed Tudor style. Above this, the roofs changed considerably. The hip roof, shallower than its predecessors, was adopted, and roofing slates of thin, handcut limestone slabs replaced shingles. These slates with slightly over an inch thick, and ten to twelve inches (305 mm) long; laid over a cedar frame in an overlapping pattern, they gave a down-stepped appearance. Finally, the roofs were {{coated with a}} mixture of lime, sand and water and, when available, turtle and whale oil to provide extra weather-proofing. Apart from the <b>animal</b> <b>oil,</b> this method of roof construction continues to be used. The walls, likewise, were often whitewashed, giving the island a faux snowcover if seen from a distance, though American author Mark Twain preferred to liken it to cake icing, [...] "the white of marble...modest and retiring comparison". [...] French botanist André Michaux, on the other hand, found the reflective glare of the roofs fatiguing. [...] A common alternative to the whitewash was a simple lime plaster made — much like the wash — of lime, red clay and turtle or whale oil. If well-maintained, this plaster kept walls free of moisture, but if cracked, moisture would be retained.|$|E
