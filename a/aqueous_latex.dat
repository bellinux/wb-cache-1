Euphorbia tirucalli L., a plant known popularly as Aveloz, and originally used in Africa, has been drawing attention for its use in the United States and Latin America, both for use as an ornamental plant and as a medicinal plant. E. tirucalli L. {{is a member of}} the family Euphorbiaceae and contains many diterpenoids and triterpenoids, in particular phorbol esters, apparently the main constituent of this plant, which are assumed to be responsible for their activities in vivo and in vitro. The in vitro antifungal activities of Euphorbia tirucalli (L.) against opportunistic yeasts were studied using microbroth dilution assay. The results showed that <b>aqueous</b> extract and <b>latex</b> preparation were effective against ten clinical strains of Cryptococcus neoformans in vitro (Latex and extract MIC range of 3. 2 - > 411 µg/mL). Aiming the safe use in humans, the genotoxic effects of E. tirucalli were evaluated in human leukocytes cells. Our data show that both <b>aqueous</b> extract and <b>latex</b> preparation have no genotoxic effect in human leukocytes cells in vitro. Although the results cannot be extrapolated by itself for use in vivo, they suggest a good perspective for a therapeutic application in future.

40|$|The {{combination}} of reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) and emulsion polymerization has recently {{attracted much attention}} as a synthetic tool for high-molecular-weight block copolymers and their micellar nano-objects. Up to recently, though, the use of thermoresponsive polymers as both macroRAFT agents and latex stabilizers was impossible in aqueous media due to their hydrophobicity at the usually high polymerization temperatures. In this work, we present a straightforward surfactant-free RAFT emulsion polymerization to obtain thermoresponsive styrenic block copolymers with molecular weights of around 100 kDa and their well-defined latexes. The stability of the <b>aqueous</b> <b>latexes</b> is achieved by adding 20 vol % of the cosolvent 1, 4 -dioxane (DOX), increasing the phase transition temperature (PTT) of the used thermoresponsive poly(N-acryloylpyrrolidine) (PAPy) macroRAFT agents above the polymerization temperature. Furthermore, this cosolvent approach is combined {{with the use of}} poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) -block-poly(N-acryloylpiperidine-co-N-acryloylpyrrolidine) (PDMA-b-P(APi-co-APy)) as the macroRAFT agent owning a short stabilizing PDMA end block and a widely adjustable PTT of the P(APi-co-APy) block in between 4 and 47 °C. The temperature-induced collapse of the latter under emulsion polymerization conditions leads to the formation of RAFT nanoreactors, which allows for a very fast chain growth of the polystyrene (PS) block. In dynamic light scattering (DLS), as well as cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM), moreover, all created latexes indeed reveal a high (temperature) stability and a reversible collapse of the thermoresponsive coronal block upon heating. Hence, this paper pioneers a versatile way towards amphiphilic thermoresponsive high-molecular-weight block copolymers and their nano-objects with tailored corona switchability...|$|R

The outstanding feature of the "one pot" synthesis developed in this work lies in the successful preparation of a stable complex suspension made of silica sol, multi-scale porogens and Pt nanoparticles. The multi-scale porogens were based on non-ionic triblock copolymers and <b>aqueous</b> <b>latex</b> suspension to create mesopores and macropores, respectively, with finely tuned pore size and organization. For further functionalization of the membranes, Pt nanoparticles of about 4 nm in diameter were prepared by irradiating with microwaves (MW) the Pt precursors added in the starting suspension. This original path is suggested to enable a pre-organization of Pt nanoparticles in the ordered mesoporous structure. The suspensions were then deposited as thin films on either dense or macroporous supports, and further thermally treated at 450 °C to remove the porogen units. Hierarchical porous layers composed of micropores (< 2 nm), ordered mesopores (∼ 4 nm) and macropores (∼ 70 nm) with or without Pt were prepared and characterized.

The residual surfactants in paint, as well as hydrolytic effects with some polymers cause the paint to remain susceptible to softening and, over time, degradation by water.

PMeV is an isometric virus particle with a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome of approximately 12 Kb. Unusual for a plant virus, PMeV particles are localized on and linked to the polymers present in the latex. The ability of the PMeV to inhabit such a hostile environment demonstrates an intriguing interaction of the virus with the papaya. A hypersensitivity response is triggered against PMeV infection, and there is a reduction in the proteolytic activity of papaya latex during sticky disease. In papaya leaf tissues, stress responsive proteins, mostly calreticulin and proteasome-related proteins, are up regulated and proteins related to metabolism are down-regulated. Additionally, PMeV modifies the transcription of several miRNAs involved in the modulation of genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

All shunts were attenuated close to their insertion site via ventral midline celiotomy and a transdiaphragmatic approach to the shunt. Perioperative complications were recorded. Results: A 3 - 5 cm incision, 0. 5 - 1 cm ventral and lateral {{to the level of the}} aortic hiatus, was made in the pars lumbalis part of the diaphragm. Stay sutures at both sides of the diaphragmatic incision were placed to open up the incision and a retractor was used to push the esophagus away from the aorta. Intrathoracic insertion of the shunt was confirmed intraoperative. Exposure of the shunt insertion site at the azygos vein was excellent in all clinical cases. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were encountered. Conclusion: If thoracic attenuation of a porto-azygos shunt is considered, a transdiaphragmatic approach exposes the insertion site for shunt attenuation. This approach is straightforward, without unnecessary abdominal organ manipulation, and since attenuates at the insertion, avoids missing additional contributing branches...|$|E
40|$|Natural rubber (NR) {{composites}} were {{reinforced with}} bacterial cellulose (BC) to improve mechanical and physical properties. The natural rubber bacterial cellulose (NRBC) composite films were prepared via a <b>latex</b> <b>aqueous</b> microdispersion process by a thorough mixing of BC slurry with natural rubber latex (NRL). The structural morphology and chemical and physical properties of NRBC composites were investigated. The hydrophilicity, opacity, and crystallinity of the NRBC composites were significantly enhanced {{because of the}} added BC. By loading BC at 80 [*]wt. %, the mechanical properties, such as Young’s modulus and tensile strength, were 4, 128. 4 [*]MPa and 75. 1 [*]MPa, respectively, which were approximately 2, 580 times and 94 times those of pure NR films, respectively, whereas the elongation at break of was decreased to 0. 04 of that of the NR film. Because of its high mechanical strength and thermal stability, the NRBC composites have potential uses as high mechanical strength rubber-based products and bioelastic packaging in many applications...|$|R
40|$|Processing {{graphene}} and graphene polymer nanocomposites {{in an aqueous}} medium {{has always}} been a big challenge due to the hydrophobic nature of graphene (or reduced graphene oxide) nanosheets. In this work, a waterborne latex of polyurethane has been used both as the matrix material for embedding the graphene nanosheets and as a unique stabilizer to help produce an up to 5 wt% graphene/PU nanocomposites. The graphene oxide/polyurethane <b>latex</b> <b>aqueous</b> suspension is reduced in-situ using hydrazine, without any trace of aggregation/agglomeration upon completion of the reduction process, which would otherwise have occurred severely were PU not present. A highly aligned nanostructure is produced when graphene content is increased beyond 2 wt%, resulting in a remarkable improvement in electrical and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite. The exceptionally low electrical percolation threshold of 0. 078 %, as well as 21 -fold and 14 fold increases in tensile modulus and strength, respectively, have been attained thanks to the alignment of graphene nanosheets in the polymeric matrix. © 2011 Materials Research Society...|$|R
40|$|Latex is a {{colloidal}} {{dispersion of}} a polymer substance in an <b>aqueous</b> medium. <b>Latex</b> blends of natural rubber (NR) and several synthetic rubber latices (e. g. chloroprene rubber (CR), nitrile rubber (NBR), {{styrene butadiene rubber}} (SBR) etc.) have been used extensively for manufacturing various rubber products including foam rubber and gloves. In NRlNBR latex blend interfacial tension between NR and NBR is very high due to the differences in polarities of the two latices. Therefore the compatibility and hence the miscibility of NRlNBR latex blend is low. In this study {{an attempt was made}} to use CR latex as a compatibilizing agent in NRlNBR latex blends. Using FT-IR spectra it was found that addition of CR latex to NRlNBR latex blend has. caused a chemical shift. Hence the properties of NRlNBR latex blend and NRlCRlNBR latex blend were studied. It was found that the tensile strength ofNRlCRlNBR latex blend is greater than NRlNBR latex blend. Further the solubility parameter of CR latex was found to be between NR and NBR. Hence it was found that CR latex can be used to improve the strength and miscibility ofNRlNBR latex blends. The effect of addition of CR latex on other properties of NRlNBR latex blend (water extractable protein content and oil resistance) were studied and it was found that there was no adverse effect on those properties with the addition of CR latex to NRlNBR latex blend. Therefore it can be concluded that CR latex {{can be used as a}} suitable compatibilizing agent ~nNRlNBR latex blend...|$|R
