5|$|At {{the head}} of the {{principal}} staircase an <b>Anteroom</b> divides the former Great Chamber from what would have been the main bedroom. During the 19th century, this room was furnished as an armoury. The adjoining bedroom, the Garden Chamber, was used as a bedroom by Lord Curzon during the early 20th century, and as such was equipped with a plumbed bath hidden in a wardrobe, one of the few in the house.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, the {{painting}} was moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was displayed {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. The painting was hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war the painting was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 the painting has been {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like the painting to be shown. The painting is displayed in the <b>anteroom</b> of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. The painting was restored in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the <b>anteroom</b> to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E

25|$|The Shodaibunoma {{building}} {{was used as}} a waiting room for dignitaries on their official visits to the palace. They were ushered into three different <b>anterooms</b> according to their ranks.|$|R
5|$|As {{with the}} new keeps {{constructed}} in France, these Anglo-Norman designs were informed both by military thinking and by political drivers. The keep at Orford has been particularly extensively analysed in this regard, and although traditional explanations suggested that its unusual plan {{was the result of}} an experimental military design, more recent analysis concludes that the design was instead probably driven by political symbolism and the need for Henry to dominate the contested lands of East Anglia. The architecture would, for mid-12th century nobility, have summoned up images of King Arthur or Constantinople, then the idealised versions of royal and imperial power. Even formidable military designs such as that at Château Gaillard were built with political effect in mind. Gaillard was designed to reaffirm Angevin authority in a fiercely disputed conflict zone and the keep, although militarily impressive, contained only an <b>anteroom</b> and a royal audience chamber, and was built on soft chalk and without an internal well, both serious defects from a defensive perspective.|$|E

5|$|The palace, which {{housed the}} city's sheikh, {{had a large}} central room with two <b>anterooms,</b> each {{containing}} its own courtyard. A series of residential rooms were accessible from the main hall. There were also two additional courts, the audience court and the reception court, which were accessed through different gates.|$|R
25|$|The basic {{structure}} of present-day fire temples {{is always the}} same. There are no indigenous sources older than the 19th century that describe an Iranian fire temple (the 9th century theologian Manushchir observed {{that they had a}} standard floor plan, but what this might have been is unknown), and {{it is possible that the}} temples there today have features that are originally of Indian origin. (Stausberg, 2004:175,405) On entry one comes into a large space or hall where congregation (also non-religious) or special ceremonies may take place. Off to the side of this (or sometimes a floor level up or down) the devotee enters an <b>anteroom</b> smaller than the hall he/she has just passed through. Connected to this <b>anteroom,</b> or enclosed within it, but not visible from the hall, is the innermost sanctum (in Zoroastrian terminology, the atashgah, literally 'place of the fire' (Boyce, 1993:669-670) in which the actual fire-altar stands.|$|E

25|$|In {{the northernmost}} of the wings that project {{from both sides}} of the central block, is a dining room and a billiard room {{separated}} by a marble <b>anteroom</b> backed, on the service side, by a butler's pantry with two dumbwaiters. These communicate with the all-but-subterranean kitchens below which were lit, invisibly, from the sunken service yard on the north side of the house. The main entrance, on the opposite south wing, is through a vestibule where the exterior Ionic order is carried inside, now suitably enriched, under an emphatic cornice that divides the height 2:3.|$|E
25|$|Paneled {{wooden doors}} open into an <b>anteroom,</b> from which another set, flanked by single wooden doors that {{correspond}} to the side aisles, lead to the sanctuary. The high and narrow nave has an arcade; the chancel is even narrower. Flooring is wood beneath the pews and stone elsewhere. All interior furnishings are of white oak. Windows are set with stained glass. The ceiling is framed in Douglas fir, solid except for the trusses, made of curved and straight members bolted together. Half-timbers form a crossing pattern on the ceiling. There are 32 stained glass windows.|$|E
25|$|At 17:00 on 24 July 1943 the 28 {{members of}} the Grand Council met around a massive U-shaped table in the parrot room (the <b>anteroom</b> of the globe saloon, the office of Mussolini) in Palazzo Venezia. The Duce’s seat was a high chair, and his table was {{decorated}} with a red drape with the fasces. From the ceiling was hanging an enormous wrought iron luster. The walls were decorated with blue velvet tapestries and large paintings, and in the marble floor were etched inscriptions with {{the date of the}} restoration, Year VII of the Fascist calendar.|$|E
50|$|The Hospital {{comprises}} the medieval Chapel of St James the Great, living quarters (including the Master's House), a Guildhall (with <b>anterooms)</b> and a Great Hall.

The surrounding grounds are separately listed.|$|R
50|$|In the {{basement}} was a lunch room, 900 lockers {{and to the}} rear of the building, a gym. Over the gym on the second floor level was the assembly hall which could seat 1,000. At the front there was a stage and two <b>anterooms</b> and at the rear a large balcony. Arched timbers were exposed in the ceiling.|$|R

25|$|When Orfila arrived, {{he insisted}} that the local chemists witness his {{experiments}} that night. He used the same test materials and chemical reagents that they used in the earliest tests and performed the Marsh test in an <b>anteroom</b> of the courthouse, behind locked and guarded doors. At last, {{on the afternoon of}} the next day, Orfila entered the courtroom, followed by the three chemists with bowed heads. He declared that he had indeed found arsenic on the samples taken from the body of Lafarge, to the exclusion of all other extraneous sources, such as arsenic naturally occurring in the body, or from the reagents, or from the arsenic from the earth surrounding the coffin.|$|E
25|$|The earth {{inside the}} chamber {{contained}} numerous disarticulated human bones. Although the {{minimum number of}} individuals is as low as 27, the broken and mixed state of the remains suggests severe disturbance. Thus, {{it is possible that}} the number of persons buried here was originally higher. The discovery of an Urnfield period burial above the original depositions indicates that the destruction of the grave, disturbance of its contents and removal of the roof must have taken place before the 10th/9th century BC. Charcoal and ashes were found in a number of locations, especially with human remains near the doorstone and near the southwest terminal slab. None of the human bones showed signs of burning. There was a continuous ash layer in the centre of the <b>anteroom.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} stages of the war, Russia endured heavy losses at the Masurian Lakes and Tannenberg and it was to the Winter Palace that many of the wounded returned. Rechristened the Tsarevich Alexey Nikolayevich Hospital, from October 1915, the palace was a fully {{equipped}} hospital, its staterooms transformed into hospital wards. The Fieldmarshals' Hall became a dressing station, the Armorial Hall an operating theatre. The small throne room became a doctor's mess room, while more lowly staff were accommodated in the Nicholas Hall and the <b>Anteroom.</b> Nurses were housed in the more intimate apartments once reserved for members of the extended Romanov family. The 1812 Gallery became a store room, the vestibule of the Jordan staircase the hospital's canteen, and its landings offices.|$|E
2500|$|Although no Halaf {{settlement}} {{has been}} extensively excavated some buildings have been excavated: the tholoi of Tell Arpachiyah, circular domed structures approached through long rectangular <b>anterooms.</b> [...] Only {{a few of these}} structures were ever excavated. They were constructed of mud-brick sometimes on stone foundations and may have been for ritual use (one contained a large number of female figurines). Other circular buildings were probably just houses.|$|R
60|$|His blood set {{toward his}} heart with tremulous action. His eyes glowed with zeal {{like that of}} the Middle Ages. He saw the people united once more in this desecrated hall.

50|$|Very large tea houses {{may have}} several tea rooms of {{different}} sizes; a large, well-equipped mizuya resembling a modern kitchen; a large waiting room for guests; a welcoming area where guests are greeted and can remove and store their shoes; separate toilets {{for men and}} women; a changing room; a storage room; and possibly several <b>anterooms</b> {{as well as a}} garden with a roji path, an outdoor waiting area for guests and one or more privies.|$|R
25|$|The rock cave {{shrine of}} Seokguram {{is located on}} the crest of Mt. Toham. It was built by the same master {{architect}} of Bulguksa Temple, and built around the same era. This cave shrine was artificially and skillfully constructed with granite blocks and covered with an earth mound on top to give the appearance of a natural landscape. The shrine boasts a rectangular <b>anteroom</b> lined with large stone slabs carved with the figures of the protectors of Buddhism {{on each side of the}} walls and at the entrance passageway to the main chamber. The circular main chamber covered by an elegant dome ceiling and surrounded by carved stone wall panels depicting Boddhisattvas and the ten disciples. The graceful statue of Buddha on a lotus pedestal in the center is the dominant feature of the chamber.|$|E
25|$|Only priests {{attached}} to a fire temple may enter the innermost sanctum itself, which is closed {{on at least one}} side and has a double domed roof. The double dome has vents to allow the smoke to escape, but the vents of the outer dome are offset from those of the inner, so preventing debris or rain from entering the inner sanctum. The sanctum is separated from the <b>anteroom</b> by dividers (or walls with very large openings) and is slightly raised with respect to the space around it. The wall(s) of the inner sanctum are almost always tiled or of marble, but are otherwise undecorated. There are no lights – other than that of the fire itself – in the inner sanctum. In Indian-Zoroastrian (not evident in the modern buildings in Iran) tradition the temples are often designed such that direct sunlight does not enter the sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to outstanding artwork, Number 10 contains many exceptional {{pieces of furniture}} either owned by the house or on loan. One {{of the most striking}} and unusual is the Chippendale hooded guard's chair already mentioned that sits {{in a corner of the}} entrance hall. To its left is a long case clock by Benson of Whitehaven. A similar clock by Samuel Whichcote of London stands in the Cabinet <b>anteroom.</b> The White State Drawing Room contains elegant Adams furniture. The Green State Drawing Room contains mostly Chippendale furniture including a card table that belonged to Clive of India and a mahogany desk that is thought to have belonged to William Pitt the Younger and used by him during the Napoleonic Wars. In {{addition to}} the large carpet previously described, the Pillared State Drawing Room also contains a marble-topped table by Kent. The State Dining Room contains an elegant mahogany sideboard by Adam.|$|E
5000|$|When completed, Carlton House was {{approximately}} 202 ft long, and 130 ft deep. Visitors {{entered the house}} through a hexastyle portico of Corinthian columns {{that led to a}} foyer that was flanked on either side by <b>anterooms.</b> Carlton House was unusual in that the visitor entered the house on the main floor. (Most London mansions and palaces of the time followed the Palladian architectural concept of a low ground floor (or rustic) with the principal floor above.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is entered {{through the south}} side through two separate doorways, each with Corinthian columns distyle in antis, thus immediately establishing symmetry within the plan of the structure. The doorways open into bench-lined vestibules leading to <b>anterooms</b> that open directly onto the southern portico. Between the two <b>anterooms</b> is a long, shallow hall lined with benches and faced with Ionic columns. This room is identified as the apodyterion, or undressing room, a space that {{would need to be}} close to the main entrance and have room for athletes and friends to meet. Directly across from the apodyterion, along {{the north side of the}} palaestra is the ephebion, or clubroom. This large, colonnaded hall is deeper than the apodyterion but does not run the entire length of the courtyard. The entire north side of the palaestra has deep rooms, a feature mentioned by Vitruvius, which offered shelter from the sun. Also in the north side of the {{building is}} a doorway that leads directly into the rest of the adjoining gymnasium space. The room in the northeast corner of the palaestra is identified as a bathroom. The brick-lined, 4 meter square and 1.38 meter deep tank found here is dated to the Roman period, however.|$|R
5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} {{wells and}} washing facilities, {{which would have}} been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the call to prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with <b>anterooms</b> flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca.|$|R
