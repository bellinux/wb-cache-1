5|$|Hurricane Edouard was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} in the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season, reaching winds of 145mph (230km/h) on its path. Edouard remained a major hurricane for eight days, an unusually long amount of time. A Cape Verde-type hurricane, the storm formed near the coast of Africa {{in the middle of}} August. It moved westward then curved northward, and persisted until early September when it became extratropical to the southeast of New England. Edouard was originally forecast to strike the northeast United States, but it produced hurricane-force gusts to portions of southeastern Massachusetts while remaining offshore. The winds caused minor damage totaling $20million. In addition, the hurricane generated strong waves <b>and</b> <b>rip</b> currents to coastlines, killing two people in Ocean City, Md and causing numerous injuries.|$|E
5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} preceding {{the development of}} Bertha produced rough surf <b>and</b> <b>rip</b> currents along the Florida coastline. In Perdido Key State Recreation Area, two children were swimming in an unguarded area when they swept away by the currents. Their grandfather attempted to rescue them, but drowned in the rough waters. Another family rescued the two children. The large circulation of Bertha produced light rainfall across Florida, with Pensacola and Destin reporting 2.75inches. Extreme southern portions of Alabama received over 3inches (75mm) of rain from the storm, while western Dauphin Island reported over 5inches (125mm).|$|E
5|$|The non-tropical {{low that}} absorbed Nicholas dropped locally heavy {{rainfall}} across the Bahamas and southern Florida, {{as well as}} in portions of the northern Gulf Coast. Gusty winds from the low produced heavy surf <b>and</b> <b>rip</b> currents along the east and west coast of Florida, and a wind gust of 35mph (55km/h) was recorded in Cape Canaveral as a rainband from the system moved ashore. The low also resulted in two to four foot (0.6 to 1.2m) swells along the East Coast of the United States. Overall, no damage or deaths were associated with Nicholas or the low that absorbed it.|$|E
