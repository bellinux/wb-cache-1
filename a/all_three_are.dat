5|$|Islamic {{geometric}} patterns {{derived from}} simpler designs used in earlier cultures: Greek, Roman, and Sasanian. They {{are one of}} three forms of Islamic decoration, the others being the arabesque based on curving and branching plant forms, and Islamic calligraphy; <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> frequently used together. Geometric designs and arabesques are forms of Islamic interlace patterns.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> part of {{the genus}} Oecomys, which {{includes}} about fifteen species distributed in rainforest habitats in South America and into southern Central America. Oecomys {{is one of the}} genera of the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels is classified in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research. <b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> thought to have diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E

5|$|Fossils of Argentinean ferugliotheriids {{come from}} the Los Alamitos (Ferugliotherium), La Colonia (Ferugliotherium and Argentodites), and Allen Formations (Trapalcotherium). <b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> {{approximately}} the same age, dating to the Campanian (84–71mya) or more likely the Maastrichtian (71–66mya), but the La Colonia Formation is perhaps a little younger. The Los Alamitos and Allen Formations may have been deposited in a marshy environments, and the depositional environment of the La Colonia Formations {{may have been an}} estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain.|$|E
5|$|In concert bands, {{clarinets}} are {{an important}} part of the instrumentation. The E clarinet, B clarinet, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and contra-alto/contrabass clarinet are commonly used in concert bands. Concert bands generally have multiple B clarinets; there are commonly 3 B clarinet parts with 2–3 players per part. There is generally only one player per part on the other clarinets. There are not always E clarinet, alto clarinet, and contra-alto clarinets/contrabass clarinet parts in concert band music, but <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> quite common.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{near the}} {{boundary}} with Ophiuchus are Zeta, Nu, and Omicron Serpentis. <b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> 4th-magnitude main-sequence stars, with Nu and Omicron being of spectral type A and Zeta being of spectral type F. Nu {{is a single}} star with a 9th-magnitude visual companion, while Omicron is a Delta Scuti variable with amplitude variations of 0.01 magnitudes. In 1909, the symbiotic nova RT Serpentis appeared near Omicron, although it only reached a maximum magnitude of 10.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota is {{represented}} {{at the federal}} level by Senator John Thune, Senator Mike Rounds, and Representative Kristi Noem. <b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> Republicans. South Dakota is one of seven states with only one seat in the US House of Representatives. In United States presidential elections, South Dakota is allotted three of 538 votes in the Electoral College. As in all other states except Maine and neighboring Nebraska, South Dakota's electoral votes are granted in a winner-take-all system.|$|E
5|$|The Georgian scripts are {{the three}} writing systems used to write the Georgian language: Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli. Although the systems differ in appearance, <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> unicase, their letters share the same names and {{alphabetical}} order, and are written horizontally from left to right. Of the three scripts, Mkhedruli was once the civilian royal script of the Kingdom of Georgia mostly used for the royal charters {{and is now the}} standard script for modern Georgian and its related Kartvelian languages, whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only in ceremonial religious texts and iconography by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{other three}} species are {{classified}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The populations of <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> large, {{with that of}} the magnificent frigatebird thought to be increasing, while the great and lesser frigatebird decreasing. Monitoring populations of all species is difficult due to their movements across the open ocean and low reproductivity. The status of the Atlantic populations of the great and lesser frigatebirds are unknown and possibly extinct.|$|E

5|$|The three Group 4 {{elements}} that occur naturally are titanium, zirconium and hafnium. The first {{three members of}} the group share similar properties; <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> hard refractory metals under standard conditions. However, the fourth element rutherfordium (Rf), has been synthesized in the laboratory; none of its isotopes have been found occurring in nature. All isotopes of rutherfordium are radioactive. So far, no experiments in a supercollider have been conducted to synthesize the next member of the group, unpenthexium (Uph, element 156), and it is unlikely that they will be synthesized in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the word}} atom {{originally}} denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom {{is composed of}} various subatomic particles. The constituent particles of an atom are the electron, the proton and the neutron; <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> fermions. However, the hydrogen-1 atom has no neutrons and the hydron ion has no electrons.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the Galapagos {{sea lion}} and Japanese sea lion were {{classified}} as subspecies of the California sea lion. However, a genetic study in 2007 found that <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> in fact separate species. The lineages of the California and Japanese sea lion appear to have split off 2.2 million years ago during the Pliocene. The California sea lion differs from the Galapagos sea lion in its greater sexual dimorphism. The Steller sea lion is the closest extant relative of the Zalophus sea lions, being a sister taxon.|$|E

Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, and Max Kellerman {{comprise}} the ringside broadcast team (<b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> commentators for HBO Boxing). Sportswriters such as Bert Sugar, Bernard Fernandez and Steve Springer also appear. As for actual boxers, Mike Tyson (who had retired by the film's release) makes a cameo appearance, taunting Dixon as the fighter enters the ring. Lou DiBella, a real-life boxing promoter, portrays himself as Dixon's promoter. Several of ESPN's personalities also portray themselves. SportsCenter anchor Brian Kenny {{is the host}} of the fictional Then and Now series, while Cold Pizza and 1st and 10 hosts Jay Crawford, Dana Jacobson, Skip Bayless, and Woody Paige also appear. Ring announcer Michael Buffer appeared as himself, as did referee Joe Cortez.|$|E
5|$|Alice and Meg have {{received}} Falstaff's letters. They compare them, {{see that they}} are identical and, together with Mistress Quickly and Nannetta Ford, resolve to punish Falstaff. Meanwhile, Ford has been warned of the letters by Bardolfo and Pistola. <b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> thirsty for revenge and are supported by Dr Caius and Fenton, a young gentleman. To Ford's disapproval, Fenton is in love with Nannetta. Finding a moment to be alone, the young lovers exchange banter. They are interrupted by the return of Alice, Meg and Mistress Quickly. The act ends with an ensemble in which the women and the men separately plan revenge on Falstaff.|$|E
5|$|By 1685 Ville Marie {{was home}} to some 600 colonists, most of them living in modest wooden houses. Ville Marie became a centre for the fur trade and a base for further exploration. In 1689 the English-allied Iroquois {{attacked}} Lachine on the Island of Montreal, committing the worst massacre {{in the history of}} New France. By the early 18th century, the Sulpician Order was established there. To encourage French settlement, they wanted the Mohawk {{to move away from the}} fur trading post at Ville Marie. They had a mission village, known as Kahnewake, south of the St Lawrence River. The fathers persuaded some Mohawk to make a new settlement at their former hunting grounds north of the Ottawa River. This became Kanesatake. In 1745 several Mohawk families moved upriver to create another settlement, known as Akwesasne. <b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>are</b> now Mohawk reserves in Canada. The Canadian territory was ruled as a French colony until 1760, when it was surrendered to Great Britain after the Seven Years' War.|$|E
