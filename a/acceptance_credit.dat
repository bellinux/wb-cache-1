2500|$|As far as {{industry}} and agriculture were concerned, the trends that {{were set in}} motion in the transitional period after 1670 continued unabated. The Dutch economy remained a high-real-wage and high-tax economy, which discouraged investment in labor-intensive pursuits. This caused a decline of labor-intensive industries, like the textile industry, and of capital-goods industries like shipbuilding (both suffering {{from a lack of}} innovation also, which made it even more difficult to conquer foreign markets). That decline was only partially compensated by the growth of industries requiring proximity to ports, or large inputs of skilled labor (which was still in abundant supply) and fixed capital. The agricultural sector, faced with the same pressures, specialized in two directions: less labor-intensive livestock raising on the one hand, and very labor-intensive industrial crop production on the other. Trade shifted from the intra-European [...] "mother trade" [...] serving the Baltic and the Mediterranean to intercontinental trade (colonial wares) and distribution to the German hinterland (which was now a rising market again, after finally recovering from the ravages of the Thirty Years' War). Trade changed in other respects also: shipping became more of a service industry, offering shipping services to merchants of other countries.

2500|$|The German–Soviet Credit Agreement (also {{referred}} to as the German–Soviet Trade and Credit Agreement) [...] was an economic arrangement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany whereby Soviet Union received an [...] <b>acceptance</b> <b>credit</b> of 200 million Reichsmark. over 7 years with an effective interest rate of 4.5 percent. The credit line was to be used during the next two years for purchase of capital goods (factory equipment, installations, machinery and machine tools, ships, vehicles, and other means of transport) in Germany [...] and was to be paid off by means of [...] Soviet material shipment from 1946 onwards. The economic agreement was the first step toward improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and Germany. The next day after the Credit Agreement, the Soviet Union went to war against Japan, in a successful four-week military campaign in the Far East. The Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed four days after the Credit Agreement. The 1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement renewed declined Nazi–Soviet economic relations and was adjusted and expanded with the larger German–Soviet Commercial Agreement in February 1940 and January 1941 German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement. German shipments to the Soviets became tardy and failed to provide all that was promised the closer the date of Barbarossa came. The Soviets fulfilled their obligations to the letter right up until the invasion, wanting to avoid provoking Germany. All these agreements were terminated when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, in violation of the treaties between the two countries. Soviet trade with Germany in the pre-invasion period ended up providing the Germans with many of the resources they needed for their invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E

50|$|Banks {{may also}} create an <b>acceptance</b> <b>credit</b> {{facility}} allowing {{a company to}} issue time drafts not linked to specific shipments {{in order to provide}} general working capital finance. Under the arrangement the issuing company presents bills of exchange to the bank for acceptance, confirmation and sale at a discount to face value (representing the finance cost until maturity). The discounted sum is made available to the issuing company until the bill's maturity when it is obliged to repay the bill's full face value to the bank. The process may then be repeated to provide a so-called rolling facility.

50|$|The great {{import of}} this episode {{is that it}} shows that {{by this time the}} capital market had become truly international, not only for {{long-term}} bonds, but now also for short-term capital. Financial crises easily propagated because of this. Examples are the crisis of 1763, {{after the end of the}} Seven Years' War in which the Netherlands had remained neutral, occasioned a collapse of commodity prices, and debasements of the currency in Eastern Europe disrupted the bullion trade. Some Amsterdam accepting houses became overextended and failed as a consequence. This caused a brief credit crunch. Ten years later the bursting of a speculative bubble in British-East-India-Company stock, and a simultaneous default of Surinam planters, forced Dutch merchant bankers to liquidate their positions. As a result, <b>acceptance</b> <b>credit</b> evaporated temporarily, causing another credit crunch which brought down a number of venerable banking houses. This time a short-lived Fonds tot maintien van publiek crediet (a kind of bank of last resort) was erected by the city of Amsterdam, but dissolved again after the crisis abated. This experiment was repeated a few times during the crises of the end of the century, but equally without lasting results. The need for them was probably less than abroad, because the Dutch citizens were still extremely liquid, and possessed large cash hoards that obviated the need for a lender of last resort. Besides, the by then extremely conservative Dutch financial community feared that a paper currency beside the metal currency would undermine confidence in the Amsterdam capital market.|$|E
50|$|The {{financial}} {{history of the}} Dutch Republic involves the interrelated development of financial institutions in the Dutch Republic. The rapid economic development of the country after the Dutch Revolt in the years 1585 - 1620 accompanied by an equally rapid accumulation of a large fund of savings, created the need to invest those savings profitably. The Dutch financial sector, both in its public and private components, came to provide {{a wide range of}} modern investment products beside the possibility of (re-)investment in trade and industry, and in infrastructure projects. Such products were the public bonds, floated by the Dutch governments on a national, provincial, and municipal level; <b>acceptance</b> <b>credit</b> and commission trade; marine and other insurance products; and shares of publicly traded companies like the Dutch East India Company (VOC), and their derivatives. Institutions like the Amsterdam stock exchange, the Bank of Amsterdam, and the merchant bankers helped to mediate this investment. In the course of time the invested capital stock generated its own income stream that (because of the high propensity to save of the Dutch capitalists) caused the capital stock to assume enormous proportions. As {{by the end of the}} 17th century structural problems in the Dutch economy precluded profitable investment of this capital in domestic Dutch sectors, the stream of investments was redirected more and more to investment abroad, both in sovereign debt and foreign stocks, bonds and infrastructure. The Netherlands came to dominate the international capital market up to the crises of the end of the 18th century that caused the demise of the Dutch Republic.|$|E

This course of action includes in particular the installation of a centralized clearing entity and with this the obligation to clear all relevant financial derivatives.

By focusing on relevant attributes that have been identified, {{it is believed that}} credit card issuing banks can position themselves effectively via their marketing strategies to activate their existing cardholders' usage rate as well as to attract new active cardholders. Thirteen important attributes were used to measure credit cardholders' attitude. These attributes include <b>acceptance</b> level, <b>credit</b> limit, interest-free repayment period, annual fee, application approval period, ancillary functions, handling of cardholders' complaints, issuing bank image, gift/bonus to new applicants, card design, leaflet to describe the card,and advertising by the issuing bank. <b>Acceptance</b> level, <b>credit</b> limit, interest free repayment period, ancillary functions, handling of cardholders' complaints, bank image, and bank advertising were found {{to be the most important}} attributes that influenced cardholders' attitudes in distinguishing active from inactive cardholders.

The firm became once again one of London's leading advisory and corporate finance businesses with a new emphasis on mergers and acquisitions in which it gained a reputation for innovation and daring, surprising for what was regarded as such a traditional firm. Banking business to date had largely been based on providing short-term finance to companies {{through the medium of}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>credits</b> - the process of guaranteeing repayment of companies' bills of exchange by way of the bank, for a fee or commission, providing their countersignature ("acceptance") so that the bills would secure the finest interest rate for the company when sold to the market.

In asset management the small private client team was transformed into a predominantly institutional investment division, becoming one of the leading London-based asset managers.
