5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch <b>Awe</b> <b>and</b> Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of <b>awe</b> <b>and</b> wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of the focus á with the demonstratives gives the frequently used particles áyá and <b>áwé,</b> <b>and</b> the less common áhé and áyú. Combination of the interrogative ágé with the demonstratives gives the confirmative particles ákwé and ákyá (ák-hé and ákyú are uncommon), used to elicit a yes/no response from the listener.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th {{century the}} MacSweens {{controlled}} lands across central Argyll, extending {{as far north}} as Loch <b>Awe</b> <b>and</b> as far south as Loch Fyne. Their principal seats included Lochranza Castle on the Isle of Arran, Skipness Castle and Castle Sween at Knapdale, which may be Scotland's oldest surviving stone-built castle.|$|E

25|$|Draestail was in {{the form}} of vampire ash in a box that was given to Deshwitat. Using Remi's blood he was brought back to life to help train Deshwitat for his battle against Kalutika and for the Lord of the Vampires tournament. He is a lecherous but crafty old man, to Eiji's <b>awe</b> <b>and</b> Deshwhitat's disgust.|$|E
25|$|When Mack {{resigned}} as manager, he largely withdrew from active {{control of the}} team. Over the next five years, the team crumbled {{to the bottom of}} the American League. Although reduced to a figurehead, Mack continued to be treated with <b>awe</b> <b>and</b> reverence by players who considered him living history. His sons handled his correspondence by 1953 as he had become too frail by that point to do it himself.|$|E
25|$|The Toltec were {{skilled in}} battle, ferocious and highly trained. A {{standing}} army, garrisons, forts and reserve units comprised a formidable weapon against inhabitants of regions coveted by the Toltec and against enemies. Because of their skill and their bravery in battle, the Toltec {{were able to}} instill enough <b>awe</b> <b>and</b> respect among their neighbors that cities such as Tula could be built without heavy defenses incorporated into their design.|$|E

25|$|The flying man – This man was Ultima’s {{teacher and}} was also known as el hombre volador. He gave her the owl that became her spirit familiar, her guardian, and her soul.

25|$|The Kabbalists {{considered}} the tallit {{as a special}} garment for the service of God, intended, {{in connection with the}} tefillin, to inspire <b>awe</b> <b>and</b> reverence for God at prayer. The tallit gadol is worn by worshipers at the morning prayer on weekdays, Shabbat, and holy days; by the hazzan (cantor) at every prayer while before the ark; and by the reader of Torah, as well as by all other functionaries during the Torah reading.|$|E
25|$|Native American tribes whose territories {{overlapped}} {{with those}} of grizzly bears often viewed them {{with a mixture of}} <b>awe</b> <b>and</b> fear. North American brown bears were so feared by the Natives that they were rarely hunted, especially alone. When Natives hunted grizzlies, the act was done with the same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare, and was never done except with a company of 4 to 10 warriors. The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian Indians actively avoided prime bear habitat, and would not allow their young men to hunt alone, for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American west wrote of Natives or voyagers with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes due to attacks from grizzlies. Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately 1 per year during the 1930s through the 1950s, though it increased to 4 per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to 1 injury every 2 years (0.5/year) during the 1970s. Between 1980-2002, there were only 2 grizzly bear-caused human injuries in a developed area. However, although grizzly attacks were rare in the back-country before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately 1 per year during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Starflight {{has also}} {{received}} favorable reviews from critics and commentators decades after its release. [...] Erin Hoffman of The Escapist in 2010 called it [...] "one {{of the great}} breakthroughs in gaming". In 2012, Lee Hutchinson of Ars Technica called the game [...] "a thing of <b>awe</b> <b>and</b> reverence" [...] and said it [...] "defined the genre of space exploration games".|$|E
500|$|High praise {{was given}} to the film's visual effects, musical score, and Spielberg's direction, {{although}} there was some criticism leveled at the script and departures from the book. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave the film a [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] rating of 93%, based on 116 reviews, with a rating average score of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Jurassic Park is a spectacle of special effects and life-like animatronics, with some of Spielberg's best sequences of sustained <b>awe</b> <b>and</b> sheer terror since Jaws." [...] Metacritic gave the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews".|$|E
500|$|In another review at the SF Site, Greg L. Johnson {{wrote that}} while City at the End of Time {{provides}} plenty of [...] "wonder, <b>awe,</b> <b>and</b> {{a sense of}} humanity {{in the face of}} an implacable universe", he feels that Bear does not quite succeed with this ambitious story of the fate of reality and the universe at large. Johnson described it as [...] "an immensely complicated story" [...] that unfolds by means of [...] "hints and allusions". He said that even the book's ending only hints at what the gathered role players had achieved. Johnson wrote that while Bear's depictions of events on a grand scale, like the decay of Seattle, are good, his portrayal of the key players against this backdrop is not as strong.|$|E
50|$|Musgrave is <b>awed</b> <b>and</b> {{amazed by}} life in Ionia, and quickly becomes a convert to its values. He leaves {{the country after}} a stay of several months, though; he is {{determined}} to bring Ionian advances to England {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|R
