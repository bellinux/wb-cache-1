5000|$|The {{traditional}} DES-based crypt algorithm {{was originally}} chosen because DES was resistant to key recovery {{even in the}} face of [...] "known plaintext" [...] attacks, and because it was computationally expensive. On the earliest Unix machines it took over a full second to compute a password hash. This also made it reasonably resistant to dictionary attacks in that era. At that time password hashes were commonly stored in an <b>account</b> <b>file</b> (...) which was readable to anyone on the system. (This <b>account</b> <b>file</b> was also used to map user ID numbers into names, and user names into full names, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the three}} decades since that time, {{computers}} have become vastly more powerful. Moore's Law has generally held true, so the computer speed and capacity {{available for a}} given financial investment has doubled over 20 times since Unix was first written. This has long since left the DES-based algorithm vulnerable to dictionary attacks, and Unix and Unix-like systems such as Linux have used [...] "shadow" [...] files for a long time, migrating just the password hash values out of the <b>account</b> <b>file</b> (...) and into a file (conventionally named [...] ) {{which can only be}} read by privileged processes.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{challenge in}} improving the file system performance is to design effective block replacement algorithms to minimize buffer cache misses. Despite the well-known interactions between prefetching and caching, almost all buffer cache replacement algorithms have been proposed and studied comparatively without taking into <b>account</b> <b>file</b> system prefetching which exists in all modern operating systems. This paper shows that such kernel prefetching can {{have a significant impact}} on the relative performance in terms of the number of actual disk I/Os of many well-known replacement algorithms; it can not only narrow the performance gap but also change the relative performance benefits of different algorithms. These results demonstrate the importance for buffer caching research to take file system prefetching into consideration...|$|E
40|$|In a path-breaking paper {{last year}} Pat and Betty O'Neil and Gerhard Weikum {{proposed}} a self-tuning improvement to the Least Recently Used (LRU) buffer management algorithm[15]. Their improvement is called LRU/k and advocates giving priority to buffer pages {{based on the}} kth most recent access. (The standard LRU algorithm is denoted LRU/ 1 according to this terminology.) If P 1 's kth most recent access is more more recent than P 2 's, then P 1 will be replaced after P 2. Intuitively, LRU/k for k ? 1 is a good strategy, because it gives low priority to pages that have been scanned or to pages that belong to a big randomly accessed file (e. g., the <b>account</b> <b>file</b> in TPC/A). They found that LRU/ 2 achieves most of the advantage of their method. The one problem of LRU/ 2 is the processor Supported by U. S.

40|$|AbstractReplication is {{one common}} way to {{effectively}} address challenges {{for improving the}} data management in data grids. It has attracted {{a lot of work}} and many replication strategies have therefore been proposed. Most of these strategies consider a single file-based granularity and do not take into <b>account</b> <b>file</b> access patterns or possible file correlations. However, file correlations become an increasingly important consideration for performance enhancement in data grids. In this regard, the knowledge about file correlations can be extracted from historical and operational data using the techniques of the data mining field. Data mining techniques have proved to offer a powerful tool facilitating the extraction of meaningful knowledge from large data sets. As a consequence of the convergence of data mining and data grid, mining grid data is an interesting research field which aims at analyzing grid systems with data mining techniques in order to efficiently discover new meaningful knowledge to enhance data management in data grids. More precisely, in this paper, the extracted knowledge is used to enhance replica management. Gaps in the current literature and opportunities for further research are presented. In addition, we propose a new guideline to data mining application in the context of data grid replication strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey mainly dedicated to data grid replication strategies based on data mining techniques...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} the design, programming, {{implementation}} and presentation of on-line business applications for IBM's On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) system called Customer Information Control System (CICS). According to the book “Designing and Programming CICS Applications ” ([HOR 00]) published by John Horswill we explain two out of many feasible procedures to present the functionality of CICS resp. CICS business applications. As the main result, we create for each of both procedures a business application representing a little clip of a bank customer account program. These applications access a database-like file stored on an Operating System/ 390 (OS/ 390) server to create, read, update, and delete customer accounts. Both use CICS {{not only as a}} transaction processing system but also as an application server that manages business applications 24 hours a day for 7 days a week. The difference between the two business applications are the data transfer and information display methods. The first procedure describes how to create a business application that uses the legacy 3270 Interface to inquire a customer record stored on the OS/ 390 -server and how to display the information on a 3270 terminal screen (also called as the green screen). In contrast, the second business application uses Message Queuing (MQ) provided by IBM's Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) product MQSeries to transfer the request data to and the response data from the customer <b>account</b> <b>file</b> between CICS and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
