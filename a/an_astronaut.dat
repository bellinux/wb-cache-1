5|$|At {{the time}} of Kennedy's proposal, only one American had flown in space—less than a month earlier—and NASA had not yet sent <b>an</b> <b>astronaut</b> into orbit. Even some NASA {{employees}} doubted whether Kennedy's ambitious goal could be met. By 1963, Kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint US-USSR Moon mission, to eliminate duplication of effort.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher {{enrolled}} in the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, hoping that a medical degree, along with a military background, would earn him a civilian spot on a space mission.

During and after Scott's year-long mission, the brothers were studied to find physical differences caused by living in space versus a baseline on Earth.|$|E
5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that <b>an</b> <b>astronaut</b> could only do so much, particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
