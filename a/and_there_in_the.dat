25|$|It is {{said that}} in a soy sauce shop long ago, in Totsuka-juku of the 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō (now Totsuka-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture), it {{sometimes}} happened that napkins would disappear in the night one by one. One night, when the proprietor of the soy sauce shop went out on a job, he heard some bustling music from {{a place where there}} should have been no people around. When he looked, there were several cats gathered, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center was a strange sight: the shopkeeper's pet cat, wearing a napkin on its head and dancing. That explained why his napkins had been going missing.|$|E
25|$|He wrote {{at length}} on {{the unity of}} judgment, on the {{different}} kinds of negation, and on the difference between unconditional and conditional necessity. In his doctrine of syllogisms he brought forward the proof for the conversion of universal affirmative judgments, differed from Aristotle here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laying down and arranging the modi of the syllogisms, partly in the proof of them, partly in the doctrine of mixture, i.e. of the influence of the modality of the premises upon the modality of the conclusion. Then, in two separate works, he dealt with the reduction of arguments to the syllogistic form and on the resolution of them; and further, with hypothetical conclusions. For the doctrine of proof, Galen quotes the second Analytic of Theophrastus, in conjunction with that of Aristotle, as the best treatises on that doctrine. In different monographs he seems to have tried to expand it into a general theory of science. To this, too, may have belonged the proposition quoted from his Topics, that the principles of opposites are themselves opposed, and cannot be deduced from one and the same higher genus. For the rest, some minor deviations from the Aristotelian definitions are quoted from the Topica of Theophrastus. Closely connected with this treatise was that upon ambiguous words or ideas, which, without doubt, corresponded to book Ε of Aristotle's Metaphysics.|$|E

2500|$|Science {{writers and}} skeptics have {{suggested}} that the evidence for Cayce's alleged psychic powers comes from contemporaneous newspaper articles, affidavits, anecdotes, testimonials, and books. Martin Gardner, for example, wrote that while Cayce's trances did happen, most of the information from his trances was derived from books that Cayce had been reading by authors such as Carl Jung, P. D. Ouspensky, and Helena Blavatsky. Gardner's hypothesis was that the trance readings of Cayce contain, [...] "little bits of information gleaned from here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> occult literature, spiced with occasional novelties from Cayce's unconscious." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Williamsport was {{established}} as {{the county seat}} it {{was little more than}} a few cabins spread here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned swampy areas. Jaysburg served as the de facto county seat for several years after Williamsport was [...] "officially" [...] named the seat of government for Lycoming County. This delay became a cause for concern to the residents of county and the state government in Philadelphia. The county commissioners delayed in constructing a courthouse and jail in Williamsport until 1799. The jail was finally opened in 1801. Next the commissioners approved the construction of the county courthouse in Williamsport. Construction also began in 1800 and work was completed in late 1804, nearly ten years after Williamsport was named the county seat.|$|E

2500|$|Pendelton {{and other}} rodeos {{cancelled}} celebrations {{because of the}} war. [...] With professional rodeo women cut from the picture, amateur cowgirls stepped in to fill the void. It was during this period that informal all-girl rodeos were held here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwest to provide entertainment for the troops. [...] In 1942, Fay Kirkwood staged what was billed as an all-girl rodeo in Bonham, Texas but the program was actually an exhibition rather than a competition. [...] Vaughn Kreig produced an all-girl rodeo {{about the same time}} with 8 of its 19 events listed as contests. Neither rodeos featured rodeo queens, perhaps as a general protest against the role of rodeo queens. [...] Cowgirls felt such contests deflected attention from the cowgirl athlete and focused it on the pretty daughters of local boosters instead. [...] Women's barrel racing at Madison Square Garden in 1942 led to that contest's acceptance in rodeo.|$|E
2500|$|From the 17th to the 18th centuries, {{the region}} was centre of contemplative {{religious}} orders who established convents in Sintra. But it remained a place of myths, with a large, mysterious forest and macabre, gloomy spaces. Father Baião, in his Portugal Cuidadoso (1724) noted: [...] "Next to the Palace of Sintra was a forest, so thick, that during the day, it cast fear in him who entered it. And [...] D. Sebastian was free from these fears,that he would walk at night,through it,many times {{for two or three}} hours." [...] Starting {{in the second half of}} the 18th century and lasting through the 19th century Sintra became known as a nostalgic and mysterious location described by many foreigners. It was the Romantic Lord Byron's Glorioso Eden; Almeida Garrett's pleasant resort; Eça de Queirós's [...] "nest of lovers [...] the romantic foliage, the nobles abandoned themselves in the hands of the poets"; [...] or the place where Richard Strauss saw a garden [...] "comparable to Italy, Sicily, Greece or Egypt, a true garden of Klingsor, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heights, a castle of the Holy Grail".|$|E
2500|$|When {{the time}} came {{that he should be}} brought out of Newgate to Smithfield, the place of his execution, Mr. Woodroofe, one of the sheriffs, first came to Mr. Rogers, and asked him if he would revoke his abominable doctrine, and the evil opinion of the Sacrament of the altar. Mr. Rogers answered, [...] "That which I have preached I will seal with my blood." [...] Then Mr. Woodroofe said, [...] "Thou art an heretic." [...] "That shall be known," [...] quoth Mr. Rogers, [...] "at the Day of Judgment." [...] "Well," [...] said Mr. Woodroofe, [...] "I will never pray for thee." [...] "But I will pray for you," [...] said Mr. Rogers; and so was brought the same day, the fourth of February, by the sheriffs, towards Smithfield, saying the Psalm Miserere by the way, all the people wonderfully rejoicing at his constancy; with great praises and thanks to God for the same. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of Mr. Rochester, comptroller of the queen's household, Sir Richard Southwell, both the sheriffs, and a great number of people, he was burnt to ashes, washing his hands in the flame as he was burning. A little before his burning, his pardon was brought, if he would have recanted; but he utterly refused it. He was the first martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in Queen Mary's time that gave the first adventure upon the fire. His wife and children, being eleven in number, ten able to go, and one sucking at her breast, met him by the way, as he went towards Smithfield. This sorrowful sight of his own flesh and blood could nothing move him, but that he constantly and cheerfully took his death with wonderful patience, in the defence and quarrel of the Gospel of Christ." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
