5|$|<b>A</b> <b>crater</b> named Anat {{provides}} the reference point for measuring longitude on Ganymede. By definition, Anat is at 128° longitude. The 0° longitude directly faces Jupiter, and unless stated otherwise longitude increases toward the west.|$|E
5|$|Glaciation {{took place}} around the volcano roughly 6700 years BP, carving out U-shaped valleys. At the {{southwest}} {{flank of the}} island, <b>a</b> <b>crater,</b> likely a maar, can be found amid an alluvial plain.|$|E
50|$|The {{depth of}} any <b>crater</b> in <b>a</b> solid planet or moon - {{whether it is}} <b>an</b> impact <b>crater,</b> <b>a</b> {{volcanic}} <b>crater,</b> or <b>a</b> subsidence <b>crater</b> - may be measured from the local surface {{to the bottom of}} the crater, or from the rim of the crater to the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Cartan is <b>a</b> small lunar <b>crater</b> {{near the}} eastern edge of the Moon. It lies just to the west of the larger Apollonius. The rim is {{circular}} with <b>a</b> tiny <b>crater</b> along the eastern side. The interior floor is about half the diameter of the <b>crater.</b> <b>A</b> smaller <b>crater</b> attached to the southern rim is also attached to the north rim of Apollonius H, forming <b>a</b> short <b>crater</b> chain.|$|R
50|$|Incahuasi has two <b>craters,</b> <b>a</b> summit <b>crater</b> and <b>an</b> arcuate <b>crater</b> on {{the eastern}} slope that {{contains}} a lava dome. The summit crater has dimensions of 750 x 900 m. Subsidiary vents conversely are associated with fissure vents.|$|R

5|$|Harvey was {{appointed}} to captain an Australian XI in a warm-up match against the touring Englishmen, indicating that the selectors were considering him for the Test captaincy. Harvey scored a duck and 38 and the Australians lost heavily by 345 runs on a wicket with <b>a</b> <b>crater.</b> Therefore, Benaud was made Australian captain ahead of Harvey.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 the Oval {{was bombed}} in the Belfast blitz, {{destroying}} both grandstands and leaving <b>a</b> <b>crater</b> in the pitch. As a result, {{the ground was}} flooded repeatedly by the Connswater River; the water pumps were insufficient to drain the pitch. Grosvenor Park {{was used as a}} temporary home for Glentoran, until August 1949. In 1953 the main grandstand was built.|$|E
5|$|The Amak Volcano has erupted {{three times}} in {{historical}} times: circa 2550 BC, from 1700–1710, and in 1796; {{the first of these}} events was identified with tephrochronology. Each eruption has been characterized by lava flows, and the two most recent eruptions included <b>a</b> <b>crater</b> eruption.|$|E

5|$|When set to {{fragmentation}} mode, the OF-530 projectile produced fragments which covered an area 70 meters {{wide and}} 30 meters deep. When set to high-explosive (HE) action, the exploding shell produced <b>a</b> <b>crater</b> about 3.5 meters {{in diameter and}} about 1.2 meters deep. Despite the D-1's withdrawal from service in the mid- 1970s, the OF-530 is still fired from modern 152mm ordnance pieces of the Russian Army.|$|E
5|$|For unarmored {{targets and}} shore bombardment, the 1,900lb (862kg) Mk.13 HC (High-Capacity—referring {{to the large}} {{bursting}} charge) shell was available. The Mk.13 shell would create <b>a</b> <b>crater</b> 50feet (15m) wide and 20feet (6m) deep upon impact and detonation, and could defoliate trees 400yards (360m) {{from the point of}} impact. Mk. 13 High Capacity shells that were made by manufacturers other than the Naval Gun Factory received the designation Mk. 14 HC, but were otherwise identical.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton is {{an impact}} crater that {{lies at the}} south pole of the Moon. The peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight, while the {{interior}} is perpetually in shadow (<b>a</b> <b>Crater</b> of eternal darkness). The low-temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the Moon. Measurements by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater, which may indicate the presence of water ice. The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton.|$|E

50|$|This is <b>a</b> worn <b>crater</b> {{formation}} {{with several}} small craters {{attached to the}} exterior of the rim. Lavoisier F is <b>a</b> distorted <b>crater</b> that shares <b>a</b> common rim along the southeastern side of Lavoisier. The southern rim is extended outward, and is overlaid by the small crater Lavoisier W. Lavoisier S is <b>a</b> worn <b>crater</b> that is attached to the northwestern rim. There are also a pair of small craters along the outer eastern rim. <b>A</b> small <b>crater</b> has incised <b>a</b> short section along the northern rim.|$|R
5|$|The crater was {{discovered}} by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who {{had been looking for}} petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was <b>a</b> <b>crater</b> and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|When war was declared, Waddington {{volunteered for}} Lord Kitchener's New Army, joining the Bradford Pals {{battalion}} of the West Yorkshire Regiment. On 1 July 1916, {{during the first}} day of the Battle of the Somme, Waddington was wounded by shrapnel at Serre, and took shelter in <b>a</b> <b>crater</b> in no man's land with other wounded soldiers. One of these was the Yorkshire cricketer Major Booth, who was mortally wounded. Waddington comforted Booth while the cricketer died in his arms, an experience which haunted Waddington for the rest of his life. After recovering, Waddington transferred to the Royal Flying Corps.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 57 {{people were}} killed directly, {{including}} innkeeper Harry R. Truman, photographers Reid Blackburn and Robert Landsburg, and geologist David A. Johnston. Hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland, causing over a billion U.S. dollars in damage ($3.03 billion in 2017 dollars), thousands of animals were killed, and Mount St. Helens was left with <b>a</b> <b>crater</b> on its north side. At {{the time of the}} eruption, the summit of the volcano was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, but afterward the land passed to the United States Forest Service. The area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.|$|E

5|$|At 10:03:11, near Indian Lake and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, {{the plane}} {{crashed into a}} field near a {{reclaimed}} coal strip mine known as the Diamond T. Mine owned by PBS Coals in Stonycreek Township in Somerset County. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the flight impacted at 563mph (906km/h, 252m/s, or 489 knots) at a 40-degree nose-down, inverted attitude. The impact left <b>a</b> <b>crater</b> eight to ten feet deep (c. 3m), and 30 to 50 feet wide (c. 12m). All 44 people on board died. Many media reports and eyewitness accounts said {{the time of the}} crash was 10:06 or 10:10; an initial analysis of seismographic data in the area concluded that the crash occurred at 10:06, but the 9/11 Commission report states that this analysis was not definitive and was retracted. Other media outlets and the 9/11 Commission reported the time of impact as 10:03, based on when the flight recorders stopped, analysis of radar data, infrared satellite data, and air traffic control transmissions.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact. Debate {{continues}} {{about how}} much ice is in a comet. In 2001, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the surface of Comet Borrelly. It {{was found that the}} surface of comet Borrelly is hot and dry, with a temperature of between , and extremely dark, suggesting that the ice has been removed by solar heating and maturation, or is hidden by the soot-like material that covers Borrelly. In July 2005, the Deep Impact probe blasted <b>a</b> <b>crater</b> on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form the coma of Tempel 1. Renamed EPOXI, it made a flyby of Comet Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{two men are}} {{haunted by}} the fate the girl will suffer and {{formulate}} a plan to rescue her. They break into the laboratory and free her from confinement, but the lab's alarms are triggered. The three escape in an armored truck and drive along a narrow suspended roadway over {{what appears to be}} a domed city built in <b>a</b> <b>crater.</b> Police hovercrafts are in pursuit, and one of them comes very low to the roadway to block the fugitives' truck. The roadway collapses when the protagonists try to force their way through, sending the truck plummeting. The winged girl refuses to let go of the hands of her rescuers, and the three of them fall into the abyss.|$|E
