5|$|Similarly, {{shift workers}} have {{difficulty}} maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours. Shift {{workers need to}} be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they <b>are</b> <b>sleeping.</b>|$|E

5|$|Red foxes may kill small mustelids like weasels, stone martens, pine martens, stoats, kolonoks, polecats {{and young}} sables. Eurasian badgers may live {{alongside}} red foxes in isolated sections of large burrows. It {{is possible that}} the two species tolerate each other out of mutualism; foxes provide badgers with food scraps, while badgers maintain the shared burrow's cleanliness. However, cases are known of badgers driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them. Wolverines may kill red foxes, often while the latter <b>are</b> <b>sleeping</b> or near carrion. Foxes in turn may kill unattended young wolverines.|$|E

5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they <b>are</b> <b>sleeping.</b> For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E
5|$|In the Rogue Cut version, Rogue's role is more consequential, and the {{narrative}} is more complex: When seeing Stryker causes Wolverine's consciousness to phase {{between past and}} future—resulting in his claws being extended, injuring Kitty Pryde—the Professor talks {{about the need for}} Wolverine to have more time back in 1973. Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the Professor's school, the one place where the Professor's mind can't reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. With the Professor and Magneto, he does so—at the cost of his own life—and Rogue is taken to where the mutants are making their last stand, where she takes over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels were able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand, which got stuck in the X-Jet after the Sentinel tried to prevent the Professor, Magneto and Rogue from escaping the incinerated remains of the X-Mansion. It also includes a scene where Mystique visits the X-Mansion at night while Charles and Logan <b>are</b> <b>sleeping.</b> She revisits her previous romance with Beast but leaves very early the next morning and breaks Cerebro in order to prevent Charles from finding her.|$|E

Colleen's real reason for visiting her son is that she learned from her friend in Florida that Jack is dating Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), a recent divorcée, {{and a woman who}} happens to be Jack's high school sweetheart. During dinner, Colleen does not bring Nancy up, but tells Jack she knows about his involvement with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) after an awkward encounter between Avery and Jack in an elevator with Colleen present; because of the encounter, Colleen knows that Avery and Jack <b>are</b> <b>sleeping</b> together.

25|$|Other Christians {{understand}} the soul as the life, {{and believe that}} the dead <b>are</b> <b>sleeping</b> (Christian conditionalism).

As a result, the repressed instincts, along with their associated emotions and memories, seep into consciousness when soldiers <b>are</b> <b>sleeping.</b> The result is night terrors.|$|E

25|$|In South Indian temples, often each {{god will}} have His or Her own shrine, each {{contained}} in a miniature house (specifically, a mandir). These shrines are often scattered around the temple compound, with the three main ones being in the main area.

Directly outside the main shrine {{there will be a}} statue of the god's vahana or vehicle. The shrines have curtains hung over the entrances, and wooden doors which are shut when the Deities <b>are</b> <b>sleeping.</b> Some South Indian temples have one main altar, with several statues placed upon it.|$|E

25|$|Dolomedes are nocturnal hunters, feeding when birds, {{their main}} predators, <b>are</b> <b>sleeping.</b> The method {{they use to}} fish for insects is {{to hold on to}} the shore with their back legs while the rest of their body lies on the water, with legs {{stretched}} out. Dolomedes species tend to be robust with thickset legs that allow them to tackle prey larger than themselves. They stretch out their front legs and wait, as if listening. Their front legs feel the vibrations carried on the water, just as other spiders feel the vibrations in a web. They are able to tell what is causing the vibrations that the water is carrying - to distinguish the drawn-out, erratic vibrations of a struggling insect from the one-off vibrations caused by falling leaves or the background noise of the wind or the flow of the water around rocks and other obstacles. As well as identifying the source of the vibrations, the spiders are also able to discern the distance to and direction of the source. To this end they have a range of vibration-detecting organs, including very sensitive hairs (trichobothria) on their legs and feet. Their eyes play a secondary role - experiments on related species show that touch is the main sense these spiders use to catch their prey. Their eyes are of little use for nocturnal hunting. These vibration detectors also serve to warn the spider of predators such as trout.|$|E
