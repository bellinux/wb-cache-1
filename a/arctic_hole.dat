Attention {{is given to the}} successive stages of particle nucleation, condensation/evaporation and sedimentation/coagulation phenomena, {{and the ways in which}} polar stratospheric clouds are observed. Considerable evidence exists that polar stratospheric cloud particles are composed of nitric acid.

40|$|Key to {{understanding}} the chlorine chemistry in the polar stratosphere is the measurement of polar stratospheric clouds, chlorine monoxide, and the reservoir gas chlorine nitrate. Chlorine nitrate has been measured by CLAES and chlorine monoxide by MLS. The CLAES and MLS measurements together help {{to show that the}} polar stratospheric clouds which form in the cold Arctic stratosphere have converted most of the chlorine nitrate into the radical chlorine monoxide. In 1992, UARS measurements showed conclusively that an an <b>Arctic</b> ozone <b>hole</b> is beginning to form.

40|$|Chemical ozone {{destruction}} occurs over both polar regions in local winter–spring. In the Antarctic, essentially complete removal of lower-stratospheric ozone currently {{results in an}} ozone hole every year, whereas in the Arctic, ozone loss is highly variable and has until now been much more limited. Here we demonstrate that chemical {{ozone destruction}} over the Arctic in early 2011 was—for {{the first time in}} the observational record—comparable to that in the Antarctic ozone hole. Unusually long-lasting cold conditions in the Arctic lower stratosphere led to persistent enhancement in ozone-destroying forms of chlorine and to unprecedented ozone loss, which exceeded 80 per cent over 18 – 20 kilometres altitude. Our results show that <b>Arctic</b> ozone <b>holes</b> are possible even with temperatures much milder than those in the Antarctic. We cannot at present predict when such severe Arctic ozone depletion may be matched or exceeded...|$|R
40|$|Chlorine- and bromine-containing ozone-depleting {{substances}} (ODSs) {{are controlled by}} the 1987 Montreal Protocol. In consequence, atmospheric equivalent chlorine peaked in 1993 and has been declining slowly since then. Consistent with this, models project a gradual {{increase in stratospheric ozone}} with the Antarctic ozone hole expected to disappear by [sim] 2050. However, we show that by 2013 the Montreal Protocol had already achieved significant benefits for the ozone layer. Using a 3 D atmospheric chemistry transport model, we demonstrate that much larger ozone depletion than observed has been avoided by the protocol, with beneficial impacts on surface ultraviolet. A deep <b>Arctic</b> ozone <b>hole,</b> with column values < 120 DU, would have occurred given meteorological conditions in 2011. The Antarctic ozone hole would have grown in size by 40 % by 2013, with enhanced loss at subpolar latitudes. The decline over northern hemisphere middle latitudes would have continued, more than doubling to [sim] 15 % by 2013...|$|R
40|$|Simulations of stratospheric {{geoengineering}} {{with black}} carbon (BC) aerosols using a general circulation model with fixed sea surface temperatures {{show that the}} climate effects strongly depend on aerosol size and altitude of injection. 1 Tg BC/a injected into the lower stratosphere would cause little surface cooling for large radii but {{a large amount of}} surface cooling for small radii and stratospheric warming of over 60 C. With the exception of small particles, increasing the altitude of injection increases surface cooling and stratospheric warming. Stratospheric warming causes global ozone loss by up to 50 % in the small radius case. The Antarctic shows less ozone loss due to reduction of polar stratospheric clouds, but strong circumpolar winds would enhance the <b>Arctic</b> ozone <b>hole.</b> Using diesel fuel to produce the aerosols is likely prohibitively expensive and infeasible. Although studying an absorbing aerosol is a useful counterpart to previous studies involving sulfate aerosols, black carbon geoengineering likely carries too many risks to make it a viable option for deployment...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} provided in-situ ozone measurements onboard the NASA Ames DC- 8 research aircraft {{during the}} 1989 Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Experiment. The Ames DC- 8 and ER- 2 aircraft performed extensive {{sampling of the}} Arctic stratosphere and troposphere in {{a program designed to}} study those factors important in ozone depletion in the Arctic during times when the polar vortex and meteorology are conducive to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds and/or an <b>Arctic</b> ozone <b>hole.</b> The DC- 8 ozone instrument complement included in-situ measurements for H 2 O, NO, NO 2, NO(y) gas, NO(y) particulate, as well as remote sensors for measuring the vertical distribution and column density of ozone above the aircraft altitude. The in-situ data (ozone, water vapor, and nitrogen species) at the aircraft altitude provide a definition of tropospheric conditions {{in the vicinity of the}} polar vortex and polar stratospheric clouds. Defining tropospheric conditions will assist in the understanding of the chemistry of both stratosphere and troposphere and the extent to which polar stratospheric clouds affect the chemistry of transported air...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthesis by {{microbes}} on {{the surfaces}} of glaciers and ice sheets {{has the potential to}} fix carbon, alter the albedo of ice surfaces via the production of organic matter and so enhance ice melt. It could also be important for supplying labile organic matter and nutrients to in situ and downstream ecosystems. This study compares in situ 24 hour incubation methods for measuring rates of gross photosynthesis, respiration and net community production (NCP) in cryoconite holes on three Svalbard valley glaciers. Rates of gross photosynthesis and respiration measured by the ?CO 2 method were closely balanced, resulting in rates of NCP close to the detection limit (mean of - 1. 3 ?g C g- 1 d- 1) consistent with previous measurements in <b>Arctic</b> cryoconite <b>holes.</b> This suggests that organic matter within cryoconite holes may be derived largely from allochthonous sources. The molar ratio of ?O 2 to ?CO 2 in incubations gave mean respiratory and photosynthetic quotients of 0. 80 ? 0. 17 (1 ? SD) and 1. 24 ? 0. 20 (1 ? SD), respectively. The 14 C method typically underestimated rates of gross photosynthesis (?CO 2 method) by more than one order of magnitude and measured a rate closer to NCP. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{cryosphere}} presents some of {{the most}} challenging conditions for life on earth. Nevertheless, (micro) biota survive in a range of niches in glacial systems, including water-filled depressions on glacial surfaces termed cryoconite holes (centimetre to metre in diameter and up to 0. 5 m deep) that contain dark granular material (cryoconite). In this study, the structure of bacterial and eukaryotic cryoconite communities from ten different locations in the Arctic and Antarctica was compared using T-RFLP analysis of rRNA genes. Community structure varied with geography, with greatest differences seen between communities from the Arctic and the Antarctic. DNA sequencing of rRNA genes revealed considerable diversity, with individual cryoconite hole communities containing between six and eight bacterial phyla and five and eight eukaryotic &# 039;first-rank&# 039; taxa and including both bacterial and eukaryotic photoautotrophs. Bacterial Firmicutes and Deltaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria, eukaryotic Rhizaria, Haptophyta, Choanomonada and Centroheliozoa, and archaea were identified {{for the first time in}} cryoconite ecosystems. Archaea were only found within Antarctic locations, with the majority of sequences (77 %) related to members of the Thaumarchaeota. In conclusion, this research has revealed that Antarctic and <b>Arctic</b> cryoconite <b>holes</b> harbour geographically distinct highly diverse communities and has identified hitherto unknown bacterial, eukaryotic and archaeal taxa, therein...|$|R
40|$|An {{unprecedented}} {{stratospheric ozone}} loss {{has been reported in}} the Arctic from all ground-based, sondes and satellites observations during the winter 2010 - 11. It was attributed to unusually long-lasting cold conditions allowing Polar Stratospheric Clouds to form until at least mid-March. Chlorine activation and ozone loss amplitudes are found comparable to that in the Antarctic ozone hole, but the warmer conditions, the lesser reduction of nitric acid, and the absence of dehydration, indicate that <b>Arctic</b> ozone <b>holes</b> are possible even with temperature much milder than those in the Antarctic (Manney et al., 2011, Arnone et al, 2011). Here the ozone loss in and out vortex is evaluated by the "passive" method by comparison between total ozone measured at height SAOZ stations and that simulated by the REPROBUS Chemistry Transport Model (CTM) ignoring chemistry. Most unprecedented feature is the loss rate of 0. 5 - 0. 6 % per day after February 20, similar to that observed in the Antarctic but never seen before in the Arctic. The explanation, demonstrated by the simultaneous NO 2 SAOZ measurements, is the late renoxification of the vortex after the photolysis of HNO 3 starting on March 20 only, later than all other years in the Arctic, particularly in 1997, the year of the longer lasting cold vortex. This implies strong denoxification (heterogeneous conversion of N 2 O 5 in HNO 3) and at least partial denitrification by sedimentation of NAT particles, that is temperature far below that of NAT formation in the early winter as reported. In summary, it is shown that the unprecedented loss amplitude in the winter 2011 was due to a cold vortex until mid-March, but also to extremely cold temperatures below TICE, in the mid stratosphere in January. Shown in the presentation will be the evolution of the ozone loss and the NO 2 column in and out vortex during the 2010 - 2011 winter, the contribution of gas phase chemistry, the relationship with sunlit VPSC, and comparisons with previous years, particularly those of largest losses...|$|R

New visitor amenities and naturalistic habitats were planned, including the Asian River and Highlands Zone, African Watering <b>Hole,</b> <b>Arctic</b> Edge, and the Wonders of Water Children’s Zoo. Phase One of the Master Plan {{has resulted in the}} opening of the Vanishing Animals exhibit, EcoStation, Otter Creek, and Sea Lion Cove. The completion of Phase One was marked by the September 10, 2008, opening of the South American Rainforest, a four-season attraction that features a two-story waterfall, dozens of colorful free-flighted birds, {{and a variety of other}} rainforest species. These include ocelots, blue poison dart frogs, and many other animals you can find in the rain forest.In the fall of 2015 the 14 million dollar Arctic Edge opened to the public featuring Arctic wolves, bald eagles, Eurasian lynx and polar bears. In 2016 the Arctic wolves were replaced by Arctic foxes which fit the size of the exhibit better than the wolves. Arctic Edge is currently home to two polar bears Anana and Luna. Luna is the offspring of Anana and Nanuq, Nanuq now resides at the Columbus Zoo. The Buffalo Zoo is currently fundraising for a remodel of the historic Reptile House. The refurbished Reptile House will feature Komodo dragons and dwarf crocodiles.|$|R
40|$|Marine glacial environments contain unique {{seafloor}} features {{resulting from}} the dynamic glacial processes. Studying these submarine geomorphological features can {{help us understand the}} glacial paleo-environments so that we can predict the likely responses of present day glaciers and ice sheets to future changes in the climate. This thesis details different approaches in understanding glacial seafloor features using acoustic systems. It focuses on the novel technique of automated mapping seafloor properties using the backscatter intensity collected by acoustic multibeam echosounder systems (MBES). The aim of this thesis is to assess the potential of this unexploited data source in characterizing different glacial landforms in the polar oceans. This is done by examining the voluminous backscatter data collected by Swedish icebreaker Oden from different cruises to the polar oceans and employing an automated backscatter processing technique, the ARA algorithm, to extract surficial sediment characteristics. The results from the sediment characterization are used together with outputs from other marine acoustical systems and sediment core data to understand formational processes of the glacial submarine features. Operational issues encountered in using this technology and its viability as a tool in characterization of glacial seafloor features are discussed and suggestions are given on the improvements needed to effectively implement the method in future studies. The final part of the manuscript is a paper, published in Geo-marine Letters, where I and my co-authors show a practical application of the acoustic systems ability to characterize geomorphological features of a mass-wasting event in the deepest part of the <b>Arctic,</b> the Molloy <b>Hole.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In 1993, the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 151 drilled at 7 {{sites in}} the Nordic Seas and the {{adjacent}} Arctic Ocean to study the Cenozoic paleoceanography and paleoclimate evolution (Myhre et al. 1995). On Yermak Plateau, the northernmost ODP sites to date were drilled and more than 1200 meters of glacial marine sediments of Pleistocene and Pliocene age were obtained in 10 holes (Myhre et al. 1995). Two shallow water drill holes from sites 910 and 911 that are today located {{in the path of}} relatively warm North Atlantic waters transported in the Svalbard branch of the Westspitsbergen Current into the Arctic Ocean were selected for a detailed study. Magnetostratigraphic, stable isotope and biostratigraphic age control suggests that Holes 910 A and 911 A provide an almost complete stratigraphic record of the last 3. 5 Ma (Myhre et al. 1996). In particular, Hole 910 A is unique compared to other Quaternary marine sequences from the Arctic Ocean because of a relatively well-constrained stable oxygen and carbon isotope stratigraphy for the last 650. 000 years (Flower 1997). Therefore, Holes 910 A and 911 A are important sites to improve the Plio-/Pleistocene chronostratigraphy of the Eastern Arctic Ocean, and to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental history in the past 3. 5 Ma. Furthermore, these holes may form stratigraphic reference sections for new holes to be drilled in the Central Arctic Ocean in the frame of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). A multi-proxy study was started in summer 2003 to establish a dinoflagellate cyst stratigraphy for Plio-/Pleistocene sediments of the eastern Arctic Ocean that will be calibrated versus a revised stable oxygen isotope stratigraphy. Furthermore, the variability of sea-surface conditions and its interaction with the discharge of freshwater from Eurasia and the growth and decay of the northern Barents Sea ice sheets since the Pliocene will be reconstructed. Various micropaleontological, sedimentological and organic geochemical methods are applied on the same sample set to reveal the synchroneity/ asynchroneity of changes in the surface water regime and changes in the sediment supply and source areas. In {{the first year of the}} project, the studies focussed on the Pleistocene sediments of Hole 910 A that has an average sedimentation rate of 2 to 4 cm/k. y. (Flower 1997). A preliminary dinoflagellate cyst biostratigraphy is based on a first set of 80 out of ca. 220 samples from the uppermost 20 meters of Hole 910 A, and the results of a low-resolution study on Hole 911 A by Matthiessen & Brenner (1996). Most samples of Hole 910 A are productive but contain only few specimens of a small number of taxa. The presence of delicate spherical brown cysts indicates that preservation is generally good. Age-diagnostic species were not found in the Pleistocene and the ubiquitous species have long stratigraphic ranges (e. g. Rochon et al. 1999). The freshwater algae Pediastrum is present in a number of samples suggesting some freshwater supply from the Laptev and Kara seas during certain intervals. The coarse sand fraction (250 to 2000 µm) and the number of gravel particles (> 2 mm/ 10 g) that characterise supply by icebergs do not show much variability, except for a pronounced maximum in marine isotope stage 2 that is probably related to the last glacial maximum. Minor fluctuations of the gravel content might be related to glacial/interglacial transitions and the onset of glaciations. Mineralogical and geochemical parameters show some variability in the Pleistocene siliciclastic sediments of Hole 910 A. Carbonate contents are principally low and range usually between 0 and 4 %. The terrigenous minerals dolomite and siderite clearly dominate in most samples showing that only a rather small portion of bulk carbonate is of biological origin. Small fluctuations are obviously not related to glacial/interglacial cycles. Maximum values of 8 to 10 % were measured in samples from MIS 2. Rock eval pyrolysis revealed that total organic carbon contents are predominately of terrestrial origin, and are obviously inversely correlated with carbonate contents. ReferencesFlower, B.
