40|$|Objectives: To explore job adjustments, job satisfaction, {{and health}} {{experience}} among employees with an upper limb amputation and {{to compare the}} results with those of lower limb <b>amputees</b> and control subjects. Methods: <b>Amputees</b> were recruited from data files of a large European University Medical Centre and orthopaedic workshops. Controls were matched colleagues of the lower limb <b>amputees.</b> All participants filled out the VAG questionnaire (Vragenlijst Arbeid en Gezondheid), assessing job satisfaction and job adjustments, and the RAND- 36. Results: 28 upper limb <b>amputees</b> were compared to 144 lower limb <b>amputees</b> and 144 controls. Job adjustments were necessary in 38 % and 28 % of upper and lower limb <b>amputees,</b> respectively. All three groups were equally satisfied with their jobs (p= 0. 90). Vocational rehabilitation was applied to 26 % and 8 % of upper and lower limb <b>amputees,</b> respectively. Upper limb <b>amputees</b> rated their general health worse (18 points, 95 % CI: 12 - 25) compared to lower limb <b>amputees,</b> corrected for effects of confounders (age and co-morbidity). Conclusions: Upper and lower limb <b>amputees</b> have high job satisfaction and a minority need job adjustments. In upper limb <b>amputees,</b> {{the causes of the}} worrisome general health experience need further investigation. In upper and lower limb <b>amputees,</b> vocational rehabilitation deserves additional attention...|$|R
40|$|ASSESSMENT OF SELECTED ASPECTS OF POSTURAL CONTROL IN TRANSTIBIAL AMPUTEES Abstract The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} aspects of automatic and voluntary posture control in transtibial <b>amputees</b> with respect to cause of amputation, prosthesis alignment and prosthetic usage duration by means of dynamic computed posturography (NeuroCom®). A total of 44 volunteers participated in our study (14 transtibial <b>amputees</b> due to trauma, 13 vascular transtibial <b>amputees</b> and 17 healthy subjects). Our results suggest, that transtibial <b>amputees</b> due to trauma have more similar posture behaviour with healthy subjects in compare to vascular <b>amputees.</b> Transtibial <b>amputees</b> due to trauma are able to effectively coordinate voluntary inclination of body {{on the side of}} amputated leg. Also the older traumatic <b>amputees</b> were, the worse they could control their posture - same as healthy subjects. Despite the fact that traumatic <b>amputees</b> were able to voluntary coordinate posture even on the side of amputated leg, within automatic posture reactions (on platform translations) they bore more weight on their non-amputated leg. In vascular <b>amputees</b> this tendency was not present. Tested prosthetic alignments didn't have significant influence on the posture control in transtibial <b>amputees.</b> Keywords: Lower limb amputation, posture control, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The devastating {{earthquake}} in Sichuan in 2008 has left many adolescent <b>amputees.</b> However, {{little research has}} been focused on the adolescent <b>amputees</b> who have high potential to return to premorbid activity level. Objectives: To investigate daily step activities and prosthesis-related quality of life of the adolescent transtibial and transfemoral <b>amputees</b> after the earthquake. Study design: A prospective and descriptive study. Methods: A total of 21 adolescent unilateral <b>amputees</b> (11 transtibial and 10 transfemoral <b>amputees)</b> were recruited. Step Activity Monitors and Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire were used to assess patients over a 3 -month period. Results: The average number of steps per day was 4577 ± 849 and 2551 ± 693 in transtibial and transfemoral <b>amputees,</b> respectively. Transtibial <b>amputees</b> had significantly higher (p < 0. 05) levels of step activity than transfemoral <b>amputees</b> in all Step Activity Monitors measures. Prosthetic compliance was good with daily wearing time of above 12 h/day in both groups. Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire scores showed no significant difference between two groups. Conclusions: The subjective quality of life is similar for adolescent <b>amputees</b> across transtibial and transfemoral amputation levels. Higher levels of step activity of transtibial <b>amputees</b> suggest that they have had lower energy expenditure and more capacity for ambulation.

40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of walking speed on the energy {{expenditure}} in traumatic lower-limb <b>amputees</b> was studied. The oxygen consumption was measured in 10 transfemoral <b>amputees,</b> 9 transtibial <b>amputees</b> and 13 control subjects, while they stood and walked at different speeds from 0. 3 m s(- 1) to near their maximum sustainable speed. Standing energy expenditure rate was the same in lower-limb <b>amputees</b> and in control subjects (approximately 1. 85 W kg(- 1)). On the contrary, during walking, the net energy expenditure rate was 30 - 60 % greater in transfemoral <b>amputees</b> and 0 - 15 % greater in transtibial <b>amputees</b> than in control subjects. The maximal sustainable speed was about 1. 2 m s(- 1) in transfemoral <b>amputees</b> and 1. 6 m s(- 1) in transtibial <b>amputees,</b> whereas it was above 2 m s(- 1) in control subjects.

40|$|Aim: The {{presented}} study {{reports a}} quantitative gait analysis and different adaptive strategies evaluation on 12 male adults, war trauma transtibial (TT) <b>amputees,</b> fitted with prostheses. Methods: Gait analysis included kinematics (joint mobility variables) prosthetic and healthy legs in 12 TT <b>amputees</b> and 12 able-bodied persons/individuals. Results: The results disclose asymmetry in gait parameters between the amputated and sound legs, {{as well as}} between transtibial <b>amputees</b> and able-bodied persons.

5|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} sand for the Sandman, experiments were done with twelve types of sand, such as splashing, launching it at stuntmen, and pouring it over ledges. The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman. For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied. With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corncobs were used as a substitute instead.

40|$|Objective: To study {{limitations}} in function and adjustment strategies in lower limb <b>amputees</b> during gait initiation. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: University Medical Center. Participants: <b>Amputees</b> with a unilateral transfemoral or transtibial amputation, and able-bodied subjects. Main outcome measures: Leading limb preference, temporal variables, ground reaction forces, and {{centre of pressure}} shift. Results: <b>Amputees</b> demonstrated a decrease in peak anterior ground reaction force, a smaller or absent posterior centre of pressure shift, and a lower gait initiation velocity. The main adjustments strategies in <b>amputees</b> were more limb-loading on the non-affected limb, prolonging the period of propulsive force production in the non-affected limb and initiating gait preferably with the prosthetic limb. Conclusion: Since an intact ankle joint and musculature is of major importance in gait initiation, functional limitations and adjustment strategies in transfemoral and transtibial <b>amputees</b> were similar. Improving prosthetic ankle properties and initiating gait with the prosthetic limb may facilitate the gait initiation process in <b>amputees.</b> (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{limitations}} in function and adjustment strategies in lower limb <b>amputees</b> during obstacle crossing. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SUBJECTS: Transfemoral and transtibial <b>amputees</b> and able-bodied control subjects. METHODS: In a motion analysis laboratory unimpeded and obstacle crossing runs were performed. The subjects stepped over an obstacle of 0. 1 m height and thickness and 1 m width. Outcome measures were gait velocity, hip, knee and ankle joint angles and leading limb preference. RESULTS: Whereas able-bodied and transtibial subjects demonstrated {{an increase in}} knee flexion during obstacle crossing compared to unimpeded walking, in transfemoral <b>amputees</b> the opposite was seen, namely a decrease in knee flexion. The lack of knee strategy in transfemoral <b>amputees</b> was compensated by circumduction at the hip on the prosthetic side and plantar flexion of the non-affected ankle. Transtibial <b>amputees</b> preferred to cross the obstacle with the prosthetic limb first, while transfemoral <b>amputees</b> preferred the non-affected limb. CONCLUSION: The different leading limb strategy in transfemoral and transtibial <b>amputees</b> {{could be explained by}} the restricted flexion and propulsion properties of the prosthetic knee. Training of obstacle crossing tasks during rehabilitation and improvement of prosthetic design may contribute to safe obstacle crossing...|$|R

40|$|Background: Walking energy expenditure, {{calculated}} as the percent {{utilization of the}} maximal aerobic capacity, is little investigated in transfemoral <b>amputees.</b> Objectives: Compare the energy expenditure of healthy participants (control participants) and transfemoral <b>amputees</b> walking with their respective preferred walking speeds on the treadmill (T PWS) and floor (F PWS). Study design: Randomized cross-over study. Methods: Oxygen uptake (VO 2) was measured when walking with the F PWS and T PWS. VO 2 max was measured by an incremental treadmill test. Results: Mean ± standard deviation VO 2 max of the transfemoral <b>amputees</b> and control participants were 30. 6 ± 8. 7 and 49. 0 ± 14. 4 mL kg − 1 min − 1, respectively (p < 0. 05).

F PWS for the transfemoral <b>amputees</b> and control participants was 1. 22 ± 0. 2 and 1. 52 ± 0. 1 m s − 1, respectively (p < 0. 01). Walking on floor with the F PWS, the energy expenditure of the transfemoral <b>amputees</b> and control participants was 54 % and 31 % of VO 2 max, respectively (p < 0. 01). Walking on the treadmill with the T PWS, the energy expenditure of the transfemoral <b>amputees</b> and control participants was 42 % and 29 % of the VO 2 max, respectively (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Energy expenditure is higher for the transfemoral <b>amputees</b> than the control participants, regardless of walking surface. There are minimal differences in energy expenditure between treadmill and floor walking for the control participants but large differences for the transfemoral <b>amputees.</b> Clinical relevance During walking, the transfemoral <b>amputees</b> expend {{a larger percentage of}} their maximal aerobic capacity than healthy participants. With a low VO 2 max, ordinary activities, such as walking, become physically more challenging for the transfemoral <b>amputees</b> than the control participants, and this may, in turn, {{have a negative effect on}} the walking range of the transfemoral <b>amputees...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many upper-limb <b>amputees</b> {{retain the}} ability to control a hand, however no {{suitable}} mechanical hand is available to them. A hand/arm virtual interface (VIA) developed at Rutgers allows <b>amputees</b> to manipulate objects within a virtual environment. The interface uses residual myo-kinetic signals expressed at the surface of the forearm to control the virtual hand, while arm reaching is transduced by a goniometer. In preliminary tests <b>amputees</b> readily gained control of the virtual hand, and successfully used it to manipulate objects. This is indicative of VIA usefulness as a tool for assessing and training <b>amputees</b> in using a dexterous mechanical hand...|$|R
