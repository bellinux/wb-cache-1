40|$|Software {{fault-tolerance}} schemes often employ multiple software versions {{developed to}} meet the same specification. If the versions fail independently of each other, they can be combined to give high levels of reliability. Although design diversity is a means to develop these versions, it has been questioned because it increases development costs and because reliability gains are limited by common-mode failures. The use of genetic programming is proposed to generate multiple software versions by varying parameters of the genetic programming algorithm. An environment is developed to generate programs for a controller in an <b>aircraft</b> <b>arrestment</b> system. Eighty programs have been developed and tested on 10000 test cases. The experimental data show that failure diversity is achieved, but for the top performing programs its levels are limited...|$|E
40|$|With the {{functionality}} of most {{embedded systems}} based on software (SW), interactions amongst SW modules arise, resulting in error propagation across SW them. During SW development, {{it would be}} helpful to have a framework that clearly demonstrates the error propagation and containment capabilities of the different SW components. In this paper, we assess the impact of inter-modular error propagation. Adopting a white-box SW approach, we make the following contributions: (a) we study and characterize the error propagation process and derive a set of metrics that quantitatively represents the inter-modular SW interactions, (b) we use a real embedded target system used in an <b>aircraft</b> <b>arrestment</b> system to perform fault-injection experiments to obtain experimental values for the metrics proposed, (c) we show how the set of metrics can be used to obtain the required analytical framework for error propagation analysis. We find that the derived analytical framework establishes a very close correla [...] ...|$|E

In 1987 he completed the Naval Postgraduate School/Test Pilot School Cooperative Program, and was assigned as F-14 Project Officer to the Carrier Suitability Branch of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. During his tour of duty, Rominger completed the initial carrier suitability sea trials of the F-14B, logging the first <b>aircraft</b> carrier <b>arrestment</b> and catapult launch in the upgraded Tomcat. In September 1990, he reported to Fighter Squadron 211 (VF-211), where he served as Operations Officer and completed a Desert Storm Deployment to the Persian Gulf aboard [...]|$|R
