40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{to estimate the}} average airlines operational costs and <b>airports</b> <b>charges</b> per route is important for airlines companies trying to open new routes and for data generation for other purpose such as transport modeling, simulation modeling, investment analyses for airlines and airports, etc. In this paper, a {{mathematical model}} is proposed for calculating airline operations costs and <b>airports</b> <b>charges</b> on a certain route by a specific airline. This model {{was set up by}} analyzing the domestic US air transport market. A multi-regression analysis determined the relation between distance, airline operations costs and <b>airports</b> <b>charges</b> between origin and destination and market fares. The model calculates the average airlines operations costs and <b>airports</b> <b>charges</b> per route by using these costs as parameters to estimates airlines routes fares. Thus, Airlines and airports cost factors are estimated by least square method between real fares data per route and the proposed model estimations. The results have been validated comparing with real airlines operations costs data showing a correlation over 99 %, meaning that the average airlines operational costs and <b>airports</b> <b>charges</b> per route can be estimated by the model using real fares data and also that route fares are mainly determined by airline operations costs and <b>airport</b> <b>charges.</b> Marine & Transport TechnologyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{questions}} of why carriers advocate for higher per-passenger <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> and lower per-flight charges, and whether and when this proposal is welfare-enhancing.

It focuses on the trade-off between price and frequency (i. e., schedule delays) when time valuations are uniform, or differ, between business and leisure passengers. We identify an easy test {{for the evaluation of}} the mix of per-passenger and per-flight based <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> by policy makers, which is simply to check whether the carrier's preferred per-flight charge is zero.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} factors determining <b>airport</b> <b>charges.</b> Using {{data for}} 100 large airports in Europe, {{we find that}} they charge higher prices when they move more passengers. Additionally, competition from other transport modes and nearby airports imposes some discipline on the pricing behavior of airports. Low-cost car-riers and airlines with a high market share {{seem to have a}} stronger countervailing power. We also find that private <b>airports</b> not regulated <b>charge</b> higher prices than public or regulated airports.

40|$|We {{consider}} a public and congested airport served by airlines {{that may have}} market power, and two types of travelers with different relative values of time.

40|$|None of the airport-pricing {{studies have}} {{differentiated}} the congestion incurred in the terminals from the congestion incurred on the runways. This paper models and connects the {{two kinds of}} congestion in one joint model. This is done by adopting a deterministic bottleneck model for the terminal to describe passengers' behavior, and a simpler static congestion model for the runway. We find that different from the results obtained in the literature, uniform airfare does not yield the first-best outcome when terminal congestion is explicitly taken into account. In particular, business passengers are at first-best charged a higher fare than leisure passengers {{if and only if}} their relative schedule-delay cost is higher. We further identify circumstances under which passengers are, given a uniform <b>airport</b> <b>charge</b> scheme, under- or over-charged with respect to the terminal charge. Furthermore, when concession surplus is added to the analysis, the airport may raise (rather than reduce) the <b>airport</b> <b>charge</b> in order to induce more business passengers who in turn will lengthen leisure passengers' dwell time and hence increase their chance of purchasing concession goods. Finally, the impacts of terminal capacity expansion and time-varying terminal fine toll are discussed. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the price decision of an unregulated profit-maximizing airport with profitable concession activities. We show that a privatized airport will levy a lower <b>airport</b> <b>charge</b> if it has profitable concession operations than if the airport does not have concession operations. As a special case, the pricing policy may even attain social optimum. In general, however, the profit-maximizing price deviates from social optimum provided that the demand is growing over time and the per-flight concession profit is independent {{of the total number of}} flights. We further show that, without concession operations, a privatized airport tends to add capacity too late from a social point of view. However, when the airport has profitable concession operations, its timing of capacity expansion will be earlier and thus might be closer to social optimum...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} strategic {{interaction between}} intercontinental airports, {{each of which}} levies <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> paid by airlines and chooses its own capacity under conditions of congestion. Congestion from intercontinental flights is common across the airports since departure and arrival airports are linked one to one, while purely domestic traffic also uses each airport. The paper focuses on five questions. First, if both continents can strategically set separate <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> for domestic and intercontinental flights, how will the outcome differ from the first-best solution? Second, how {{is the impact of}} strategic airport behavior affected by the extent of market power of the airlines serving the intercontinental market? Third, what happens if one continent has several competing intercontinental airports, each with its own regulator, while the other has a single airport and regulator? Fourth, how effective is a non-discrimination clause for <b>airport</b> <b>charges,</b> which prevents independent strategic use of the intercontinental charge? Fifth, what is the effect of higher airport operating costs on one continent (a result of security or immigration procedures) on the strategic outcome? The questions are addressed with an algebraic model and results are illustrated numerically. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on airport congestion pricing by allowing carriers to price-discriminate between the business and leisure passengers when operating costs are {{the same for all}} passengers. The main results are: First, the second-best discriminating business fare exceeds the first-best uniform fare (which equals the external part of the marginal congestion costs), while the second-best discriminating leisure fare is lower than the first-best uniform fare. Second, the optimal <b>airport</b> <b>charge</b> implements the first-best uniform or second-best discriminating fares. Importantly, this charge can always be higher than what would be expected when all passengers were treated as having the same time valuation.

40|$|The UK airport {{industry}} faced {{regulatory reform}} following the 1986 Airports Act. The regulatory reform not only included privatisation of the then nationalised British Airports Authority, but also changed the airports {{that used to}} be directly owned and managed by local authorities into autonomous pics. As a result, the industry includes four categories of institutional arrangement for the airports in the UK, i. e., (1) privatised airports with price regulation, (2) privatised airports without price regulation, (3) a local authority airport plc with price regulation, and (4) local authority airports plc without price regulation. The regulatory reform involves the imposition of price cap regulation on 'designated' airports' average <b>airport</b> <b>charge</b> levels. In this thesis focus is placed upon the predictions of outcome changes in this industry by the regulatory reform. The framework of the analyses is based on applied microeconomics, particularly on the theory of regulation. The predictions regarding the airport charges rebalancing effect and productive efficiency are accompanied by empirical analyses as to finding any performance changes. Predictions and empirical analyses were carried out mainly with regard to (1) allocative efficiency in price rebalancing and (2) technical efficiency in production. The price regulation's constraint form is the 'Average Revenue Approach' and some economists suggest this leads to efficiency distortion. 'Designated' airports' price cap constraint uses only the passenger numbers to 'average' the level of total <b>airport</b> <b>charge</b> revenue. The thesis shows that this approach would produce a different outcome from the general outcome predicted through a typical 'Average Revenue Approach' using both a simple model and interdependency demand model, followed by an empirical analysis using price ratio data. As to productive efficiency, after predictions of the outcome I used Data Envelopment Analysis to test efficiency scores in (A) the then nationalised British Airports Authority/privatised BAA as time series, and (B) private airports and local authority airports after the reform as a panel comparison...|$|E
