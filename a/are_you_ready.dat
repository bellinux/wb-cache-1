500|$|The {{movement}} organizers {{found themselves}} out of money after the amount of required bail was raised. Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested. He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived. Some SCLC members grew frustrated with his indecisiveness. [...] "I have never seen Martin so troubled", one of King's friends later said. After King prayed and reflected alone in his hotel room, he and the campaign leaders decided to defy the injunction and prepared for mass arrests of campaign supporters. To build morale and to recruit volunteers to go to jail, Ralph Abernathy spoke at a mass meeting of Birmingham's black citizens at the 6th Avenue Baptist Church: [...] "The {{eyes of the world}} are on Birmingham tonight. Bobby Kennedy is looking here at Birmingham, the United States Congress is looking at Birmingham. The Department of Justice is looking at Birmingham. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>ready,</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>ready</b> to make the challenge? I am ready to go to jail, are you?" [...] With Abernathy, King was among 50 Birmingham residents ranging in age from 15 to 81 years who were arrested on Good Friday, April 12, 1963. It was King's 13th arrest.|$|E

When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. [...] "I guess {{to see if he}} made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day," [...] remembers Afanasieff. [...] "He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can {{to put it on the}} album.'

He {{released}} critically acclaimed albums Lonesome, On'ry and Mean and Honky Tonk Heroes followed by hit albums Dreaming My Dreams {{as well as}} <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> for the Country. In 1976, he released the album Wanted! The Outlaws with Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter, the first platinum country music album. That success was followed by Ol' Waylon and the hit song [...] "Luckenbach, Texas". Jennings was featured in the 1978 album White Mansions performed by various artists documenting the lives of white people in the Confederacy during the Civil War. The songs on the album were written by Paul Kennerley. By the early 1980s, Jennings was struggling with a cocaine addiction, which he quit in 1984. Later, he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen with Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album Will the Wolf Survive. He toured less after 1997 {{to spend more time}} with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, his appearances were limited by health problems. On February 13, 2002, Jennings died from complications of diabetes.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, Jennings {{released}} Lonesome, On'ry and Mean and Honky Tonk Heroes, {{the first}} albums recorded and released under his creative control. The release of these albums heralded a major {{turning point for}} Jennings, kicking off his most critically and commercially successful years. More hit albums followed with This Time and The Ramblin' Man, both released in 1974. The title tracks of both albums topped the Billboard Country singles chart, with the self-penned [...] "This Time" [...] becoming Jennings's first no. 1 single. Dreaming My Dreams, released in 1975, included the no. 1 single [...] "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way" [...] and was his first album to be certified gold by the RIAA; {{it was also the}} first of his next six consecutive, solo studio albums to be certified gold or higher. In 1976, Jennings released <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> for the Country, Jennings wanted the record to be produced by Los Angeles producer Ken Mansfield. Although RCA denied the request, Jennings and The Waylors went to Los Angeles and recorded with Mansfield at his expense. After a month, Jennings presented the master tape to Chet Atkins, who decided to release it. The album hit number one on Billboards country albums three times the same year, topping the charts for 10 weeks. It was named Country album of the year in 1976 by Record World magazine and it was certified gold by the RIAA.|$|E
500|$|DJ Kool Herc {{developed}} the style {{that was the}} blueprint for hip hop music. Herc used the record {{to focus on a}} short, heavily percussive part in it: the [...] "break". Since this part of the record was the one the dancers liked best, Herc isolated the break and prolonged it by changing between two record players. As one record {{reached the end of the}} break, he cued a second record back to the beginning of the break, which allowed him to extend a relatively short section of music into [...] "five-minute loop of fury". This innovation had its roots in what Herc called [...] "The Merry-Go-Round," [...] a technique by which the deejay switched from break to break at the height of the party. This technique is specifically called [...] "The Merry-Go-Round" [...] because according to Herc, it takes [...] one [...] "back and forth with no slack." [...] Herc told The New York Times that he first introduced the Merry-Go-Round into his sets in 1972. The earliest known Merry-Go-Round involved playing James Brown's [...] "Give It Up or Turnit a Loose" [...] (with its refrain, [...] "Now clap your hands! Stomp your feet!"), then switching from that record's break into the break from a second record, [...] "Bongo Rock" [...] by The Incredible Bongo Band. From the [...] "Bongo Rock"'s break, Herc used a third record to switch to the break on [...] "The Mexican" [...] by the English rock band Babe Ruth. Kool Herc also contributed to developing the rhyming style of hip hop by punctuating the recorded music with slang phrases, announcing: [...] "Rock on, my mellow!" [...] "B-boys, b-girls, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>ready?</b> keep on rock steady" [...] "This is the joint! Herc beat on the point" [...] "To the beat, y'all!" [...] "You don't stop!" [...] For his contributions, Herc is called a [...] "founding father of hip hop," [...] a [...] "nascent cultural hero," [...] and an integral part of the beginnings of hip hop by Time.|$|E
