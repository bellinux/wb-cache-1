This meant that Patton would have some role in organizing the effort, and his eagerness <b>and</b> <b>dedication</b> to the task impressed Pershing. Patton modeled much of his leadership style after Pershing, who favored strong, decisive actions and commanding from the front. As an aide, Patton oversaw the logistics of Pershing's transportation and acted as his personal courier.|$|E
