5|$|Fort Eliza, {{also known}} as The Salt Battery, is a {{freestanding}} five-sided four-gun battery, constructed around 1812, and standing {{on the east side}} of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed of broad parapets. The other two sides meet at the rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The battery is surrounded by a dry moat, with the entrance originally across a drawbridge close to the guardhouse. At the centre of the enclosure was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell's Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from <b>all</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from <b>all</b> <b>angles,</b> at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter. The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from <b>all</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|E

5|$|PlayStation VR is {{a virtual}} reality device that is {{produced}} by Sony Computer Entertainment. It features a 5.7 inch 1920x1080 resolution OLED display, and operates at 120fps which can eliminate blur and produce a smooth image; the device also has a low latency of less than 18ms. Additionally, it produces two sets of images, one being visible on a TV {{and one for the}} headset, and includes 3D audio technology so the player can hear from <b>all</b> <b>angles.</b> The PlayStation VR was released in October 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the inner bailey, with its wall studded with {{semi-circular}} projections, is unparalleled. This innovation had two advantages: firstly, the rounded wall absorbed the damage from siege engines much better as it did not provide a perfect angle to aim at; secondly, the arrowslits in the curved wall allowed arrows to be fired at <b>all</b> <b>angles.</b> The inner bailey, which contained the main residential buildings, used the principles of concentric defence. This and the unusual {{design of the}} inner bailey's curtain wall meant that castle was advanced for its age, since it was built before concentric fortification was fully developed in Crusader castles such as Krak des Chevaliers. Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe; for instance when Edward I of England—who had himself been on Crusade—built castles in Wales in the late 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded were concentric.|$|E
25|$|A {{corollary}} is {{a proposition}} that follows with little proof from another theorem or definition. Also a corollary {{can be a}} theorem restated for a more restricted special case. For example, the theorem that <b>all</b> <b>angles</b> in a rectangle are right angles has as corollary that <b>all</b> <b>angles</b> in a square (a special case of a rectangle) are right angles.|$|E

We also show some artwork based on these constant-torsion circuits...|$|R
25|$|A {{triangle}} {{that has}} two angles {{with the same}} measure also has two sides with the same length, and therefore it is an isosceles triangle. It follows that in a triangle where <b>all</b> <b>angles</b> have the same measure, all three sides have the same length, and such a triangle is therefore equilateral.|$|E
25|$|Small bronze {{figures for}} collector's cabinets, often mythological {{subjects}} with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which Giambologna, originally Flemish but based in Florence, excelled {{in the later}} part of the century, also creating life-size sculptures, of which two joined the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the figura serpentinata, often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from <b>all</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{aforementioned}} situation with distance, the scale of angles is the same in pure mathematics, physics, and computing. It {{does not depend on}} the scale of distances; all distances may be multiplied by some fixed factor, and <b>all</b> <b>angles</b> will be preserved. Usually, the angle is considered a dimensionless quantity, but there are different units of measurement, such as radian (preferred in pure mathematics and theoretical physics) and degree (°) (preferred in most applications).|$|E

The site was selected by Wilson for its visibility from <b>all</b> <b>angles</b> on the Cultural Trail and its lack of a visual point of interest. Some opponents of the artwork's location are concerned about the statue's close proximity to the Marion County Jail, pointing to current racial disparities in mass incarceration in the United States.|$|E
25|$|There {{is always}} a judge sitting at C, {{although}} for upper-level competition, there can be up to seven judges at different places around the arena— at C, E, B, K, F, M, and H— which allows the horse {{to be seen in}} each movement from <b>all</b> <b>angles.</b> This helps prevent certain faults from going unnoticed, which may be difficult for a judge to see from only one area of the arena. For example, the horse's straightness going across the diagonal may be assessed by judges at M and H.|$|E
25|$|If {{the tops}} of the {{antennae}} are wired together, the net voltage will be zero when the antenna is face-on to the signal, because the voltages in both vertical sections are opposing each other. When the antenna is rotated, the slight difference in phase, and thus induced voltages, will leave a net voltage in the circuit, and current will flow. This is maximized when the antennae are parallel to the transmitter. If one measures the output at <b>all</b> <b>angles</b> as the antennae are rotated with respect to the signal, a figure-eight reception pattern is produced, with a sharp nul point and an extended area of maximum signal.|$|E

25|$|When the {{amplification}} {{process is}} complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber, lying {{at one end}} of the building. Here it is reflected off a series of deformable mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront, and then feeds them into the target chamber from <b>all</b> <b>angles.</b> Since the overall distances from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber are different, delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time, within about 10picoseconds (ps). The target, a fusion fuel pellet about 1mm in diameter in the case of HiPER, lies at the center of the chamber.|$|E
25|$|Combat in Mass Effect: Andromeda {{takes place}} in real-time, and unlike {{previous}} installments in the series, pausing the game to aim or use skills from a menu {{is no longer a}} feature. During action sequences, the player has direct control of Ryder from an over-the-shoulder perspective, who can move around the battlefield in a variety of ways, including a side-to-side dash or vertical leap into the air using a jetpack. When the player approaches an object, Ryder will automatically take cover, providing the player with protection in battle. The game encourages players to keep moving during combat with large, open battlefields and enemies that attack from <b>all</b> <b>angles,</b> but also allows for both aggressive and defensive strategies.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the move}} to Frostbite, BioWare decided to unite the combat systems of the single and {{multiplayer}} modes. In Mass Effect 3, the single-player mode used a system tailored to a slower, cover shooter approach while the multiplayer mode used a system tailored to a faster-paced approach. It was important to BioWare that, for all gameplay modes in Mass Effect: Andromeda, the player stay moving and have a strategy behind every action as opposed to remaining in one location for the entire duration of an encounter. To encourage players to play this way, BioWare built open combat layouts, which required the programming of complex artificial intelligence so that enemies could understand space {{and know how to}} flank the player from <b>all</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A convex polygon is {{a simple}} polygon (not self-intersecting) in which no line segment between two points on the {{boundary}} ever goes outside the polygon.
