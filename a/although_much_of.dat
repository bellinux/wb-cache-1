5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{his life}} remains obscure, Nerva was {{considered}} a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians. Nerva's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death by selecting Trajan as his heir, thus founding the Nerva–Antonine dynasty.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the BBC's Shetland (TV series) {{was filmed}} on {{mainland}} Scotland, {{the cast and}} crew did work in Shetland on occasion, particularly in and near Lerwick.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the first}} film's cast {{returned}} for the sequel, Anne Hathaway {{was replaced by}} Hayden Panettiere {{in the role of}} Red and Jim Belushi was replaced by Martin Short in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman.|$|E
50|$|Dwyer is {{currently}} based in Los Angeles, California, <b>although</b> for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his career he {{was based in}} San Francisco, California. Dwyer is originally from Providence, Rhode Island, United States.|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> {{deriving}} <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its semantics from Scheme {{and other}} Lisps—some implementations {{were in fact}} initially built within existing Lisp systems—Dylan has an ALGOL-like syntax rather than a Lisp-like prefix syntax.|$|R
50|$|He {{retired in}} 1841 but {{remained}} living at Kew, <b>although</b> passing <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{his time with}} his brother at Kensington where he died on 9 October 1849. He is buried at Kew.|$|R
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the {{industry}} that dominated Worsley was in decline, in 1937 Sir Montague Maurice Burton opened a clothing factory along the East Lancashire Road. Built in the Art Deco style, in 1938 the factory employed 3,000people.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{this work}} {{has focused on}} {{independent}} sets in sparse graphs, a case {{that does not make}} sense for the complementary clique problem, there has also been work on approximation algorithms that do not use such sparsity assumptions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with {{a wider range of}} themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
60|$|Word {{was brought}} of {{collisions}} between soldiers and citizens at different points, and <b>although</b> very <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the information was}} afterwards ascertained to be untrue, no one questioned it at the moment.|$|R
50|$|Over its 44-year lifetime, the Centerville & Southwestern had a {{total of}} four {{operating}} locomotives on its roster, <b>although</b> for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its lifetime the railroad never had more than three locomotives simultaneously on the property.|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much,</b> perhaps most, <b>of</b> Killir's work remains un{{published}}, Shulamit Elizur {{has published}} three volumes of his poetry, {{and continues to}} work on his work.|$|R
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Stanford's {{music is}} {{neglected}} in the concert hall, {{a considerable amount}} has been recorded. Complete cycles of the symphonies have been recorded for the Chandos and Naxos labels, under the conductors Vernon Handley and David Lloyd-Jones. Other orchestral works recorded for CD include the six Irish Rhapsodies, the Clarinet Concerto, the Second Piano Concerto and the Second Violin Concerto.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Thoughts {{is devoted}} to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few {{passages}} anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the SSSI is {{in private}} hands, {{considerable}} areas are managed by large conservation organisations. As {{well as the}} two NNRs, there is an RSPB reserve at Titchwell Marsh, and Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserves are at Cley and Salthouse Marshes. The NWT also manages the Holme Dunes NNR. In addition to Blakeney Point, the National Trust owns land at Brancaster Staithe.|$|E
50|$|Seaham Hall {{is now a}} spa Hotel in County Durham, England. It {{was once}} owned by George Vane-Tempest, 5th Marquess <b>of</b> Londonderry, <b>although</b> for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his life he lived at Plas Machynlleth, his wife's home in Montgomeryshire.|$|R
25|$|Following Usmani's criticisms {{the global}} sukuk market shrunk from US$50 billion in 2007 to {{approximately}} $14.9 billion in 2008, <b>although</b> how <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{this was due}} to his criticisms or the Global Financial Crisis is a matter of debate.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} end is in Sasang-gu, Busan, <b>although</b> for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the distance between}} Busan and Daegu it runs together with the Gyeongbu Expressway. Its northern end is in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province. The expressway was completed in December 2001.|$|R
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the upper}} reaches are now {{designated}} as leisure routes, there is still significant commercial traffic on the navigation. 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, {{although most of the}} traffic is now petroleum and gravel, rather than the coal which kept the navigation profitable for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|As Part III progresses, the {{narrative}} switches to describing their upper-class {{life on the}} island, and filling details of the lifestyle the family was born into. The story of the voodoo practicing Haitian family maid is elucidated: she escaped Trujillo's massacre of Haitians and came to work for Laura, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> her family was not so lucky.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it was {{estimated}} that there were 10,000 foxes in London. City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their diet will be similar to rural foxes.|$|E
25|$|Dr Kenneth: The {{longtime}} {{doctor of}} Gimmerton {{and a friend}} of Hindley's who is present at the cases of illness during the novel. <b>Although</b> not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his character is known, he seems to be a rough but honest person.|$|R

5|$|Shen Kuo wrote {{several other}} books besides the Dream Pool Essays, yet {{much of the}} writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was {{preserved}} in posthumous written works. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his focus was on technical and scientific issues, he {{had an interest in}} divination and the supernatural, the latter including his vivid description of unidentified flying objects from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient Daoist and Confucian texts.|$|E
5|$|Some {{have speculated}} that a {{contributor}} to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation. By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} streams has cut combes through the hills {{down to the}} sea, which are now wooded, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Exmoor is open heathland. There is an outlier of Exmoor at North Hill near Minehead. Iron working was {{formerly}} carried out, probably from the Roman period onward.|$|E
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> is made <b>of</b> the {{collaboration}} between James Stewart and Anthony Mann, Robert Ryan also teamed with Mann in The Naked Spur, Men in War, and God's Little Acre.|$|R
50|$|Bedford's {{painting}} is loosely representational of landscape, and {{was influenced by}} the work of Rover Thomas. <b>Although,</b> like <b>much</b> <b>of</b> central and western desert art, it is strongly influenced by traditional techniques and iconography, it also addresses black-white relationships and historical events in his country.|$|R
50|$|The House of Assembly was {{overseen by}} a Governor {{appointed}} by the Company (from 1684, by the Crown), <b>although,</b> for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the colony's history, the real political power lay with the appointed Council of Bermuda, composed of members of Bermuda's wealthy merchant class.|$|R
5|$|The {{church was}} {{assigned}} as a historic monument by decree of 10 September 1913, {{only to have}} its stained glass smashed during a Zeppelin bombardment on 15 January 1915, falling through the roof. General de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on 6 April 1921 at the cathedral. The building experienced extensive damage during World War II, and was partially rebuilt, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the old altar and furnishings were not replaced.|$|E
5|$|This fungus is inedible, as it {{contains}} the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of water, consumption is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect.|$|E
5|$|A {{defensible}} barracks made of brick, {{faced in}} Kentish ragstone on the fort's exterior, closes off the gorge. Its line is indented to facilitate small arms fire from loopholes and windows with armoured steel shutters. The {{first floor of}} the barracks had a veranda facing towards the fort's interior and supported on cast-iron pillars. The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCO and men, though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the barracks is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.|$|E
