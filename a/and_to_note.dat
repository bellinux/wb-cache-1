25|$|Hence, it is {{important}} to distinguish the rational-expectations assumption from assumptions of individual rationality <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the first does not imply the latter. Rational expectations is an assumption of aggregate consistency in dynamic models. In contrast, rational choice theory studies individual decision making and is used extensively in, among others, game theory and contract theory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the overall}} population, a slight {{majority}} of melanomas do not form in an existing mole, but rather create a new growth on the skin. Somewhat surprisingly, this also applies to those with dysplastic nevi. They are at {{a higher risk of}} melanoma occurring not only where there is an existing mole, but also where there are none.

Hanson therefore criticized Holder and Obama for suggesting that racism may have been a factor in the trial of Hispanic George Zimmerman who had been charged and acquitted of murder with the shooting death of Trayvon Martin—and especially for intruding in an ongoing criminal case before a jury had even been selected. Hanson argued that Zimmerman was later found by a jury of his peers to be justified in shooting Martin in self-defense, and he suggested that Obama was alluding to racism being a factor in the case, to distract attention from his then unpopular presidency.|$|E

2500|$|The {{differences}} between Tincture of Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) {{are important and}} {{should be kept in}} mind when administering either of these drugs. Care and caution should always be taken in administering doses of Tincture of Opium, {{such as the use of}} a dosage syringe or other suitable measurement device, and by pharmacists in preparing Paregoric from Laudanum, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the dosages in this article refer to Apothecaries weight and fluid measure. In particular, [...] "the difference between a minim and a drop should be borne in mind when figuring doses. A minim is always a sixtieth part of a fluidrachm regardless of the character of the substance, while a drop varies from a forty-fifth to a two-hundred-and-fiftieth part, according to the surface tension of the fluid." [...] Tincture of Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) each have 50.9 drops per gram; 50.0 drops per cc; 185.0 drops per fluid drachm; and 3.10 drops per minim." [...] The importance of these distinctions is evident in view of the dangers of erroneously relying upon more general descriptions of Apothecaries' fluid measures, which typically list 60 minims per fluid dram, and 8 fluid drams per fluid ounce (480 minims).|$|E
