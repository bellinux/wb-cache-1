5|$|Conway Morris {{found that}} the shelly fossils in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed were about as {{abundant}} as in other shelly fossil deposits, but <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 14% of the Phyllopod Bed fossils. Assuming that, as in modern marine ecosystems, about 70% of the species that lived in the Early Cambrian seas are unsuitable for fossilization, he estimated that the shelly fossils probably represent about 2% of the animals that were alive at the time. Since these shelly fossils are found {{in other parts of}} North America and, in many cases, over a much wider range, the Burgess Shale fossils, including the soft-bodied ones, probably show how much diversity could be expected at other sites if Burgess Shale type preservation were found there.|$|E

5|$|During its Thursday-midnight showings, On Stranger Tides earned $4.7 {{million from}} 2,210 theaters, and $34,860,549 in total on its opening day. It earned $90.2 million on its opening weekend, topping the weekend box office, but earning {{much less than}} its two {{immediate}} predecessors (At World's End – $114.7 million and Dead Man's Chest – $135.6 million) and the directly preceding Johnny Depp spectacle (Alice in Wonderland – $116.1 million). 3D showings <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 46% of its opening-weekend gross. It closed on September 29, 2011, with a $241.1 million gross, ranking as the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2011 and the least profitable film of the franchise. However, it was the top-grossing movie during May 2011 (with $166.8 million by May 31).|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the period's outward-looking {{development}} strategy, Brazil's industrial exports increased from US$1.4billion in 1963 to US$6.2billion in 1973.

25|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, {{intercity}} bus {{service in the}} United States had fallen from 140 million annual passengers in 1960 to 40 million in 1990.

25|$|The {{first wave}} of Italian {{immigration}} to Boston occurred in the late 19th century.

By 1897, that figure had risen to 11%, with 18,000 living in the North End alone. Others lived in East Boston, Roxbury, the West End, and other neighborhoods.|$|E

By 1953, coins <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 5% of the business.|$|E
25|$|As of 2014, {{offshore}} wind power amounted to 8,771 megawatt of global installed capacity. Although offshore capacity doubled within three years (from 4,117MW in 2011), it <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 2.3% of the total wind power capacity.

25|$|Leeds {{was mainly}} a {{merchant}} town, manufacturing woollen cloths and trading with Europe via the Humber estuary {{and the population}} grew from 10,000 {{at the end of}} the seventeenth century to 30,000 {{at the end of the}} eighteenth. As a gauge of the importance of the town, by the 1770s Leeds merchants were responsible for 30% of the country's woollen exports, valued at £1,500,000 when 70 years previously Yorkshire <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 20% of exports.|$|E

25|$|The {{opposing}} {{air forces}} of Belgium (the Aéronautique militaire – AeMI) and the Netherlands (the Militaire Luchtvaart – ML) were far inferior {{in terms of}} equipment and numbers, the Dutch Airforce largely used biplanes. The ML had only 144 aircraft but, like the Polish, they were dispersed well. After the first days operations half the ML's strength had been sapped. During the four days that it resisted the Luftwaffe it <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> a handful of Luftwaffe aircraft shot down.|$|E
25|$|One {{of crucial}} {{failures}} of the Luftwaffe was to underestimate the role of civil aviation on the Soviet Union. The Germans believed that it <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> 12 to 15 percent of all logistical traffic, {{and the nature of}} the Soviet terrain meant that rail was relied upon to deliver around 90 percent of Soviet supplies to the front, making it the prime target. The civil air organisation was deemed too primitive and ineffective. In wartime, it would contribute significantly to supporting logistics.|$|E
25|$|According to the BLS, total nonfarm {{employment}} in Massachusetts in 2005 was about 3.2 million. About {{half of these}} jobs were located in the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy NECTA Division, which lies entirely within Massachusetts, although this NECTA <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> about 43% of the state’s population, according to 2005 Census estimates. This indicates either a higher labor participation rate in central Greater Boston or a surplus of commuters traveling to work {{from other parts of}} Massachusetts or neighboring states. Clearly, Greater Boston dominates the employment and economy of Massachusetts.|$|E
