5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown P.semilanceata to {{suppress}} {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, a virulent plant pathogen that causes the disease root rot. When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat, P.semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard <b>antimicrobial</b> susceptibility tests, Psilocybe semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

40|$|SummaryTreatment of {{infectious}} diseases with <b>antimicrobials</b> constituted a great achievement {{in the history of}} medicine. Unfortunately, the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria to all classes of <b>antimicrobials</b> limited their efficacy. The present study was aimed at evaluating the effect of combinations of antibiotics on multi-drug resistant Gram-negative (MDRGN) bacteria. A liquid micro-broth dilution method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of 10 different classes of <b>antimicrobials</b> on 20 bacterial strains belonging to six different species. The <b>antimicrobials</b> were associated with phenylalanine β-naphthylamide (PAβN), an efflux pump inhibitor, and with other <b>antimicrobials</b> at their sub-inhibitory concentrations. The effectiveness of each combination was monitored using the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC). Most of the <b>antimicrobials</b> tested showed low antibacterial activity with a MIC value of 128 mg/L on a majority of the bacterial strains, justifying their multidrug-resistant (MDR) profile. Synergistic effects were mostly observed (FIC≤ 0. 5) when ampicillin (AMP), cloxacillin (CLX), erythromycin (ERY), chloramphenicol (CHL), kanamycin (KAN) and streptomycin (STR) were combined with tetracycline (TET) at the sub-inhibitory concentration of MIC/ 5 or MIC/ 10. The results of the present work suggest that the association of several <b>antimicrobials</b> with TET could improve the fight against MDRGN bacterial species...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} whether outcomes {{for patients with}} cellulitis treated with oral <b>antimicrobials</b> {{are as good as}} for those who are treated with parenteral <b>antimicrobials.</b> Methods A prospective randomized non-inferiority trial was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were patients referred by the emergency department for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis with parenteral <b>antimicrobials.</b> Patients were randomized to receive either oral cefalexin or parenteral cefazolin. Parenteral <b>antimicrobials</b> were changed to oral after the area of cellulitis ceased progressing. The primary outcome was days until no advancement of the area of cellulitis. A non-inferiority margin of 15 % was set for the oral arm compared with the parenteral arm. Secondary outcomes were failure of treatment, pain, complications and satisfaction with care. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN 12611000685910). Results Twenty-four patients were randomized to oral <b>antimicrobials</b> and 23 to parenteral <b>antimicrobials.</b> Mean days to no advancement of cellulitis was 1. 29 (SD 0. 62) for the oral arm and 1. 78 (SD 1. 13) for the parenteral arm, with a mean difference of − 0. 49 (95 % CI: − 1. 02 to + 0. 04). The upper limit of the 95 % CI of the difference in means of + 0. 04 was below the 15 % non-inferiority margin of + 0. 27 days, indicating non-inferiority. More patients failed treatment in the parenteral arm (5 of 23, 22 %) compared with the oral arm (1 of 24, 4 %), although this difference was not statistically significant (P =  0. 10).
