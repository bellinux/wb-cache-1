40|$|Not {{all aspects}} of the side effects that occur during the {{treatment}} of stress are negative. In fact, many of the socalled side effects, including <b>abreactions,</b> physiological and psychological discharges, and other cognitive distortions, that occur during treatment are common, and one can argue that they are often an integral part of successful treatment. Side effects occur at different frequencies depending on factors such as the treatment approach used (e. g., autogenic training, biofeedback, or neurofeedback) and client history and symptoms. Side effects and symptoms can be detected via observation, client report, checklists, and physiological measurements. Some side effects can be avoided by using a different treatment approach; for example, clients undergoing autogenic training are likely to experience very different side effects than those who are undergoing progressive relaxation training. It can be argued that side effects occur in 100 % of patients if treatment is successful; thus, practitioners should be prepared and competent so that they can anticipate, identify, and appropriately deal with side effects when they occur. Individualized approaches are necessary for dealing with side effects in an ethical and beneficial manner...|$|R

40|$|Notably deplorable phenomenological {{changes of}} homicides in Serbia at the {{beginning}} of 1990 ’s proceeded along with the dismantling of SFRJ, wars and unsuccessful starting of social transition: within the turbulent and almost extreme social context it had been generated an increase of all types of violence as well as crime in general. Restrictive social conditions economic deprivation, social disorganization and deregulation are apprehended as factors of facilitation of risks of violent <b>abreactions</b> in the form of expressive homicides and also of risks of instrumental violence under the high structural pressure toward illegal alternatives and weak formal crime control at the same time. The crises of external and internal security coincided amplifying one another and succeeded by economic declension, deregulation and revived cultural definitions that extended the ‘legitimacy’ of violence. The plenty of cycles of structural and behavioural violence were initiated during the 1990 s in Serbia: a holistic approach to violence as one complex phenomenon that extends from ‘invisible’ violence to homicides is the strategy which should be considered as perspective one regarding both the exploration and prevention of homicides.

5000|$|One {{treatment}} method Hubbard drew from in developing Dianetics was <b>abreaction</b> therapy. <b>Abreaction</b> is a psychoanalytical term that means bringing to consciousness, and thus adequate expression, material {{that has been}} unconscious.

This process is usually facilitated by the patient's gaining awareness of the causal relationship between the previously undischarged emotion and his symptoms." ...|$|E

5000|$|Hubbard's {{concept of}} the engram evolved over time. In Dianetics, he wrote that [...] "The word engram, in Dianetics is used in its {{severely}} accurate sense as a 'definite and permanent trace left by a stimulus on the protoplasm of a tissue'", which followed fairly closely the original definition in Dorland's. He later repudiated the idea that an engram was a physical cellular trace, redefining his concept as being [...] "a mental image picture of a moment of pain and unconsciousness". According to Hubbard whenever an engram is stimulated it increases in power. Jeff Jacobsen compared auditing for engrams in Scientology to the Freudian psychoanalytic concept of <b>abreaction,</b> equating engrams to the painful subconscious memories that <b>abreaction</b> therapy brings up to the conscious mind. He quoted Nathaniel Thornton, who compared <b>abreaction</b> to confession. Dorthe Refslund Christensen describes engrams in layman’s terms as trauma, a means to explain the long and short term effects of painful experiences. According to Christensen, Hubbard wrote about the dramatization of an engram, where the one who suffered and recorded the pain as an engram relates all sensory perceptions {{during the time of}} the painful incident to the incident. These sensory perceptions become “restimulators” that remind the individual of the pain and triggers him or her to re-experience it.|$|E
5000|$|He {{contributed a}} number of {{innovations}} of his own to autogenic therapy, such as techniques of autogenic neutralization, autogenic <b>abreaction,</b> autogenic verbalization, and intentional off-loading exercises. He encouraged autogenic training as a therapeutic modality in several diseases. In 1961, he described the therapeutic significance of “autogenic discharges”, which had been considered to be mere “training symptoms” or side effects of basic autogenic training.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that the process of insight-oriented psychotherapy can be improved by the use of drugs, which can be described as psychedelic drugs (meaning [...] "mind-manifesting"). Psychedelic substances, such as the amphetamine MDMA, can be used in psychotherapy to reinforce and enhance the relationship between the healthcare professional and his or her client (or patient). Such substances can be used to better manage <b>abreaction</b> and catharsis and improve the quality of understanding between the healthcare professional and patient.|$|E
50|$|In Scientology, Dianetics {{is a form}} of <b>abreaction</b> {{that science}} fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard {{borrowed}} from the United States Navy when he spent three months in a San Diego hospital in 1943 with the complaints of an ulcer and malaria. Hubbard later wrote, in his autobiography My Philosophy, that he had observed abreactive therapy in the hospital, though in later life he claimed to have made the discovery on his own after being wounded in battle and given up as untreatable.|$|E
50|$|Hypnosis, {{which at}} the end of the 19th century had become a popular phenomenon, in {{particular}} due to Charcot's public hypnotism sessions, was crucial in the invention of psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud, a student of Charcot. Freud later witnessed a small number of the experiments of Liébeault and Hippolyte Bernheim in Nancy. Back in Vienna he developed <b>abreaction</b> therapy using hypnosis with Josef Breuer. When Sigmund Freud discounted its use in psychiatry, in the first half of the last century, stage hypnotists kept it alive more than physicians.|$|E
5000|$|Born into a rich Austrian Jewish family, Anna von Lieben was {{referred}} to Freud in the late eighties for help with a long-standing series of nervous disorders. After referring her for a consulation with Charcot, Freud treated her (with some short-term success) through hypnotism, taking her with him to see Hippolyte Bernheim in 1889 in the (unsuccessful) hope {{that he might be}} able to work a permanent cure. [...] He also used <b>abreaction</b> for temporary relief of her symptoms, noting however that her sense of guilt and self-reproaches would swiftly return after the treatment sessions.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was from}} this {{treatment}} that cathartic <b>abreaction</b> came into {{use as a}} treatment for soldiers following the Second World War. The administration of short-term barbiturates caused disinhibition which facilitated the soldiers' participation in psychotherapy.

By augmenting standard hypnosis with narcotics and [...] "synthesizing" [...] mental states through the power of hypnotic suggestion, a negative mental state could be replaced by a positive one.|$|E
5000|$|... == Psychotherapy == Carbogen {{was once}} used in {{psychology}} and psychedelic psychotherapy {{to determine whether}} a patient would react to an altered state of consciousness or to a sensation of loss of control. Individuals who reacted especially negatively to carbogen were generally not administered other psychotherapeutic drugs for fear of similar reactions. Meduna administered carbogen to his patients to induce <b>abreaction,</b> which, with proper preparation and administration, he found could help clients become free of their neuroses. Carbogen users are said to have discovered unconscious contents of their minds, with the experience clearing away repressed material and freeing the subject for a smoother, more profound psychedelic experience.|$|E

Following on from Pennebaker's original work, {{there has been a}} renewed interest in the therapeutic value of <b>abreaction.</b> This was first discussed by Josef Breuer and Freud in Studies on Hysteria but not much explored since. At the heart of Pennebaker's theory is the idea that actively inhibiting thoughts and feelings about traumatic events requires effort, serves as a cumulative stressor on the body, and is associated with increased physiological activity, obsessive thinking or ruminating about the event, and longer-term disease. However, as Baikie and Wilhelm note, the theory has intuitive appeal but mixed empirical support: ...|$|E

5000|$|This [...] "topographic theory" [...] {{is still}} popular {{in much of}} Europe, {{although}} it has fallen out of favour in much of North America. In 1905, Freud published Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in which he laid out his discovery of so-called psychosexual phases: oral (ages 0-2), anal (2-4), phallic-oedipal (today called 1st genital [...] ) (3-6), latency (6-puberty), and mature genital (puberty-onward). His early formulation included the idea that because of societal restrictions, sexual wishes were repressed into an unconscious state, and that the energy of these unconscious wishes could be turned into anxiety or physical symptoms. Therefore, the early treatment techniques, including hypnotism and <b>abreaction,</b> were designed to make the unconscious conscious in order to relieve the pressure and the apparently resulting symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|In 1895, Josef Breuer and Sigmund Freud {{published}} their Studies on Hysteria, {{which looked}} at a series of case studies where patients presented with dramatic neurological symptoms, such as [...] "Anna O" [...] who suffered headaches, partial paralysis, loss of sensation, and visual disturbances. [...] These symptoms did not conform to known patterns of neurological disease, and neurologists were thus unable to account for symptoms in purely anatomical or physiological terms. Breuer's breakthrough was the discovery that symptomatic relief could be brought about by encouraging patients to speak freely about emotionally difficult aspects of their lives. Experiencing these emotions which had been previously outside of awareness {{seemed to be the}} curative factor. This cure became known as catharsis, and the experiencing of the previously forbidden or painful emotion was <b>abreaction.</b>|$|E
