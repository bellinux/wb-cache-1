Colorectal surgeons must know how to determine and manage the main colonic complications. ObjectiveTo review the clinical features, clinical and pathological staging of graft vs host disease (GVHD), and treatment of patients suffering with colonic complications of human {{bone marrow transplantation}}. Patients and methodsWe have reviewed the records of all patients that received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant and were evaluated at our Colon and Rectal Surgery department due to gastrointestinal symptoms, between January 2007 and January 2012. The study {{was carried out in}} patients who developed colonic complications, all of them with clinical, histopathological or laboratory diagnosis. ResultsThe study group was constituted by 77 patients, 43 male and 34 female patients. We identified colonic complications in 30 patients (38. 9 %); five patients developed intestinal toxicity due to pretransplant chemotherapy (6. 4 %); graft vs. host disease was present in 16 patients (20 %); 13 patients (16. 8 %) developed acute colonic GVHD, and 3 (3. 8 %) chronic GVHD. Infection was identified in 9 patients (11. 6 %). ConclusionsThe three principal colonic complications are the chemotherapy toxicity, GVHD, and superinfection; the onset of symptoms could help to suspect the type of complication (0 – 20 day chemotherapy toxicity, 20 and more GVHD), and infection could appear in any time of transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} {{bone marrow}} failure syndrome. The spectrum of cancer susceptibility in this disorder of telomere biology has not been described. There were more than 500 cases of DC {{reported in the literature}} from 1910 to 2008; the National Cancer Institute (NCI) prospective DC cohort enrolled 50 cases from 2002 to 2007. Sixty cancers were reported in 52 literature cases, while 7 occurred among patients in the NCI DC cohort. The 2 cohorts were comparable in their median overall survival (42 years) and cumulative incidence of cancer (40 %- 50 % by age 50 years). The most frequent solid tumors were head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (40 % of patients in either cohort), followed by skin and anorectal cancer. The ratio of observed to expected cancers (O/E ratio) in the NCI cohort was 11 -fold compared with the general population (P <. 05). Significantly elevated O/E ratios were 1154 for tongue cancer and 195 for acute myeloid leukemia. Survival after bone marrow transplantation for <b>aplastic</b> anemia or <b>leukemia</b> was poor in both cohorts. The frequency and types of cancer in DC are surpassed only by those in Fanconi anemia (FA), indicating that FA and DC have similarly high risks of adverse hematologic and neoplastic events, and patients with these diseases should be counseled and monitored similarly...|$|R
