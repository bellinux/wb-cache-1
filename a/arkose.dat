5|$|The {{stone that}} was quarried is <b>arkose</b> of the Famennian stage. Approximately 360 million years ago, {{the thrust of}} forming Gondwana plates raised the seabed. Meanwhile, an ice age {{occurred}} in regions near the poles. Marine regression allowed sedimentation of detrital sand and clays which left large shoals of hard sandstone with ripple marks, alternating with levels more or less shaley according to their clay's content.|$|E
5|$|The Proterozoic {{sedimentary}} formations of the Pahrump Group were {{deposited on}} these basement rocks. This occurred following uplift and erosion of any earlier sediments from the Proterozoic basement rocks. The Pahrump {{is composed of}} <b>arkose</b> conglomerate (quartz clasts in a concrete-like matrix) and mudstone in its lower part, followed by dolomite from carbonate banks topped by algal mats as stromatolites, and finished with basin-filling sediment derived from the above, including possible glacial till from the hypothesized Snowball Earth glaciation. The very youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are basaltic lava flows.|$|E

25|$|The Bass Formation {{consists}} of interbedded sandstone (<b>arkose),</b> and silty sandstone, prominent interbeds of conglomerate and dolomite, and subordinate interbeds of argillite and limestone.

The dolomites and limestones vary in color from gray to red-gray and sometimes contain biscuit-form and biohermal stromatolite beds. The conglomerates, breccias, sandstones, and argillites vary in color from purple-brown to dark red and reddish brown. Dolomite and limestone dominate the Bass Formation in {{the central part of}} the Grand Canyon, while the sandstone, conglomerate, and argillite dominate the Bass Formation in the eastern part of the Grand Canyon.

500|$|Uplift {{eventually}} {{exposed the}} crystalline complex to erosion. <b>Arkose</b> conglomerate and mudstone {{of the lower}} Crystal Spring Formation were created from muddy debris derived from stream erosion of these uplands. A warm shallow sea spread over the area as the Amargosa aulacogen slowly subsided; thick sequences of lime-rich ooze with abundant colonies of algae called stromatolites were then laid down. Dolomite and limestone resulted, forming the middle part of the Crystal Spring Formation. The upper part was formed after silt and sand destroyed the algal mat, forming siltstone and sandstone.

500|$|The basalt floods of lava {{that now}} form {{much of the}} Metacomet Ridge took place over a span of 20 million years. Erosion and {{deposition}} occurring between the eruptions deposited layers of sediment between the lava flows which eventually lithified into sedimentary rock layers within the basalt. The resulting [...] "layer cake" [...] of basalt and sedimentary rock eventually faulted and tilted upward (see fault-block). Subsequent erosion wore away many of the weaker sedimentary layers {{at a faster rate}} than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today on the western and northern sides of the ridge. Evidence of this layer-cake structure is visible on Mount Norwottuck of the Holyoke Range in Massachusetts. The summit of Norwottuck is made of basalt; directly beneath the summit are the Horse Caves, a deep overhang where the weaker sedimentary layer has worn away at a more rapid rate than the basalt layer above it. Mount Sugarloaf, Pocumtuck Ridge, and Mount Toby, also in Massachusetts, together present a larger [...] "layer cake" [...] example. The bottom layer is composed of <b>arkose</b> sandstone, visible on Mount Sugarloaf. The middle layer is composed of volcanic traprock, most visible on the Pocumtuck Ridge. The top layer is composed of a sedimentary conglomerate known as Mount Toby Conglomerate. Faulting and earthquakes during the period of continental rifting tilted the layers diagonally; subsequent erosion and glacial activity exposed the tilted layers of sandstone, basalt, and conglomerate visible today as three distinct mountain masses. Although Mount Toby and Mount Sugarloaf are not composed of traprock, {{they are part of the}} Metacomet Ridge by virtue of their origin via the same rifting and uplift processes.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePetrographic, major, trace, {{and rare}} earth element {{compositions}} of quartz arenites, <b>arkoses,</b> and siltstones of Neoproterozoic Rabanpalli Formation of Bhima Basin have been investigated to understand the provenance. The quartz arenites, <b>arkoses,</b> and siltstones have large variations in major element concentrations. For example, quartz arenites and <b>arkoses</b> contain the higher SiO 2 (average with one standard deviation being 97 ± 1, 73 ± 2, respectively) and lower Al 2 O 3 (0. 95 ± 0. 4, 9. 6 ± 0. 9, respectively) concentrations than siltstones (SiO 2 = 64 ± 4, Al 2 O 3 = 14 ± 1), which is mainly due {{to the presence of}} quartz and absence of other Al-bearing minerals in relation with rock types. This is also supported by our petrography, since quartz arenites and <b>arkoses</b> contain significant amount of quartz relative to feldspar and lithic fragments. The observed low CIA values and A-CN-K diagram suggest that the sedimentary rocks of Rabanpalli Formation have undergone K-metasomatism. The Co, Ni, Cr, Ba, Zr, Hf, and Th values are higher in siltstones than quartz arenites and <b>arkoses.</b> The Eu/Eu*,(La/Lu) cn, La/Sc, Th/Sc, Th/Co, Th/Cr, Cr/Th ratios, and Cr, Ni, V, and Sc values strongly suggest that these sediments were mainly derived from the felsic source rocks. This interpretation is also supported by the Th/Sc versus Sc bivariate and La-Th-Sc triangular plots. The {{rare earth element}} (REE) patterns of these rocks also support their derivation from felsic source rocks. Further more, these rocks exhibit higher LREE/HREE ratio (8 ± 4) and a significant negative Eu anomaly (0. 77 ± 0. 16), which indicate the felsic igneous rocks as a possible source rock...|$|R
50|$|Since {{it refers}} to grain size rather than {{chemical}} composition, the term is used for example in the classification of clastic carbonatic limestones, as the granulometrically equivalent term sandstone is not appropriate for limestone.

2500|$|The {{lower contact}} of the Dox Formation with the {{underlying}} Shinumo Quartzite {{appears to be}} gradational and {{is marked by a}} change in topographic expression and color. The basal [...] of the Dox Formation directly overlying Shinumo Quartzite consists of predominantly dark green to black, fissile, slope-forming shale that contains thin sandstone beds. This shale makes a distinct notch between the resistant cliff-forming quartzites of the Shinumo Quartzite underlying them and resistant cliff-forming arkosic sandstones of the Dox Formation overlying them. The change in topographic expression, color, and the facies change, from quartz arenite, to mudstone and fine-grained <b>arkose</b> [...] is gradational.

50|$|Quartz is {{commonly}} the dominant mineral component, and some mica is often present. Apart from the mineral content, rock fragments {{may also be}} a significant component. <b>Arkose</b> usually contains small amounts of calcite cement, which causes it to 'fizz' slightly in dilute hydrochloric acid; sometimes the cement also contains iron oxide. <b>Arkose</b> is typically grey to reddish in colour. The sand grains making up an <b>arkose</b> may range from fine to very coarse, but tend toward the coarser end of the scale. Fossils are rare in <b>arkose,</b> due to the depositional processes that form it, although bedding is frequently visible.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Arkose</b> (...) is a {{detrital}} sedimentary rock, specifically {{a type of}} sandstone containing {{at least}} 25% feldspar. Arkosic sand is sand that is similarly rich in feldspar, and thus the potential precursor of <b>arkose.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Oberkirchen Formation’s sediments are {{markedly}} {{distinguished from}} the strata both above and below them. They can be found north and northwest of Abtweiler, towards the Hühnerhof. Prevailing here are beds of red to grey-red, coarsely sandy to conglomeratic <b>arkoses</b> up to several metres thick. Interstratified therein are horizons of reddish fine sandstone {{and to some extent}} also grey siltstones and claystones. These fine-grained horizons are mostly only thinly developed. The <b>arkoses,</b> which exist as detritus (particularly vein quartz, quartzite, lydite, metamorphic rocks and volcanic rocks) as well as bits more than a centimetre across, almost always containing weathered feldspars, are deposits in channels of a many-branched river system that flowed across the Saar-Nahe Basin from southwest to northeast. The fine-grained sediments mainly represent floodplain and horseshoe lake deposits. The Oberkirchen Formation, named after an outlying centre of the municipality of Freisen in the Saarland, contains minerals that are exposed in the Saar-Nahe Basin {{on both sides of the}} Palatine Saddle from southwest to northeast.|$|R
30|$|The medium-grained {{sandstones}} (Fig.  5 c) contain angular to sub-angular quartz, albite, microcline, and lithic fragments {{within a}} clay-sized matrix which classify them as lithic <b>arkoses</b> (Folk 1954).

The primary clay content is lower than in the very-fine and fine-grained sandstones, however, the majority of feldspars have been partially altered to clays.|$|R
50|$|<b>Arkose</b> is {{generally}} formed from the weathering of feldspar-rich igneous or metamorphic, most commonly granitic rocks, which are primarily composed of quartz and feldspar (called 'grus' as a sand).

Stratigraphically higher follow <b>arkoses,</b> dolostones and limestones. A NW-SE striking fault zone originating in Nontron traverses the territory and raises the Northeastern basement block. Movements along this fault zone must {{have been going on}} well into the Pleistocene, because one can observe stream rejuvenation along some of the southwestward-draining creeks.
