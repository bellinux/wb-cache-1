This paper, therefore, first analyses a nonconforming finite element discretization which converges owing to some a priori $L^ 2 $ error estimates even for reduced regularity on non-convex polygonal domains. An equivalence result of that nonconforming finite element scheme to the mixed finite element method (MFEM) leads to the well-posedness of the discrete solution and to a priori error estimates for the MFEM. The explicit residual-based a posteriori error analysis allows some reliable and efficient error control and motivates some adaptive discretization which improves the empirical convergence rates in three computational benchmarks.

Several {{more or less}} {{algebraic}} {{approaches to}} model checking are presented and compared with each other {{with respect to their}} range of applications and their degree of automation. All of them have been implemented and tested in our Haskell-based formal-reasoning system Expander 2. Besides realizing and integrating state-of-the <b>art</b> <b>proof</b> and computation rules the system admits rarely restricted specifications of the models to be checked in terms of rewrite rules and functional-logic programs. It also offers flexible features for visualizing and even animating models and computations. Indeed, this paper does not present purely theoretical work. Due to the increasing abstraction potential of programming languages like Haskell the boundaries between developing a formal system and implementing it or making it ‘user-friendly ’ as well as between systems developed in different communities become more and more obsolete. The individual topics discussed in the paper reflect this observation. ...|$|E

At the age of nineteen El Greco, who was born in Crete in 1541 and was initially an icon painter in the Byzantine tradition, went to Venice. Through study and experiment, and by following the examples of other artists who had achieved artistic mastery and was of proven Catholic orthodoxy, he educated himself as an artist in the Western manner. Even during his years as an apprentice El Greco’s <b>art</b> is <b>proof</b> that he aspired to the highest humanly accessible values exemplified by Renaissance artistic theory, humanism and Christian spirituality — all of which later came to fruition in an unprecedented original combination in Toledo, Spain, where he settled permanently in 1577...|$|R

50|$|Institutio Oratoria is {{effectively}} a comprehensive textbook {{of the technical}} aspects of rhetoric. From the eleventh chapter of Book II to the end of Book XI, Quintilian covers such topics as natural order, the relation of nature and <b>art,</b> invention, <b>proof,</b> emotion, and language. Perhaps most influential among the ideas discussed is his examination of tropes and figures, found in Books 8 and 9. “A trope involves the substitution of one word for another, a figure does not necessarily entail any change either to the order or the meaning of words” (Leitch, 156). An example of a trope would be metaphor, the altering of a word’s meaning. A figure, on the other hand, gives the words a new aspect or greater emotional value. Figures are divided into figures of thought, which may make proof seem more forceful, intensify emotions, or add elegance or ornamentation; and figures of diction, which is further subdivided into “the grammatical, in which the form of the word creates the figure, and the rhetorical, in which the position of the word is the primary factor” (Gwynn, 88).|$|R

40|$|The tree {{method of}} origami design [Lan 96, LD 06] {{has been a}} {{critical}} element {{in the growth of}} complex origami design over the past few decades. This design technique finds an optimal (largest scale) folding of a desired stick figure (metric tree) from a given rectangle of paper. The algorithm is efficient (polynomial time) aside from the first step, which places disks and rivers to reserve paper for flaps. In the special case of a star tree with varying edge lengths (i. e., designing an origami base with several adjacent flaps of different lengths), this problem is equivalent to packing n given disks in a given rectangle. We prove {{for the first time that}} this disk-packing problem is NP-hard, showing that optimal origami design has to remain an <b>art.</b> Our <b>proof</b> is based on a reduction from 3 -PARTITION, which requires partitioning a set of 3 k numbers into k triples of sum at most 1.

40|$|This is a {{proof of}} the strong AI hypothesis, i. e. that {{machines}} can be conscious. It is a phenomenological proof that pattern-recognition and subjective consciousness are the same activity in different terms. Therefore, it proves that essential subjective processes of consciousness are computable, and identifies significant traits and requirements of a conscious system. Since Husserl, many philosophers have accepted that consciousness consists of memories of logical connections between an ego and external objects. These connections are called "intentions. " Pattern recognition systems are achievable technical artifacts. The proof links this respected introspective philosophical theory of consciousness with technical <b>art.</b> The <b>proof</b> therefore endorses the strong AI hypothesis and may therefore also enable a theoretically-grounded form of artificial intelligence called a "synthetic intentionality," able to synthesize, generalize, select and repeat intentions. If the pattern recognition is reflexive, able to operate {{on the set of}} intentions, and flexible, with several methods of synthesizing intentions, an SI may be a particularly strong form of AI.

40|$|Is there, in {{the work}} of Paul Ricœur, as has been said, a form of {{dissymmetry}} between the field of metaphor and that of narrative ? From The Rule of Metaphor, the reference to Northrop Frye and to Nelson Goodman will make it possible to fully grasp the unity of the poetic sphere. The Rule of Metaphor and Time and Narrative are then presented as two twin works. Paul Ricœur explains in particular that lyric poetry itself has the power to produce a plot, and that in this sense “the feeling articulated by the poem is no less heuristic than the tragic tale. ” (The Rule of Metaphor (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1986 [1978]), 245.) Following certain references made in these two twin books – where the dialectic between “discovering and creating,” “finding and projecting” (The Rule of Metaphor, 306) can be read –, it is then possible to make a common thread appear in the analyses where a general idea of the creative act presents itself as a viewpoint.

40|$|Matrix completion, {{where we}} wish to recover a low rank matrix by observing a few entries from it, is a widely studied problem in both theory and {{practice}} with wide applications. Most of the provable algorithms so far on this problem have been restricted to the offline setting where they provide {{an estimate of the}} unknown matrix using all observations simultaneously. However, in many applications, the online version, where we observe one entry at a time and dynamically update our estimate, is more appealing. While existing algorithms are efficient for the offline setting, they could be highly inefficient for the online setting. In this paper, we propose the first provable, efficient online algorithm for matrix completion. Our algorithm starts from an initial estimate of the matrix and then performs non-convex stochastic gradient descent (SGD). After every observation, it performs a fast update involving only one row of two tall matrices, giving near linear total runtime. Our algorithm can be naturally used in the offline setting as well, where it gives competitive sample complexity and runtime to state of the <b>art</b> algorithms.

Efavirenz-based <b>ART</b> was <b>proofed</b> to be beneficial in HIV/tuberculosis co-infection management; however, the drug-drug interactions and toxicity are major concerns. Factors affecting adverse drug events and liver toxicity were investigated in this study. Seventy-one HIV patients with tuberculosis receiving efavirenz (600 mg/day) -based ART were enrolled in the randomized trial: the N 2 R study in Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand. After 12 weeks of ART, 65 rifampicin recipients continued in the analysis of the factors influenced drug toxicity. Plasma efavirenz, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total and direct bilirubins were determined. CYP 2 B 6 and ABCB- 1 polymorphisms were genotyped. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare genotypes and laboratory parameters. CYP 2 B 6 516 TT and ABCB- 1 3435 CT genotypes were found in 9 (13. 85 %) and 33 (50. 77 %) patients, respectively, while six (9. 23 %) carry both - 516 TT and - 3435 CT genotypes.
