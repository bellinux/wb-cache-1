In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted.

25|$|After {{the electoral}} victory of 2011, {{the ruling party}} regained control over both {{chambers}} of Congress. They initiated a period of fiscal reform, which included several tax increases, limits to wage increases, but increases in protectionism and reorganization of state-owned enterprises. Congress passed an <b>anti-terrorism</b> <b>law,</b> criticized for its vague and imprecise terms, that may {{allow it to be}} used against political opponents of the government. Hugo Moyano, main union leader, who was a strong supporter of kirchnerism, began to oppose the President. Moyano would later organize a big protest at Plaza de Mayo, with 30,000 people, requesting the abolition of capital gains tax. However, her close union ally Enrique Omar Suárez, another powerful union leader, has remained in support of her. The Vice President Amado Boudou got involved in a political scandal, suspected of favoring the Ciccone currency printing business. The poor maintenance of rail services led to a rail disaster that left 51 dead and 703 injured.
