Others musicians who helped with the first album were: Joe Hardy (bass, guitars, percussion), John Hampton (drums), Ed DeGarmo (of DeGarmo and Key; organ/synthesizer), Jack Holder (guitar/background vocals), Phil Driscoll (trumpet/fluegel horn). Later members of the band included: Tim Huffman (guitars/vocals) and Scott Allen (rhythm guitar/vocals). Others Musicians who helped with other albums over the years were: Kerry Livgren (of Kansas), Phil Keaggy, Ed Zimmerman, The 2nd Chapter of Acts, The group Sevenfold, and Jimi Jamison. Two more albums came out in 1983, More and Live Forever (recorded at Six Flags Over Georgia).|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 This study {{analyzes}} {{the movement and}} dispersion of airborne volcanic ash within the North Pacific region by simulating volcanic plumes from 22 volcanoes using the PUFF ash-tracking model. The model is run hourly using archived wind field data between 1994 - 2001 {{and the results are}} analyzed with statistical and GIS software. Maps and statistics are generated revealing the distribution of simulated <b>airborned</b> ash particles at 6 and 24 hr intervals, constraining the likely direcion and distance a volcanic ash cloud may propagate from a given volcano. The results indicate wind field charactistics during and after an eruption may have a larger effect on volcanic cloud growth rate than the eruption dynamics. Wind field and statistical analyses show North Pacific ash cloud distribution is strongly affected by the intensity, migration, and location of the Polar jet stream and associated cyclones. Although often used operationally during an eruption crisis, the PUFF model can also be used as an effective research tool and provide airborne ash hazard mitigation for towns, airports, and air traffic within the North Pacific region...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the light reflectance characteristics ofwaterhyacinth [Eichhornia crassipes (Mort.) Solms] and hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata (L. F.) Royle] {{and the application}} of <b>airborned</b> videography with global positioning system (GPS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies for distinguishing and mapping the distribution of these two aquatic weeds in waterways of southern Texas. Field reflectance measurements made at several locations showed that waterhyacinth generally had higher near-infrared (NIR) reflectance than associated plant species and water. Hydrilla had lower NIR reflectance than associated plant species and higher NIR reflectance than water. Reflectance measurements made on hydrilla plants submerged below the water surface had similar spectral characteristics to water. Waterhyacinth and hydrilla could be distinguished in color-infrared (CIR) video imagery where they had bright orange-red and reddish-brown image responses, respectively. Computer analysis of the imagery showed that waterhyacinth and hydrilla infestaions could be quantified. An accuracy assessment performed on the classified image showed an overall accuracy of 87. 7 %. Integration of the GPS with the video imagery permitted latitude/longitude coordinates of waterhyacinth and hydrilla infestation to be recorded on each image. A portion of the Rio Grande River in extreme southern Texas was flown with the video system to detect waterhyacinth and hydrilla infestaions. The GPS coordinates on the CIR video scenes depicting waterhyacinth and hydrilla infestations were entered into a GIS to map the distribution of these two noxious weeds in the Rio Grande River...|$|R

5000|$|COUM were {{frustrated}} with the restrictions imposed on them by the Arts Council as a prerequisite for receiving funding; the Council insisted that they perform in at least eight specifically-chosen venues a year, although COUM felt that this meant performing to the same audiences repeatedly and wished to perform at {{a wide range of}} other locations, such as in fields and on streets. In August 1974 they carried out a spontaneous unauthorised piece of performance art in Brook Green, Hammersmith. Titled <b>Airborn</b> Spells, Landborn Smells, it entailed the group members pretending to be dogs and pushing along a pram containing chicken's heads and bloodied tampons; during the performance, police arrived and put a stop to the event, deeming it to be obscene. In September 1974, COUM were invited to attend the Stadfest in Rottweil, West Germany, and they proceeded with a travel grant from the British Council. Their first performance there was titled Schlimm, which involved P-Orridge and Tutti performing anarchic actions in the street using a range of props. The next day, they followed this with a second street action, All that Glitters is not Kunst, which earned them praise from Bridget Riley and Ernst Jandl, both of whom were present. The acclaim that COUM received at Rottweil established the group's reputation as [...] "one of the most innovative performance art groups then on the London art scene", convincing the Arts Council and British Council to take them more seriously and offer them greater support.|$|E

The model describes the long term average (annual or seasonal) <b>airborn</b> pollutant concentration due to a single source. Because the chemical transformation and physical deposition processes are assumed to be linear in the concentrations, the contributions of many sources may be determined by superposition. Simplified forms of the source-receptor relation are derived for ranges of the model parameters which are appropriate to sulfur oxide species.
