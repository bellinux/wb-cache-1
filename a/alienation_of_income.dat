40|$|The {{implications}} <b>of</b> categorising <b>income</b> as "personal services income" and {{the actual}} meaning of this term have been marked with uncertainty. The Commissioner of Taxation has long asserted that "personal services income" inherently may not be derived by an entity other than the person whose exertions produce the income. In Liedig v FCT (1994) 28 ATR 141, however, Hill J held that {{in the absence of}} a specific legislative provision, there was no basis for the Commissioner 2 ̆ 7 s doctrine. The specific legislative measures Hill J required were put in place through the New Business Tax System (<b>Alienation</b> <b>of</b> Personal Services <b>Income)</b> Act 2000. In certain circumstances this Act prevents interposed entities from deriving personal services income. Such payments are attributed instead to the individual who performs the services. It will also be seen, however, that these provisions do not apply to entities that are conducting a "personal services business". It is submitted that the combined effect of, inter alia, the Act 2 ̆ 7 s definition of "personal services income" and "personal services business" is to give the Act a narrower scope than the Commissioner 2 ̆ 7 s personal services doctrine. Moreover, it will be submitted that the statutory definition <b>of</b> personal services <b>income</b> also suffers from the same flaws that Hill J identified as relevant to the Commissioner 2 ̆ 7 s personal services doctrine. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Nigeria is {{a country}} of high ethnic and {{linguistic}} diversity, threatened by internal fissures and persistent levels of violence. It is argued that, ethnically polarized societies are prone to competitive rent-seeking activities by different groups and will have difficulty agreeing on public goods such as infrastructure, education, and good policies. This in part explains high level <b>of</b> inequity in <b>income</b> distribution and poverty in the country. High potential for large regional differences in economic and social conditions makes Nigeria susceptible to disintegration if the regional differences in standards of living continue to grow. Thus, the study aims to give insight into {{the extent to which}} income inequality has been socially embedded (polarization) in Nigeria, when {{the rich and the poor}} are distinguished not only by their wealth, but also by their language, ethnicity, or other social characteristic and account for the factors responsible.
