25|$|John Ostrom {{described}} the functional morphology of ceratopsid jaws {{for the first}} time. He concluded that they fed on tough gymnosperms with significant fiber contents like palms and cycads. He also interpreted ceratopsid frills as sites for the <b>attachment</b> of enlarged <b>jaw</b> muscles.|$|R
6000|$|The {{point of}} <b>attachment</b> of the <b>jaw</b> has shifted outward, and the [...] {{original}} suspensorial cartilage (the quadrate) {{has taken on}} a new [...] and minor function as the incus of the middle ear-- the squamosal [...] superseding it as the suspensory part.|$|R
2500|$|Ostrom further {{described}} the functional morphology of ceratopsid jaws.

2500|$|... {{probably}} provided <b>attachment</b> {{points for}} <b>jaw</b> muscles.

50|$|Oligokyphus is an extinct {{advanced}} herbivorous cynodont of {{the late}} Triassic to early Jurassic periods. Originally {{considered to be an}} early mammal, it is now classified as a Mammaliamorph (nearly a mammal) because Oligokyphus does not have the mammalian <b>jaw</b> <b>attachments</b> and it retains a vestigial joint between the quadrate bone and the squamosal bone in the skull.|$|R
500|$|Nigersaurus did not {{exhibit the}} same {{modifications}} {{seen in the}} jaws of other dinosaurs with dental batteries, or mammals with elaborate chewing functions. The lower jaw was S-shaped and divided into the subcylindrical transverse ramus, which contained the teeth, and the back ramus, which was more lightweight and was the location {{for most of the}} muscle <b>attachments.</b> The <b>jaws</b> also contained several fenestrae, including three that are not present in other sauropods. The front ends of the jaws had grooves that indicate the presence of a keratinous sheath. Nigersaurus is the only known tetrapod animal to have had jaws wider than the skull and teeth that extended laterally across the front. The snout was even broader than those of the [...] "duck-billed" [...] hadrosaurs.|$|R
50|$|Most {{amphibians}} exhibit {{teeth that}} have a slight <b>attachment</b> to the <b>jaw</b> or acrodont teeth. Acrodont teeth exhibit limited connection to the dentary and have little enervation. This is ideal for organisms who mostly use their teeth for grasping, but not for crushing and allows for rapid regeneration of teeth at a low energy cost. Teeth are usually lost {{in the course of}} feeding if the prey is struggling.  Additionally, amphibians that undergo a metamorphosis develop bicuspid shaped teeth.|$|R
50|$|Vernier, dial {{and digital}} {{calipers}} {{can be used}} with accessories that extend their usefulness. Examples are a base that extends their usefulness as a depth gauge and a <b>jaw</b> <b>attachment</b> that allows measuring the center distance between holes. Since the 1970s a clever modification of the moveable jaw on the back side of any caliper allows for step or depth measurements in addition to external caliper measurements, in similar fashion to a universal micrometer (e.g., Starrett Mul-T-Anvil or Mitutoyo Uni-Mike).|$|R
5000|$|Synapsids were {{originally}} defined {{at the turn}} of the 20th century as one of the four main subclasses of reptiles, on the basis of their distinctive temporal openings. These openings in the cheek bones allowed the <b>attachment</b> of larger <b>jaw</b> muscles, hence a more efficient bite. Synapsids were considered to be the reptilian lineage that led to mammals; they gradually evolved increasingly mammalian features, hence the name [...] "mammal-like reptiles", which became a broad, traditional description for all Paleozoic synapsids.|$|R
50|$|Felids {{tend to have}} lithe and {{flexible}} bodies with muscular limbs. In {{the great majority of}} species, the tail is between a third and a half of the body length, although with some exceptions (for example, the bobcat and margay). The limbs are digitigrade with soft toe pads and protractible claws. Compared with most other mammals, the head is highly domed with a short muzzle. The skull possesses wide zygomatic arches and a large sagittal crest, both of which allow for the <b>attachment</b> of strong <b>jaw</b> muscles.|$|R
50|$|Synapsids evolved a {{temporal}} fenestra behind each eye orbit on the lateral {{surface of the}} skull. It may have provided new <b>attachment</b> sites for <b>jaw</b> muscles. A similar development {{took place in the}} diapsids, which evolved two rather than one opening behind each eye. Originally, the openings in the skull left the inner cranium covered only by the jaw muscles, but in higher therapsids and mammals, the sphenoid bone has expanded to close the opening. This has left the lower margin of the opening as an arch extending from the lower edges of the braincase.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparing}} the skulls of carnivores and herbivores, {{it can be}} seen that the shearing force of the temporalis is somewhat more important to carnivores, which have more room on the braincase (this is not unrelated to carnivoran intelligence) and commonly develop a sagittal crest (running from posterior to anterior on the skull), providing yet additional room for temporalis <b>attachment.</b> Carnivoran <b>jaws</b> can only move on a vertical axis, in an up-and-down motion, and cannot move from side-to-side. The jaw joint in carnivores tends to lie within the plane of tooth occlusion, an arrangement that further emphasizes shearing (as in a pair of scissors). In herbivores, the crushing force of the masseters is relatively more important than is shearing. The jaw joint is generally well above the plane of tooth occlusion, allowing extra room for masseteric attachment on the dentary and causing the rotation of the lower jaw to be translated into straight-ahead crushing force between the teeth of the upper and lower jaws.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of periodontal disease stages {{is not the}} same in both human jaws, parts of the same jaw or in different ages of life. In the sample of 2, 730 sextants, 455 persons 15 + years of age, analysis of {{distribution of}} both periodontal disease and loss of <b>attachment</b> in <b>jaw</b> sextants in different age groups was made, using the Community Periodontal Index (CPI) and Loss of Attachment (LA). Statistical significance testing was checked using the Pearson Chi-Square-test with probability of 95 %. Healthy periodontium is mostly found in upper anterior sextant (36 %, p < 0. 001), and bleeding on probing in lower right sextant (25. 45 %, p < 0. 001). There is most calculus in lower anterior sextant (48. 19 %, p < 0. 001), followed by upper posterior (15 – 17 %). Deep pockets are more often in lower anterior sextant (31. 87 %, p < 0. 001), and upper and lower posterior sextants are without teeth in 18 – 20. 5 % of cases, but lower anterior sextant in only 7. 73 % (p < 0. 001). Cumulative minimal loss of attachment (0 – 3 mm) significantly is more often present in upper anterior sextant (21. 2 %, p < 0. 001), while values 5 – 11 mm are more often in lower anterior sextant (25 – 43 %, p < 0. 001). Loss of attachment 12 mm appears in only 1. 4 % present sextants and it is rear on left jaw side. Significant differences in distribution of both periodontal disease and loss of attachment appear in age 30 +...|$|R
25|$|The jaws were {{apparently}} operated by relatively weak muscles. Ouranosaurus had only small temporal openings behind the eyes, {{from which the}} larger capiti-mandibularis muscle {{was attached to the}} coronoid process on the lower jaw bone. Small rounded horns in front of its eyes made Ouranosaurus the only known horned ornithopod. The back of the skull was rather narrow and could not compensate for the lack of a greater area of <b>attachment</b> for the <b>jaw</b> muscle, that the openings normally would provide, allowing for more power and a stronger bite. A lesser muscle, the musculus depressor mandibulae, used to open the lower jaws, was located {{at the back of the}} skull and was connected to a strongly projecting, broad and anteriorly oblique processus paroccipitalis. Ouranosaurus probably used its teeth to chew up tough plant food. A diet has been suggested of leaves, fruit, and seeds as the chewing would allow to free more energy from high quality food; the wide beak on the other hand indicates a specialisation in eating large amounts of low quality fodder. Ouranosaurus lived in a river delta.|$|R
500|$|Insects and spiders {{were taken}} from {{decaying}} wood, from under bark, mosses and lichens, and from the ground. Huia foraged either alone, in pairs, or in small flocks of up to five, which were probably family groups. The sexual dimorphism of the bill structure gave rise to feeding strategies that differed radically between the sexes. The male used its adze-like bill to chisel and rip into the outer layers of decaying wood, while the female probed areas inaccessible to the male, such as the burrows of insect larvae in living wood. The male had well-developed cranial musculature allowing rotten wood to be chiselled and pried apart by [...] "gaping" [...] motions. There are corresponding differences in the structure and musculature {{of the head and}} neck between males and females. Huia had very well developed depressor jaw muscles, and an occipital crest that provided extra surface for muscle <b>attachment,</b> allowing the <b>jaw</b> to be opened with considerable force. Once the bird had secured a meal, it flew to a perch with the insect in its feet. The huia stripped its meal of any hard parts, then tossed the remainder up, caught, and swallowed it.|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of form-function relationships requires a detailed understanding of anatomical systems. Here we document the 3 -dimensional morphology of the cranial musculoskeletal anatomy in the Australian Laughing Kookaburra Dacelo novaeguineae, {{with a focus}} upon the geometry and <b>attachments</b> of the <b>jaw</b> muscles in this species. The head of a deceased specimen was CT scanned, and an accurate 3 D representation of the skull and jaw muscles was generated through manual segmentation of the CT scan images, and augmented by dissection of the specimen. We identified 14 major jaw muscles: 6 in the temporal group (M. adductor mandibulae and M. pseudotemporalis), 7 in the pterygoid group (M. pterygoideus dorsalis and M. pterygoideus ventralis), and the single jaw abductor M. depressor mandibulae. Previous descriptions of avian jaw musculature are hindered by limited visual representation and inconsistency in the nomenclature. To address these issues, we: (1) present the 3 D model produced from the segmentation process as a digital, fully interactive model {{in the form of}} an embedded 3 D image, which can be viewed from any angle, and within which major components can be set as opaque, transparent, or hidden, allowing the anatomy to be visualised as required to provide a detailed understanding of the jaw anatomy; (2) provide a summary of the nomenclature used throughout the avian jaw muscle literature. The approach presented here provides considerable advantages for the documentation and communication of detailed anatomical structures in a wide range of taxa...|$|R

The Entelodontidae is a family of extinct bunodont artiodactyls that are well known for the unusual derivations to their skull and mandible. The results of this study confirm that all members of the Entelodontidae possess a 3 - 1 - 4 - 3 / 3 - 1 - 4 - 3 tooth formula with a lobed cristid obliqua and precingulum ectoflexus on M 2 /. The largest upper premolar is P 3 /, and M 3 / has a derived hypoconulid. The skull presents a postorbital bar, a vertical flange on the superior margin of the temporal bone, and a pendulous flange derived from the inferior margin of the jugal (zygomatic) bone. The mandible contains at least one pair of tubercles on the inferior margin of the ramus and the toothrow is similar in height to the position of the temporal-mandibular joint. The bones of the manus and pes are unfused. The results of taxonomic analysis provisionally support 37 of 56 named species in 7 of 23 named, and as yet one unnamed, genera. Previous errors in taxonomic nomenclature and published misidentifications are highlighted for clarification. Multiple revisions are discussed at both generic and specific levels although none are formally presented. Phylogenetic analysis of 53 characters on 8 clades of entelodonts resulted in a single most parsimonious tree at 64 steps. The species Archaeotherium coarctatum is supported as a clade that is distinct from all other genera of entelodonts, including Archaeotherium. The jugal flanges and mandibular tubercles are most likely derivations that offered the <b>attachment</b> of <b>jaw</b> musculature, which provided stability during wide gape and while crushing hard objects. Because the flanges display both intraspecific and ontogenetic variability, caution should be exercised when using them in systematic descriptions of entelodont groups. Entelodonts were a water-dependent species that are found in association with large perissodactyls such as brontotheres, rhinos, and chalicotheres. Lateral grooves near the gum-line of incisors and canines are interpreted as the result of stripping lianas for supplemental water. Food may have included an omnivorous diet that favored the scavenging of large carcasses. The presence of healed bite-mark trauma on the frontal, lachrymal, and maxillary bones suggests that some populations of entelodonts engaged in non-lethal intraspecific combat. **This dissertation includes a CD that is compound (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

40|$|Weaning {{represents}} a challenging transition for young mammals, one particularly difficult for species coping with extreme conditions during feeding. Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) experience such extreme conditions imposed by intense feeding competition {{during which the}} ability to consume large quantities of food quickly is highly advantageous. As adult spotted hyenas have massive skulls specialized for durophagy and can feed very rapidly, young individuals are likely at a competitive disadvantage until that specialized morphology is completely developed. Here we document developmental changes in skull size, shape, and mechanical advantage of the jaws. Sampling an ontogenetic series of Crocuta skulls from individuals {{ranging in age from}} 2 months to 18 years, we use linear measurements and geometric morphometrics to test hypotheses suggesting that size, limited mechanical advantage of the <b>jaws,</b> and/or limited <b>attachment</b> sites for <b>jaw</b> muscles might constrain the feeding performance of juveniles. We also examine skull development in relation to key life history events, including weaning and reproductive maturity, to inquire whether ontogeny of the feeding apparatus is slower or more protracted in this species than in carnivores not specialized for durophagy. We find that, although mechanical advantage reaches maturity in hyenas at 22 months, adult skull size is not achieved until 29 months of age, and skull shape does not reach maturity until 35 months. The latter is nearly 2 years after mean weaning age, and more than 1 year after reproductive maturity. Thus, skull development in Crocuta is indeed protracted relative to that in most other carnivores. Based on the skull features that continue to change and to provide additional muscle attachment area, protracted development may be largely due to development of the massive musculature required by durophagy. These findings may ultimately shed light on the adaptive significance of the unusual “role-reversed” pattern of female dominance over males in this species. J.

2500|$|The rear of {{the skull}} is {{dominated}} by a large eye socket, often covering the {{major part of the}} rear side surface. In the socket, a large scleral ring is present; this is a circular structure of small, overlapping bone segments protecting the eye against the water pressure. Both in the relative and absolute senses, ichthyosaurs have the largest eye sockets of all known vertebrates. The other rear skull elements are typically so compressed and fused that they are difficult to identify. The top rear element of the skull was usually assumed to be the supratemporal bone, while the squamosal and quadratojugal were sometimes fused. However, in 1968, Alfred Sherwood Romer stated that the presumed supratemporal was in fact the squamosal, which was in 1973 confirmed by McGowan. In 1990, though, John Steve Massare convinced most researchers that the original identification had been the correct one after all. The supratemporal forms the rear rim of the supratemporal opening; a lower temporal opening at the side is lacking. The front rim of the supratemporal opening is typically formed by the postfrontal; only with the very basal Utatsusaurus the postorbital and the squamosal still reach the edge. Between the paired supratemporal openings, the skull roof is narrow; some species have a longitudinal crest on it as an <b>attachment</b> for the <b>jaw</b> muscles. Basal Ichthyopterygia have a parietal eye opening between the paired parietal bones. With ichthyosaurs proper, this opening moves to the front, first to the border between the parietals and the frontals and ultimately between the frontals, a condition shown by derived species. [...] Postparietal and tabular bones are lacking. Often, the bones {{of the back of the}} skull and the palate are incompletely ossified, apparently having partly remained cartilage. The occipital condyle is typically very convex. The stapes, the bone transmitting sound waves from the eardrum to the middle ear, is elongated and not pierced by a foramen. Pterygoid teeth are typically lacking.|$|R
5000|$|Ouranosaurus had a skull 67 cm long. The {{head was}} very {{elongated}} and flat, {{and carried a}} much longer snout than its relative Iguanodon: this rostrum was not curved but straight, off-set {{from the back of}} the skull in an oblique line. The snout was toothless and covered in a horny sheath during life, forming a very wide beak together with a comparable sheath on the short predentary bone at the extreme front of the lower jaws. However, after a rather large diastema with the beak, there were large batteries of cheek teeth on the sides of the jaws: the gaps between the teeth crowns were filled by the points of a second generation of replacement teeth, the whole forming a continuous surface. Contrary to the situation with some related species, a third generation of erupted teeth was lacking. There were twenty-two tooth positions in both lower and upper jaw, for a total of eighty-eight. The jaws were apparently operated by relatively weak muscles. Ouranosaurus had only small temporal openings behind the eyes, from which the larger capiti-mandibularis muscle was attached to the coronoid process on the lower jaw bone.
