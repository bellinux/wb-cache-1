25|$|In general, though, Machen {{thoroughly}} disliked work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper,</b> and it {{was only}} the need to earn money for his family which kept him at it.

B. Wyndham Lewis, and Jerome K. Jerome. Machen's dismissal from the Evening News in 1921 came as a relief in one sense, though it caused financial problems.
