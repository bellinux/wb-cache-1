5|$|A {{prophylactic}} method introduced {{after the}} North Sea Flood of 1953 is {{the construction of}} dams and storm-surge barriers (flood barriers). They <b>are</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge. Major storm surge barriers are the Oosterscheldekering and Maeslantkering in the Netherlands, which {{are part of the}} Delta Works project; the Thames Barrier protecting London; and the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia.|$|E

The frontiers between Zones Three, Four and Five <b>are</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> people and {{knowledge}} are flowing between them. Previously stagnant, the three Zones are now filled with enquiry, inspiration and renewal.|$|E
5|$|His eyes <b>are</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> {{his skin}} is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E

5|$|Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, {{emphasizing}} platforming and gameplay. Their homing attack can lock onto robots {{created by}} Eggman and G.U.N., {{and they can}} grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's levels are slower and oriented towards multi-directional shooting; they are confined to mechs {{in which they can}} jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's levels <b>are</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. Their search is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, digging into them to find power-ups.|$|E
5|$|Utilising the Game Boy Horror, {{players can}} access {{a map of}} the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what doors <b>are</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror {{automatically}} indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device also keeps track of any treasure that Luigi has found - rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, gems, gold bars and so forth, hidden within items and even in a chest that appears when the ghosts are cleared out, which Luigi can draw out and then suck up with the Poltergust; if a ghost harms Luigi, he will drop a small portion of collected treasure that he will need to recover before it disappears. After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the device can be used to find each one hiding in a room, through a beeper sound and a flashing yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one; Boos can only be located in rooms that have become lit after their ghosts have been cleared out. Boos are trickier to deal with, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they can hide in that can fool the Horror, and will escape into other rooms if they can, forcing the player to chase after them.|$|E

50|$|The {{upper end}} of the Kalyuka <b>is</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> {{although}} it has a built-in fipple to produce sound, a player should also partly close the opening of the tube with the tongue. The lower end of the tube <b>is</b> also <b>open</b> <b>and</b> occasionally there <b>is</b> a small side hole near the end. The side hole and/or end <b>are</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> closed while playing to produce different notes (like the Slovak Koncovka). Higher tones are reached through over blowing.|$|R
25|$|An {{interior}} algebra {{is called}} Boolean if all its elements <b>are</b> <b>open</b> (<b>and</b> hence clopen). Boolean interior algebras {{can be identified}} with ordinary Boolean algebras as their interior and closure operators provide no meaningful additional structure. A special case is the class of trivial interior algebras which are the single element interior algebras characterized by the identity 0 = 1.|$|E
25|$|At {{the south}} end the {{platforms}} <b>are</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> lit by modern double lampposts. Just south of the island platform's end is a pyramid-roofed original signal tower. There are other signal towers and service rooms, faced in corrugated metal, south of the other platforms. A flagman's structure is beneath {{the north end of}} the island platform canopy.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{sliding doors}} <b>are</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> closed either by power, spring, or by a sensor. This {{eliminates}} the need for a person to open or close a door by turning a doorknob or pressing up against a bar on the door itself. Automatic sliding doors are commonly found at entrance and exits of supermarkets, department stores, and airport terminals. In 1954, Dee Horton and Lew Hewitt co-invented the automatic sliding door.|$|E

25|$|Fresh oysters must {{be alive}} just before {{consumption}} or cooking. There {{is only one}} criterion: the oyster must be capable of tightly closing its shell. Open oysters should be tapped on the shell; a live oyster will close up and is safe to eat. Oysters which <b>are</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> unresponsive are dead and must be discarded. Some dead oysters, or oyster shells which are full of sand may be closed. These make a distinctive noise when tapped, and are known as 'clackers'.|$|E
25|$|Anioma social {{structure}} {{is dominated by}} the use of lineages which are based loosely on the concept of uno, eboh', and idumu, which are major blood lineages; while ogbe and obodo <b>are</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> much more political. Uno is a small family unit comprising husband, wife, and children. The next lineage was Eboh, which includes the primary or nuclear family, the daughter or son in law, and the grandparents and the grandchildren. The Ogbe is a large structure which allowed non-blood relatives; it comprises the Idumu and some outsiders and it is best classified as a quarter in terms of demographics. The maximal concept is one that looks like a small town; this is the Obodo.|$|E
25|$|Modern marching {{bands and}} drum corps use multi-tenors, which consist of several {{single-headed}} tom-toms {{played by a}} single drummer. The bottoms of the shells <b>are</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> beveled to project {{the sound of the}} drum forward. Double-ply PET film heads are typically used for increased sound projection and durability. They are typically played with wooden- or aluminum-shafted mallets that have disc-shaped heads made of nylon. Mallets with felt or fleece heads, drum sticks, drum brushes, and other implements are occasionally used to achieve different timbres. The playing technique used for multi-tenors is somewhat different from that of a snare drum, and more like that of a timpani because the drumhead is struck closer to the edge instead of in the center. This creates a sound with more overtone, as opposed to striking the drumhead in the center, which produces a very short, dull sound with few overtones that is considered undesirable for multi-tenors.|$|E

25|$|On {{the fifteenth}} day {{the realms of}} Heaven and Hell and {{the realm of the}} living <b>are</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> Chinese would perform rituals to transmute and absolve the sufferings of the deceased. Intrinsic to the Ghost Month is {{ancestor}} worship, where traditionally the filial piety of descendants extends to their ancestors even after their deaths. Activities during the month would include preparing ritualistic food offerings, burning incense, and burning joss paper, a papier-mache form of material items such as clothes, gold and other fine goods for the visiting spirits of the ancestors. Elaborate meals would be served with empty seats for each of the deceased in the family treating the deceased as if they are still living. Ancestor worship is what distinguishes Qingming Festival from Ghost Festival because the latter includes paying respects to all deceased, including the same and younger generations, while the former includes only older generations. Other festivities may include, buying and releasing miniature paper boats and lanterns on water, which signifies giving directions to the lost ghosts and spirits of the ancestors and other deities.|$|E
