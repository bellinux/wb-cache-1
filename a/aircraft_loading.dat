500|$|In 1949 Halvorsen {{received}} the Cheney Award, {{given by the}} Air Force to recognize humanitarian action, from General Hoyt S. Vandenberg for the inception of Operation 'Little Vittles'. Other prominent awards include the Legion of Merit, Ira Baker [...] "Fellow" [...] Award by the USAF Chief of Staff General John Dale Ryan; Air Force Sergeants Association [...] "Americanism" [...] Award (some previous recipients were Bob Hope and President George Bush); [...] Freedom Award from City of Provo, Utah; The Distinguished Humanitarian Award from the Institute of German Relations; the Eric Warburg Pries, 1998; and the Patriot Award from Brigham Young University ROTC. In 2014, Halvorsen became a recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award that Congress can give to a civilian. He {{was inducted into the}} Airlift/Tanker Hall of Fame and the Utah Aviation Hall of Fame in May 2001. The United States Air Force has helped cement Colonel Halvorsen's airlift legacy by naming its next generation, 25,000-pound capacity <b>aircraft</b> <b>loading</b> vehicle in his honor. The Air Force has also created the Col. Gail Halvorsen Award for outstanding air transportation support in the logistics readiness career field. In 2008, Halvorsen was honored as Grand Marshal of the German-American Steuben Parade in New York City, where he was celebrated by tens of thousands of spectators on Fifth Avenue.|$|E

Also, {{the response of}} a fatigue meter to a random load sequence was simulated. Fatigue damage for the different load histories was computed using material constants for an Al-Cu alloy. Computed fatigue damage was relatively insensitive to the algorithm used for load sequence generation from combat <b>aircraft</b> <b>load</b> exceedance curves. Fatigue meter data based damage estimates were, however,sometimes unconservative...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} {{problems}} associated with aircraft sustainment related issues and illustrates how cracks that grow from small naturally occurring material discontinuities in operational aircraft behave. The example discussed in this paper, which is associated with crack growth under a representative maritime <b>aircraft</b> <b>load</b> spectrum, when taken in conjunction with previous studies into cracks growing under combat <b>aircraft</b> <b>load</b> spectra illustrates how for cracks that grow from naturally occurring material discontinuities under such operational load spectra there is generally little crack closure so that the crack growth history from its initial equivalent pre-crack size (EPS) through to final failure can be easily and accurately computed...|$|R

50|$|Taxiway bridges are unusually wide {{relative}} to their length, and <b>aircraft</b> <b>loading</b> cannot be assumed to be distributed evenly to a bridge superstructure's web, so different modeling is required in these bridges' structural design. In cold climates, provisions for anti-icing must be made. In the U.S., regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration must be met. And there are various other differences versus typical bridges covered by AASHTO standards.|$|E

50|$|A {{longitudinal}} stabilizer is used {{to maintain}} the aircraft in longitudinal balance, or trim: it exerts a vertical force at a distance so that the summation of pitch moments about {{the center of gravity}} is zero. The vertical force exerted by the stabilizer to this effect varies with flight conditions, in particular according to the aircraft lift coefficient and wing flaps deflection which both affect the position of the center of lift, and with the position of the aircraft center of gravity (which changes with <b>aircraft</b> <b>loading).</b> Transonic flight makes special demands on horizontal stabilizers, since the crossing of the sound barrier is associated with a sudden move aft of the center of lift.|$|E
