These dance-pop R beats are the same light and noncommittal ones you've become accustomed to with artists like, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier,</b> Rihanna and Chris Brown, along with the party feel of The Pussycat Dolls and other contemporaries.

5000|$|Thornton Wilder {{said that}} the book poses the question: [...] "Is there a {{direction}} and meaning in lives beyond the individual's own will?" [...] Describing the sources of his novel, Wilder explained that the plot was inspired in its external action by a one-act play Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement by French playwright Prosper Mérimée, which takes place in Latin America and one of whose characters is a courtesan. However, the central idea of the work, the justification {{for a number of}} human lives that comes up {{as a result of the}} sudden collapse of a bridge, stems from friendly arguments with my father, a strict Calvinist. Strict Puritans imagine God all too easily as a petty schoolmaster who minutely weights guilt against merit, and they overlook God's 'Caritas' which is more all-encompassing and powerful. God's love has to transcend his just retribution. But in my novel I have left this question unanswered. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier,</b> we can only pose the question correctly and clearly, and have faith one will ask the question in the right way. When asked if his characters were historical or imagined, Wilder replied, [...] "The Perichole and the Viceroy are real people, under the names they had in history street singer named Micaela Villegas. Most of the events were invented by me, including the fall of the bridge." [...] He based the Marquesa's habit of writing letters to her daughter on his knowledge of the great French letter-writer, Madame de Sévigné.|$|E

40|$|Piaget famously {{remarked that}} logic is the {{morality}} of thought, {{and it is in}} this sense that Wolfgang Wagner's (1994 a) recent paper on The Fallacy of Misplaced Intentionality in Social Representation Research presents us with a kind of morality tale whose object is to teach us {{some of the things we}} should avoid.

The center of Wagner's argument is that the use of verbally assessed beliefs as an independent measure of a representation which can be used to predict some subsequent behaviour reflects the importation of a misplaced intentionality into s ci l representations research. This intentionality, with its assumption of a causal relation flowing from representation to behaviour, is misplaced because it misconstrues the relations between representation and behaviour. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier,</b> Wagner establishes this argument through a consideration of the logic of scientific research, not least because this is the traditional idio...|$|E

40|$|A {{new model}} for land use {{planning}} Cue: Africa is well known as a continent rich in natural resources. However, if those resources are to bring prosperity and development, how they are used and managed is clearly critical. But who {{has the right to}} decide how the resources should be used? Local communities? Town councils? Government ministries or planning departments? An obvious answer is that it depends on who owns the land, but in many areas ownership is disputed. In much of rural South Africa, as elsewhere, two different systems of land ownership exist side-by-side, the formal system based on legal documents, and traditional systems rooted in local culture. Not surprisingly, reaching agreements on how land should be used in this context can be extremely difficult, and may lead to open conflict. According to Pat Luckin, a land use planner working in South Africa, preventing conflict and developing agreement over land use depends on involving local communities in planning, and creating better communication between the communities and other interest groups. In recent work with two communities, Pat has experimented with a new approach which she believes has greatly improved that communication process, and has given people a much better understanding of the resources that they have. She spoke to Susanna Thorp about the new approach and the way it has been used. IN:		?I {{think the most important thing}} ? OUT:		? reduction of conflict in certain areas. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 38 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Pat Luckin, on some new approaches to {{land use planning}} that have recently been piloted in South Africa. Transcript Luckin	I think the most important thing to realise when one deals with planning processes is trust, and that people participate in the planning process. Now that?s quite difficult with the formal planning tools that we have which are quite abstract and often come from other countries and sometimes aren?t applicable to our local conditions. So what we?ve done is we built three-dimensional models, physical models, so people can physically see the land and touch a model. Immediately people then identify where they live, where their schools are, where the rivers are, where the hills are, where the forests are etc. Thorp	So how has that made a difference in the way that people have worked together and if they have identified these things, how have they then used those results? Luckin	What we have done in our communities is we have brought people together, traditional leaders, women, other community members, people with disabilities, to make sure that we have a good range of people living in that particular area and ensure that they can participate on how land in that particular area should be used. Obviously one does this in an area where people are demanding a change in land use or more appropriate land use or where there are some conflicts in land use and people need to resolve these problems. So bring all the different parties together around the model and they just start discussing how they want to use different pieces of land. Thorp	Now you mentioned that there had previously been a lot of conflict. Has this process allowed some of those conflicts to be resolved, can you give me examples? Luckin	Often when one has large areas of land, like particularly in South Africa, there is often distrust or lack of communication between different sectors of communities, between traditional leaders and municipalities, and what these particular projects have facilitated is that by bringing the people together around the model, we?ve had municipal officials, we?ve had traditional leaders, we?ve had elders and women all talking around the same issues and agreeing and understanding one another. And I think that the modeling process has huge potential for helping people to genuinely communicate with one another and realise that they are much closer to one another than they had thought before, and that they all have the same intention which is the management of land and the development of a particular area concerned. Thorp	So a very powerful tool obviously, but you?ve only used it in two communities? Luckin		Very small, yes. Thorp	How would you take this process on now? Are there lessons that you have learned that you would perhaps do differently or is this something that you would like to try elsewhere? Luckin	Oh yes well the responsibility of using models in a community are very huge. So <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier</b> they must be based on trust. There is certain information in communities relating to biodiversity, relating to plants and animals which have specific significance to communities which they might not want to divulge and they have the right to keep that information private and within the community and not make it public, particularly relating to medicinal plants where people invariably get exploited. Next time I go into a community we would write up protocols of how the information would be managed, who would own the information, how much of it would become mapped in a public map for public consumption and how much of it would be kept within the community. It does not solve all problems there are obviously lots of other land legal problems which require other kinds of solutions but it definitely can facilitate the reduction of conflict in certain areas.

40|$|Increasing {{biosecurity}} when outbreaks occur Cue: Cross-border {{trade in}} poultry and poultry products {{is big business}} in much of Africa. However despite being {{a good source of}} income for the traders, and a valuable source of meat and eggs for consumers, there can be risks in this cross-border trade. Spreading disease from one country to another is one risk. For example, when Nigeria first experienced outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian flu in early 2006, neighbouring countries became very concerned. For this reason, when outbreaks of contagious livestock disease occur, governments can decide to impose a ban on all imports of the livestock concerned, at least until the outbreak is controlled. However, few governments are can make import bans completely effective; they lack the trained staff to do it. Controlling movements of livestock within a country is even more difficult. But controlling diseases like avian flu is in everyone?s interest, and it is everyone?s responsibility to prevent the disease spreading. Farmers, for instance, must know {{the right thing to do}} if they suspect one or more of their birds has caught or died from the virus. In a recent interview, Excello Zidana spoke to Michael Nkosi, a lecturer at Malawi?s Natural Resources College, and began by asking what farmers should do if one of their birds shows symptoms of the virus. IN:		?I would advise that the ?? OUT:		??Thank you very much. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 56 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And asking the questions was Excello Zidana. The interview comes from a radio resource pack on avian flu produced by CTA. Transcript Nkosi	I would advise that the first thing that farmers should do is actually to report to the nearest veterinary station. That is the first thing, so that maybe officers should come, verify the signs and symptoms, if there is need undertake sampling, take birds to the lab and then they would do analysis. But unfortunately in Malawi we may not have the capacity to test for avian influenza. But the other thing that farmers need to do is to intensify bio-security measures. They should not just allow their workers to move from house to house if they have several units of birds. Maybe they should allocate specific attendants to a specific house so that the virus is not passed on to safe birds. Zidana		How does the virus spread? Nkosi	The virus can spread in many ways. It could be from inanimate objects like farm equipment. If you just borrow feeders from any how, drinkers from any unknown farm you can spread the virus. From clothes of people, boots [...] . So I should emphasise that protective wear is very important and should be specific to a unit. Zidana	Let?s look at the handling of the sick birds, how does a farmer handle sick birds from his farm? Nkosi	One, he should first of all isolate the sick birds, confine them separately. But at the same time he should put on protective wear, even a mask if it is available, because you never know, he maybe working with a strain of avian influenza virus that can affect man. So you need to be protected whether it is confirmed or not. Zidana	And if this farmer wants his dead birds to be tested from any lab around, how does he carry the dead bird? Nkosi	He can put the birds in a plastic bag that is having no holes or double plastic bag, the whole live bird push it there and then transport it to the lab. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier</b> on that in this country we do not have the capacity to examine and diagnose for this virus. Then the lab knows how to safely package international samples to referral labs. Zidana	Now let?s turn to disposing of the dead birds. How should the process of disposing of the dead birds carried out? Nkosi	If it is by mass slaughter, if it is the government policy to say we want to control the outbreak by mass slaughter, one, you can bury very deep: two metres deep, three metres. Or you can dig a shallow pit and then push all the birds there, put diesel and then burn. Zidana		Why three metres Mr Nkosi? Nkosi	Because some carnivores like dogs, cats, jackals, they can jump into a shallow pit, lift the animal and then they can scavenge and spread the virus. Zidana	People who know avian flu very well have indicated that the virus can survive in birds? droppings. What measures should be taken when using items such as cages, bicycles or even vehicle tyres trying to go to an area where people suspect that there could be this outbreak? Nkosi	The first thing is to institute wheel baths just outside the farm. You need to have a wheel bath that has disinfectant and as the vehicle is moving across all the manure will remain there. But at the same time you need to spray the whole vehicle canopy, even the tyres, so that you do not take the manure. Because you never know, you can carry the virus. About the facilities like cages, you need to decontaminate and remove all the manure if it is there, so that you move a safe product. Zidana	In countries like Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya, people know that birds migrate from one region to another. Are there special rules to guard maybe the movement of wild birds from one country to another, as a region or as a continent? Nkosi	That is a very tricky question. You know natural birds, you cannot govern them, but you definitely know the routes that they take from one continent to the other. The only bet is actually to avoid contact of domesticated birds with the wild birds along the shores of Lake Malawi or any other ocean in this region. We need to advise our farmers, maybe to intensively rear birds that are domestic to avoid that contact. Zidana	Lastly how or what do you advise people involved in business of poultry, cross-border business people trying to bring in maybe birds or meat from birds? What do you advise them to do if they are doing that in the event of rumours that there should be avian flu within the region? Nkosi	The only advice that I can give is they need to follow proper protocol. Get all the licenses for importation. They should desist from smuggling because avian influenza can not only affect their consumers; even themselves if it is brought into this country, we are all at risk. So what we need to do is desist from smuggling or black marketing and then follow proper channels. Zidana	That was Mr Michael Nkosi who is an Animal Scientist at Natural Resources College, thank you Mr Nkosi. Nkosi		Thank you very much. End of track.
