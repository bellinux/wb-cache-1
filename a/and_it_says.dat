5|$|The oldest {{annotation}} of {{the stone}} is in a church inventory from 1829, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> that the stone was illegible. Ljungström documented in 1861 {{that it was in}} the rock fence with the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, it was still in the same spot. Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove the stone from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found the stone raised in the cemetery.|$|E

25|$|Based on {{a report}} by {{journalist}} Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors they must perform surgical sterilizations on women. One doctor reported, “It's ruling number 1098 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> that after two children, in some areas after three, a woman should be sterilized.”, {{in a loss of}} the former surface decency of Central Asian mores in regard of female chastity. In 2010, the Ministry of Health passed a decree stating all clinics in Uzbekistan should have sterilization equipment ready for use. The same report also states that sterilization is to be done on a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient. In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors to sterilize women in order to control the population. Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need to sterilize. These orders are passed on to them through their bosses and, allegedly, from the government.|$|E
25|$|Lou Vincent and his New Zealand flayed a {{substandard}} Zimbabwe to {{all corners}} as they routed {{their way to}} the third highest score of all time in One Day International cricket. Despite the match being shortened to 44 overs a side following the discovery of a damp patch on the Bulawayo pitch, New Zealand hit runs right from the outset, and Zimbabwe did not take a wicket until the 28th over. By then, Vincent and Stephen Fleming had taken the score to 207 – already a fearsome total, and then you consider that 16 overs remained. No Zimbabwean bowler escaped the carnage, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> something that debutant Anthony Ireland recorded the best bowling figures – still conceding 52 runs in his seven overs. Andy Blignaut, regarded as one of Zimbabwe's best bowlers, was dispatched for 96 runs – nine runs off the most expensive of all time. When the dust had settled, New Zealand had made 397 for 5 – one run short of Sri Lanka's nine-year-old record, which was set in 50 overs, and Brendon McCullum had equalled the fastest fifty for New Zealand, off 21 balls.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right.

500|$|Even the {{truncated}} {{version was}} met with considerable controversy by UK film critics. Dilys Powell in The Sunday Times complained [...] "...17th century hanging, burning, raping, screaming, and Vincent Price as England's prize torture-overseer. Peculiarly nauseating." [...] The Guardian felt the film was filled with [...] "gratuitous sadism." [...] Margaret Hinxman of The Sunday Telegraph dismissed it as a [...] "sadistic extravaganza." [...] Nonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades. John Russell Taylor in the London Times Saturday Review said the film [...] "...is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything else... There is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject... Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising. He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period." [...] Films and Filming noted, [...] "Witchfinder General has no explicit 'message', but it does {{say something about the}} springs of despair <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> it forcefully. It is a very frightening film... Matthew Hopkins is the best of Price's recent performances. Witchfinder General is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one..." [...] Monthly Film Bulletin observed, [...] "Not since Peeping Tom has a film aroused such an outcry about nastiness and gratuitous violence as this one... the tone of the film is oddly muted, with torture and death in plenty, but viewed matter-of-factly and without stress... Throughout the whole film there is a vivid sense of a time out of joint, which comes as much from the stray groups of soldiers who skirmish against unseen attackers in the woods or hang wearily about by the wayside waiting for battle to commence, as from the bloody crimes committed in the name of religion by Matthew Hopkins." ...|$|E

Speed has explained her character’s initial attraction to Barry: [...] "I think {{it has a lot}} to do with her childhood. Natalie really adored her dad but he couldn't put up with that horrible wife of his, Andrea… and so he walked out on the family. Andrea is a total nightmare control freak, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> a lot about who Natalie is, why she had no confidence in herself. Her mother probably emotionally abused her. So Barry represented safety and a secure family environment…She feels safe with him and she felt she made the right choice at the time, although of course she was apprehensive about it.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The founder’s {{inscription}} {{was written}} on the inner west wall, above {{the entrance to the}} church, covering the entire width of the lintel. The text was written in four rows on the white basis with black letters of unequal size <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> that several persons participated in the construction and painting process of church. The text begins with trinity invocation on Church Slavonic language: “Izvolenijem Otca I savršenijem Sina I sapospešenijem”, which was normal for the founding labels of the Serbian and Bulgarian people in the Middle Ages. At the start, before the first word was preceded a small painted cross saved partially (lat. Invocatio symbolica) which in the Middle Ages [...] usually began and ended the inscriptions of this kind. Strangeness of founders inscription in Staničenje is that a mention of the Bulgarian Emperor brings us to the name of Vidin master Balaur. Also, the label reveals the fact which was unprecedented in other already known sources. We discover here that Balaur was co-ruler, which is important proof of its real power within the Bulgarian elite.|$|E
2500|$|This dynasty is {{dated to}} the 26th century BC. Meskalamdug {{is the first}} archaeologically {{recorded}} king (Lugal from lu=man, gal=big) {{of the city of}} Ur. He was succeeded by his son Akalamdug, and Akalamdug by his son Mesh-Ane-pada. Mesh-Ane-pada is the first king of Ur listed on the king list, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> he defeated Lugalkildu of Uruk. He also seems to have subjected Kish, thereafter assuming the title [...] "King of Kish" [...] for himself. This title would be used by many kings of the preeminent dynasties for some time afterward. King Mesilim of Kish is known from inscriptions from Lagash and Adab stating that he built temples in those cities, where he seems to have held some influence. He is also mentioned in some of the earliest monuments from Lagash as arbitrating a border dispute between Lugal-sha-engur, ensi (high priest or governor) of Lagash, and the ensi of their main rival, the neighbouring town of Umma. Mesilim's placement before, during, or after the reign of Mesannepada in Ur is uncertain, owing to the lack of other synchronous names in the inscriptions, and his absence from the king list.|$|E
