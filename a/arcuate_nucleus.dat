5|$|The <b>arcuate</b> <b>nucleus</b> and the periventricular {{nucleus of}} the {{hypothalamus}} have dopamine neurons that form an important projection—the tuberoinfundibular pathway which goes to the pituitary gland, where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine produced by neurons in the <b>arcuate</b> <b>nucleus</b> is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland. The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, {{in the absence of}} dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion. In the context of regulating prolactin secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E
5|$|The <b>arcuate</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of <b>arcuate</b> <b>nucleus</b> neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} pathophysiological mechanisms {{involved in the}} development and maintenance of obesity. This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman's laboratory. While leptin and ghrelin are produced peripherally, they control appetite through their actions on the central nervous system. In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the melanocortin pathway being the most well understood. The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the <b>arcuate</b> <b>nucleus,</b> that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Neuropeptide Y is {{demonstrated}} as a potent orexigenic peptide when {{injected into the}} rat hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei. The neuropeptide Y innervation of paraventricular nuclei originates from both hypothalamic <b>arcuate</b> <b>nuclei</b> and brainstem neurons, whose specific role in the control of food intake is still under discussion. To assess {{the role of the}} arcuate neuropeptide Y in the regulation of food intake, we propose a new method for immunologically impairing the neuronal secretion of neuropeptide Y from a unique brain site. The monoclonal antibody to the neuropeptide Y precursor epitope, the C-flanking peptide, was microinjected with two cellular toxins (the ricin A chain and the monensin) into the hypothalamic <b>arcuate</b> <b>nuclei</b> or paraventricular nuclei. One microinjection into the <b>arcuate</b> <b>nuclei</b> reduced the food intake and body weight gain for 10 days. It prevented the food intake stimulation usually induced by a 12 h food deprivation. This decrease of food intake was not due to the aversive properties of monoclonal antibody or cellular toxins, or the immunoneutralization of the biologically active neuropeptide Y, because (i) the acute effect of the microinjection into the <b>arcuate</b> <b>nuclei</b> promoted a transient increase of the food intake likely induced by a strong release of neuropeptide Y from the arcuate neurons which were immunologically damaged, and (ii) the C-flanking peptide monoclonal antibody binds neither neuropeptide Y nor its receptors. The microinjection was inefficient when C-flanking peptide monoclonal antibody was replaced by non-specific rat immunoglobulins or when the C-flanking peptide monoclonal antibody/toxins mixture was injected into the paraventricular nuclei.

Central but not peripheral administration of GM-CSF to adult rats significantly decreased food intake and body weight for at least 48 hours. Similar results were observed following central administration of GM-CSF in mice. GM-CSF receptor immunoreactivity was found on neurons within the paraventricular and <b>arcuate</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the hypothalamus. GM-CSF–deficient (GM–/–) mice weighed more and had significantly higher total body fat than wild-type (GM+/+) mice. Energy expenditure in GM–/– mice was decreased compared with that in GM+/+ mice.

25|$|Neurons of the <b>arcuate</b> <b>nucleus</b> secrete gonadotropin {{releasing}} hormone (GnRH) {{into the blood}} of the pituitary portal system. An American physiologist, Ernst Knobil, found that the GnRH signals from the hypothalamus induce pulsed secretion of LH (and to a lesser degree, FSH) at roughly 1-2 hour intervals. The LH pulses are the consequence of pulsatile GnRH secretion by the <b>arcuate</b> <b>nucleus</b> that, in turn, is the result of an oscillator or signal generator in the central nervous system ("GnRH pulse generator"). In the years preceding physical puberty, Robert M. Boyar discovered that the gonadotropin pulses occur only during sleep, but as puberty progresses they can be detected during the day. By the end of puberty, there is little day-night difference in the amplitude and frequency of gonadotropin pulses.|$|E

Ghrelin-responsiveness of these neurons is both leptin- and insulin-sensitive. Ghrelin reduces the mechanosensitivity of gastric vagal afferents, so they are less sensitive to gastric distension.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the function of}} VGF, a secreted polypeptide that is synthesized by neurons, is abundant in the hypothalamus, and is regulated in the brain by electrical activity, injury, and the circadian clock, we generated knockout mice lacking Vgf. Homozygous mutants are small, hypermetabolic, hyperactive, and infertile, with markedly reduced leptin levels and fat stores and altered hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and agouti-related peptide (AGRP) expression. Furthermore, VGF mRNA synthesis is induced in the hypothalamic <b>arcuate</b> <b>nuclei</b> of fasted normal mice.

While the exploration of hypothalamic function has progressed well, knowledge of hypothalamic development is poor.

Genetic fate mapping and loss of function studies in mice demonstrate that Ngn 3 + progenitors contribute to subsets of POMC, NPY, TH and SF 1 neurons and is required for the specification of these neuronal subtypes in the ventral hypothalamus. Interestingly, while Ngn 3 promotes the development of arcuate POMC and ventromedial SF 1 neurons, it inhibits the development of NPY and TH neurons in the <b>arcuate</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Given the opposing roles of POMC and NPY neurons in regulating food intake, these results indicate that Ngn 3 plays a central role in the generation of neuronal populations controlling energy homeostasis in mice...|$|R

In rodents, kisspeptin neurons are found mostly in the anteroventral periventricular and <b>arcuate</b> <b>nuclei,</b> but the physiology of arcuate kisspeptin neurons is not completely understood. We investigated the role of kisspeptin in the control of hypothalamic DA and pituitary PRL secretion in adult rats. Intracerebroventricular kisspeptin- 10 (Kp- 10) elicited PRL release in a dose-dependent manner in estradiol (E 2) -treated ovariectomized rats (OVX+E 2), whereas no effect was found in oil-treated ovariectomized rats (OVX). Kp- 10 increased PRL release in males and proestrous but not diestrous females. Associated with the increase in PRL release, intracerebroventricular Kp- 10 reduced Fos-related antigen expression in tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (ir) neurons of <b>arcuate</b> and periventricular <b>nuclei</b> in OVX+E 2 rats, with no effect in OVX rats. Kp- 10 also decreased 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid concentration and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid-DA ratio in the median eminence but not striatum in OVX+E 2 rats. Double-label immunofluorescence combined with confocal microscopy revealed kisspeptin-ir fibers in close apposition to and in contact with tyrosine hydroxylase-ir perikarya in the arcuate.

Family members contain multiple zinc fingers that mediate DNA binding and homooligomerization or heterooligomerization. Ikaros is abundantly expressed in pituitary mammosomatotrophs, where it deacetylates histone 3 sites on the proximal growth hormone (GH) promoter to silence gene expression. Ikaros-null mice display stunted growth with reduced circulating levels of the GH target factor insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Ikaros-deficient mice have small anterior pituitary glands with a disproportionately reduced somatotroph population. Systemic administration of GH results in increased IGF-I levels and enhanced somatic growth. In contrast, reconstitution with WT lymphocytes was not sufficient to rescue the stunted growth phenotype of Ikaros-deficient mice. Ikaros was identified in mouse hypothalamic <b>arcuate</b> <b>nuclei,</b> where it colocalized with GH-releasing hormone (GHRH); in contrast, Ikaros-null mice lack GHRH immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus.

40|$|Simvastatin is a {{cholesterol}} lowering statin whose {{adverse effects}} include {{an increase in}} appetite and, consequently, obesity. This is counterproductive to the otherwise beneficial outcomes of simvastatin on metabolic and cardiovascular health. The mechanisms underlying simvastatin-induced hyperphagia are unknown. This thesis investigated by using a laboratory rat model whether central mechanisms contribute to simvastatin-induced increase in appetite. First, the effect of intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered simvastatin on the energy-driven intake of ‘bland’ chow, and on reward-motivated consumption of palatable solutions, was determined. The data indicate that ICV simvastatin moderately increases ingestion of energy-dense chow, {{but it does not}} affect consumption of calorie-dilute and non-caloric palatable sucrose or saccharin solutions. It suggests that simvastatin acting directly at the brain level elevates intake of energy, while being ineffective in stimulating eating for reward. Surprisingly, rats injected ICV with this statin consume also significantly more water after water deprivation, which points to a relationship between centrally acting simvastatin and thirst-related processing. In the second part of this project, the effect of the orexigenic dose of ICV simvastatin on neuronal activation in consumption-related hypothalamic sites was investigated. Simvastatin elevated c-Fos immunoreactivity, which serves as a marker of neuronal activation, in the <b>arcuate</b> and paraventricular <b>nuclei,</b> two sites that have a profound influence on the regulation of energy intake and energy balance, as well as affect water balance.
