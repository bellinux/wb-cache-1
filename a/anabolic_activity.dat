40|$|Abstract: Biomechanical signals play an {{important}} role in normal disc metabolism and pathology. For instance, nucleus pulposus (NP) cells will regulate metabolic activities and maintain a balance between the anabolic and catabolic cascades. The former involves factors such as transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and mechanical stimuli, both of which are known to regulate matrix production through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. The present study examined the combined effect of TGFβ and mechanical loading on <b>anabolic</b> <b>activities</b> in NP cells cultured in agarose constructs. Stimulation with TGFβ and dynamic compression reduced nitrite release and increased matrix synthesis and gene expression of aggrecan and collagen type II.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveMechanical {{loading of}} cell-laden {{synthetic}} hydrogels is one strategy for regenerating functional cartilage. This work tests {{the hypothesis that}} type of loading (continuous vs intermittent) and timing when loading is applied (immediate vs delayed) influence <b>anabolic</b> and catabolic <b>activities</b> of chondrocytes when encapsulated in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels. MethodsPrimary bovine chondrocytes encapsulated in PEG hydrogels were subjected to unconfined dynamic compressive strains applied continuously or intermittently for 1 week (i. e., immediate) or intermittently for 1 week but after a 1 week free-swelling (FS) period (i. e., delayed). <b>Anabolic</b> <b>activities</b> were assessed by gene expression for collagen II and aggrecan (AGC) and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by (immuno) histochemistry. Catabolic activities were assessed by gene expression for matrix metalloproteinases, MMP- 1, 3, and 13. ResultsIntermittent loading (IL) upregulated ECM and MMP expressions, e. g., 2 -fold, 16 -fold and 8 -fold for collagen II, MMP- 1, MMP- 3, respectively. Continuous loading upregulated AGC expression 1. 5 -fold but down-regulated MMP- 1 (3 -fold) and - 3 (2 -fold) expressions. For delayed loading, chondrocytes responded to FS conditions by down-regulating MMP expressions (P< 0. 01), but were less sensitive to loading when applied during week 2. Spatially, deposition of ECM molecules was dependent on the timing of loading, where immediate loading favored enhanced collagen II deposition. ConclusionsThe type and timing of dynamic loading dramatically influenced ECM and MMP gene expression {{and to a lesser}} degree matrix deposition.

50|$|LG-121071 (or LGD-121071) is a {{selective}} androgen receptor modulator (SARM) developed by Ligand Pharmaceuticals that was first described in 1999 {{and was the}} first orally active nonsteroidal androgen to be discovered. It is a tricyclic quinolone derivative, structurally distinct from other nonsteroidal AR agonists like andarine and enobosarm (ostarine). The drug acts as a high-affinity full agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) (Ki = 17 nM), with a potency and efficacy that is said to be equivalent to that of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Unlike testosterone, but similarly to DHT, LG-121071 and other nonsteroidal androgens cannot be potentiated by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues (nor aromatized into estrogenic metabolites), and for this reason, show tissue-selective androgenic effects. In accordance, they are said to possess full <b>anabolic</b> <b>activity</b> with reduced androgenic activity, similarly to anabolic-androgenic steroids.|$|E
5000|$|As an AAS, {{fluoxymesterone}} is an agonist of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and DHT. It is a substrate for 5α-reductase like testosterone, {{and so is}} potentiated in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland. As such, fluoxymesterone has a relatively high ratio of androgenic to <b>anabolic</b> <b>activity,</b> similarly to testosterone. Fluoxymesterone {{has been reported to}} be non-aromatizable due to steric hindrance by its C11β hydroxyl group, and hence is not considered to have a propensity for producing estrogenic effects such as gynecomastia or fluid retention. However, paradoxically, a case report of severe fluoxymesterone-induced gynecomastia exists, and gynecomastia associated with fluoxymesterone has also been reported in other publications. Fluoxymesterone is thought to possess little or no progestogenic activity. Because of the presence of its 17α-methyl group, the metabolism of fluoxymesterone is impeded, resulting in it being orally active, although also hepatotoxic.|$|E

The key species on the Arctic shelf, the calanoid copepod Calanus glacialis, grows and accumulates lipid reserves in spring and summer in surface waters. The winter is spent in dormancy in deeper water layers with low metabolic activity. As timing and intensity of metabolic changes have been poorly investigated, our study aims to characterize the physiology of C. glacialis over an entire year, from July 2012 to July 2013. We followed anabolic and catabolic enzyme activities and the biochemical composition of this species, taking depth-stratified samples once a month in Billefjorden, a high-Arctic sill fjord. A large part of the population had migrated to depths > 100 m by July 2012. Only thereafter, <b>anabolic</b> <b>activities</b> decreased slowly, suggesting that low metabolism is related to ceased feeding rather than to endogenous regulation. During overwintering, <b>anabolic</b> enzyme <b>activities</b> were reduced by half as compared to peak activities in spring. The biochemical composition of the copepods changed little from July to December. Then, the lipid catabolic activity increased and the lipid content decreased, likely fuelling moulting and gonad maturation. The protein content did not change significantly during winter, suggesting that proteins are not much catabolized during that time. The relatively high metabolic activity in C. glacialis in winter suggests that this species is not entering a true diapause and should thus be able to respond flexible to changing environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Skeletal {{integrity}} is tightly {{regulated by the}} activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts that are both {{under the control of}} extracellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) through their interactions with endogenous growth factors and differentiation-promoting ligands. Receptor activator of NF-kappa-B ligand (RANKL), which is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -related protein that is critical for osteoclast formation, is produced by osteoblasts and further modulated by certain types of GAGs. Using unfractionated osteoblast-derived GAGs that reflect the complex tissue microenvironment within which osteoclasts reside, we demonstrate that these GAGs block the osteoclastogenic activity of RANKL. Furthermore, RANKL significantly reduces extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activity, a putative suppressor of osteoclastogenesis, but osteoblast-derived GAGs eliminate the inhibitory effects of RANKL on ERK activity. Notably, while imposing an anti-osteoclastic effect, these GAGs also enhanced the proliferation of osteoblasts. Thus, the osteoblast microenvironment is a potent source of GAGs that promote bone <b>anabolic</b> <b>activities.</b> The anti-osteoclastogenic and osteoblast-related mitogenic activities of these GAGs together may provide a key starting point for the development of selective sugar-based therapeutic compounds for the treatment of osteopenic disorders...|$|R
