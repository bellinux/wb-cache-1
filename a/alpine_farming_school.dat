40|$|In {{the present}} work, a rapid and simple NMR method to {{discriminate}} Asiago d’Allevo cheese samples from different production chains is described. A fast and reproducible extraction {{of the organic}} fraction was employed. By applying chemometric analysis to NMR data, {{it is possible to}} differentiate PDO Asiago cheese produced in <b>alpine</b> <b>farms</b> from that produced in lowland and mountain industrialized factories. PCA of both 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra showed a good separation of <b>alpine</b> <b>farm</b> products from the other ones, whereas the lowland and mountain industrialized cheeses are undistinguishable. The samples were differentiated {{on the basis of a}} higher content of unsaturated fatty acids, principally oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and conjugated linoleic acids for the <b>alpine</b> <b>farm</b> cheeses and a higher content of saturated fatty acids for the industrialized products. Conjugated linoleic acid and 1 -pentene are also discriminating components...|$|R

40|$|The <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farming</b> {{settlements}} or <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farms</b> {{represent an}} important part of the settlement structure characteristic mainly for Slovenian mountains. With their archaic image the <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farms</b> offer an insight into the distant past and are as such an important source of information about the first settlements on our territory. In the past years a number of <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farms</b> has undergone a transformation into permanent settlements or holiday resorts, some are even falling apart and are therefore losing their historical value. Using the examples of 15 <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farming</b> settlements from Julian and Kamnik Alps this dissertation analyses the major factors that have impacted the choice of location for the farming settlements, their spatial arrangement, the building typology, the arrangement of accesses and connections inside each settlement, and their connections with pastures. By analysing each settlement, the dissertation researches to what degree the arrangement of the <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farming</b> settlements has been impacted not only by natural resources and ecological factors but also by social factors; it also tries to define the boundaries between the functionality and the planned forming of such settlements. Using the data acquired with the analyses and the research of local literature and current legislation the dissertation also presents suggestions for further regulations of <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Various {{research}} reports and {{articles in the}} popular press have highlighted the obstacles and negative conditions that learners experience at some <b>farm</b> <b>schools</b> in South Africa. These obstacles and conditions are not conducive {{to the health and}} well-being of <b>farm</b> <b>schools</b> and violate <b>farm</b> <b>school</b> learners' rights to receive a high quality of education. The aim of this research was to establish how parents of <b>farm</b> <b>school</b> learners perceive {{the health and well-being of}} <b>farm</b> <b>schools.</b> A literature study and a qualitative investigation were undertaken to achieve the aim of the research. The literature study focused on the health and well-being of schools with specific reference to <b>farm</b> <b>schools.</b> In the qualitative part of the research, focus group interviews were conducted with 38 parents of learners who attend <b>farm</b> <b>schools</b> in the Mopani District of the Department of Education in the Limpopo Province. The qualitative data analysis revealed the following findings: • Parents who participated in the research have negative perceptions of the health and well-being of the <b>farm</b> <b>schools</b> that their children attend. • Their negative perceptions can be ascribed to various health-related problems/issues that prevail at these schools. Based on the research findings, various recommendations were made with a view to improve the health and well-being of these <b>farm</b> <b>schools.</b> Master...|$|R

40|$|A {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) {{application was}} developed to discriminate Asiago d'Allevo, cheese coming from different production chains (<b>alpine</b> <b>farms,</b> mountain and lowland factories). One hundred wheels were collected in different seasons from all productive sites of Asiago d'Allevo: 14 <b>alpine</b> <b>farms</b> and 8 mountain and 13 lowland factories. Samples were analyzed for chemical composition and color and scanned by NIRS (1100 - 2500 nm). A factorial discriminant analysis based on chemical and color data showed a clear separation between alpine and factory products due to their different fatty acids profile and color. However, cheeses from lowland and mountain factories were undistinguishable. A discriminant analysis using NIRS spectra alone or combined with chemical and color data showed similar results. A final calibration based on NIRS spectra was developed and validated {{by a set of}} 7 external samples to discriminate alpine from factory products. This real-time analysis is a reliable alternative to expensive and time-consuming lab determinations...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in the Waterberg District with particular focus on the Nylstroom Circuit. The primary aim of this {{research was}} to assess the performance of <b>farm</b> <b>school</b> governing bodies in the Limpopo Province. The <b>farm</b> <b>schools</b> that were selected for this purpose were in the Nylstroom Circuit since it had a number of <b>farm</b> <b>schools.</b> The school governing body members such as the chairpersons, the principals and educators in the governing bodies of those <b>farm</b> <b>schools</b> participated in this study. The primary data collection method used in this research was semi-structured interviews. Participant observations were carried out on the sites before the interviews were conducted. Documents were analysed at the randomly selected schools. This research revealed that many <b>farm</b> <b>school</b> governing bodies cannot perform their duties because of various challenges such as poverty, illiteracy, lack of time off from work and the long distances that have to be travelled to meetings. In order for these <b>farm</b> <b>schools</b> to overcome these challenges, this research made a number of recommendations, based on the conclusions reached. Educational Studies(M. Ed.
