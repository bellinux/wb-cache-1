40|$|DOI: [URL]   The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{association}} between variables of the game on the offensive structure from the zone in which attack is performed in high-level Men’s volleyball. The sample was composed by 12 teams, with the analysis of 142 games, which totalized 19, 545 reception, set <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> actions. Data analyses were run with descriptive statistic and the qui-quadratic test for searching association between the variables.

It was concluded that Brazilian teams underuse backcourt <b>attacks,</b> <b>and</b> the offensive structure accomplished through the faster game, which is mainly important on attacks carried out in positions 2, 3 and 4. Furthermore, the reception quality proved to be the precursor factor in the construction of attack. It was also observed that there was no 1 st tempo of attacks from the backcourt, indicating that it is necessary to change the type of game, specifically with the increment of the speed of sets conducted by the backcourt...|$|R
