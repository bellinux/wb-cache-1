5|$|The work {{is widely}} admired by biologists, <b>anthropologists</b> <b>and</b> architects among others, but less often read than cited. Peter Medawar {{explains}} this as being because it clearly pioneered {{the use of}} mathematics in biology, and helped to defeat mystical ideas of vitalism; but that the book is weakened by Thompson's failure to understand the role of evolution and evolutionary history in shaping living structures. Philip Ball and Michael Ruse, on the other hand, suspect that while Thompson argued for physical mechanisms, his rejection of natural selection bordered on vitalism.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Malays {{which make}} up the {{majority}} population of Malaysia at 50.4%, are an ethnic group of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula, including the southernmost parts of Thailand, {{the east coast of}} Sumatra, the coast of Borneo, and the smaller islands which lie between these locations. The true origin of ethnic Malays is still the subject of studies among historians, <b>anthropologists</b> <b>and</b> linguists. A popular theory suggested that the people who spoke Austronesian languages first arrived in Maritime Southeast Asia between 2,500BCE and 1,500BCE, as a part of Austronesian expansion from Taiwan to South East Asia.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by <b>anthropologists</b> <b>and</b> psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|This {{emphasis}} {{on the relationship between}} <b>anthropologists</b> <b>and</b> those they study—the point that, while astronomers and stars; chemists and elements; botanists and plants are fundamentally different, <b>anthropologists</b> <b>and</b> those they study are equally human—implied that anthropologists themselves could be objects of anthropological study. Although Boas did not pursue this reversal systematically, his article on alternating sounds illustrates his awareness that scientists should not be confident about their objectivity, because they too see the world through the prism of their culture.|$|E

25|$|The term Dakota {{has also}} been applied by <b>anthropologists</b> <b>and</b> {{governmental}} departments to refer to all Sioux groups, resulting in names such as Teton Dakota, Santee Dakota, etc. This was {{mainly because of the}} misrepresented translation of the Ottawa word from which Sioux is derived.|$|E

25|$|Today, most biologists, <b>anthropologists,</b> <b>and</b> sociologists {{reject a}} {{taxonomy}} of races {{in favor of}} more specific and/or empirically verifiable criteria, such as geography, ethnicity or a history of endogamy.

25|$|By this time, Germany was well-accustomed to {{theories}} {{of race and}} racial superiority due to the long presence of the Völkish movement, the philosophy that Germans constituted a unique people, or volk, linked by common blood. While Volkism was popular mainly among Germany's lower classes and was more a romanticised version of ethnic nationalism, Nordicism attracted German <b>anthropologists</b> <b>and</b> eugenicists.|$|E
