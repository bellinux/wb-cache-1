40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for {{spatially}} explicit assessment of multiple ecosystem services (ES) and remote sensing (RS) can provide valuable data to meet this challenge. In this study, located in the Central French Alps, we used high spatial and spectral resolution RS images to assess multiple ES based on underpinning ecosystem properties (EP) of subalpine grasslands. We estimated five EP (green biomass, litter mass, crude protein content, species diversity and soil carbon content) from RS data using empirical RS methods and maps of ES were calculated as simple linear combinations of EP. Additionally, the RSbased results were compared with results of a plant trait-based statistical modelling approach that predicted EP and ES from land use, abiotic and plant trait data (modelling approach). The comparison between the RS and the modelling approaches showed that RS-based results provided better insight into the fine-grained spatial distribution of EP and thereby ES, whereas the modelling approach reflected the land use signal that underpinned trait-based models of EP. The spatial agreement between the two approaches at a 20 -m resolution varied between 16 and 22 % for individual EP, but for the total ecosystem service supply it was only 7 %. Furthermore, the modelling approach identified the <b>alpine</b> <b>grazed</b> meadows land use class as areas with high values of multiple ES (hot spots) and mown-grazed permanent meadows as areas with low values and only few ES (cold spots). Whereas the RS-based hot spots were a small subset of those predicted by the modelling approach, cold spots were rather scattered, small patches with limited overlap with the modelling results. Despite limitations associated with timing of assessment campaigns and field data requirements, RS offers valuable data for spatially continuous mapping of EP and can thus supply RS-based proxies of ES. Although the RS approach was applied to a limited area and for one type of ecosystem, {{we believe that the}} broader availability of high fidelity airborne and satellite RS data will promote RS-based assessment of ES to larger areas and other ecosystems...|$|R

Among morphological features of plants, life forms may reflect their adaptation to grazing. We studied life-form composition of four typical communities within the alpine belt (3930 - 3960 m a. s. l.) subjected to grazing of various intensity: <b>alpine</b> fen (heavily <b>grazed),</b> <b>alpine</b> shrub meadow (heavily grazed), Spiraea alpina thicket (grazed), and Rhododendron thicket (practically not grazed). The following morphological traits were studied: (1) life form according to Raunkiaer, (2) life form according to Serebryakov, (3) canopy structure, and (4) rate of lateral spreading. We derived life-form spectra based on (1) {{the number of species}} per life form and (2) the cumulative abundance of species which have the same life form. One-way ANOVA and nonparametric ANOVA were run to test for significance of differences between spectra. The studied communities differed significantly by the proportion of different life forms. The main life forms are caudex and short rhizome hemicryptophytes, nonclonal species, or species with a low rate of lateral spreading. Therophytes made up 10 - 11 % of the communities except in Rhododendron thickets, where such were absent. These life forms can indicate grazing in the study area...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} grazing on grassland plants sexual and clonal recruitment, we conducted a demographic field investigation of species recruitment along a grazing gradient in the Tibetan <b>alpine</b> grassland. <b>Grazing</b> intensity had significant effects on quantity and diversity of sexual and clonal recruitment. Sexual recruitment increased significantly, but clonal offspring production decreased significantly with increased grazing intensity. Grazing intensity had different, significant effects on offspring recruitment of the various functional groups in the community, grasses (GG), sedges (SG), legumes (LG) and forbs (FG). Higher grazing intensity reduced offspring recruitment of GG and SG; it increased offspring recruitment of LG and FG. Seedlings were significantly more abundant in lightly grazed, moderately grazed and heavily grazed meadows than in non-grazed grasslands. Offspring diversity from sexual recruitment {{was significantly higher than}} that from clonal recruitment in grazed than in non-grazed grasslands.

On the Tibetan Plateau, yak herders have used fire to reduce brush and to keep alpine meadows open for <b>grazing.</b> <b>Alpine</b> meadows on the plateau support remarkable plant species richness and endemism (Ma et al. 2007), contain the greatest concentration of Tibetan medicinal plants, and produce forage for production of yak butter (R.K.

A total of 108 permanent plots of 1 m² were established. The main aim was to observe effects of time in untreated sites and impacts of grazing exclusion on species number and frequency of functional groups in different subalpine and <b>alpine</b> plant communities. <b>Grazing</b> exclusion led to decreases in species numbers. Significant positive grazing effects were detected for dwarf shrubs and legumes in the subalpine zone and for herbs in the upper alpine zone. Within the untreated sites, species numbers and frequencies changed significantly with time, involving almost all functional groups. The lichen heath was the most stable community.

40|$|Predation {{in small}} {{ruminant}} {{farms in the}} inland Savona region, Liguria (Italy) – Predation on domestic stock {{has always been one}} of the main causes of the conflict between humans and large predators. This problem has been recently spreading to new geographic areas, thus reinforcing the strength of this conflict. In order to point out the characteristics and risk factors of predation in the Province of Savona (Italy), we carried out a survey with direct inspections and interviews in 43 sheep and goats farms, 4 of which make use of alpine pastures during the summer. Predation episodes seldom or never occur in farms {{at the bottom of the}} valleys, whereas they commonly occur in 3 out of 4 farms during <b>alpine</b> summer <b>grazing</b> periods. It has not always been possible to state with certainty the responsibility of the attacks. All the events recorded in summer ranges were attributed to wolves and occurred during the night, while in the farms at the bottom of the valley most of the attacks were due to stray dogs and predation occurred mainly during daytime. Surplus killing was recorded in many cases. Principal risk factors were, first of all, grazing in summer ranges, followed by the presence of large flocks and by a too high ratio animals/stockmen. The presence of wolves is considered a problem by all grazing farmers, and only by 23 % of farmers at the bottom of the valley. Solutions proposed by the farmers to reduce the risk of predation by wolves consist of wolf killing or, in second place, of setting up adequate reimbursement strategies. Very few farmers are willing to accept financial support for the adoption of preventive measures.

40|$|Resilience is an {{important}} aspect of the non-linear restoration of disturbed ecosystems. Fenced grassland patches on the northern Tibetan Plateau can be used to examine the resistance and resilience of degraded <b>alpine</b> grasslands to <b>grazing</b> and to a changing climate. To examine the non-linearity of restoration, we used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for productivity during a ten-year restoration by fencing. Degraded alpine grasslands exhibited three restoration trajectories: an equilibrium in meadows, a non-linear increase across steppes, and an abrupt impulse in desert-steppes following a slight increase in productivity. Combined with weather conditions, the ten-year grazing exclusion has successfully enhanced the NDVI on the most degraded steppes, but did not do so efficiently on either meadows or desert-steppes. Warming favors the NDVI enhancement of degraded meadows, but higher temperatures limited the restoration of degraded steppes and desert-steppes. Precipitation is necessary to restore degraded alpine grasslands, but more precipitation might be useless for meadows due to lower temperatures and for desert-steppes due to limitations caused by the small species pool. We suggest that detailed field observations of community compositional changes are necessary to better understand the mechanisms behind such non-linear ecological restorations...|$|R
40|$|Norwegian alpine {{areas have}} for the past nine decades been {{subjected}} to an intensified use in terms of grazing by large domestic herbivores. It is thus essential to know how this affects <b>alpine</b> ecosystems. <b>Grazing</b> studies to date have focused primarily on how plants respond to grazing, while grazing studies on insects are rare. Furthermore, {{there are indications that}} grazing effects on insects cannot be deduced from the effects on plants. To advance this field, studies have to be conducted directly on insects. Further, little is known about short- versus long-term effects of grazing, and research on the effects of grazing on invertebrates have shown both positive, negative and even non-linear results. In this study, the responses of beetles to sheep grazing were studied within a fully replicated large-scale experiment with three levels of sheep <b>grazing</b> in an <b>alpine</b> ecosystem in Hol, Norway. Beetles were collected with pitfall traps and classified to a species level. I analysed beetle richness and abundance of five beetle species from two functional groups (Calathus melanocephalus and Patrobus assimilis as carnivores and Otiorhynchus nodosus, Byrrhus fasciatus and Hypnoidus rivularius as herbivores). I predicted long-term (2009) to differ from short-term (2003) effects and that these changes might be driven by changes in plant community. I also predicted beetles responses to be determined by their functional group, and that they would show either a nonlinear, negative or positive response. Beetle richness and occurrence were negatively affected by sheep grazing in 2003, while there generally were neutral or positive responses in 2009. However, different species differed in their responses, and functional groups did not explain the responses adequately. Plant richness or plant composition (DCA- 1) were included in all models to see whether sheep grazing through changes in plant community from 2003 to 2009 could explain the changes in beetle richness and the occurrence of beetles, but this was rejected for both richness and all species. In general, it appears that the negative effects of short-term grazing found earlier have been eliminated after an additional 6 years of grazing. This study highlight the importance of long-term studies and that responses of grazing might change over time...|$|R
40|$|Alpine {{grassland}} of Tibet is a frangible ecosystem {{in terms}} of carbon (C) emission. Yak dung is an important resident energy with about 80 % of yak dung combusted for energy in the north Tibetan plateau. This paper investigated the impact of dung combustion on the C cycle of the alpine grassland ecosystem in north Tibet, China. During the growing season of 2011, from a field survey and household questionnaires, the main impacts of dung collection for fuel on the C cycle of the ecosystem were identified. (1) The C sequestration and storage capacity, including the dung-derived C stored in soil and C captured by vegetation, decreased. The net primary production decreased remarkably because of the reduction of dung returned to soil. (2) In a given period, more C was emitted to {{the atmosphere in the}} dung combustion situation than that in the dung returned to soil situation.

To reduce the CO 2 emission derived from dung use, the proportion of dung combustion should be reduced and alternative renewable energy such as solar, wind, or hydro energy should be advocated, which is suitable for, and accessible to, the north Tibetan plateau...|$|R
