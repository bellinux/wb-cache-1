5|$|From 1964–2010, {{and again}} since 2012, the Flag of Malawi {{is made up}} of three equal {{horizontal}} stripes of black, red and green with a red rising sun superimposed {{in the center of the}} black stripe. The black stripe represented the African people, the red represented the blood of martyrs for African freedom, green represented Malawi's ever-green nature and the rising sun represented the dawn of freedom <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> Africa. In 2010, the flag was changed, removing the red rising sun and adding a full white sun in the center as a symbol of Malawi's economic progress. The change was reverted in 2012.|$|E

The ship settled onto the rock which breached her, preventing the craft from sinking further, and these men too were rescued. A total of about six lives were lost in the accident.|$|E

25|$|After {{moving in}} with Perón, Eva is {{introduced}} to high society, but she is met with disdain from the upper classes and the Argentine Army ("Perón's Latest Flame"). In 1946, Perón launches his presidential bid after being promoted to general in the army, and while in bed with Eva, he discusses his chances of winning the election. Eva reassures him and soon they organise rallies where the people show their support <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> a better future, while on the sidelines Perón and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way ("A New Argentina").|$|E
25|$|Pitches {{resemble}} those in Australia with added swing (lateral) movement and comparatively lesser bounce. However, genuine fast bowlers who {{can hit the}} deck hard <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> some seam as well do the most damage, the like of which are Shaun Pollock, Allan Donald, Makhaya Ntini, Dale Steyn, Morné Morkel, André Nel, Fanie de Villiers, Vernon Philander, Lance Klusener and Jacques Kallis. Spinners gain no assistance, as in New Zealand, and have to toil hard. This is perhaps a reason why South Africa has failed to produce a quality wicket-taking spinner for all cases except in the limited overs formats with Imran Tahir.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the hardships}} and privations, Halberstam was {{a beacon of}} {{strength}} <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> his fellow prisoners. When one died in the infirmary—hardly a noteworthy occurrence in those days—the Rebbe stood up and eulogized him for having been a great Torah scholar in Hungary. He refused to eat non-kosher food or food cooked in the non-kosher kitchen, subsisting only on bread and water during his nine months in Muldorf. Moreover, he would not eat the bread until he had ritually washed his hands, and would often wait for days to find some water for this purpose. One prisoner watched him stand beside the cement mixer {{for hours at a}} time, collecting the drops of water that dripped from the tank.|$|E

25|$|Domestically in Zimbabwe, he {{did well}} in the Logan Cup, captaining the Midlands team and scoring two centuries to average 55. However, this was down the order, as he decided his {{technique}} was not tight {{enough for him to}} open the innings. Despite his domestic success, he failed to keep his place against Bangladesh, and decided to take up a club appointment in England rather than stay at home <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> selection against India and West Indies. He might have had a match or two, in fact, as Zimbabwe suffered from injuries, and had he been available he might have played in the final Test against the West Indies instead of Hamilton Masakadza, who hit a century on debut.|$|E
25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, {{it seems to me that}} I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the opening}} game when they missed their first six three-pointers, the USA started this game an even worse 0-for-8. Colangelo said opponents' {{strategy}} was to force the Americans to shoot from outside <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> an off night. The USA made 17 of 22 on conventional field goals in the first half, while missing 10 of 12 from three-point range. This was the team's second consecutive slow start in the Olympics, following the pattern in their five earlier exhibition games. The Americans scored {{on a variety of}} dunks once the game was in hand. Anthony and Love led the team with 16 points. Six Americans scored in double figures, including Durant who had 13 points and added 10 rebounds and 5 assists.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis of}} this {{approach}} is to look at mental illness or distress {{from the perspective of a}} spiritual crisis. Spiritual interventions focus on developing a sense of meaning, purpose <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> the person in their current life experience. Spiritual interventions involve listening to the person's story and facilitating the person to connect to God, a greater power or greater whole, perhaps by using meditation or prayer. This may be a religious or non-religious experience depending on the individual's own spirituality. Spiritual interventions, along with psychosocial interventions, emphasize the importance of engagement, however, spiritual interventions focus more on caring and 'being with' the person during their time of crisis, rather than intervening and trying and 'fix' the problem. Spiritual interventions tend to be based on qualitative research and share some similarities with the humanistic approach to psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{fraternity}} {{was founded}} on October 31, 1861, at the Brühl's Terrace in Dresden's city center as the Rhetoric Society by students of Dresden's former Institute of Technology, now the Dresden University of Technology. The name chosen for the new fraternity was originally Polyhymnia, after the muse of sacred poetry, rhetoric and eloquence. The founders strongly believed that a rhetoric education and discourse {{should be part of}} a complete humanistic higher education. The colors grey-green-gold were chosen to represent the fraternity's principles focusing on academia (grey), being full of fresh energy <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> its principles (green), and valuing friendship among fraternity brothers (gold). The strong connection to the fraternity's founding location is often revived with a rhetoric get-together at Brühl's Terrace and spontaneous afternoon pub gatherings near the river Elbe as well as lavish balls throughout the year.|$|E

The character gained prominence in a comic strip and the Chicago Defender newspaper. Although the character was created in 1923, the parade did not begin until 1929, when David Kellum initiated it as a celebration of the [...] "unity in diversity for the children of Chicago". It has since grown to become a locally televised event and the second largest parade in the nation.|$|E

500|$|Chbosky first {{conceived}} random ideas, including [...] "a kid {{standing up}} in a tunnel", {{a girl he}} likes, and parties he goes to. After five years with these elements in mind, he had the idea of writing the novel during a difficult period in his life. He was experiencing an unpleasant breakup of his own which led him to ask, [...] "Why good people let themselves get treated so badly?" [...] The author tried {{to answer the question}} with the sentence [...] "we accept the love we think we deserve". This answer meant to be an advice to remark that one is in charge of one's life as he is referring to self love, encompassing one's life <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> the future, and not just romantic love.|$|E
500|$|In June 1999, Time {{magazine}} {{published a}} special edition titled [...] "". Anne Frank was selected {{as one of the}} [...] "Heroes & Icons", and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described her legacy with the comment, [...] "The passions the book ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that she has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world—the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> the future of human beings." [...] He notes that while her courage and pragmatism are admired, her ability to analyse herself and the quality of her writing are the key components of her appeal. He writes, [...] "The reason for her immortality was basically literary. She was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition." ...|$|E
