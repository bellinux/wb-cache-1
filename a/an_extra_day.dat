He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen.

5|$|The outdoor {{scenes were}} filmed around Vancouver's Mount Seymour, with weather {{conditions}} making shooting difficult enough to require <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> of work. The episode's production took place {{just a week}} before David Duchovny's wedding, with his fiancée Téa Leoni visiting the set during filming. The first cut of the episode was twelve minutes too long, resulting {{in some of the}} scenes in the mountains being removed. Series creator Chris Carter re-edited the entire episode two days before it aired.|$|E
5|$|An attack {{had been}} planned for 18 September but was {{postponed}} due to the poor weather. On 25 September, the attack went ahead. It was intended to extend the front to high ground that was known as Factory Corner. The high ground was undefended, and the 1st Brigade easily captured it {{under the cover of}} a creeping barrage. Two days later, Factory Corner formed the launchpad for a further attack by the brigade and the neighbouring 55th Division on two more trenchlines, designated Gird Trench and Gird Support. This time, the attack was not as straightforward and it took <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> before the entire objective was in New Zealand hands. On 1 October, as a preliminary to the Battle of Le Transloy, 2nd Brigade's Otago and Canterbury battalions captured strongpoints near Eaucourt L'Abbaye, which fell to the 47th Division two days later.|$|E

Accordingly, a common Hebrew calendar year can have a length of 353, 354 or 355 days, while a leap Hebrew calendar year can have a length of 383, 384 or 385 days.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{match the}} new German speedsters, White Star decided {{to drop out}} of the {{competition}} and commission the four large Celtic-class luxury liners of more moderate speed. White Star realised that passengers preferred comfort even if this means spending <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> at sea. In 1902, White Star joined the well capitalised American combine, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM) that owned the American Line and others. IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. After its bad experience with the Deutschland, Hamburg America also dropped out of the race and commissioned large luxury liners based on the Celtic. However, NDL completed building a fleet of four additional express liners modelled on Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse.|$|E
25|$|Li Na {{followed}} her strong showing at the Medibank tournament with an equally strong showing at the 2007 Australian Open, where she {{advanced to the}} fourth round. Seeded 19th, Li dispatched Elena Bovina and Lourdes Domínguez Lino in straight sets through the first two rounds, leading to a matchup with no. 9 Dinara Safina. The match was postponed due to rain, but Li handily beat Safina {{to advance to the}} fourth round to play Swiss star, no. 6 Martina Hingis. Due to a rain delay and the fact that Hingis played on Rod Laver Arena, a roofed court, on the originally scheduled day, Hingis had <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> of rest. The match the previous day seemed to have no effect, as Li took the first set from Hingis. However, Na faded as the match went on and lost while committing 69 unforced errors. Despite the loss, the tournament was a success for Na, as it marked the third straight time in a Grand Slam that she advanced at least to the fourth round.|$|E

25|$|The {{seventh and}} {{deciding}} {{game of the}} series was scheduled for Sunday night, October 26. However, heavy rain caused the postponement of the game one night and the game was played on Monday night, October 27. The Mets sent Ron Darling, their scheduled starter, out for Game 7 with <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> of rest due to the rainout. Oil Can Boyd, who had struggled in his Game 3 start earlier in the series, {{was supposed to take}} the mound for the Red Sox in Game 7. The postponement gave Red Sox manager John McNamara another idea, and he decided to start Bruce Hurst, already 2-0 in the series and the presumptive series MVP if the Red Sox won, instead of Boyd as the rainout enabled him to get a third day of rest and thus be ready to go for the decider. Boyd, upset at not being given the ball as he was supposed to, went into the clubhouse and decided to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Thus, when pitching coach Bill Fischer went to check on him, he found Boyd was highly intoxicated and thus in no condition to pitch in relief that night if he was needed.|$|E
25|$|And fail to win they did, losing 2–1 to a Chelsea {{side that}} had had <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> to recuperate from their Champions League tie against Liverpool in mid-week. Coming {{off the back}} of a poor display in Barcelona, United were looking to cement their claim to the Premier League title, which would have been all but won with a win over Chelsea. However, with several players rested with Barcelona on Tuesday in mind, and Nemanja Vidić having to be {{substituted}} early on after a knee to the face, the odds never looked in United's favour. Owen Hargreaves took Vidić's place in defence, with Wes Brown switching from right-back to centre-back. Joe Cole had the first real chance, but could only smash the ball into the woodwork from 18yards after he regained the ball from a poor clearance. United held out for 45 minutes, but finally went behind on the stroke of half-time to a Michael Ballack header, after the German had lost his marker to find room at the back post. After the break, United came out a new team, taking the game to Chelsea. After 57 minutes, United conceded a free kick just inside Chelsea's half, but a poor back pass from Ricardo Carvalho allowed Wayne Rooney to pounce on the ball and place a shot beyond Petr Čech into the corner of the net, his first career goal against Chelsea. However, he appeared to have injured himself during his celebration and was soon substituted, making way for Cristiano Ronaldo. The game went quiet for the last 20 minutes, until a Michael Essien cross was handled by Michael Carrick just inside the United penalty area with four minutes left to play. Referee Alan Wiley pointed to the spot, and Ballack stepped up to convert and give Chelsea the win. United went all out for a much needed equaliser, but the closest they came were two shots blocked on the line by Ashley Cole and Andriy Shevchenko. The result brought Chelsea level on points with United with two games to go, United holding on to top spot by virtue of their +53 goal difference. This now meant that United would have to win both of their remaining games to secure the title, provided that Chelsea did not drop any more points.|$|E

500|$|The season finale, [...] "Gethsemane", was notable in that {{an entire}} set created to {{emulated}} icy caverns was constructed inside a warehouse which {{had previously been}} used for cold storage; and required the use of truckloads of lumber and [...] of Styrofoam.

500|$|The {{video was}} shot over four days, with <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> allotted for re-shooting {{some of the}} scenes. Originally Lambert had casts taken of Robinson's face, hand and feet to create the statue of the saint which would {{be used as a}} decoration. The actor only enacted the live scenes. However during post-production, Lambert found that the statue did not look like Robinson, who was asked to re-shoot the {{respective}} scenes. He had to act as the statue and required special make-up for the retakes. The actor recalled that standing like a statue was difficult since [...] "first of all, I didn't realize how hard it is on the back to stand absolutely tall and straight and not move. Secondly, as a performer you have this nervous energy—and my requirements here were total antithesis of that." ...|$|E
500|$|Humber was {{promoted}} to the Mets, again as a September call-up, on September 2. Though the Mets considered inserting him into the starting rotation immediately, they chose to start Pelfrey. Humber made two relief appearances for the Mets, on September 5 and 11. The Mets, having lost eight of their previous 12 games and seen their lead over the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League East division race decrease from seven games to two, removed Pelfrey from the final rotation to give <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> of rest to pitchers Pérez, Maine, and Pedro Martínez, and gave Humber his first Major League start on September 26, 2007, against the Washington Nationals, choosing him over Dave Williams. Although the Mets raced out to a 6–2 lead, Humber allowed five runs in four-plus innings, receiving a no decision in a game the Mets eventually lost, 9–6. The decision to start Humber was seen as emblematic of the Mets' desperation. As George Vecsey wrote in The New York Times, [...] "How did it come to this? How did the entire Mets' season come to depend so much on a young pitcher, Philip Humber, who had never started {{in the major leagues}} until last night?" [...] He concluded his three Mets appearances in the 2007 season with a 7.71 ERA.|$|E

500|$|Another summertime {{birthday}} celebration in the Netherlands {{was that of}} Wilhelmina's mother, Queen-Regent Emma, who after Wilhelmina attained adulthood generally spent her own birthday, 2 August, at Soestdijk Palace in Baarn. [...] Until her death in 1934, Emma received an annual floral tribute from the townsfolk on her birthday. [...] In 1937 Wilhelmina's daughter and heiress, Princess Juliana, took up residence at Soestdijk Palace following her marriage, and the townsfolk made their floral presentation to her, moving the date to Juliana's birthday, 30 April. In September 1948 Juliana ascended to the Dutch throne and from 1949 onwards Koninginnedag was on her birthday. [...] The change in date attracted immediate approval from Dutch children, who gained <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> of holiday. [...] The first observance of the holiday on the new date included a huge circus at the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium—one not attended by the royal family, who remained at Soestdijk Palace. [...] Queen Juliana retained the floral tribute, staying each year on Koninginnedag at Soestdijk Palace to receive it. [...] The parade became televised in the 1950s, and Koninginnedag increasingly became a national holiday, with workers given the day off.

500|$|The {{following}} morning, 1 September, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion went on {{the offensive}} again, while a force of seven Kittyhawks attacked the Japanese headquarters around Waga Waga. By this time, the Japanese had abandoned the objective of reaching the airfields and instead sought only to hold off the Australians {{long enough to be}} evacuated. This information was not known by the Allies, however, who were in fact expecting the Japanese to undertake further offensive action. In this regard, the 2/9th, initially with orders to join the 2/12th's counterattack, was delayed <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> after an erroneous intelligence report from MacArthur's headquarters warning Clowes of a renewed Japanese attack forced him to briefly adopt a more defensive posture. The attack did not occur and, as a result, on 2 September the 2/9th was moved by barge up to the KB Mission. The next day it took over from the 2/12th and led the Australian advance. With the Japanese position at Milne Bay close to collapse, on 2 September Yano sent a radio message to the headquarters of the 8th Fleet which stated: [...] "e have reached the worst possible situation.

McQueen tries to repave the road in a single day, but turns out shoddy, and he is forced to repave the road again, which takes several days to complete. During this time, he befriends several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs {{used to be a}} popular stopover along the old U.S. Route 66, but with the construction of Interstate 40 bypassing it, the town literally vanished from the map. McQueen also discovers that Doc is the [...] "Fabulous Hudson Hornet", a three-time Piston Cup winner, whose racing career ended after an accident in 1954, and quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes repaving the road, which has invigorated the cars to improve their town, and spends <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> in Radiator Springs with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town, led by a tip to McQueen's location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race, while Sally chastises Doc after discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered by them instead.|$|E
