5|$|One of the {{strengths}} of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on prognosis. At Hippocrates' time, medicinal therapy was quite immature, <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> best thing that physicians could do was to evaluate an illness and predict its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories.|$|E
5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several bee {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> host egg also. The Arctic bee species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.|$|E
5|$|Casting metalware in Chamba is {{an ancient}} tradition, {{dating back to the}} Bronze Age period, with items {{typically}} made out of copper or brass, and also iron, especially in the traditional making of implements and weapons by blacksmiths. Of particular note in this trade are the large plaques with reliefs, commonly used for wall decoration. The temple cupolas in Chamba district are often furnished with copper and brass items made in Chamba <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> golden kalasha or vessel crowning them is produced here.|$|E

5|$|Concordant rites exist {{with the}} blessing <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> active support of regular masonic lodges. There are several {{concordant}} bodies in the United States which admit the wives and female relatives of Freemasons. The Dutch Order of Weavers admits only the wives, while in the American orders {{the men and women}} share in the ritual. Like the lodges of adoption, they have their own ceremonies, which means that some grand lodges view them as irregular.|$|E
5|$|In melody-dominated homophony, {{accompanying}} voices provide chordal {{support for}} the lead voice, which assumes the melody. Some popular music today might be considered melody-dominated homophony, voice typically taking on the lead role, while instruments like piano, guitar and bass guitar normally accompany the voice. In many cases, instruments also take on the lead role, <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> role switches between parts, voice taking the lead during a verse and instruments subsequently taking solos, during which the other instruments provide chordal support.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's cuisine {{reflects}} the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. Many cultures {{from within the}} country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, {{largely due to the}} country being part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states have varied dishes, <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.|$|E

5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and use the same mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert could use the same mouthpiece (<b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E
5|$|The {{avenues for}} {{research}} {{have been limited}} by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns in the two world wars, and {{a great number of}} works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed. The record-keeping in the region was inconsistent, <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded. The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s, and while the inventories of collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the artist or workshop that produced them. Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rivalry between}} these two cities may {{have been based on}} more than {{competition}} for resources. Their dynastic histories reveal different origins and the intense competition between the two powers may have had an ideological grounding. Calakmul's dynasty seems ultimately derived from the great Preclassic city of El Mirador while the dynasty of Tikal was profoundly affected by the intervention of the distant central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. With few exceptions, Tikal's monuments and those of its allies place great emphasis upon single male rulers while the monuments of Calakmul and its allies gave greater prominence to the female line <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> joint rule of king and queen.|$|E

5|$|The small {{fields in}} the western part of the area are {{particularly}} characteristic of the Chew Valley and date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Fields of this category are generally small in size, regular in outline <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> boundaries preserve the outlines of the earlier strip field system. Regional variations in field size and pattern do occur. For example, there is evidence of medieval clearance of woodland on the slopes around Nempnett Thrubwell, south of Bishop Sutton and west and south of Chelwood.|$|E
5|$|Viking metal is a {{style of}} heavy metal music {{characterized}} by a lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age. Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, {{to the point where}} some consider it more a cross-genre term than a genre, but it is typically seen as black metal with influences from Nordic folk music. Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both sung and harsh vocals, a reliance on folk instrumentation, <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> use of keyboards for atmospheric effect.|$|E
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was founded}} during {{a wave of}} monastic enthusiasm that swept through western Christendom in the 11th and 12th centuries. This wave was {{responsible}} for the foundation of the majority of England's monasteries, and very few were founded after the 13th century. These monasteries were often founded by a wealthy aristocratic benefactor who endowed and patronised the establishments in return for prayers for their soul, <b>and</b> <b>often,</b> <b>the</b> right to be buried within the monastic church. Leicester Abbey was founded in the Augustinian tradition. The monks at the abbey were known as canons, and followed the monastic rules set down by Saint Augustine of Hippo. Sometimes known as Black Canons, because of their dress (a white habit and black cloak), Augustinian Canons lived a clerical life engaged in public ministry; this is distinct to other forms of monasticism in which monks were cloistered from the outside world, and lived an isolated, contemplative life.|$|E

Rounding out the office are the stern salesman Stanley Hudson, who barely stood for Michael's constant references to his Black-American heritage (he also doesn't like {{to take part in}} time wasting meetings and sometimes sleeps in them or works on crossword puzzles); eccentric quality assurance representative Creed Bratton; the kind and caring saleswoman Phyllis Lapin-Vance, who marries Bob Vance from Vance Refrigeration across the hall from the office; Andy Bernard is a salesman introduced in season three after the closing of the Stamford, Connecticut branch of Dunder Mifflin and the merging of the two; the bubbly and talkative customer service representative Kelly Kapoor; the promiscuous alcoholic supply relations representative Meredith Palmer; human resources representative Toby Flenderson, who is admittedly hated by, <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> target of abuse by Michael Scott; warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin; Warehouse dock worker and Pam's ex-fiancé Roy Anderson, who was fired in the third season; and Michael's former love interest and former Vice President for Regional Sales for Dunder Mifflin Jan Levinson (Jan Levinson-Gould until her divorce in season 2).|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb of most lemuriforms {{includes}} six finely spaced teeth, four incisors and two canine {{teeth that}} are procumbent (tilt forward) {{in the front}} of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them, but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors. In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the incisors. The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt, and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side. The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, <b>and</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.|$|E
