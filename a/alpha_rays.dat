2500|$|The first {{gamma ray}} source to be {{discovered}} historically was the radioactive decay process called gamma decay. In this type of decay, an excited nucleus emits a gamma ray almost immediately upon formation (it is now understood that a nuclear isomeric transition, however, can produce inhibited gamma decay with a measurable and much longer half-life). Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from radium. Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of rays from radium, which included beta rays, first noted as [...] "radioactivity" [...] by Henri Becquerel in 1896, and <b>alpha</b> <b>rays,</b> discovered as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type. Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from previously named rays, by Ernest Rutherford, who in 1903 named Villard's rays [...] "gamma rays" [...] by analogy with the beta and <b>alpha</b> <b>rays</b> that Rutherford had differentiated in 1899. The [...] "rays" [...] emitted by radioactive elements were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials, using the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: <b>alpha</b> <b>rays</b> as the least penetrating, followed by beta rays, followed by gamma rays as the most penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or at least, not easily deflected) by a magnetic field, another property making them unlike alpha and beta rays.|$|E

2500|$|The {{counter that}} Geiger and Rutherford built proved {{unreliable}} because the alpha particles were being too strongly deflected by their collisions with the molecules of air within the detection chamber. The highly variable trajectories of the alpha particles {{meant that they}} did not all generate the same number of ions as they passed through the gas, thus producing erratic readings. [...] This puzzled Rutherford because he had thought that alpha particles were just too heavy to be deflected so strongly. Rutherford asked Geiger to investigate just how much matter could scatter <b>alpha</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Gamma rays (also called gamma radiation), {{denoted by}} the lower-case Greek letter gamma (γ or [...] ), are {{penetrating}} electromagnetic radiation {{of a kind}} arising from the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. It consists of photons in the highest observed range of photon energy. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying radiation emitted by radium. In 1903, Ernest Rutherford named this radiation gamma rays. Rutherford had previously discovered two other types of radioactive decay, which he named <b>alpha</b> <b>rays</b> and beta rays.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the 20th century, {{radioactivity}} {{had been}} recently discovered in uranium and thorium.

[...] These radiations were soon identified with known particles: [...] <b>alpha</b> <b>rays</b> were shown to be helium ions by Rutherford and Thomas Royds in 1907, beta rays were shown to be electrons by Henri Becquerel in 1900, and gamma rays were shown to be electromagnetic radiation (light) in 1914. [...] These radiations had also been identified as emanating from atoms, hence they provided clues as to processes occurring within atoms. [...] Conversely, the radiations were also recognized as tools that could be exploited in scattering experiments to probe the interior of atoms.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{noted that the}} time of the decay of the nucleus cannot be controlled, and that the finite half-life invalidates the result. This objection can be dispelled by sizing the hemispheres appropriately with regards to the half-life of the nucleus. The radii are chosen so that the more distant hemisphere is much farther away than the half-life of the decaying nucleus, times the flight-time of the <b>alpha</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Another {{example is}} gamma-ray bursts, now {{known to be}} {{produced}} from processes too powerful to involve simple collections of atoms undergoing radioactive decay. This {{has led to the}} realization that many gamma rays produced in astronomical processes result not from radioactive decay or particle annihilation, but rather in much the same manner as the production of X-rays. Although gamma rays in astronomy are discussed below as non-radioactive events, in fact a few gamma rays are known in astronomy to originate explicitly from gamma decay of nuclei (as demonstrated by their spectra and emission half life). A classic example is that of supernova SN 1987A, which emits an [...] "afterglow" [...] of gamma-ray photons from the decay of newly made radioactive nickel-56 and cobalt-56. Most gamma rays in astronomy, however, arise by other mechanisms. Astronomical literature tends to write [...] "gamma-ray" [...] with a hyphen, by analogy to X-rays, rather than in a way analogous to <b>alpha</b> <b>rays</b> and beta rays.
