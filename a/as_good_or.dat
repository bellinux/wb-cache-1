5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil.|$|E
25|$|Chandogya Upanishad, {{in chapter}} 1.2, {{describes}} {{the battle between}} Devas and Asuras on various sensory powers. This battle {{between good and evil}} fails to produce a victor and simply manifests itself in the perceived universe, <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil sights witnessed by beings, <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil words shared between people, <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil smells of nature, <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil feelings experienced, <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil thoughts within each person. Finally, the Deva-Asura battle targets the soul, where Asuras fail and Devas succeed, because soul-force is serene and inherently good, asserts Chandogya Upanishad.|$|E

25|$|This {{classification}} {{system has been}} superseded for the water quality within the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which {{may be one of}} five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> fail.|$|E
25|$|While, however, Xenocrates (and {{with him}} Speusippus {{and the other}} {{philosophers}} of the older Academy) would not accept that these intermediate things, such as health, beauty, fame, good fortune, etc. were valuable in themselves, he did not accept that they were absolutely worthless or indifferent. According, therefore, as what belongs to the intermediate region is adapted to bring about or to hinder the good, Xenocrates appears to have designated it <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil, probably with the proviso, that by misuse what is good might become evil, and vice versa, that by virtue, what is evil might become good.|$|E
25|$|The Simonians were {{variously}} {{accused of}} using magic and theurgy, incantations and love-potions; declaring idolatry a matter of indifference that was neither good nor bad, proclaiming all sex to be perfect love, and altogether leading very disorderly, immoral lives. Eusebius of Caesarea, in his 4th century Historia Ecclesiastica, writes that 'every vile corruption that could either be done or devised, is practised by this most abominable heresy'. In general, they were said to regard nothing in itself <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> bad by nature: it was not good works that made men blessed, in the next world, but the grace bestowed by Simon and Helena on those who followed them.|$|E

25|$|The nightwatchman {{is usually}} a lower-order batsman, able to protect his wicket {{primarily}} by defending dangerous balls and leaving non-dangerous ones rather than looking to produce {{a large number of}} runs for his team, but not a complete rabbit, liable to expose other batsmen late in a day. This move prevents a regular batsman from having to face the last few overs left in the day or bat early the following morning; however, some teams do not employ a nightwatchmen for various reasons, including a belief that middle-order batsmen should be able to protect their wicket in poor conditions as well <b>as</b> <b>good,</b> <b>or</b> a lack of defensively minded lower-order batsmen.|$|E
25|$|The boat {{is first}} {{directly}} addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if Skíðblaðnir {{is the best}} of ships, what {{there is to know about}} it, and asks if there is no other ship <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> as large as it. High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} community reacted strongly to Weld's leadership. In a 1994 survey of chief executives {{conducted by the}} Massachusetts High Technology Council, 83% of those polled rated the state's business climate <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> excellent—up from only 33% {{at the beginning of}} his term. Proponents might claim that Weld's leadership changed the minds of 50% of the CEOs surveyed while others would note the national economic trends or other factors might play a part. Weld also reaped the benefits of the 1990s prosperity, as the state's unemployment rate fell by more than 3 percentage points during his first term, from 9.6% in 1991 to 6.4% in 1994. As a result, Weld received grades of A in 1992, B in 1994, and B in 1996 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors. In 1993 he supported adoption of a gun control bill in Massachusetts that included limits on gun purchases under age 21, as well as prohibiting certain types of weapons, which was not ultimately passed. He has since renounced this proposal. During his term, he launched a successful effort to privatize many state's human services, laying off thousands of state employees. After cutting state spending year-over-year for his first two years, the Republican Party lost its ability to sustain a veto in the legislature due to losses in the Massachusetts State Senate, forcing Weld to make greater concessions to Democratic legislators.|$|E

500|$|The {{rivalry between}} Angier and Borden dominates the film. Obsession, secrecy, and {{sacrifice}} fuel the battle, as both magicians contribute {{their fair share}} to a deadly duel of one-upmanship, with disastrous results. Angier's obsession with beating Borden costs him {{a great deal of}} money and Cutter's friendship, while providing him with a collection of his own suicide victims; Borden's obsession with maintaining the secrecy of his twin leads Sarah to question their relationship, eventually resulting in her suicide when she suspects the truth. Angier and one of the twins both lose Olivia's love because of their inhumanity. [...] Finally, Borden is hanged and the last copy of Angier shot. Their struggle is also expressed through class warfare: Borden as The Professor, a working-class magician who gets his hands dirty, versus Angier as The Great Danton, a classy, elitist showman whose accent makes him appear American. Film critic Matt Brunson claimed that a complex theme of duality is exemplified by Angier and Borden, that the film chooses not to depict either magician <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil.|$|E
