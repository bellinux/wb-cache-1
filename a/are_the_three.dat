5|$|Speyer's two {{principal}} legacies <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> deep-level tube {{lines of the}} London Underground, and the Promenade Concerts. The former {{might not have been}} built without the finance he raised with Yerkes, and would have struggled without his chairmanship. The latter may have failed in the early 20th century without his financial support. The tube lines now form the central sections of the Underground's Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. After Speyer's funding of the Promenade Concerts ended, they were taken over by music publishers Chappell & Co. and, in 1927, by the BBC. The characters of Sir Hermann and Lady Aline Gurtner in E. F. Benson's 1919 novel Robin Linnet were based on Sir Edgar and Lady Speyer. Leanne Langley suggests that the character of Appleton, a villainous stockbroker, in John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps may have been based on Speyer.|$|E
5|$|The Georgian scripts <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> writing systems used {{to write}} the Georgian language: Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli. Although the systems differ in appearance, all three are unicase, their letters share the same names and {{alphabetical}} order, and are written horizontally from left to right. Of the three scripts, Mkhedruli was once the civilian royal script of the Kingdom of Georgia mostly used for the royal charters {{and is now the}} standard script for modern Georgian and its related Kartvelian languages, whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only in ceremonial religious texts and iconography by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Tours <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> {{most prestigious}} multi-week stage races in {{professional}} road bicycle racing. The competitions are the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a España, contested annually in that order. They {{are the only}} stage races permitted to last longer than 14 days. No cyclist has won all three Grand Tours in the same year; the only cyclists to win all three Grand Tours in their career are Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Felice Gimondi, Bernard Hinault, Alberto Contador and Vincenzo Nibali. Contador is the youngest, at 25 years, and quickest to win every Tour, completing the feat in 14 months. It is rare for cyclists to ride all Grand Tours in the same year; in 2004, for example, 474 cyclists started {{in one of the}} Grand Tours, 68 rode two and only two cyclists started all three.|$|E

5|$|The Palazzo Zacco {{is one of}} {{the more}} notable Baroque {{buildings}} of the city, its Corinthian columns supporting balconies of amazing wrought iron work, while supports of grotesques mock, shock or amuse the passerby. The palazzo was built in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It was later acquired by the Zacco family, after which it is named. The building has two street façades, each with six wide balconies bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family, a frame of acanthus leaves from which a puttino leans. The balconies, a feature of the palazzo, are notable for the differing corbels which support them, ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques. The focal points of the principal façade <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> central balconies, divided by columns with Corinthian capitals. Here the balconies are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces.|$|E
5|$|The median plates (m, m') {{are also}} sclerites {{that are not}} so {{definitely}} differentiated as specific plates as <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> principal axillaries, but nevertheless they are important elements of the flexor apparatus. They lie in the median area of the wing base distal to {{the second and third}} axillaries and are separated from each other by an oblique line (bf) which forms a prominent convex fold during flexion of the wing. The proximal plate (m) is usually attached to the distal arm of the third axillary and perhaps should be regarded {{as a part of the}} latter. The distal plate (m') is less constantly present as a distinct sclerite and may be represented by a general sclerotization of the base of the mediocubital field of the wing. When the veins of this region are distinct at their bases, they are associated with the outer median plate.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} mihrab, {{uncovered in}} 1933, has a semi-dome above {{it with a}} marble column on either side. Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the mihrab and the walls ornately decorated. The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch, which is still intact. The first set of verses <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> that open al-Mu’minoon:Successful indeed are the believers – who are humble in their prayers – and who avoid vain talkThe next inscription {{is made up of}} verses 162 and 163 of al-An'am:Say: Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for Allah, the Lord of the worlds – No associate has He; and this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{hypothesis}} of LDR is in contradiction to some embryological studies on birds which show that, from five developmental sites, the digits that develop <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> middle digits (II, III, IV). This inconsistency has {{been a matter of}} debate for almost 200 years, and has been used by Alan Feduccia to support the controversial hypothesis that birds are descended not from theropods but from some other group of archosaurs which had lost the first and fifth digits. To explain the discrepancy between morphological and embryological data in the context of bird origins, an alternative scenario to LDR was developed by Tony Thulborn and Tim Hamley in 1982. In this scenario, the digits I and V of theropods were reduced in the process of Bilateral Digit Reduction (BDR), with the remaining digits developing to resemble the former digits I-III. Limusaurus was initially considered as evidence for the BDR hypothesis due to it - and other ceratosaurians - having a reduced first digit, with researchers hypothesizing that a similar pattern of reduction occurred among the tetanurans (the sister group of the ceratosaurians).|$|E
5|$|Saddlebreds are {{popularly known}} as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. The former <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter {{includes}} the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and the rack. The slow gait today is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot. In the show ring, the gait should be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also a four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each footfall, making it a smooth gait to ride. In the show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained. Historically, the slow gait could be either a running walk, the stepping pace, or the fox trot, however, the modern five-gaited Saddlebred usually performs the stepping pace.|$|E
5|$|The {{carousel}} {{is one of}} {{the three}} oldest surviving Dentzel menagerie carousels. Thirty-one of its 42wood-carved animals are horses, 17 standing and 14 jumping. There are also three goats, three giraffes, three deer, one lion, and one tiger. The single lion and tiger are typical of Dentzel-created carousels, as <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> giraffes; Gustav Dentzel's love of that animal resulted in all of his carousels including at least one row of giraffes. The animals are arranged in three circles around the central mechanism, alternating leaping or jumping horses with stationary animals. Typical for a Mangels-Illions manufactured carousel, there are 18jumping animals, all but one of which is original; the horse that could not be found in 1975 was replaced with another Dentzel horse. Although the animals were not originally carved to display jewels, at some point they were so displayed at the amusement park, and thus the museum restored the animals on the outside circle with jewels.|$|E
