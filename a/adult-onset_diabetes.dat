Design/Patients: We analyzed insulin autoantibodies (IAA), IA- 2 autoantibodies (IA- 2 icA), and ZnT 8 autoantibodies (ZnT 8 A) by radioimmunoassay in 47 Japanese patients with <b>adult-onset</b> autoimmune <b>diabetes</b> who were identified by native GAD autoantibody (nGADA) screening in ~ 3, 000 non-insulin-requiring diabetes and in 302 nGADA-negative type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, GAD 65 autoantibody-specific epitopes were also analyzed using GAD 65 /GAD 67 chimeric constructs. Results: The prevalence of IAA, IA- 2 icA and ZnT 8 A in nGADA-positive patients was 26 %, 15 %, and 19 %, respectively, which was significantly higher than that in nGADA-negative type 2 diabetes (2 %, 2 %, and 2 %, P< 0. 0001). Among nGADA-positive patients, 38 % had one or more of IAA, IA- 2 icA, or ZnT 8 A, and 15 % had two or more of these autoantibodies, compared with none of the nGADA-negative patients (P< 0. 0001). Thirty-six % of nGADA-positive patients subsequently required insulin therapy, and high nGADA titer (log-rank P= 0. 003), middle epitope recognition of GAD 65 A (P= 0. 002), and the presence of one or more of IAA, IA- 2 icA, or ZnT 8 A (P= 0. 002) at diagnosis marked the risk for early requirement of insulin therapy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the multiple islet autoantibodeis to be independently associated with the risk for insulin requirement (Odds ratio= 13. 77, 95 %CI: 2. 77 - 68. 45, P= 0. 001). Conclusions: These results indicate that the determination of IAA, IA- 2 icA, and ZnT 8 A improves the prediction of a future insulin insufficiency in <b>adult-onset</b> autoimmune <b>diabetes,</b> which appears to be superior to GADA titer and GAD 65 A-specific epitopes...|$|R

RESULTS: Of 4, 250 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients, 4. 5 % had either GADAs and/or IA- 2 As.

We investigated the response of isolated rat and human hepatocytes to various TZDs using biochemical assays, coherent multiprobe fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analyses. The results identified direct effects of TZD on mitochondria from live human and rodent hepatocytes. The multiprobe fluorescence assays showed disruption of mitochondrial activity as an initiating event followed by increased membrane permeability, calcium influx and nuclear condensation. Other TZD-related cellular effects were increased hepatic enzyme leakage, decreased reductive metabolism and cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate depletion. Mitochondrial effects were similar in cryopreserved hepatocytes from diabetic or non-diabetic donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) had baseline mitochondrial energetics and metabolism comparable with isolated hepatocytes. Mitochondrial effects in isolated hepatocytes were found in human PBMCs exposed to the TZDs. The relative potency of TZDs for causing hepatocyte and PBMC effects was troglitazone >pioglitazone >rosiglitazone.

The near-constant increase in blood insulin levels results from an effort to match the increase in blood glucose, which will cause receptor sites on the liver cells to downregulate and decrease the number of receptors for insulin, increasing the subject’s resistance by decreasing sensitivity to this hormone.

Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) are each exclusive forms of diabetes which are, at least initially, clinically distinct from type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes, and each have a different natural history from these major types of diabetes. KPD can be diagnosed unequivocally as diabetes presenting with the categorical clinical feature, ketoacidosis.

40|$|Diabetes is not {{a single}} {{homogeneous}} disease but composed of many diseases with hyperglycaemia as a common feature. Four factors have, historically, been used to identify this diversity: the age at onset; the severity of the disease, i. e. degree of loss of beta cell function; the degree of insulin resistance and the presence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies. Our broad understanding of the distinction between the two major types, type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, are based on these factors, but it has become apparent that they do not precisely capture the different disease forms. Indeed, both major types of diabetes have common features, encapsulated by <b>adult-onset</b> autoimmune <b>diabetes</b> and maturity-onset diabetes of the young. As a result, there has been a repositioning of our understanding of diabetes. In this review, drawing on recent literature, we discuss the evidence that autoimmune type 1 diabetes has a broad clinical phenotype with diverse therapeutic options, while the term non-autoimmune type 2 diabetes obscures the optimal management strategy because it encompasses substantial heterogeneity. Underlying these developments is a general progression towards precision medicine with the need for precise patient characterisation, currently based on clinical phenotypes but in future augmented by laboratory-based tests.

It is commonly accepted that these diseases develop because of the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Evidence for genetic factors includes the higher concordance of disease in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins. However, monozygotic twins may remain discordant for disease indicating a role for environmental factors. Environmental factors may alter gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. This is particularly pertinent in type 1 diabetes in which DNA methylation and histone modifications {{have been associated with}} altered gene expression. The low disease concordance rate in <b>adult-onset</b> type 1 <b>diabetes</b> (< 20 %) suggests that environmental and epigenetic changes may play a predominant role. Defining the role of epigenetic changes could identify specific gene pathways and dysregulated expression of gene products that contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. This article reviews how epigenetic mechanisms may {{contribute to the development of}} autoimmune diseases with a focus on type 1 diabetes. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
