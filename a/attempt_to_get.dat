5|$|Passport to Pimlico is set {{during a}} {{heatwave}} {{that occurred in}} Britain in 1947, but, despite this, filming took place during 1948's abnormally wet summer. The poor weather caused delays in production, {{which led to the}} film being over-time and over-budget. Shooting started early each day, in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the first successful shot completed before 9:00 am. An average of ten takes a day were taken, in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> two and a half minutes of usable film per day. There were arguments between Cornelius and Balcon throughout the production, because Balcon was unhappy with what he saw as poor direction. Cornelius left Ealing Studios after working on Passport to Pimlico and did not work for the studio again.|$|E
5|$|That {{night the}} brigade {{made the first}} <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> men of the Polish Parachute Brigade across the Rhine. Under the command of Captain Harry Brown of the brigade's {{engineer}} squadron, fifteen men with a makeshift fleet of six boats, managed to transport fifty-five Poles across the river.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, he {{experienced}} tightness {{in the same}} hamstring he had hurt earlier in the year, and the Dodgers shut him down indefinitely. He eventually rejoined the Dodgers lineup on September 17, and had four hits (including two doubles) in four at bats. He played regularly in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his timing back before the playoffs.|$|E

Each of Sylvester's <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the bird ends unsuccessfully; several times, he is barely able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from the bulldog.|$|R

5|$|In October 2001 Adams left Brighton {{to become}} {{assistant}} manager to Dave Bassett at Leicester City. Peter Taylor, the former Leicester manager, was drafted in to complete Brighton's promotion campaign. Adams chose the move in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{closer to his}} dream of managing a Premiership club. He understood that Bassett was to move 'upstairs' {{at the end of}} the season, leaving Adams free to take the management job for 2002–03.|$|E
5|$|One night, FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) kills a young man, who Mulder {{believes}} is a vampire {{but who has}} pointed dentures instead of actual fangs.

Before they do so, they <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their stories straight.|$|E

5|$|Avnet went to Aurelio De Laurentiis and {{convinced}} him to finance the film without a distribution deal. Nine months before filming, Avnet had Conran meet the actors and begin rehearsals in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the shy filmmaker out of his shell. Avnet set up a custom digital effects studio with a blue screen soundstage in an abandoned building in Van Nuys, California. A group of almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators and compositors created multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live action footage yet to be filmed.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{arrive at}} the police station to see Billy. Doggett {{interviews}} the boy, who seems to be mute. In <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Billy to speak, Doggett keeps his backpack from him. This infuriates Lisa and leads Scully to question Doggett’s expertise in child abduction cases. Scully suggests that Billy is an alien abductee, but Doggett believes Ronald Purnell, a local , may {{have been involved in the}} boy's disappearance. Doggett questions Purnell, who expresses confusion when the agent suggests that he should meet Billy. As Doggett sits in his car, he pulls out a photo of his deceased son, Luke.|$|E
5|$|Historians Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully {{believe that}} by {{combining}} the surviving aircraft and pilots from Shōkaku and Zuikaku, {{it is likely that}} Zuikaku could have been equipped with almost a full composite air group. They also note that doing so would have violated Japanese carrier doctrine, which stressed that carriers and their airgroups must train as a single unit (in contrast, American air squadrons were considered interchangeable between carriers). In any case, the Japanese apparently made no serious <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Zuikaku ready for the forthcoming battle.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being used as {{the exterior of the}} school, Studio C holds sets for the school's entrance foyer, the gymnasium, the media lab and a hallway with lockers. As the series progressed and the budget increased, a stairway and balcony was installed in the foyer in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> characters off the floor and not all appear in the same geometric plane. For the first few seasons, the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards; due to warping, it was replaced by concrete painted to look like wood.|$|E
5|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial. Pořádek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on stage. Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down, knelt on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he (Pořádek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped {{the fact that he was}} not wanted on stage.|$|E
5|$|Randazza's {{argument}} {{compared the}} case to the Supreme Court of the United States case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Randazza wrote that Beck was attempting to evade the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by filing the legal process with an agency of the United Nations instead of in a U.S. court. In the legal brief, Randazza pointed out that Beck's action of going to the WIPO in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the website taken down was in contradiction to his prior statements saying he preferred United States law over international law.|$|E

5|$|The Marble Index is {{the second}} solo album and third studio album by German {{musician}} Nico, which was released in November 1968 on Elektra Records. The avant-garde sound introduced in the album—a stark contrast with her folk pop debut, Chelsea Girl—was {{the result of the}} combination of Nico's droning harmonium and somber vocals, and producer John Cale's musical arrangements, which were inspired by modern European classical music. Nico envisioned the release as an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> artistic legitimacy, thus also drastically changing the looks that had initially made her famous as a fashion model.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs on}} Road to Ruin were {{considered}} by both fans and critics as an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the band more airplay. The album incorporated musical elements which were {{unheard of in}} punk rock, such as guitar solos and ballads. The difference in style caused for mixed reviews by critics, with many {{pointing out that the}} band was trying to sell more records through a change in form. This attempt by the band failed, as Road to Ruin debuted at 103 on the Billboard 200, nearly 50 places behind its predecessor Rocket to Russia.|$|E

After a wild night of partying, they wind up in the desert, where the duck dresses Willard in women's clothing in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a ride. After several encounters with an old prospector dying of thirst, a racist police officer, two lesbians, and a short Mexican man, they are finally picked up by a trucker.|$|E

5|$|After meeting Fannie Lou Hamer in {{the summer}} of 1964 and hearing her {{experiences}} in the civil rights movement, Blackwell decided to join the SNCC. As a project director for the SNCC, she organized voter registration drives across Mississippi. Later that year, she became a member on the executive committee of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), which provided a party for voters that SNCC had been registering to vote. In late August she and 67 other activists left Mississippi to represent the MFDP at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the MFDP seated as delegates. They were unsuccessful in getting seats, but the move brought the party and the Mississippi civil rights movement into the public eye.|$|E
5|$|Anderlecht {{began the}} second half the better of the two sides as they pushed forward {{in an attempt to}} extend their lead. Rensenbrink, in particular, was in good form as he caused {{numerous}} problems for Liverpool defender Emlyn Hughes, who started because of an injury to Phil Thompson after being absent himself for a lengthy period. Liverpool replaced David Johnson with midfielder Steve Heighway in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back into the match but it was to no avail as Anderlecht extended their lead late in {{the second half}} when Rensenbrink scored. No further goals were scored and the referee Károly Palotai blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Anderlecht.|$|E
5|$|As the day progressed, the 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment counterattacked in the Bénouville area in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{through to}} the bridges. The coup-de-main force and the 7th Parachute Battalion held their position, {{knocking}} out 13 of the 17 tanks trying to get through. The British troops moved forward into Bénouville and cleared the Germans in house to house fighting. By midday, most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion {{had arrived at the}} bridges. Despite the ferocity of the attacks, the battalion and the coup-de-main force were able to hold the bridges until 19:00, when the leading elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division arrived and began to relieve the airborne troops, a process that was completed around 01:00 7 June.|$|E
