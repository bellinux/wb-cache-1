5000|$|Haggis is a savoury pudding {{containing}} sheep's pluck (heart, {{liver and}} lungs); minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, traditionally encased in the animal's stomach though now often in an <b>artificial</b> <b>casing</b> instead. According to the 2001 English {{edition of the}} Larousse Gastronomique: [...] "Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour".|$|E
50|$|Pepperoni is a cured {{dry sausage}} {{similar to the}} spicy salamis of {{southern}} Italy, such as salsiccia Napoletana piccante, a spicy dry sausage from Naples, or the soppressata from Calabria. The main differences are that pepperoni has a finer grain (akin to salami of Milan, a spiceless regional variant of salami), is usually softer, and is produced {{with the use of}} an <b>artificial</b> <b>casing</b> (instead Italian salami are produced using natural gut for casing). Pepperoni is mass-produced to meet the demand for the sausage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>casings</b> {{are made}} of {{collagen}}, cellulose, or even plastic {{and may not be}} edible. <b>Artificial</b> <b>casings</b> from animal collagen can be edible, depending on the origin of the raw material.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCasing {{is part of}} sausages, {{giving it}} shape, size and integrity, but also having a role in volumetric, {{structural}} and chemical changes which occur in sausage during different production phases. For fermented sausages, natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>casings</b> can be used. <b>Artificial</b> <b>casings</b> have an advantage from the hygienic point of view, because microbiological contamination is negligible, storage at low temperatures unnecessary, {{and there is no}} problem with product spoilage during storage and transport. Today, <b>artificial</b> sausage <b>casings</b> are a better choice for production of large diameter sausages, while they are equivalent to natural casings for production of small diameter sausages...|$|R
50|$|It is {{the only}} world {{producer}} with the capacity to manufacture the four main technologies available on the <b>casings</b> or <b>artificial</b> <b>casings</b> market (cellulose, collagen, fibrous and plastic), {{and for this reason}} it has the widest range of quality products in its market.|$|R
5000|$|Saumagen is a German dish {{popular in}} the Palatinate. The name means [...] "sow's stomach". The dish {{is similar to a}} sausage in that it {{consists}} of a stuffed casing; however, the stomach itself is integral to the dish. It isn't as thin as a typical sausage casing (intestines or <b>artificial</b> <b>casing).</b> Rather it is meat-like, being a strong muscular organ, and when the dish is finished by being pan-fried or roasted in the oven, it becomes crisp. The dish is somewhat similar to the Scottish haggis, although the stuffing is quite different.|$|E
40|$|Fermented {{sausages}} {{are defined}} as a mixture of lean meat and fat, curing salts, sucrose and spices, stuffed in a natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>casing</b> and submitted to fermentation and air-drying process. Starter culture and ripening process may affect the quality and acceptability of the final product. Current research evaluates the use of Enterococcus faecium as starter culture in fermented sausage production and its physicochemical and microbiological profile during maturation process, coupled to sausage sensory acceptance after ripening. Enterococcus faecium showed 10. 9 log CFU g- 1 and remained viable after the ripening period with 8. 32 log CFU g- 1. Fermented sausage was monitored during the ripening period by physicochemical (pH control, water activity and weight loss) and microbiological (analysis of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, coliforms and Salmonella spp.) analyses. All tests complied with standards established by Brazilian legislation and did not interfere in final product quality. Results showed that E. faecium was resistant to curing salt and sodium chloride, maintaining its viability during ripening and conferring beneficial effects on fermented sausage technological characteristics. E. faecium also proved to be in vitro resistant to simulate passage through the human digestive tract. Fermented sausage containing E. faecium had better sensory acceptance than commercial sausage evaluated...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} sodium alginate hydrosols (1 %) with 0. 2 % of NaCl treated with direct electric current (DC) used as a coating on microbial (Total Viable Counts, Psychrotrophic bacteria, yeast and molds, Lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae), physiochemical (pH, lipid oxidation, antioxidant activity, weight loss, color) and sensory properties of skinned pork sausages or with <b>artificial</b> <b>casing</b> stored at 4 °C for 28 days. Moreover, the cytotoxicity analysis of sodium alginate hydrogels was performed. The results have shown that application of experimental coatings on the sausage surface resulted in reducing all tested groups of microorganisms compared to control after a 4 -week storage. The cytotoxicity analysis revealed that proliferation of RAW 264. 7 and L 929 is not inhibited by the samples treated with 200 mA. Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and free radical scavenging activity (DPPH) analyses showed {{that there are no}} significant differences in antioxidant properties between control samples and those covered with sodium alginate. After 28 days of storage, the highest value of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) was noticed for variants treated with 400 mA (1. 07 mg malondialdehyde/kg), while it was only slightly lower for the control sample (0. 95 mg MDA/kg). The obtained results suggest that sodium alginate treated with DC may be used as a coating for food preservation because of its antimicrobial activity and lack of undesirable impact on the quality factors of sausages...|$|E
50|$|Viscofan is a Spanish {{group and}} a world leader in the {{manufacturing}} and commercialisation of casings for meat products (also known as <b>artificial</b> <b>casings</b> given their capacity to replace animal casings {{that are used in}} the production of cold meats), with commercial presence in over 100 countries around the world.|$|R
50|$|Casing, sausage casing, or sausage skin is the {{material}} that encloses the filling of a sausage. Casings are divided into two categories, natural and <b>artificial.</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>casings,</b> such as collagen, cellulose, plastic, and extruded casings, are relatively new to the field, mainly borne of market demand during the technological advances of the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Portuguese chouriço is made (at least) with pork, fat, wine, paprika, garlic, and salt. It is then {{stuffed into}} natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>casings</b> and slowly dried over smoke. The many {{different}} varieties differ in color, shape, seasoning, and taste. Many dishes of Portuguese cuisine and Brazilian cuisine {{make use of}} chouriço - cozido à portuguesa and feijoada are just two of them.|$|R
50|$|Haggis {{is widely}} {{available}} in supermarkets in Scotland all year, with cheaper brands normally packed in <b>artificial</b> <b>casings,</b> rather than stomachs. Sometimes haggis is sold in tins or a container which can be cooked in a microwave or conventional oven. Some commercial haggis is largely made from pig, rather than sheep, offal. Kosher haggis, not only pork-free but fully conformant to Jewish dietary laws, is produced.|$|R
50|$|In {{the shops}} Stippgrütze is usually sold in sausage form in clear <b>artificial</b> <b>casings</b> about 12 cm in diameter. To prepare it {{a large piece}} is fried in a pan without any {{additional}} fat, until a firm crust forms on the underside, occasionally it is stirred and fried again. A sort of porridge or puree (Brei) results, hence its other name of Wurstebrei (sausage puree).|$|R
50|$|Teewurst is a German sausage {{made from}} two parts raw pork (and {{sometimes}} beef) and one part bacon; they are minced, seasoned and packed in <b>casings</b> (mostly porous <b>artificial</b> <b>casings)</b> before being smoked over beech wood. The sausage then has to mature for seven to ten days {{in order to}} develop its typical taste. Teewurst contains 30 to 40 percent fat, which makes it particularly easy to spread.|$|R
50|$|Pinkel {{consists}} {{mainly of}} bacon, groats of oats or barley, beef suet, pig lard, onions, salt, pepper and other spices. The exact {{composition of the}} recipe is guarded as a trade secret by the different butchers and therefore varies from village to village. Pinkel with a high meat content is also described as Fleisch-Pinkel ("meat pinkel") or Oldenburger Pinkel. Traditionally Pinkel is filled into the edible small intestines of pigs, although today edible <b>artificial</b> <b>casings</b> are also used.|$|R
50|$|The {{collagen}} for <b>artificial</b> <b>casings</b> {{is processed}} extensively and, as a raw material, it {{is similar to}} bread dough prior to final production. It is then extruded through a die to the desired diameter, dried and shirred into short sticks up to 41 cm long that contain as much as 50 m of casing. In a newer process, a form of dough is coextruded with the meat blend, and a coating is formed by treating the outside with a calcium solution to set the coating.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{study was}} carried out on a typical {{homemade}} Petrovská klobasá in order to characterize this traditional dry-fermented sausage, {{and to provide a}} basis for establishing the quality standard and protecting designation of origin. This paper reviews the microbiological profile of the produced from warm meat in the traditional way depending on the method of packaging (unpacked, vacuum-packed and MAP), with particular reference to the presence of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, micrococci and enterococci. According to the results, no significant practical difference was noticed between the use of either natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>casings...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Weckewerk is a sausage, {{native to}} Northern Hesse, Germany. It {{is made from}} cooked brawn and minced meat, veal or sausage, and broth of pork, {{sometimes}} from cooked meat, blood and offal. The sausage is stretched with stale bread, explaining the name: [...] "Weck" [...] or [...] "Wegge" [...] is the traditional term for roll in Northern Hesse. It is seasoned with onions, salt, pepper, marjoram, regionally also with caraway, allspice and garlic. The ingredients are ground and mixed. To be consumed within a short time, the mixture is packaged in pig intestines. If longer storage is desired, it is preserved in jars or filled in <b>artificial</b> <b>casings.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Its name derived through French {{from the}} Latin sal, [...] "salt", the sausage-making {{technique}} involves placing ground or chopped meat along with salt into a tube. The tubes can vary, {{but the more}} common animal-derived tubes include sheep, hog, or cattle intestinal linings. Additionally, animal stomachs and bladders, as well as edible <b>artificial</b> <b>casings</b> produced from collagen and inedible plant cellulose or paper are also used. Inedible casings are primarily used to shape, store, and age the sausage. [...] The two main variants of sausage are fresh and cooked. Fresh sausages involve the production of raw meat placed into casings to be cooked at a later time, whereas cooked sausages are heated during production and are ready to eat {{at the end of}} production.|$|R
30|$|The {{emulsion}} {{was filled}} into the Sirman sausage filler (Model- 1 S-V 15 -IRDA-VERT, S.No. 07  L 01410. Marsango, Italy) and the <b>artificial</b> cellulose <b>casing</b> was applied on the nozzle of sausage filler. Pressure was applied {{in such a}} way so that the emulsion was filled into the casings.|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{sinusoidal}} {{pulsating flow}} that develops in the vibrating flow pump (VFP) <b>artificial</b> heart <b>casing.</b> In such system flow is {{induced by the}} axial movements of the vibrating pipe. Pipe is capped with the flexible thin disk that is called jelly-fish valve (JFV). Valve is opened during the downward pipe motion and is closed during the upward motion. Valve movement is very similar with the movement of falcon wings. It {{is due to the}} pipe motion and happens under the influence of fluid inertial, JFV spring, fluid shear and pressure forces. Authors utilized industrial strength CFD-ACE+ / FEMSTRESS software package from CFDRC to analyze dynamic fluid-structure interaction, flow velocity field and time-dependent vorticity distribution. It was shown in the previous studies that blood hemolysis is closely correlated with the maximum value...|$|R
50|$|Sarah is {{captured}} and {{taken back to}} the castle. Learning the Doctor is a Time Lord, Morbius fears the Time Lords have tracked him down and will return in force. Morbius insists that he be transferred into the patchwork body now, with an <b>artificial</b> brain <b>casing</b> Solon constructed. Solon protests, as there may be severe pain and seizures, but Morbius insists. Back in the castle, Solon prepares to operate, but Condo is enraged when he recognises his lost arm attached to the patchwork body. He attacks Solon before being shot in the stomach, their struggle knocking Morbius's brain to the floor. Not knowing what damage has been done, Solon places the fallen brain in the casing, releasing Sarah so she can assist in the operation. He threatens her into doing so, saying if Morbius dies, so does she.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{ripening}} process of fermented sausages {{is affected by}} diameter and type of sausage casings, and depends on changes in the microflora, important from hygienic and technological aspects. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the bacteriological status sausages which were stuffed in <b>artificial</b> collagen sausage <b>casings</b> of different diameters (35 mm and 60 mm) during ripening and drying. The sausage stuffing was the same, as was the uncontrolled ripening conditions. In bigger diameter sausages, significantly higher average total bacterial count, enterobacteria and lactic acid bacteria counts were found than in smaller diameter sausages...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro Tecnológico. Programa de Pós-Graduação em Engenharia de Alimentos. Os embutidos, que podem ser frescos, secos, embutidos cozidos e defumados, entre outros, necessitam de tripas, naturais ou artificiais, para que possam ser produzidos. As tripas naturais se caracterizam pela alta permeabilidade à fumaça; boa adesão da massa à superfície da tripa; podem ser comestíveis como proteína animal e, apresentam boa imagem para o consumidor. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a influência do tratamento de tripas suínas naturais com soluções emulsificantes de grau alimentar (lecitina de soja) no aumento do rendimento de processo de embutimento de lingüiça calabresa. Foi utilizado um delineamento {{experimental}} com a finalidade de estudar o efeito combinado das variáveis de processo, concentração de lecitina, concentração de óleo, temperatura da solução de lecitina e de óleo, e tempo de residência das tripas na solução, nas características da tripa natural. Foram realizadas avaliações de elasticidade, porosidade, permeabilidade ao vapor d'água das tripas submetidas aos tratamentos, bem como cor, atributos sensoriais e análises físico-químicas das lingüiças. Verificou-se que os maiores rendimentos de processo foram obtidos utilizando-se as maiores concentrações de lecitina e embutimento com resistência à liberação da tripa e, que ocorreu redução de até 76 % das perdas de tripa por rompimento quando foram utilizados tratamentos com banho de lecitina nas tripas naturais. Além disso, foram observados menores teores de água entre a tripa e a massa de lingüiça calabresa para os tratamentos utilizando lecitina, o que resultou em lingüiças com melhor aparência, ou seja, menor enrugamento superficial. As análises físico-químicas das lingüiças indicaram que todos os tratamentos do planejamento experimental ficaram de acordo com os valores permitidos pela legislação brasileira com relação às características físico-químicas. Com relação às propriedades mecânicas das tripas, os tratamentos que apresentaram os maiores alongamentos, foram obtidos com concentração de lecitina 1 : 30 e 1 : 25 e tempo de imersão na solução de 30 e 60 minutos, respectivamente. Não houve diferença significativa (p> 0, 50) com relação à permeabilidade ao vapor d'água das tripas tratadas com lecitina em comparação às tripas sem tratamento, embora mais estudos sejam necessários para a obtenção de dados mais conclusivos. Sausages {{which can}} be fresh, dry, smoked and cooked, among others, need either natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>casings</b> to be produced. The natural casings are characterized by its high permeability to smoke; good adherence to the casing surface; edible as animal protein and a good image to the consumer. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the influence of the treatment of the natural hog casing with emulsification solution of alimentary degree (soy lecithin) in the increase of yield of the process of the pepperoni sausage. An experimental draft was used with the objective of investigating the combined effect of the variables of the process, lecithin concentration, oil concentration, temperature of the lecithin and oil solution, and period of time of the casing residence in the solution, under the features of the natural casings. Elasticity evaluations, porosity, permeability to the steam of the casings as well as the color, sensory attributes and physical-chemical analyses of the sausages were submitted to the treatments. It was observed that the highest process yields were obtained with the use of higher lecithin concentrations and sausages with pressure and that there was a reduction of up to 76 % of the casing losses by means of the tear when the treatment with lecithin bath was used in the natural casings. Moreover, it was observed lower content of water between the intestine and the variety of treatments with the use of lecithin which resulted the sausages to have a better appearance, that is, lower superficial purl. The physical-chemical analyses of the sausages have indicated that all the treatments of the experimental planning were in accordance with the permitted values of the Brazilian legislation in relation to physical-chemical characteristics. Concerning the mechanical properties of the casings, the treatments which presented higher lengthen were those where the lecithin concentration was 1 : 30 and 1 : 25, and immersion time on the solution of 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. There was not significant difference (p> 0, 50) with regard to the permeability of the steam of the casings treated with lecithin in comparison with the casings without treatment, but in order to obtain more conclusive results, it would be necessary more studies...|$|R
