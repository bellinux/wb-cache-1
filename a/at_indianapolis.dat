5|$|On April 20 Indianapolis's {{city council}} {{appropriated}} $10,000 for wartime use. Four days later, the Indiana General Assembly convened in Indianapolis {{to give the}} governor wartime powers and appropriate funds to support the war effort ($1.6 million for military purposes and a $2 million bond issue for state and national defense). To provide ammunition, Governor Morton established a state-owned arsenal <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis.</b> Congress passed legislation to establish a permanent federal arsenal <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Slightly {{more than}} 60 percent of Indiana's regiments mustered into service and trained <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis.</b> Other camps for Union {{soldiers}} were established {{elsewhere in the}} state, including Fort Wayne, Gosport, Jeffersonville, Kendallville, Lafayette, Richmond, South Bend, Terre Haute, Wabash, and in LaPorte County.|$|E
5|$|By April 27, 1861, Indiana's {{first six}} regiments, {{all of which}} were {{organized}} <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis,</b> were fully organized as the First Brigade, Indiana Volunteers, under the command of Brigadier General Thomas A. Morris. These included the 6th Indiana, the 7th Indiana, the 8th Indiana, the 9th Indiana, the 10th Indiana, and the 11th Indiana infantry regiments.|$|E
25|$|While the {{military}} facilities at Camp Morton no longer exist, {{the remains of}} 1,616 Confederate soldiers and sailors who died while prisoners at the camp are interred <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis's</b> Crown Hill Cemetery. Several monuments and historical markers commemorate Camp Morton, including a bust of Richard Owen, a camp commandant, at the Indiana Statehouse, and memorials to the Confederate prisoners who died at the camp <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis's</b> Garfield Park and Crown Hill.|$|R
25|$|A {{monument}} <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis's</b> Greenlawn Cemetery {{was erected}} {{to honor the}} Confederate soldiers who were buried there. The monument was moved to Garfield Park in 1928.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} Team Vogler classic <b>at</b> the <b>Indianapolis</b> Speedrome. His father Donald Vogler died in a midget car {{accident}} <b>at</b> the <b>Indianapolis</b> Speedrome on May 1, 1981.|$|R
5|$|Hornish {{returned}} to the series with Penske for a full-time season in 2012. Winless, he had second-place finishes <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis,</b> Montréal and Kentucky. After a race at Talladega Superspeedway, Danica Patrick intentionally spun Hornish's car into the main straightaway wall after he made contact with her during the race. He finished fourth at the season-ending Ford EcoBoost 300 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, and was fourth in points with 1,146.|$|E
5|$|Most of Indiana's regimental {{units were}} {{organized}} within towns or counties, but ethnic units also formed. The 32nd Indiana, the state's first German-American infantry regiment, and the 35th Indiana, the state's first Irish-American regiment, organized <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> in 1861. Other regiments established in 1861 that included residents of Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana, included the 19th Indiana, the 27th Indiana, and the 33rd Indiana, among others.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of its investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{discovered}} that tower staffing levels at Blue Grass Airport violated an internal policy as reflected in a November 16, 2005, memorandum requiring two controllers during the overnight shift: one in the tower working clearance, ground, and tower frequencies, and another, either in the tower or remotely <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> Center, working TRACON (radar). At {{the time of the}} accident, the single controller in the tower was performing both tower and radar duties. On August 30, 2006, the FAA announced that Lexington, as well as other airports with similar traffic levels, would be staffed with two controllers in the tower around the clock effective immediately.|$|E

5|$|Lilly {{developed}} {{cancer in}} 1897 {{and died in}} his Indianapolis home on June 6, 1898. His funeral was held on June 9 and attended by thousands. His remains are interred in a large mausoleum <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis's</b> Crown Hill Cemetery.|$|R
50|$|The modern open wheel support {{series has}} {{its origins in}} USAC's Mini Indy series, and later CART's ARS/Indy Lights series. None of those support series ever raced <b>at</b> the <b>Indianapolis</b> Motor Speedway. Typically the support series would take the month of May off of the {{schedule}} while the top-level Indy cars were <b>at</b> the <b>Indianapolis</b> 500. In 1979, USAC's Mini-Indy series scheduled a support race on the oval <b>at</b> nearby <b>Indianapolis</b> Raceway Park, but it was held only once.|$|R
5|$|In 1868 President Ulysses S. Grant {{appointed}} Harrison {{to represent}} {{the federal government in}} a civil suit filed by Lambdin P. Milligan, whose controversial wartime conviction for treason in 1864 led to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case known as Ex parte Milligan. The civil case was referred to the U.S. Circuit Court for Indiana <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis,</b> where it evolved into Milligan v. Hovey. Although the jury rendered a verdict in Milligan's favor and he had sought {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in damages, state and federal statutes limited the amount the federal government had to award to Milligan to five dollars plus court costs.|$|E
5|$|New regiments {{continued}} to muster into service <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis.</b> The 28th Regiment U.S. Colored Troops, organized between December 24, 1863, and March 31, 1864, {{was the only}} black regiment formed in Indiana during the war. The regiment trained at Camp Fremont, near Fountain Square. It included 518 enlisted men who signed on for a term of three years, but the war was effectively over within a year, cutting short its term of service. The regiment lost 212 men before it mustered out of service on November 8, 1865.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 1861, President Lincoln {{called for}} a total of 75,000 volunteers to join the Union army. On the same day, Governor Morton telegraphed the {{president}} offering 10,000 Indiana volunteers. The state's initial quota was set at six regiments (a total of 4,683 men) for three months of service. Orders were issued on April 16 to form the state's first regiments and to gather <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis.</b> On the first day, five hundred men were encamped in the city; within a week more than 12,000 Hoosier volunteers had signed up to fight for the Union, nearly three times as many needed to meet the state's initial quota.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} {{attended}} by many dignitaries from across the United States, and President Hayes ordered all flags to half-staff. Because the church could not hold the large crowd, thousands of mourners waited outside and followed in a long procession to witness the burial <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis's</b> Crown Hill Cemetery.|$|R

5|$|Union troops {{continued}} {{to organize and}} train at military camps in the city, as battles in Kentucky and Tennessee caused major changes to Indianapolis. After the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, the Union began to collect {{a large number of}} Confederate prisoners of war for transport to the North. Governor Morton volunteered to hold some of the prisoners <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis.</b> Designated as one of four northern prisoner-of-war camps, Camp Morton was converted into one of the Union's largest prisons for captured Confederate soldiers.|$|E
5|$|After much speculation, Manning {{announced}} in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL. In the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning's play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and one interception, but a pick-6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed the Broncos to win 19–13. The Broncos {{got off to a}} dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, the streak ended in a loss <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis,</b> losing 24–27. During that winning streak, and the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played better, putting up over 250 yards in six of the seven games, and he scored nine touchdowns. However, he never had a game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13, and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories.|$|E
5|$|As regiments {{organized}} and reorganized, Union soldiers continued to gather <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis,</b> sometimes {{as many as}} 12,000 at a time. Indianapolis regiments formed in 1862 included the 70th Indiana, {{under the command of}} Benjamin Harrison, and the 79th Indiana, under the command of Frederick Knefler. Popular gathering spots for the soldiers included Monument Circle and University Park. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis in 1862 and in 1863, respectively, to house and feed Indiana's soldiers and their families as they passed through Indianapolis. City residents continued to aid Union soldiers by providing food, clothing, equipment, and supplies. Soldiers' aid societies and the Indiana Sanitary Commission, established in 1862 with its headquarters in Indianapolis, raised funds and gathered supplies for troops in the field. The women of Indianapolis also organized groups, usually local Ladies' Aid Societies, to provide soldiers with blankets and clothing, and helped raise funds for additional troop supplies.|$|E

5|$|In 1877 Morton {{was named}} to lead a {{committee}} to investigate charges of bribery made against La Fayette Grover, a newly elected U.S. Senator from Oregon. The committee spent eighteen days in Oregon holding hearings and investigations. On the return trip, Morton detoured to San Francisco for a rest and visit. After dinner {{on the night of}} August 6, Morton suffered a severe stroke that paralyzed {{the left side of his}} body. The next day he was taken by train to Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory, where he was met by his brother-in-law, John A. Burbank, the former governor of the Dakota Territory. Morton was accompanied by him to the home of his mother-in-law in Richmond, Indiana, where he stayed until October 15, then he was moved to his own home in Indianapolis to recover. He remained <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis,</b> surrounded by his family, until his death on November 1, 1877.|$|E
5|$|Most of Indiana's regimental {{units were}} {{organized}} within towns or counties, but ethnic units were also formed, including the 32nd Indiana, a German-American infantry regiment, and the 35th Indiana, composed of Irish Americans. The 28th Regiment U.S. Colored Troops, formed <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> between December 24, 1863, and March 31, 1864, {{was the only}} black regiment formed in Indiana during the war. It trained at Indianapolis's Camp Fremont, near Fountain Square, and included 518 enlisted men who signed on for three years of service. The regiment lost 212 men during the conflict. The 28th participated in the Siege of Petersburg and at the Battle of the Crater, where twenty-two of its men were killed. At {{the end of the}} war the regiment served in Texas, where it mustered out of service on November 8, 1865.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2003, in {{the lead}} up to the 2003 Indy 500, Andretti took to the track {{for the first time}} in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of 63. He participated in a test session for son Michael's AGR IndyCar team. One of the team's regular drivers, Tony Kanaan, {{suffered}} a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April 15 crash at Motegi. If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him. He would turn the car over to Kanaan on race day, though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race. During the test, Andretti ran at competitive speeds, but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash. Andretti was able to walk away from the wreck with just a minor cut on his chin. This was Andretti's last significant on-track activity <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis.</b>|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{went to the}} No. 35 Chevrolet for Laughlin Racing for the 1993 Busch Series, {{and drove}} in twenty-four races. At the season-opening Goody's 300, she retired after 71 laps due to a blown engine; her team also changed {{manufacturers}} during the season from Oldsmobile to Pontiac. She took her best finish {{of the season with}} an eleventh-place result in the Kroger 200 <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> Raceway Park. She did not qualify for four races in the 1993 season. Robinson finished the year 23rd in the final points standings, the highest of her Busch Series career. She made her first start in the Busch North Series (now the K Pro Series East) at New Hampshire Motor Speedway where she qualified, but finished in 34th position after her engine failed. Robinson returned to Ferree Racing to drive the No. 46 Chevrolet for the 1994 Busch Series season.|$|E
5|$|Andretti {{made his}} Champ Car debut on April 19, 1964 at the New Jersey State fairgrounds in Trenton, New Jersey. He started sixteenth and {{finished}} eleventh. Andretti {{was introduced by}} his USAC sprint car owner, Rufus Gray, to veteran mechanic Clint Brawner. Brawner was not impressed since sprint car drivers Stan Bowman and Donnie Davis had recently died, and Brawner's current driver, Chuck Hulse, had been critically injured. Chris Economaki recommended Andretti to Brawner, so Brawner watched Andretti race at Terre Haute, Indiana. Brawner was convinced {{that he had found}} the new driver for his team. The two stayed together for six years. Andretti finished eleventh in the USAC National Championship that season. Andretti won his first championship car race at the Hoosier Grand Prix on a road course <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis</b> Raceway Park in 1965. His third-place finish at the 1965 Indianapolis 500 in the Brawner Hawk (a mechanical copy of the current Brabham Formula 1 design) earned him the race's Rookie of the Year award, and contributed towards Andretti winning the series championship. He was the youngest national champion in series history at age 25. He repeated as series champion in 1966, winning eight of fifteen events. He also won the pole at the 1966 Indianapolis 500. Andretti finished second in the IndyCars in 1967 and 1968. He also won a single non-championship drag race in 1967 in a Ford Mustang. In both 1967 and 1968, Andretti lost the season USAC championship to A. J. Foyt and Bobby Unser, respectively, in the waning laps of the last race of the season at Riverside, California—each by the smallest points margin in history.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{cars were}} {{deployed}} {{to slow the}} race as marshals worked for twenty-two minutes to dry the spilled oil along the Mulsanne Straight. As the safety cars were recalled, Lotterer in the No. 7 Audi used slower traffic to pass both Porsche drivers {{in front of him}} and take over the race lead, just as Nico Hülkenberg moved to fourth place by passing the remaining Audi cars. In the LMP2 category the safety car had split the field up, leaving the TDS Racing and KCMG Oreca-Nissan cars forty seconds ahead of their class rivals. Richard Bradley for KCMG was able to fight with TDS Racing's Tristan Gommendy on the restart and eventually retake the class lead it had lost at the race start. Lotterer was later forced to give up the race lead as a puncture on one of the No. 7's tyres required an extra pit stop, allowing Hartley's No. 17 Porsche to the front of the race. Duval was caught on an approach to a slow zone (which was enforced to allow a marshal to retrieve debris <b>at</b> <b>Indianapolis)</b> by a group of slowed LMGTE cars and took avoiding action by steering right into the grass off track. The No. 8 Audi clipped the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari's right-hand section and was thrown back sideways across the track, impacting the outside barriers head on heavily driving into Indianapolis corner and ripping the car's front bodywork off. Safety cars were required once again as the barriers needed lengthy repairs, while Duval was able to drive the damaged Audi back to the garage. Repairs took less than five minutes and the car resumed in eighth place.|$|E
