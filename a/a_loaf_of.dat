5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like <b>a</b> <b>loaf</b> <b>of</b> bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E
5|$|The farm invasions {{severely}} impacted agricultural development. Zimbabwe {{had produced}} over two {{million tons of}} maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000.

At this time, the worshipper usually engages in silent prayerful worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E

This incident raised fears about safety of the highway, particularly with memories of the then-recent overpass collapse in Laval, Quebec, still fresh in the minds of motorists and media.|$|E
