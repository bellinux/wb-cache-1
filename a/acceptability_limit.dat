40|$|Despite its {{apparently}} intuitive nature, the <b>acceptability</b> <b>limit</b> {{is probably}} the most difficult parameter to be defined when developing a shelf life test. Although it dramatically affects the final shelf life value, it is surprising that discussion on its nature has been largely neglected in the literature and only rare indications about the possible methodologies for its determination are available in the literature. This {{is due to the fact}} that the definition of this parameter is a consumer- and market-oriented issue, requiring a rational evaluation of the potential negative consequences of food unacceptability in the actual market scenario. This paper critically analyzes the features of the <b>acceptability</b> <b>limit</b> and the role of the decision maker.

40|$|The {{microbiota}} of crewmembers and {{the spacecraft}} environment contributes significant risk to crew health during space flight missions. NASA reduces microbial risk with various mitigation methods that originated during the Apollo Program {{and continued to}} evolve through subsequent programs: Skylab, Shuttle, and International Space Station (ISS). A quarantine of the crew and lunar surface samples, within the Lunar Receiving Laboratory following return from the Moon, was used to prevent contamination with unknown extraterrestrial organisms. The quarantine durations for the crew and lunar samples were 21 days and 50 days, respectively. A series of infections among Apollo crewmembers resulted in a quarantine before launch to limit exposure to infectious organisms. This Health Stabilization Program isolated the crew for 21 days before flight and was effective in reducing crew illness. After the program developed water recovery hardware for Apollo spacecraft, the 1967 National Academy of Science Space Science Board recommended the monitoring of potable water. NASA implemented <b>acceptability</b> <b>limits</b> of 10 colony forming units (CFU) per mL {{and the absence of}} viable E. coli, anaerobes, yeasts, and molds in three separate 150 mL aliquots. Microbiological investigations of the crew and spacecraft environment were conducted during the Apollo program, including the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project and Skylab.

40|$|The {{chemical}} stability of lupin protein isolates (LPIs) obtained through aqueous fractionation (AF, i. e. fractionation {{without the use}} of an organic solvent) at 4 °C or 20 °C was assessed. AF of lupin seeds results in LPIs containing 2 wt. % oil. This oil is composed of mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids and the isolate may thus be prone to lipid and protein oxidation. Lipid and protein oxidation marker values of LPIs obtained at 4 °C and at 20 °C were below the <b>acceptability</b> <b>limit</b> for edible vegetable oils and meat tissue protein; the level of lipid oxidation markers was lower at 20 °C than at 4 °C. The fibre-rich pellet and the protein-rich supernatant obtained after AF also had lower levels of oxidation markers at 20 °C than at 4 °C. This is probably the result of a higher solubility of oxygen in water at lower temperature, which could promote lipid oxidation. The differences between fractions {{can be explained by the}} differences in their composition; the fibre-rich pellet contains polysaccharides that potentially have an anti-oxidative effect, while the protein-rich supernatant is rich in sulphur-rich proteins that may scavenge metal ions and free radicals from the aqueous phase. Additionally, the differences in solubility of metal ions and metal-chelating properties of protein at pH 4. 5 and pH 7. 0 explain the higher level of oxidation in the LPI at pH 4. 5 compared with the LPI at pH 7. 0. The application of a heat treatment to reduce oxidation decreased the protein and oil recovery values, and increased oxidation values above the <b>acceptability</b> <b>limit.</b> Therefore, AF at 20 °C is the most suitable process to obtain chemically stable LPIs...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a combined daylight, airflow network and building energy simulation of a Public Rental Housing (PRH) development in Hong Kong to fulfil {{the requirement of}} the local green building guidance. The numerical modelling results are partly validated by on-site measurements during the period with the highest monthly average outdoor temperature. Different ventilation control strategies are simulated to optimize natural ventilation performance. The simulation {{results show that the}} full-day ventilation strategy contributes to a lower average and peak indoor temperatures compared to the non-ventilation and night-ventilation scenarios. The indoor operative temperature of a worst-case vacant flat lies under the upper 80 % <b>acceptability</b> <b>limits</b> in ASHRAE 55 during 67. 5 % of the modelled period in July. On the other side, at least 95. 6 % of the habitable area in the case buildings is predicted to experience a higher average daylight factor of 1 % compared with the local green building guidance. Furthermore, the energy saving potential of the combined natural ventilation and daylight strategies is anticipated to be 51. 9 % for air-conditioning and 8. 3 % for lighting compared to a baseline building, respectively.

40|$|Microorganisms can spoil food supplies, {{contaminate}} drinking water, release noxious volatile compounds, initiate allergic responses, {{contaminate the}} environment, and cause infectious diseases. International <b>acceptability</b> <b>limits</b> {{have been established}} for bacterial and fungal contaminants in air and on surfaces, and environmental monitoring is conducted to ensure compliance. Allowable levels of microorganism in water and food have also been established. Environmental monitoring of the space shuttle, the Mir, and the ISS have allowed for some general conclusions. Generally, the bacteria found in air and on interior surfaces are largely of human origin such as Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp. Common environmental genera such as Bacillus spp. are the most commonly isolated bacteria from all spacecraft. Yeast species associated with humans such as Candida spp. are commonly found. Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., and Cladosporium spp. are the most commonly isolated filamentous fungi. Microbial levels in the environment differ significantly depending upon humidity levels, condensate accumulation, and availability of carbon sources. However, human "normal flora" of bacteria and fungi can result in serious, life-threatening diseases if human immunity is compromised.

40|$|The {{shelf-life}} of 3 batches (Q 1, Q 2, Q 3) of quail meat, were examined. Q 1 {{were cut}} and seasoned with commercial olive oil, stoned green olive and sliced bacon. Q 2 {{were divided into}} two subgroups: Q 2. 1 produced in the previously described conditions; Q 2. 2 seasoned also with rosemary. Quails were placed in lowdensity polystirene barrier trays and aerobically packaged. Q 3 quails were boiled in salted hot water for 40 min, seasoned with myrtle leafs, placed in low density polyethylene bags and vacuum packaged. All samples were stored at + 2 and + 7 °C. Analysis were conducted at 0, 3, 7, 9 and 14 days (T 0, T 3, T 7, T 9, and T 14, respectively). For all the samples, pH measurement and microbial analysis [total viable count (TVC), Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Lactobacillus spp. (LAB), Pseudomonas spp., Brochothrix thermosphacta, coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus spp., yeasts and moulds, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes] were performed. Initial TVC levels of fresh quails (ca. 4 log CFU/g) were rather high and {{this may be due to}} the microbial population of the raw material. In Q 1 and Q 2. 1 samples, TVC reached the value of 7 log, which is considered as the upper <b>acceptability</b> <b>limit</b> for fresh poultry meat (after T 9 under storage at + 2 °C and after T 7 at + 7 °C). In Q 2. 2 samples such limit was reached earlier, after T 3. In Q 3 samples, lower TVC levels were recorded and did not reach the above mentioned limit, not even at the end of storage. However, mean counts > 5 log were reached, maybe because of a post-cooking cross-contamination. Salmonella spp. prevalence was 33 % in Q 1, Q 2. 1 and Q 2. 2 samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{bacteriological}} quality of bottled natural mineral waters sold in Hungary because, in recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in consumer demand for these products in the country. In total, 492 samples of domestic and imported brands of carbonated and non-carbonated mineral waters (246 samples each) were purchased from retail outlets, and were then screened for the presence of the following indicator and potentially pathogenic bacteria: spore-forming sulfite-reducing anaerobes (clostridia), total coliforms. Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) were also determined by incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h and at 22 degrees C for 72 h. The data generated were compared to the reference criteria set by Directive 2009 / 54 /EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters. The results showed that 5. 3 % and 10. 2 % of the carbonated and non-carbonated mineral water samples tested, respectively, were positive for at least one of the specific indicator or potentially pathogenic bacteria. Overall, a total of 38 sample units (7. 7 %) failed to comply with the standards set by Directive 2009 / 54 /EC. None of the samples were judged noncompliant with current regulations on the basis of the presence of HPC bacteria at levels reaching or exceeding the <b>acceptability</b> <b>limit</b> (i. e., 100 CFU/ml at 22 degrees C or 20 CFU/ml at 37 degrees C) because the analyses were not carried out within 12 h after bottling, as required by Directive 2009 / 54 /EC. The findings of this study highlight the need for a more stringent self-control by some producers of mineral water. In addition, a more systematic surveillance by the official authorities of food control is also necessary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In Norway, most {{patients}} on oral anticoagulation with warfarin are treated in primary care. The treatment is monitored with the laboratory method prothrombin time, expressed as International normalized Ratio (INR). It {{is important that}} the INR methods have good analytical quality because the treatment (medical dose) depends on the INR result. Overdosing can cause severe bleedings and under dosing can lead to thrombosis. The laboratories in primary care control the analytical quality of their INR methods by performing internal quality control (IQC) and external quality assessment (EQA). There are, however, some challenges regarding these quality control systems. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate and suggest improvements of the analytical quality control of INR methods used in primary care. The primary care laboratories perform IQC mainly by two different approaches; 1) a commercial lyophilized control material is analyzed on the INR method and the result is compared with some control limits, 2) a fresh patient sample is analyzed both on the INR method and on a hospital method, and the difference between the methods is compared with some control limits. The latter approach is called split sample procedure. The primary care INR method is considered “in control” if the result is within the limits and “out of control” if the result is outside the limits (error alarm). The aim of paper I was to evaluate and compare these two IQC approaches in their ability to detect systematic errors. Power functions were created by computer simulations based on empirical data from 18 primary care laboratories using the INR methods Thrombotrack, CoaguChek S, or Hemochron Jr. Signature. The control rules 12 S, 13 S, exponential weighted moving average, and the deviation limits of ± 10 % and ± 20 % were evaluated by their probability of error detection and false alarms. The results showed that the probability of detecting systematic errors was higher when lyophilized control materials were used compared to patient split samples. The probability of false alarms was, however, the same. The conclusion in paper I was that IQC of INR methods in primary care should be performed by using control materials rather than the split sample procedure. The split sample procedure with native patient samples should be restricted to method bias estimation. International guidelines recommend that primary care laboratories should participate in an EQA scheme whenever available. The aim of paper II was to investigate if and how the European countries provide this service for point-of-care (POC) INR methods. Thirty European countries were asked, and nineteen countries reported that they do not provide EQA schemes for POC INR methods, while 12 organizations from nine countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and United Kingdom) reported that they offer this service. All 12 organizations answered a questionnaire regarding their schemes, and the results showed that there is a vide variation in how the schemes are organized. However, the most common is to use lyophilized control materials, establish peer group target values, use an <b>acceptability</b> <b>limit</b> of 15 % and distribute four samples per year. Most of the countries organize educational activities with focus on quality improvement. The study in paper II demonstrates that most European countries do not provide EQA schemes for POC INR methods, and that the disadvantages in most of the provided schemes were the use of non-commutable control materials making comparison between different POC methods impossible. An important objective in EQA is to evaluate systematic deviations (bias) between methods. This is, however, not possible when non-commutable control materials with peer group target values are used. The aim of paper III was to develop a new EQA model in which an evaluation of method bias was incorporated in EQA schemes that use non-commutable materials. The model was developed based on the concept that a selected group of primary care laboratories should establish an estimate of the systematic deviation of the POC method from a designated comparison method by using fresh patient samples, and this information should then be incorporated in the feedback to the participants in the EQA scheme using non-commutable control materials. As a consequence, the participants will get more information about the analytical quality of their method. The model was applied twice in POC INR surveys among 1341 and 1578 participants, respectively. To estimate bias for each POC INR method, about 100 native patient samples were analyzed both by a selected group of expert primary care laboratories (72 and 69 in the first and second survey, respectively) and on a designated comparison method. Both method bias and the deviation of a single-participant result in the EQA schemes were evaluated against separate analytical quality specifications. Two POC INR methods (CoaguChek XS Plus and Simple Simon) fulfilled the quality specification for bias, whereas one did not (Thrombotrack). More than 90 % of the participants received results within the quality specification for a deviating EQA result. In conclusion, a new EQA model for POC methods was proposed in paper III. This model can be used in situations where commutable control materials are not available. An editorial in the journal Clinical Chemistry has recommended that EQA organizers should implement this proposed EQA model. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} recent {{research}} creating {{a family of}} electrophoresis-based point of care devices for the determination {{of a wide range}} of ionic analytes in various sample matrices. These devices are based on a first version for the point-of-care measurement of Li+, reported in 2010 by Floris etal. (Lab Chip 2010, 10, 1799 - 1806). With respect to this device, significant improvements in accuracy, precision, detection limit, and reliability have been obtained especially by the use of multiple injections of one sample on a single chip and integrated data analysis. Internal and external validation by clinical laboratories for the determination of analytes in real patients by a self-test is reported. For Li+ in blood better precision than the standard clinical determination for Li+ was achieved. For Na+ in human urine the method was found to be within the clinical <b>acceptability</b> <b>limits.</b> In a veterinary application, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + were determined in bovine blood by means of the same chip, but using a different platform. Finally, promising preliminary results are reported with the Medimate platform for the determination of creatinine in whole blood and quantification of both cations and anions through replicate measurements on the same sample with the same chip...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) process applicability to a typical aeronautical joint: the union of the stiffeners to sheets constituting the fuselage. To do this analysis FSW parameters of flat overlapped sheets were first identified by monitoring the temperature reached using thermography. 1. 3 mm thick AA 2024 T 3 overlapped sheets were welded with success and the thermal effect due {{to the use of}} different welding parameters was compared with the results of mechanical tests and microstructural investigations. FSW joint mechanical properties were compared with those detected by performing tensile tests of joints made by riveting, showing absolutely comparable values. FSW identified parameters were used to make overlap joints between flat panels and stiffeners, so as to realize a typical structure of the aeronautical sector and to compare, by pressurization tests, the resistance of such panels with similar riveted. The innovative character of this research is represented by cyclic pressurization tests, conducted as indicated by the FAR (Federal Aviation Regulation) rules on a scale model. Thus it was possible to verify that the fatigue strength of welded panels is such as to overcome the <b>acceptability</b> <b>limits</b> fixed in the aeronautical field...|$|R
40|$|Shelf life {{determination}} {{by means}} of sensory analysis {{is thought to be}} of paramount importance even in case of a microbiologically stable food. Several approaches are found in literature, both in terms of data collection and data processing. Whatever method is used, the subjectivity in the choice of some parameters for data collection and analysis can deeply influence the final result. We put in evidence some typical pitfalls that the researcher should avoid when planning the test and analysing data. A comparison between the most utilized techniques in sensory data processing for shelf life prediction is reported, taking as a fil rouge the case of coffee. In particular, a non-linear regression, a logistic regression and a survival models were applied to simulated data frames of coffee. We evaluated the influence of the choice of <b>acceptability</b> <b>limits,</b> as well as the effect of data variability and we found out that they strongly influence predictions, as well as the panel and the batch of product do. We suggest that in case of microbiologically stable food, like coffee, shelf life is not univocal and it is a choice of the company or the researcher, rather than the result of the interaction between product and consumer.
