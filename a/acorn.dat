40|$|SYNOPSIS. We {{have shown}} that eastern gray {{squirrels}} and other animals consis-tently prefer to store intact <b>acorns</b> from the red oak group rather than those from the white oak group. We hypothesized that the ultimate advantage to this behavior comes from the dormancy of red oak <b>acorns.</b> <b>Acorns</b> of the white oak group ger-minate early in the autumn; thus, we hypothesize that avoiding germination is the primary selective advantage to the preference for caching red oak <b>acorns.</b> Here, we test two alternative hypotheses to explain the benefits of this caching preference: 1) storing red oak <b>acorns</b> allows the high tannin concentrations in red oak <b>acorns</b> to decline (making them more palatable), and 2) storing red oak <b>acorns</b> minimizes losses to insects, presuming they are less infested with insects. We also test the effect of germination schedule on squirrel caching preferences directly, by pre-senting them with dormant red oak <b>acorns,</b> and red oak <b>acorns</b> about to germinate. We find no evidence that tannin concentrations in red oak <b>acorns</b> decline, although tannin levels did decline in our white oak <b>acorns.</b> We found high losses to insect infestations in one white oak species, but a second white oak species lost very little mass to insects. Finally, we found that germination schedule directly affects squir-rel caching preferences: red oak <b>acorns</b> that are near germination are treated like white oak <b>acorns.</b> We conclude that the primary advantage to the preference for caching red oak <b>acorns</b> {{is that they are}} less perishable, due to their dormancy. We discuss the effects of this preference on the dispersal of red and white oak <b>acorns,</b> and the subsequent effects of differential dispersal on the ecology and evolution of oaks...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the show}} ended in 1987, {{elements}} of {{it have been}} revived by the cast from time to time. Wood and Walters both appeared as Margery and Joan in a sketch for Red Nose Day 1988 – A Night of Comic Relief, broadcast live. <b>Acorn</b> Antiques has been revived many times: firstly, Mrs Overall briefly returned in 1992's Victoria Wood's All Day Breakfast. Secondly, <b>Acorn</b> Antiques was briefly brought back for an episode in 2001, featuring the original cast and Nick Frost as an armed robber. In 2005 it was revived by Wood as a West End theatre production , starring the original cast and directed by Trevor Nunn. Limited to a 16-week sold-out run, it then toured with a brand-new cast, this time directed by Wood herself.|$|E

50|$|Many animals eat unripe <b>acorns</b> on {{the tree}} or ripe <b>acorns</b> from the ground, with no {{reproductive}} benefit to the oak, but some animals, such as squirrels and jays serve as seed dispersal agents. Jays and squirrels that scatter-hoard <b>acorns</b> in caches for future use, effectively plant <b>acorns</b> {{in a variety of}} locations in which it is possible for them to germinate and thrive.|$|R

5|$|The Airborne Group {{had been}} experimenting with {{microwave}} systems as early as 1938 after discovering that a suitable arrangement of the <b>acorn</b> tubes could be operated at wavelengths as short as 30cm. However, these had very low output, and operated well within the region of reduced sensitivity on the receiver side, so detection ranges were very short. The group gave up on further development for the time being.|$|E
50|$|Together with larva of the {{filbertworm}} moth (Cydia latiferreana), the {{filbert weevil}} feeds on the <b>acorns</b> of {{several species of}} oak tree.

50|$|Eastern fox {{squirrels}} in Ohio prefer hickory nuts, <b>acorns,</b> corn, {{and black}} walnuts. The squirrels are absent where {{two or more}} of these mast trees are missing. Eastern fox squirrels also eat buckeyes, seeds and buds of maple and elm, hazelnuts (Corylus spp.), blackberries (Rubus spp.), and tree bark. In March, they feed mainly on buds and seeds of elm, maple, and willow. In Ohio, eastern fox squirrels have the following order of food preference: white oak (Quercus alba) <b>acorns,</b> black oak (Quercus velutina) <b>acorns,</b> red oak (Quercus rubra) <b>acorns,</b> walnuts, and corn.|$|R

5|$|The team {{received}} {{a number of}} Western Electric Type 316A large <b>acorn</b> vacuum tubes in early 1937.

Percy Hibberd built a prototype transmitter with pulses {{of a few hundred}} watts and fitted it to the Heyford in March 1937.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acorn</b> Antiques {{is perhaps}} the best-remembered regular item from the series. It was a spoof soap opera set in an {{antiques}} shop, which, despite its provincial high-street status, manages to supply an unending stream of works by Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The two shop customers appearing {{at the start of}} each sketch, examining some antique, are always played by the same two actors. The sketch parodied the soap genre with its bad acting, ridiculous dialogue and contrived plot twists. Wood, as a homage, based it on the long-running ATV/Central serial Crossroads, and the BBC radio soap opera Waggoners Walk (1969–1980).|$|E
50|$|After drying {{them in the}} sun to {{discourage}} mold and germination, women took <b>acorns</b> back to their villages and cached them in hollow trees or structures on poles, to keep them safe from mice and squirrels. The stored <b>acorns</b> could then be used when needed, particularly during the winter when other resources were scarce. Those <b>acorns</b> that germinated in the fall were shelled and pulverized before those that germinate in spring. Because of their high fat content, stored <b>acorns</b> can become rancid. Molds may also grow on them.|$|R

5|$|On 31 August boats from Alceste put {{the party}} ashore at Ostia, near Rome, where they {{made contact with}} a {{representative}} of the Vatican who agreed to speak to the Pope but failed to return. When it was deemed necessary to travel to Rome to re-establish contact, the priests refused to go. Maxwell sent them back to Palermo in <b>Acorn,</b> which returned a week later with another volunteer of Drummond's. Landed on the night of 19 September, the envoy was captured and shot as a spy the following day. Consequently, the entire plan was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Sir Clive Sinclair's {{interest}} in the possibilities of electric vehicles originated in the late 1950s during a holiday job for the electronics company Solatron.

He tasked one of his employees, Chris Curry – later a co-founder of <b>Acorn</b> Computers – to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- We {{examined}} the effects of partial cotyledon herbivory on developmental growth of seedlings from Quercus crispula <b>acorns</b> by simulated cotyledon removal. Although the size was smaller, seedlings developed from partially cotyledon-removed <b>acorns</b> showed higher RGRs with lower cotyledon reserves than those from intact ones.

50|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{begins at}} around 20 years, but the tree {{does not produce}} large crops of <b>acorns</b> until its 50th year and the amount varies from year to year. <b>Acorns</b> deteriorate quickly after ripening, the germination rate being only 10% for six-month-old seeds. As the <b>acorns</b> are prime food for animals and insects, all may be lost in years of small crops.|$|R
