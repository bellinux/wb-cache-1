5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.|$|E
500|$|On 23 December 2005, Alex Gilady, an Israeli IOC {{member and}} a member of the IOC's London 2012 Co-ordination Commission, {{suggested}} that Madrid should have tied for second spot with Paris in the third round of voting, but did not do so because Greek member Lambis Nikolaou pressed the wrong button. He further postulated that if this had happened, Madrid would have beaten Paris in the resulting runoff ballot for second place, and gone on to beat London in the final round. However, Craig Reedie, a British IOC member, dismissed these words, commenting that a claim [...] "that an unnamed member 'might' have done something which 'might' have brought <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> which 'might' have brought about a different result is 'the kind of tittle-tattle that happens after many an IOC vote'." ...|$|E
2500|$|O'Neal {{announced}} his retirement via social media on June 1, 2011. Two days later, O'Neal {{held a press conference}} at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement. When asked who was the greatest player he ever played with during his career, O'Neal did not answer but Bryant was the only player whose name was mentioned. He also mentioned that his departure from Los Angeles {{has nothing to do with}} Kobe Bryant, saying [...] "the reason I left wasn't about what Kobe did; it was <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> I was making maximum dollars and felt I deserved more. It was a business end." [...] When asked whether leaving Los Angeles was a bad decision, he answered [...] "I don't like to live in a world of ifs. But if we would have stayed, possibly we could have got six [...]" ...|$|E

And {{he sighed}} again, being indeed so profoundly gloomy that gloom {{must have been}} lodged in him to cloud him at any moment, which was odd in a man who enjoyed things so, was not much given to analysis, but was horribly romantic, of course, Bonamy thought, in his rooms in Lincoln's Inn.|$|R
2500|$|All of {{a sudden}} we had two Australian teams on one tour... I {{certainly}} felt excluded... At one stage in England I was waiting in a bar for my teammates to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out. At that stage I think I had played nine Tests and was averaging 40 and you had other people who were barely Shield cricketers being called up by Packer. I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always a question I will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... It was a strange feeling. There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Thirteen," [...] the Grounders {{celebrate}} their Ascension Day, a holy day for Grounders. Octavia {{and a man}} named Semet walk in claiming the Sky People destroyed their village. Discussing the situation, Titus wants Lexa to destroy the thirteenth clan while Clarke thinks they just need time to take out Pike from the inside. Speaking to everyone, Lexa orders the armies not to attack, but instead make a perimeter around Arkadia and says that any Sky Person found past the five mile buffer will be killed. Semet is angry at this and attempts to kill Lexa, but is stopped by Titus who kills him. Later, Titus is against Clarke staying, believing she further endangers Lexa's life. He warns Lexa that, just like with Costia, {{she may not be}} able to separate feelings from duty. Lexa is enraged at this, reminding him that because she let Ice Nation into her coalition even after they cut off Costia's head and sent it to her bed, she is more than capable of separating feelings from duty. Later, Clarke goes into Lexa's room and realizes she is saying goodbye. Clarke says the reason she is going back is because the Sky People are her people. Lexa says that this devotion is what makes Clarke the person she is. Clarke suggests that maybe someday they will owe nothing more to their people, and Lexa responds with [...] "May we meet again." [...] Clarke kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, Clarke admires Lexa's tattoos, pointing out there are only seven circles on her back despite there being nine participants. Lexa tells her she got the one on her back on her Ascension Day, and asks to talk <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Clarke agrees and they become intimate again.|$|E

60|$|This was a {{pleasant}} source of amusement, uniting, as it did, considerable effort and some danger, {{with the prospect of}} a smash in some of the steering tackle, so Billy prepared to indulge himself; but it struck him that the frequent recurrence of the accompanying noise would bring the skipper on deck and spoil the fun, so on second thoughts he desisted, and glanced eagerly <b>about</b> for <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> afraid that the golden opportunity would pass by unimproved.|$|R
6000|$|My {{eyes were}} so blinded by gold, that I paid no heed to his wise counsel, and only looked <b>about</b> for <b>something</b> <b>else</b> to grasp. Suddenly I remembered the little box of {{ointment}} that the dervish had hidden, and which most likely contained a treasure more precious {{than all the}} rest. Giving him one last embrace, I observed accidentally, [...] "What {{are you going to}} do with that little box of ointment? It seems hardly worth taking with you; you might as well let me have it. And really, a dervish who has given up the world has no need of ointment!" ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} helpfulness of strategies used by teens growing up in families with Huntington disease (HD). Forty-four participants responded to a mailed HD Family Survey-Teens Strategies. Strategies were those with strong positive correlation between use and perceived helpfulness, and those with negative or inverse relationships. Obtaining information, thinking <b>about</b> or doing <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> and actions on behalf of the parent with HD were rated as highest use and perceived helpfulness. Emotional suppression had high use but low helpfulness. Participants reported using numerous helpful strategies. Social support was often unavailable to help manage teen concerns...|$|R

2500|$|During a Children's Hospital visit near Christmas 1971 a boy {{playing with}} a toy pistol frightened Genie, and when Curtiss tried to reassure her Genie said an {{abbreviated}} version of Curtiss' words, [...] "Little bad boy. Bad gun." [...] About two weeks later Curtiss heard Genie speaking to herself and using an invented gesture for the word [...] "naughty", and when Curtiss asked Genie what she said she repeated, [...] "Little bad boy. Bad gun." [...] out loud for several minutes, marking {{the first time she}} spoke <b>about</b> <b>something</b> in the past. Several months later David and Marilyn overheard her saying, [...] "Father hit big stick. Father is angry." [...] to herself, marking the first time anyone heard her talk about her life before starting to acquire language. She infrequently spoke to others about her early life, but the Riglers said that {{for the rest of the}} time she lived with them she constantly repeated [...] "Father hit" [...] to herself.

6000|$|Trent strolled {{through the}} open window into the garden, and breathed a deep sigh of relief. He was a free man again now. He had created new dangers--a new enemy to face--but what did he care? All his life had been spent in facing dangers and conquering enemies. What he had done before he could do again! As he lit a pipe and walked to and fro, he felt that this new state of things lent a certain savour to life--took from it a certain {{sensation}} of finality not altogether agreeable, which his recent great achievements in the financial world seemed to have inspired. After all, what could Da Souza do? His prosperity was altogether bound up in the success of the Bekwando Syndicate--he was never the man to kill the goose which was laying such a magnificent stock of golden eggs. The affair, so far as he was concerned, troubled him scarcely at all on cool reflection. As he drew near the little plantation he even forgot all <b>about</b> it. <b>Something</b> <b>else</b> was filling his thoughts! ...|$|R
5000|$|The chair had {{not been}} just a charade, however. Richard {{revealed}} that he had {{allowed himself to be}} handicapped as part of his own learning process, going on to state [...] "I was a teacher then. I am <b>about</b> to become <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> So I discard that option". The city had truly degenerated by this point all pretense of law and order long lost. Richard, who had thought his studies had put him beyond such things, found himself shocked and horrified by the actions of people in Hub City. For example, a man was using a dead baby to try and beg for 'milk money'. When Richard and the others uncovered this, he tossed the body into a nearby trash can.|$|R

Cats and Nonconformists seem to me the only things in this world possessed of a practicable working conscience. Watch a cat doing something mean and wrong--if ever one gives you the chance; notice how anxious she is that nobody should see her doing it; and how prompt, if detected, to pretend that she was not doing it--that she was not even thinking of doing it--that, as a matter of fact, she was just <b>about</b> to do <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> quite different.

60|$|But now we {{approached}} Springfield, and perhaps at Springfield we should find the enemy. Surely {{if they did}} not oppose the passage they would blow up the bridge. Tiny patrols--beetles on a green baize carpet--scoured the plain, and before we reached the crease--scarcely perceptible at a mile's distance, in which the Little Tugela flows--word was brought that no Dutchmen were anywhere to be seen. Captain Gough, it appeared, with one man had ridden over the bridge in safety; more than that, had actually explored three miles on the further side: did not believe there was a Boer this side of the Tugela: would like to push on to Potgieter's and make certain: 'Perhaps we can seize Potgieter's to-night. They don't like having a flooded river behind them.' So we come safely to Springfield--three houses, a long wooden bridge 'erected by public subscription, at a cost of 4,300l.'--half a dozen farms with their tin roofs and tree clumps seen in the neighbourhood--and no Boers. Orders were to seize the bridge: seized accordingly; and after all had crossed and watered in the Little Tugela--swollen by the rains to quite a considerable Tugela, eighty yards wide--we looked <b>about</b> for <b>something</b> <b>else</b> to do.|$|R

5000|$|Peter Vajda {{identifies}} gossip {{as a form}} {{of workplace}} violence, noting that it is [...] "essentially a form of attack." [...] Gossip is thought by many to [...] "empower one person while disempowering another" [...] (Hafen). Accordingly, many companies have formal policies in their employee handbooks against gossip. Sometimes there is room for disagreement on exactly what constitutes unacceptable gossip, since workplace gossip may take the form of offhand remarks about someone's tendencies such as [...] "He always takes a long lunch," [...] or [...] "Don’t worry, that’s just how she is." [...] TLK Healthcare cites as examples of gossip, [...] "tattletailing to the boss without intention of furthering a solution or speaking to co-workers <b>about</b> <b>something</b> someone <b>else</b> has done to upset us." [...] Corporate email can be a particularly dangerous method of gossip delivery, as the medium is semi-permanent and messages are easily forwarded to unintended recipients; accordingly, a Mass High Tech article advised employers to instruct employees against using company email networks for gossip. Low self-esteem and a desire to [...] "fit in" [...] are frequently cited as motivations for workplace gossip.There are five essential functions that gossip has in the workplace (according to DiFonzo & Bordia): ...|$|R
