25|$|The HR is {{triggered}} by the plant when it recognizes a pathogen. The identification of a pathogen typically occurs when <b>avirulence</b> geneproducts, secreted by a pathogen, bind to, or indirectly interact with {{the product of a}} plant resistance (R) gene (gene for gene model). R genes are highly polymorphic, and many plants produce several different types of R gene products, enabling them to recognize virulence products produced by many different pathogens.|$|E
50|$|A complex {{relationship}} between hypersensitive response and pathogenicity genes, <b>avirulence</b> genes, and plant resistance genes {{gives rise to}} the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Generally, a single <b>avirulence</b> gene (in the bacterium) corresponds to a single resistance gene (in the plant host), giving rise to the concept of a gene-for-gene response. The <b>avirulence</b> gene leads to the pathogen being avirulent, or unable to induce disease on a specific variety of plant hosts, those being the ones carrying the corresponding resistance genes. Soybean cultivars that have been bread to contain resistance genes Rpg1, Rpg2, Rpg3, and Rpg4 {{have been shown to be}} resistant to Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea race 4. The corresponding <b>avirulence</b> genes in the bacterium are avrB, avrA, avrC, and avrD. A different race of Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea may still be able to elicit disease in these soybean cultivars as it may carry different <b>avirulence</b> genes. Researchers have shown that the exchange of <b>avirulence</b> genes can switch a race from being virulent to avirulent and vice versa. Thus, evolution, mutation, and cases of horizontal gene transfer can make it difficult to breed longterm resistance into soybean cultivars.|$|E

50|$|<b>Avirulence</b> on Ve1 is {{a protein}} first {{described}} from the fungal plant-pathogen, Verticillium dahliae, and is encoded by the Ave1 gene.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of Ave1 in an isolate of Verticillium dahliae conveys an <b>avirulence</b> phenotype when infecting a Tomato host that possesses the R-gene Ve1.|$|E
50|$|LRRs are {{involved}} in protein-protein interactions, and the greatest variation amongst resistance genes occurs in the LRR domain. LRR swapping experiments between resistance genes in flax rust resulted in the specificity of the resistance gene for the <b>avirulence</b> gene changing.|$|E
50|$|Studied R genes usually confer {{specificity}} {{for particular}} strains of a pathogen species (those that express the recognized effector). As first noted by Harold Flor in his mid-20th century {{formulation of the}} gene-for-gene relationship, a plant R gene has specificity for a pathogen <b>avirulence</b> gene (Avr gene). <b>Avirulence</b> genes are now known to encode effectors. The pathogen Avr gene must have matched specificity with the R gene for that R gene to confer resistance, suggesting a receptor/ligand interaction for Avr and R genes. Alternatively, an effector can modify its host cellular target (or a molecular decoy of that target), and the R gene product (NLR protein) activates defenses when it detects the modified form of the host target or decoy.|$|E

50|$|Effectors are {{proteins}} encoded by pathogens, which act {{to effect}} a response from a host cell - often modulating the host immune response.

50|$|There is {{no common}} {{structure}} between <b>avirulence</b> gene products. Because {{there would be}} no evolutionary advantage to a pathogen keeping a protein that only serves to have it recognised by the plant, it is believed that the products of Avr genes {{play an important role in}} virulence in genetically susceptible hosts.|$|E
50|$|Yeast two-hybrid {{studies of}} the tomato Pto/Prf/AvrPto {{interaction}} showed that the <b>Avirulence</b> protein, AvrPto, interacted directly with Pto despite Pto not having an LRR. This makes Pto the guardee protein, which is protected by the NBS-LRR protein Prf. However, Pto is a resistance gene alone, which is an argument against the guard hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 Keen {{was awarded}} the American Phytopathological Society's annual award, named after Ruth Allen (herself a plant pathologist), {{alongside}} fellow professor Brian Staskawicz. The two had worked together in 1980 at the International Plant Research Institute in San Carlos, California {{in order to use}} recombinant DNA techniques to clone bacterial <b>avirulence</b> genes. Their work confirmed an aspect of the Gene-for-gene relationship.|$|E
50|$|Several {{experiments}} {{support this}} hypothesis, e.g. the Rpm1 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana {{is able to}} respond to two completely unrelated <b>avirulence</b> factors from Pseudomonas syringae. The guardee protein is RIN4, which is hyperphosphorylated by the Avr proteins. Another high profile study that supports the guard hypothesis shows that the RPS5 pair uses PBS1, a protein kinase as a guardee against AvrPphB.|$|E
50|$|The RIP {{mutations}} do {{not seem}} to be limited to repeated sequences. Indeed, for example, in the phytopathogenic fungus L. maculans, RIP mutations are found in single copy regions, adjacent to the repeated elements. These regions are either non-coding regions or genes encoding small secreted proteins including <b>avirulence</b> genes.The degree of RIP within these single copy regions was proportional to their proximity to repetitive elements.|$|E
50|$|The HR is {{triggered}} by the plant when it recognizes a pathogen. The identification of a pathogen typically occurs when <b>avirulence</b> geneproducts, secreted by a pathogen, bind to, or indirectly interact with {{the product of a}} plant resistance (R) gene (gene for gene model).

5000|$|The gene-for-gene {{relationship}} {{was discovered by}} the late Harold Henry Flor who was working with rust (Melampsora lini) of flax (Linum usitatissimum). Flor showed that the inheritance of both resistance in the host and parasite ability to cause disease is controlled by pairs of matching genes. One is a plant gene called the resistance (R) gene. The other is a parasite gene called the <b>avirulence</b> (Avr) gene. Plants producing a specific R gene product are resistant towards a pathogen that produces the corresponding Avr gene product. [...] Gene-for-gene relationships are a widespread and very important aspect of plant disease resistance. An example can be seen with Lactuca serriola.|$|E
50|$|Resistance to Bremia lactucae in Lactuca serriola {{is due to}} Dm genes, {{or single}} {{dominant}} genes. Nine of the dominant genes that confer resistance are Dml, Dm, Dm3, Dm6, Dml4, Dml5, DmlO, Dm5/8, Dm10, Dm4, Dm7, Dm11, and Dm13. These genes are mapped in four linkage groups, so the genes within each group {{will be more likely}} to be inherited together. Lactuca serriola and B. lactucae have a gene-for-gene relationship, meaning that each resistance gene in the plant is associated with a specific gene in the pathogen, with <b>avirulence</b> being dominant to virulence. The possible combinations of these Dm genes can provide the plant with resistance to multiple strains of Bremia lactucae.|$|E
5000|$|Example: AvrPto {{is a small}} triple-helix protein that, like {{several other}} effectors, is {{targeted}} to the plasma membrane by N-myristoylation. [...] AvrPto is an inhibitor of PRR kinase domains. PRRs signal plants to induce immunity when PAMPs are detected. The ability to target receptor kinases {{is required for the}} virulence function of AvrPto in plants. However, Pto is a resistant gene that can detect AvrPto and induce immunity as well. [...] AvrPto is an ancient effector that is conserved in many P. syringae strains, whereas Pto R gene is only found in a few wild tomato species. [...] This suggests recent evolution of the Pto R gene and the pressure to evolve to target AvrPto, turning a virulence effector to an <b>avirulence</b> effector.|$|E
5000|$|Many gene-for-gene {{relationships}} {{have been identified}} using the two model organisms, P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 and Arabidopsis. The gene-for-gene relationship describes the recognition of pathogenic <b>avirulence</b> (avr) genes by host resistance genes (R-genes). P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 is {{a useful tool for}} studying avr: R-gene interactions in A. thaliana because it can be transformed with avr genes from other bacterial pathogens, and furthermore, because none of the endogenous hops genes is recognized by A. thaliana, any observed aver recognition identified using this model can be attributed to recognition of the introduced avr by A. thaliana. [...] The transformation of P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 with effectors from other pathogens have led to the identification of many R-genes in Arabidopsis to further advance knowledge of plant pathogen interactions.|$|E

5000|$|Genome-sequencing, gene {{knockout}} or antisense knockdown techniques have provided agrochemists with {{a method for}} validating potential new biochemical targets. However, genes such as <b>avirulence</b> genes are not essential for the organism and many potential targets lack known inhibitors. Examples of this procedure include the search for new herbicidal compounds of the nonmevalonate, such as the discovery of new inhibitors of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (IspD, Enzyme Commission (EC) number 2.7.7.60) with the best expressing a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 140 nM in the greenhouse at [...] Thanks to an x-ray crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana, IspD enzyme cocrystallized with the inhibitor, a more potent inhibitor with an IC50 of 35 nM was designed. Mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) inhibitors were also found. Three hundred thousand compounds were tested against the SHMT enzyme, producing 24 hits. Among those hits, a subclass was followed with in vivo screening and compounds were promoted to field trials.|$|E
5000|$|The 70-kb pYV is {{critical}} to Yersinias pathogenicity, since it contains many genes known to encode virulence factors and its loss gives <b>avirulence</b> of all Yersinia species. [...] A 26-kb [...] "core region" [...] in the pYV contains the ysc genes, which regulate the expression and secretion of Yops. [...] Many Ysc proteins also amalgamate to form a type-III secretory apparatus, which secretes many Yops into the host cell cytoplasm {{with the assistance of}} the [...] "translocation apparatus", constructed of YopB and YopD. [...] The core region also includes yopN, yopB, yopD, tyeA, lcrG, and lcrV, which also regulate Yops gene expression and help to translocate secretory Yops to the target cell. [...] For example, YopN and TyeA are positioned as a plug on the apparatus so only their conformational change, induced by their interaction with certain host cell membrane proteins, will cause the unblocking of the secretory pathway. [...] Secretion is regulated in this fashion so that proteins are not expelled into the extracellular matrix and elicit an immune response. Since this pathway gives secretion selectivity, it is a virulence factor.|$|E
50|$|P. infestans is diploid, {{with about}} 11-13 chromosomes, and in 2009 {{scientists}} completed the sequencing of its genome. The genome {{was found to}} be considerably larger (240 Mbp) than that of most other Phytophthora species whose genomes have been sequenced; Phytophthora sojae has a 95 Mbp genome and Phytophthora ramorum had a 65 Mbp genome. About 18,000 genes were detected within the P. infestans genome. It also contained a diverse variety of transposons and many gene families encoding for effector proteins that are involved in causing pathogenicity. These proteins are split into two main groups depending on whether they are produced by the water mould in the symplast (inside plant cells) or in the apoplast (between plant cells). Proteins produced in the symplast included RXLR proteins, which contain an arginine-X-leucine-arginine (where X can be any amino acid) sequence at the amino terminus of the protein. Some RXLR proteins are <b>avirulence</b> proteins, meaning that they can be detected by the plant and lead to a hypersensitive response which restricts the growth of the pathogen. P. infestans was found to encode around 60% more of these proteins than most other Phytophthora species. Those found in the apoplast include hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases, lipases and glycosylases that act to degrade plant tissue, enzyme inhibitors to protect against host defence enzymes and necrotizing toxins. Overall the genome was found to have an extremely high repeat content (around 74%) and to have an unusual gene distribution in that some areas contain many genes whereas others contain very few.|$|E
50|$|Adherence of M. pneumoniae to a {{host cell}} (usually a {{respiratory}} tract cell, but occasionally an erythrocyte or urogenital lining cell) is the initiating event for pneumonic disease and related symptoms. The specialized attachment organelle is a polar, electron dense and elongated cell extension that facilitates motility and cytadherence to host cells. It is composed of a central filament surrounded by an intracytoplasmic space, along {{with a number of}} adhesins and structural and accessory proteins localized {{at the tip of the}} organelle.A variety of proteins are known to contribute to the formation and functionality of the attachment organelle, including the accessory proteins HMW1-HMW5, P30, P56, and P90 that confer structure and adhesin support, and P1, P30 and P116 which are involved directly in attachment. This network of proteins participates not only in the initiation of attachment organelle formation and adhesion but also in motility. The P1 adhesin (trypsin-sensitive protein) is a 120 kDa protein highly clustered on the surface of the attachment organelle tip in virulent mycoplasmas. Both the presence of P1 and its concentration on the cell surface are required for the attachment of M. pneumoniae to the host cell. M. pneumoniae cells treated with monoclonal antibodies specific to the immunogenic C-terminus of the P1 adhesin have been shown to be inhibited in their ability to attach to the host cell surface by approximately 75%, suggesting P1 is a major component in cytadherence. These antibodies also decreased the ability of the cell to glide quickly, which may contribute to decreased adherence to the host by hindering their capacity to locate a host cell. Furthermore, mutations in P1 or degradation by trypsin treatment yield avirulent M. pneumoniae cells. Loss of proteins in the cytoskeleton involved in the localization of P1 in the tip structure, such as HMW1-HMW3, also cause <b>avirulence</b> due to the lack of adhesin clustering. Another protein considered to play an important role in cytadherence is P30, as M. pneumoniae cells with mutations in this protein or that have had antibodies raised against P30 are incapable of adhering to host cells. P30 is not involved in the localization of P1 in the tip structure since P1 is trafficked to the attachment organelle in P30 mutants, but rather it may function as a receptor-binding accessory adhesin. P30 mutants also display distinct morphological features such as multiple lobes and a rounded shape as opposed to elongated, which suggests P30 may interact with the cytoskeleton during formation of the attachment organelle.A number of eukaryotic cell surface components have been implicated in the adherence of M. pneumoniae cells to the respiratory tract epithelium. Among them are sialoglycoconjugates, sulfated glycolipids, glycoproteins, fibronectin, and neuraminic acid receptors. Lectins on the surface of the bacterial cells are capable of binding oligosaccharide chains on glycolipids and glycoproteins to facilitate attachment, in addition to the proteins TU and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 β, which bind to fibronectin.|$|E
30|$|A {{second group}} of genes like <b>avirulence</b> genes are known to {{activate}} plant defense responses. In this case, one expects that constitutive or inducible activation of defenses will increase disease resistance. When <b>avirulence</b> genes are used (e.g., avrXa 27), pathogen-specific effects are expected. For this reason, {{most of the cases}} deal with <b>avirulence</b> genes that are broadly distributed (e.g., flagellin).|$|E
40|$|Resistance {{of plants}} to {{bacterial}} pathogens is often controlled by corresponding genes for resistance and <b>avirulence</b> in host and pathogen, respectively. Fifty years after {{discovery of the}} genetic basis of gene-for-gene interactions, several <b>avirulence</b> and plant resistance genes have been isolated and are being studied on the molecular level. Tremendous {{progress has been made}} due {{to a better understanding of}} type III secretion systems that are required for bacterial pathogenicity. We are beginning to grasp how the plant actually recognizes bacterial <b>avirulence</b> determinants.

40|$|In {{agricultural}} systems, major (R) {{genes for}} resistance in plants exert strong selection pressure on cognate/ corresponding <b>avirulence</b> effector genes of phytopathogens. However, a complex interplay often exists between trade- offs linked to effector function {{and the need}} to escape R gene recognition. Here, using the Leptosphaeria maculans- oilseed rape pathosystem we review evolution of effectors submitted to multiple resistance gene selection. Characteristics of this pathosystem include a crop in which resistance genes have been deployed intensively resulting in ` boom and bust ' cycles; a fungal pathogen with a high adaptive potential in which seven <b>avirulence</b> genes are cloned and for which population surveys have been coupled with molecular analysis of events responsible for virulence. The mode of evolution of <b>avirulence</b> genes, all located in dispensable parts of the ' two-speed ' genome, is a highly dynamic gene- specific process. In some instances, <b>avirulence</b> genes are readily deleted under selection. However, others, even when located in the most plastic genome regions, undergo only limited point mutations or their <b>avirulence</b> phenotype is ` camouflaged ' by another <b>avirulence</b> gene. Thus, while hundreds of effector genes are present, some effectors are likely to have an important and nonredundant function, suggesting functional redundancy and dispensability of effectors might not be the rule...|$|E
40|$|The gene-for-gene {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} for each gene controlling {{resistance in the}} host, there is a corresponding, specific gene controlling <b>avirulence</b> in the pathogen. Allelic series of the cereal mildew resistance genes Pm 3 and Mla provide an excellent system for genetic and molecular analysis of resistance specificity. Despite this opportunity for molecular research, <b>avirulence</b> genes in mildews remain underexplored. Earlier work in barley powdery mildew (B. g. hordei) {{has shown that the}} reaction to some Mla resistance alleles is controlled by multiple genes. Similarly, several genes are involved in the specific interaction of wheat mildew (B. g. tritici) with the Pm 3 allelic series. We found that two mildew genes control <b>avirulence</b> on Pm 3 f: one gene is involved in recognition by the resistance protein as demonstrated by functional studies in wheat and the heterologous host Nicotiana benthamiana. A second gene is a suppressor, and resistance is only observed in mildew genotypes combining the inactive suppressor and the recognized Avr. We propose that such suppressor/avirulence gene combinations provide the basis of specificity in mildews. Depending on the particular gene combinations in a mildew race, different genes will be genetically identified as the <b>avirulence</b> gene. Additionally, the observation of two LINE retrotransposon-encoded <b>avirulence</b> genes in B. g. hordei further suggests that the control of <b>avirulence</b> in mildew is more complex than a canonical gene-for-gene interaction. To fully understand the mildew-cereal interactions, more knowledge on <b>avirulence</b> determinants is needed and we propose ways how this can be achieved based on recent advances in the field...|$|E

40|$|Segregation of <b>avirulence</b> in Mycosphaerella graminicola, a heterothallic ascomycete {{that causes}} wheat septoria tritici leaf blotch, was studied in F 1, BC 1, and F 2 populations by {{inoculation}} assays on five wheat cultivars in the seedling stage and by amplified fragment length polymorphism and random amplified polymorphic DNA analyses. F 1 was generated by crossing isolates IPO 323 (avirulent) and IPO 94269 (virulent). All F 1, BC 1, and F 2 progeny isolates were virulent on the susceptible check cultivar Taichung 29 and were avirulent on the resistant check cultivar Kavkav-K 4500. <b>Avirulence</b> segregation {{was observed in}} F 1 and in several BC 1 and F 2 generations on the differential cultivars Shafir, Kavkaz, and Veranopolis at a 1 : 1 ratio. <b>Avirulence</b> for the three differential cultivars always cosegregated.

40|$|To {{develop a}} model system for {{molecular}} genetic analysis of plant-pathogen interactions, we studied {{the interaction between}} Arabidopsis thaliana and the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst). Pst strains {{were found to be}} virulent or avirulent on specific Arabidopsis ecotypes, and single ecotypes were resistant to some Pst strains and susceptible to others. In many plant-pathogen interactions, disease resistance is controlled by the simultaneous presence of single plant resistance genes and single pathogen <b>avirulence</b> genes. Therefore, we tested whether <b>avirulence</b> genes in Pst controlled induction of resistance in Arabidopsis. Cosmids that determine <b>avirulence</b> were isolated from Pst genomic libraries, and the Pst <b>avirulence</b> locus avrRpt 2 was defined. This allowed us to construct pathogens that differed only by {{the presence or absence of}} a single putative <b>avirulence</b> gene. We found that Arabidopsis ecotype Col- 0 was susceptible to Pst strain DC 3000 but resistant to the same strain carrying avrRpt 2, suggesting that a single locus in Col- 0 determines resistance. As a first step toward genetically mapping the postulated resistance locus, an ecotype susceptible to infection by DC 3000 carrying avrRpt 2 was identified. The avrRpt 2 locus from Pst was also moved into virulent strains of the soybean pathogen P. syringae pv glycinea to test whether this locus could determine <b>avirulence</b> on soybean. The resulting strains induced a resistant response in a cultivar-specific manner, suggesting that similar resistance mechanisms may function in Arabidopsis and soybean...|$|E
40|$|Gene pthA is {{required}} for virulence of Xanthomonas citri on citrus plants and has pleiotropic pathogenicity and <b>avirulence</b> functions when transferred to many different xanthomonads. DNA sequencing revealed that pthA belongs to a family of Xanthomonas avirulence/pathogenicity genes characterized by nearly identical 102 -bp tandem repeats in the central region. By inserting an nptI-sac cartridge into the tandemly repeated region of pthA as a selective marker, intragenic recombination among homologous repeats was observed in both Xanthomonas spp. and Escherichia coli. Intragenic recombination within pthA created new genes with novel host specificities and altered pathogenicity and/or <b>avirulence</b> phenotypes. Many pthA recombinants gained or lost <b>avirulence</b> function in pathogenicity assays on bean, citrus, and cotton cultivars. Although the ability to induce cell division (hyperplastic cankers) on citrus could be lost, this ability was not acquired on cotton or bean plants. Intragenic recombination therefore provides a genetic mechanism for the generation of multiple, different, and gratuitous <b>avirulence</b> genes from a single, required, host-specific pathogenicity gene...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} studied the inheritance of <b>avirulence</b> by hybridizing the isolates Sg 139 - 4 (Mat A) a highly virulent and Sg 110 - 9 (Mat B) an avirulent on a pearl millet genotype IP 18292 containing a {{downy mildew resistance}} gene Rsg 1. Pot-grown seedlings of IP 18292 were inoculated with sporangial inocula generated from sexual spores (oospore) of the parental isolates and their F 1, F 2, BC 1 and BC 2 progenies and incubated at 25 ± 2 °C and > 90 % relative humidity in a greenhouse. Downy mildew incidence was recorded two weeks after inoculation. The results indicated that <b>avirulence</b> was dominant over virulence and a single gene pair (AA/Aa) controlled <b>avirulence</b> in isolates Sg 110 - 9, to a corresponding resistance gene Rsg 1 in IP 18292.

40|$|In plants, {{resistance}} to a pathogen is frequently correlated with a genetically defined interaction between a plant resistance gene and a corresponding pathogen <b>avirulence</b> gene.

40|$|Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria is {{the causal}} agent of leaf spot disease on pepper and tomato. On non-host plants, such as bean, soybean, cowpea, alfalfa, and cotton, X. campestris pv. vesicatoria {{is unable to}} cause disease, {{inducing}} instead a hypersensitive resistance response (HR). Since <b>avirulence</b> genes from X. campestris pv. vesicatoria specifically induce HR in several pepper cultivars, we investigated whether there were <b>avirulence</b> genes governing induction of resistance in non-host species. We report on the molecular cloning and characterization of a non-host <b>avirulence</b> gene from X. campestris pv. vesicatoria. A cosmid clone isolated from a library of DNA from X. campestris pv. vesicatoria tomato race 1 converted X. campestris pv. phaseoli to <b>avirulence</b> by inducing HR on the bean cultivar Sprite, but not on Bush Blue Lake. The HR-inducing activity was localized to a 2. 1 -kilobase Pst I fragment of DNA, designated avrRxv. In addition, we demonstrate that avrRxv inhibited disease production by several X. campestris pathovars on their normally susceptible hosts: glycines on soybean, vignicola on cowpea, alfalfae on alfalfa, holcicola on corn, and malvacearum on cotton. The HR resistance in bean induced by avrRxv segregated as a single incompletely dominant gene, designated Rxv.

40|$|A {{molecular}} genetic {{approach was}} used to identify and characterize plant genes that control bacterial disease resistance in Arabidopsis. A screen for mutants with altered resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) expressing the <b>avirulence</b> gene avrRpt 2 resulted in the isolation of four susceptible rps (resistance to P. syringae) mutants. The rps mutants lost resistance specifically to bacterial strains expressing avrRpt 2 as they retained resistance to Pst strains expressing the <b>avirulence</b> genes avrB or avrRpm 1. Genetic analysis indicated that {{in each of the}} four rps mutants, susceptibility was due to a single mutation mapping to the same locus on chromosome 4. Identification of a resistance locus with specificity for a single bacterial <b>avirulence</b> gene suggests that this locus, designated RPS 2, controls specific recognition of bacteria expressing the <b>avirulence</b> gene avrRpt 2.
