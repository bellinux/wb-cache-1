While the airport's on-site emergency services were notified almost immediately, the DFW Department of Public Safety (DPS) Communications Center did not begin notifying off-site emergency services until nearly 10 minutes after the crash, and did not finish its notifications until 45 minutes after the crash. During notifications, DPS also failed to request ambulances from the adjacent communities of Irving, Grapevine, and Hurst; however, Hurst responded with ambulances after personnel at its ambulance company overheard the airport crash report on a radio-frequency scanner.

In this context, SID EGYII antimicrobial activity was extensively studied against various microbial pathogens.

There exist discrepancies among responses of different tested bacterial members of different species/genera and even of same species towards SID EGYII. These discrepancies might be attributed possibly {{to the presence of}} siderophores’ receptors on the cell membranes of bacterial members that did not <b>affect</b> <b>adversely</b> by SID EGYII and their absence in bacterial members that did <b>affect</b> <b>adversely</b> by SID EGYII activity. These siderophore’s membrane receptors would help the bacteria to satisfy their iron nutritional requirements.|$|E
