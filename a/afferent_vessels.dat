50|$|On {{laying the}} dorsal {{wall of the}} auricle open, its cavity {{is found to be}} {{continuous}} with that of the great posterior elevated median ridge or trunk vein before alluded to, and on opening this trunk-vein the various lateral branches are observed debouching into it on either side. It is therefore evident that this trunk-vein, which lies entirely within the skin, is the great posterior afferent or branchio-cardiac vein, and that all the elevated branches coming to it from the cerata are also <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels.</b> This way are cerata used for breathing as a specialized breathing organ.|$|E
50|$|The kidney is shortly tongue-shaped, {{in length}} less than twice its breadth, {{about half the}} length of the lung, and about one and a half times {{the length of the}} pericardium; the latter has the usual {{position}} on the left margin of the kidney. The ureter continues around the right margin of the kidney, follows the posterior limit of the lung, and opens close to the intestine. From this point the intestine, or rectum, forms a long straight tube. There is a well-marked ridge on the pulmonary wall less than 3 mm. {{from the side of the}} rectum, and the narrow area thus defined appears to be the open continuation of the ureter. The above-mentioned ridge examined in section proves to be tubular; it continues into the tissue of the mantle, and appears to unite with the blood-sinus contained therein. The venation of the lung, with the exception of the great pulmonary vein, is very indistinct. This vein runs direct to the auricle, is of considerable breadth, and has an undulating, almost convolute, appearance. On approaching the pneumostome it forms several branches, and the latter, with their accompanying <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels,</b> are fairly well indicated. The vessels on the rectal side of the lung are minute and very much branched, while on the cardiac side only a few traces may be seen.|$|E
5000|$|In children, {{distinguishing}} between a primary malignant liver tumor (hepatoblastoma) and a benign primary hepatic lesion (hemangioendothelioma) is crucial. The absence of urinary catecholamines supports {{the diagnosis of}} hemangioendothelioma. In patients with hemangioendotheliomas, elevations in α1-fetoprotein levels are milder than those found in patients with hepatoblastomas. Infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma is strongly suggested {{by the presence of}} a vascular lesion on imaging studies. A complex, heterogeneous mass is often seen on ultrasonograms; a complex tumor that lacks central enhancement can be see on CT scans; and the vascular nature of the lesion along with dilation of the aorta proximal to the origin of the celiac artery and a decrease in the diameter distally, indicating significant shunting, is seen on angiograms. Because most hemangioendotheliomas in infants sponanteously involute and regress within the first 12 to 18 months of life, asymptomatic lesions are generally managed conservatively. Infants who have severe anemia and/or thrombocytopenia can be given blood products; for those who have cardiac failure, diuretics and digoxin are often given. To stop further growth and to speed regression of lesions in infants with more significant clinical sequelae, treatment with corticosteroids or interferon-α-2a is administered. To slow the growth of tumors that are rapidly enlarging, chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been used. Surgical resection, partial hepatectomy, and embolization of <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> should be considered for severe cases.|$|E

5000|$|The lymph {{capillaries}} {{drain the}} lymph to larger contractile lymphatics, which have valves {{as well as}} smooth muscle walls. These are called the collecting lymphatics. As the collecting lymph vessel accumulates lymph from more and more lymph capillaries in its course, it becomes larger and is called the <b>afferent</b> lymph <b>vessel</b> as it enters a lymph node. Here the lymph percolates through the lymph node tissue and is removed by the efferent lymph vessel. An efferent lymph vessel may directly drain {{into one of the}} (right or thoracic) lymph ducts, or may empty into another lymph node as its <b>afferent</b> lymph <b>vessel.</b> Both the lymph ducts return the lymph to the blood stream by emptying into the subclavian veins ...|$|R
40|$|Observations that {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) constitutively enter <b>afferent</b> lymphatic <b>vessels</b> in many {{organs and}} that DCs in some tissues, {{such as the}} lung, turnover rapidly in the steady state {{have led to the}} concept that a major fraction of lymph node DCs are derived from migratory DCs that enter the lymph node through upstream <b>afferent</b> lymphatic <b>vessels.</b> We used the lysozyme M–Cre reporter mouse strain to assess the relationship of lymph node and nonlymphoid organ DCs.

The kidney glomeruli, including {{those from the}} fetal kidneys, had anastomosing capillaries. The glomeruli in the kidneys of an aged person contained many more capillaries which were much more tortuous {{than those of the}} adult and fetal kidneys. Furthermore, it was observed that the glomeruli in the kidneys of the aged person usually received tortuous <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> and frequently emitted multiple efferent arterioles. The glomeruli in the juxtamedullary layer of the kidneys of the aged person were rather small in size and contained degenerative capillary networks.

50|$|The lymph nodes, the spleen and Peyer's patches, {{are known}} as {{secondary}} lymphoid organs.

40|$|That {{gangrene}} {{can result}} from venous obstruc-tion, although rare, is not widely realized. A preliminary and brief examination of its genesis is worth while. As Learmonth (I 950) pointed out, among other factors, the viability of tissue depends on an adequate rate of blood flow through the capillaries. Interference with the blood flow maybe caused by a lesion in (i) the efferent vessel or artery, (2) the capillary itself, (3) the <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel</b> or vein, (4) some combination of the preceding. Cessation or marked slowing of capillary blood flow sufficient to cause gangrene {{can result from}} venous blockage. This was shown experimentallyby Fontaine and De S.

40|$|The {{architecture}} of lymphatic microcirculation of pig lymph nodes was studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} using a corrosion cast method. There were two types of lymph <b>vessels</b> for <b>afferent</b> lymph supply {{as well as those}} for efferent lymph drainage. Most <b>afferent</b> lymph <b>vessels</b> entered the node at the A-type hilus and penetrated deeply into the node. Others divided from the larger afferents and distributed to the convex surfaces of the node. One type of efferent lymph vessel left from the E-type hilus by several efferent trunks and was formed by confluences of many smaller lymph vessels, and the other type arose from surfaces around the peri-hilar (A-type) region, encompassing the <b>afferent</b> lymph <b>vessels</b> with numerous initial efferent <b>vessels.</b> The <b>afferent</b> lymph <b>vessels</b> were followed by intra-trabecular lymph channels. The peri-trabecular lymph sinuses and the peri-hilar (A-type) sub-capsular lymph sinuses were connected subsequently with the efferent lymph vessels and there was a direct communication between the cortex- and the medulla-like tissue (CT and MT). A marked difference between the casting patterns of the CT and MT was recognized; that is, the CT was visualized as a dense coral-reef-like shape, whereas the MT exhibited a bead-like structure with numerous larger inter-spaces. These findings suggest that the intranodal lymph pathways not only share reversal in flow but are more minute and complex than those hitherto demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProposed reflex {{mechanisms}} for generalized neurohumoral activation in heart failure include decreased input from inhibitory baroreceptor <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> and increased input from excitatory <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> arising from arterial chemoreceptors, skeletal muscle metaboreceptors or the lungs. Not all subjects with {{left ventricular dysfunction}} have increased sympathetic nerve activity, but the magnitude of sympathoneural activation appears to independently predict survival. This association suggests both a causative mechanism linking sympathetic activation with adverse outcome and a therapeutic opportunity to improve the prognosis of such patients by inhibiting central sympathetic outflow. Generalized sympathetic activation {{is not unique to}} heart failure, and its functional consequences appear to be both organand condition-specific. Sympathetic activation is present in other disorders such as mild hypertension, cirrhosis and aging that do not share the dim prognosis of congestive heart failure. The adverse effects of adrenergic activation on the diseased myocardium may be a function of the magnitude and time course of increases in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, the mechanical and electrophysiologic consequences of nonuniform abnormalities of sympathetic innervation in the failing heart and the absence of specific countervailing mechanisms present in other conditions also characterized by increased sympathetic traffic. The hypotheses that activation of adrenergic drive to the diseased myocardium is the causative mechanism linking sympathoexcitation to adverse outcome and that interventions that inhibit sympathetic outflow to the heart will improve the prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure have not been specifically tested. Greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the heterogeneity of sympathetic activation in response to ventricular dysfunction, for cardiac-specific and generalized activation of the sympathetic nervous system and for the stimulation or suppression of countervailing mechanisms capable of resisting its adverse effects is fundamental to the development of better therapies for congestive heart failure...|$|E
40|$|A 76 -year-old {{woman with}} {{hepatitis}} C cirrhosis presented with tarry stools and hematemesis.

Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) of the varices using cyanoacrylate was successfully performed in combination with the temporary occlusion of the portal vein. Although no previous publications have used cyanoacrylate as an embolic agent for BRTO to control bleeding duodenal varices, this strategy can be considered as an alternative procedure to conventional BRTO using ethanolamine oleate when numerous <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> that cannot be embolized are present...|$|E
30|$|The Ag {{retention}} hypothesis, was not substantiated by subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization of mice with radioactively (14 C)-labeled TT adsorbed to AP adjuvant (Gupta et al. 1996). Subsequently, a {{study was}} conducted to show the relation between Ag retention at the site of injection and Ab titers in rat sera 5  weeks after primary immunization and 2  weeks after boost (Noe et al. 2010). In this study, rats were injected with 111 In-labelled alpha casein (IDCAS) Ag adsorbed to AH or IDCAS adsorbed to AP or non-adsorbed IDCAS Ag formulated in phosphate-treated AP (PTAP) or IDCAS solution by s.c. route.

This study and that of de Veer and colleagues summarized that alum reduces the amount of soluble Ag entering <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels,</b> although their adjuvanticity was not found to be correlated with slow Ag release (de Veer et al. 2010; Noe et al. 2010). Thus, in vivo dispensability of strong adsorption, retention, and slow release of Ag by alum in Ab response indicates that other mechanisms may exist in alum adjuvanticity.|$|E

Rats were ventilated, and rectal temperature was maintained at 36, 37 (normothermic), or 38 degrees C. In all rats, 70 % liver ischemia was induced by clamping the <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> to the median and left lateral lobes for 60 min, and reperfusion was allowed for 90 min. Changes in plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) levels were measured, hemodynamics and bile secretion were monitored, and arterial blood-gas analysis was performed. All ventilated rats showed a normal pH, arterial PCO(2), and arterial PO(2). AST, ALT, and alpha-GST levels were significantly higher in the 38 degrees C group when compared with the 36 and 37 degrees C groups after ischemia. No differences in bile secretion were found between all groups. Histopathological alterations were in agreement with AST, ALT, and alpha-GST levels in plasma. We conclude that a decrease of only 1 degrees C in body temperature significantly attenuates liver I/R injury, whereas an increase of 1 degrees C significantly increases liver I/R injur...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to investigate prevalence and Doppler characteristics of penile cavernosal-spongiosal communications (CSC). These vessels are either anastomoses connecting the cavernosal arteries with the urethral arterial network or <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> to the corpus spongiosum. Sixty-one consecutive patients underwent penile color Doppler US. Waveform changes in CSC were evaluated in comparison with changes in the cavernosal artery. Eighteen of 61 patients had normal erection, 17 of 61 had arterial insufficiency, and 26 of 61 had veno-occlusive dysfunction. Resistance index (RI) in CSC was significantly lower than in cavernosal arteries in all patients and increased during phases 1 - 2 (positive diastolic flow). Peak systolic velocity (PSV) in CSC was significantly higher in the patients with veno-occlusive dysfunction. During cavernosal phase 4 (diastolic flow reversal) CSC of patients with normal erection or with arterial insufficiency disappeared, underwent markedly reduced diastolic flow, or had systolic flow inversion. Conversely, low resistance flow was appreciable in CSC of patients with veno-occlusive dysfunction who reached phase 4. During phase 5 (systolic peak reduction) all CSC disappeared.

Twenty patients with severe Peyronie's disease underwent penile color Doppler US after intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E(1). Study inclusion criteria were penile curvature or shortening which made intercourse difficult or impossible. The quality of erectile response was subjectively scored. The spectral characteristics of CSC were evaluated in comparison with waveform changes in cavernosal artery. There were 4 patients with normal erectile response, 10 with discrepancy in rigidity of the penile base and tip, 4 with veno-occlusive dysfunction and 2 with arteriogenic dysfunction. The CSC just proximal to the plaques had peak systolic velocity (PSV) significantly higher and resistance index (RI) significantly lower than the other CSC. The PSV in CSC near the plaques of patients with base-tip discrepancy and with veno-occlusive dysfunction were significantly higher than in the other patients.

40|$|The {{multiple}} physiologic {{functions of}} angiotensin II(AII) are generally {{supposed to be}} mediated by the peptide generated in the blood circulation. In addition to this extracellular mechanism of AII formation, we have obtained immunohistochemical evidence for the intracellular synthesis of AII in the kidney.

Renin immunoreactivity was regularly observed in the epithelioid granular cells in the media of the <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel</b> of the glomerulus.
