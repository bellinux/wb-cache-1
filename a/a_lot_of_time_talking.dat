Bush told reporters: First of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give {{as a result of the}} special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during the time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person, and I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said, I did it. Would we have had this, you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter? But it's been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House, and it's run its course and now we're going to move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|During her {{reign as}} Miss America Williams was criticized in some venues for winning. She later stated that [...] "there {{were a lot}} of people that did not want me to be {{representative}} of the United States and Miss America. And not just white people alone. There {{were a lot of}} people who had issues [...] I was too light. My eyes were the wrong color. My hair wasn't the right texture and getting criticism for being who I was." [...] She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, You Have No Idea). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she [...] "wrote a book about everything that I went through, and I spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Raimi and his {{producing}} partner Robert Tapert progressed {{through various}} drafts, {{they realized that}} there was a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and [...] "lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions." [...] Goldin said that they [...] "spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of {{the nuts and bolts of}} the story." [...] The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script. For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, [...] "I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift off into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves." ...|$|E

A soldier is shot, but rather than showing a Spielbergian bloody face we see a tree explode, the shredded vegetation, and a gorgeous bird with a broken wing flying out of a tree".|$|E

50|$|The {{band was}} {{interested}} in having Ric Ocasek produce the album. Ocasek got {{his hands on the}} demo CD and immediately contacted Schwartzman.

Rooney flew out to New York City for a show with Phantom Planet at CBGB's. Schwartzman loved Ocasek's pink Jazzmaster, the one he used in The Cars. Ocasek said he could use it for the show, but Schwartzman took it back to LA and held onto to it for quite a while. The label liked the idea of Ocasek producing the album, but since he loved the demos so much, everyone thought that Keith Forsey and Brian Reeves, who recorded the demos, should be given the opportunity.|$|E

She starts dating a boy named Olímpico, who mistreats her and eventually leaves her for her coworker, Gloria. Gloria, who feels bad about the whole thing, recommends that Macabéa visit a fortune teller named Madame Carlota. She predicts that Macabéa's life will turn around soon, saying that she will be rich, happy, and marry Olímpico. However, none of this comes true as Macabéa's life comes to an abrupt end when a yellow Mercedes runs her over.|$|E
5000|$|Altman and Brackett spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> {{over the}} plot. Altman wanted Marlowe to be a loser. He even nicknamed Gould's {{character}} Rip Van Marlowe, {{as if he}} had been asleep for 20 years, had woken up, and was wandering around Los Angeles in the early 1970s but [...] "trying to invoke the morals of a previous era". Her first draft was too long, and she shortened it, but the ending was inconclusive. She had Marlowe shooting Terry Lennox. Altman conceived of the film as a satire and made several changes to the script, like having Roger Wade commit suicide and having Marty Augustine smash a Coke bottle across his girlfriend's face. Altman said, [...] "it was supposed to get the attention of the audience and remind them that, in spite of Marlowe, there is a real world out there, and it is a violent world".|$|E
