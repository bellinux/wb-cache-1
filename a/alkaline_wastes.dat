50|$|Caesium-135's {{predecessor}} xenon-135 {{is produced}} {{at a high}} rate of over 6% of fissions, but is an extremely potent absorber of thermal neutrons (neutron poison), so that most of it is transmuted to almost-stable xenon-136 before it can decay to caesium-135. If 90% of 135Xe is destroyed, then the remaining 135Cs's decay energy per unit time is initially only about 1% as great as that of the 99Tc. In a fast reactor, less of the Xe-135 may be destroyed.135Cs is the only alkaline or electropositive LLFP; in contrast, the main medium-lived fission products and the minor actinides other than neptunium are all alkaline and tend to stay together during reprocessing; with many reprocessing techniques such as salt solution or salt volatilization, 135Cs will also stay with this group, although some techniques such as high-temperature volatilization can separate it. Often the <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes</b> are vitrified to form high level waste, which will include the 135Cs.Fission caesium contains not only 135Cs but also stable but neutron-absorbing 133Cs (which wastes neutrons and forms 134Cs which is radioactive with a half-life of 2 years) as well as the common fission product 137Cs which does not absorb neutrons but is highly radioactive, making handling more hazardous and complicated; for all these reasons, transmutation disposal of 135Cs would be more difficult.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{carbonation}} of <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes</b> for CO 2 capture {{was mainly}} {{controlled by the}} CO 2 dissolution, i. e., mass-transfer controlled reaction, from the theoretical considerations. Several approaches to enhancing the CO 2 dissolution rate were proposed and investigated in the literature. For instance, it was proven {{that the rate of}} carbonation reaction for alkaline waste was effectively increase mass transfer rate if a rotating packed bed (RPB), so-called “high-gravity” or “HIGEE” process, was utilized. In this study, the experimental data were utilized to develop the carbonation model in an RPB for carbonation of various types of <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes</b> such as basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS) and cold-rolling mill wastewater (CRW). The effect of different operating parameters including operation modulus and rotating speed on CO 2 removal efficiency was evaluated. In addition, the overall volumetric gas-phase mass transfer coefficients (KGa) of BOFS/CRW carbonation in the RPB were calculated. Furthermore, according to the SEM observations, the <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes</b> were found to be successfully carbonated with CO 2 in an RPB, where calcite (CaCO 3) was identified as the main product. It was thus concluded that accelerated carbonation of <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes</b> using an RPB is an effective and efficient method for CO 2 capture due to its higher mass transfer rate and carbonation conversion...|$|E

Incinerator ash produced in municipal treatment facilities and marble-dust produced during marble cutting process are <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes.</b> This paper examines the carbon mineral sequestration potential of mixing <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes</b> in two soil samples in accelerated carbonation conditions. Six different percentages of <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes</b> in 20 g sample were used. Batch reactor conditions were maintained at 40 °C, relative humidity 60 - 70 % and CO 2 flow-rate of 10 litres-a-minute. Optimum water content was found by carrying out experiments on a sample with 7 different water-to-solid ratio (0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1 and 1. 2). The particle-size effect was gauged by taking soil samples sieved through standard sieve sizes of BSS 25 and BSS 50. It was concluded that low water-to-solids ratio is better for carbonation, although some minimum amount of water is necessary for reaction. The optimum water-to-solids ratio for incinerator ash comes to be 0. 4. Marble dust {{was found to be}} inefficient to capture CO 2 due to lower pH and due to lump formation. As expected, carbonation was higher for samples with less particle size and higher surface area...|$|E

Mineral carbonation of <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes</b> enables the combination of these two by-products, increasing the sustainability of industrial activities. On top of sequestering CO 2 in geochemically stable form, mineral carbonation of waste materials also brings benefits such as stabilization of leaching, basicity and structural integrity, enabling further valorization of the residues, either via reduced waste treatment or landfilling costs, or via the production of marketable products.

Better understanding and predictability {{of the effects of}} mineral carbonation on alkaline materials could be obtained by separately studying the constituent minerals carbonation susceptibility, allowing for detailed and accurate analysis of their reaction kinetics, maximal conversions and formed carbonate products. For this purpose, this paper presents the synthesis and carbonation of the seven most abundant alkaline minerals found in AOD, CC and BOF slags, namely: Åkermanite (Ca 2 MgSi 2 O 7), Bredigite (Ca 7 MgSi 4 O 16), Cuspidine (Ca 4 Si 2 O 7 F 2), β– and γ–C 2 S (Ca 2 SiO 4), Merwinite (Ca 3 MgSi 2 O 8), and Srebrodolskite (Ca 2 Fe 2 O 5). Two experimental approaches to mineral carbonation of increasing levels of process severity are utilized: (mild) incubator carbonation, and (accelerated) pressurized slurry carbonation. In addition, the slags and two free oxides (CaO and MgO) are equally carbonated and evaluated.

Removal of {sup 90 }Sr in the proposed treatment flashed is based on coprecipitation from strongly <b>alkaline</b> <b>waste</b> by adding stable strontium to the waste solution.

The Cesium Removal System is a modular, transportable, ion-exchange system configured as a compact processing unit. Liquid tank waste flows through columns packed with solid material, called a sorbent, that selectively adsorbs cesium and allows the other materials to pass through.

40|$|Historically, {{tailings}} {{management plans}} have focused largely on confinement and containment, {{with little regard}} to long term alteration of the chemical, physical, and biological properties of tailings materials. Management strategies are now moving towards in situ remediation of tailings to mitigate environmental risks associated with long term storage, and return occupied land areas to an alternative, productive land use. Creating a stable, sustainable ecosystem in tailings storage areas requires shifting our perspective to think of tailings as a novel soil forming material {{rather than as a}} waste. This review presents a conceptual model of soil formation (pedogenesis) in alkaline tailings and mineral processing residues, which can be used to guide rehabilitation efforts and identifies key knowledge gaps for future research. Although tailings and mine wastes exhibit chemical, physical, and biological properties greatly different to those of bedrock-derived parent materials, they experience the same drivers of soil formation (climate, organisms, relief, time) as bedrock parent materials, and understanding how these drivers interact is of importance in accelerating natural processes of soil formation and attainment of a desired ecosystem endpoint.

Among them, a fungus identified as Fusarium solani IHEM 8026 shows a good potential for cyanide biodegradation under alkaline conditions (pH 9. 2 to 10. 7). Results of K(sup 14) CN biodegradation studies show that fungal metabolism seems to proceed by a two-step hydrolytic mechanism: (i) the first reaction involves the conversion of cyanide to formamide by a cyanide-hydrolyzing enzyme, cyanide hydratase (EC 4. 2. 1. 66); and (ii) the second reaction consists of the conversion of formamide to formate, which is associated with fungal growth. No growth occurred during {{the first step of}} cyanide degradation, suggesting that cyanide is toxic to some degree even in cyanide-degrading microorganisms, such as F. solani. The presence of organic nutrients in the medium has a major influence on the occurrence of the second step. Addition of small amounts of yeast extract led to fungal growth, whereas no growth was observed in media containing cyanide as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. The simple hydrolytic detoxification pathway identified in the present study could be used for the treatment of many industrial alkaline effluents and wastes containing free cyanide without a prior acidification step, thus limiting the risk of cyanhydric acid volatilization; this should be of great interest from an environmental and health point of view...|$|E

Strontium- 90 exchanged rapidly with calcium in Florida pebble phosphate.

Heating Tennessee phosphate resulted in a material with excellent hydraulic properties that sorbed Cs/sup 137 / and Sr/sup 90 / from dilute alkaline solutions. Other calcium minerals such as calcite or dolomite were activated to adsorb Sr/sup 90 / by heating or by treating with caustic or phosphate solutions. Cesium- 137 in dilute alkaline solutions exchanged preferentially with the potassium present in a number of mica schists and mica minerals which possess a layer lattice type of structure. The high selectivity for cesium of Tennessee phosphate heated to 600 deg C for one hour ts ascribed to the presence of bentonitic impurities present in this material. The kinetics and adsorption of Ru/sup 106 / are shown to be complex and slow due to tbe large number of chemical forms and complexes of ruthenium which can exist under varying conditions.

Experiments were designed to be analogous to soil conditions following the remediation efforts. The {{results showed that the}} effect of red mud addition to soils was highly dependent upon soil properties, experimental pH, and total organic carbon (TOC) content. As and V were found to be persistently mobile under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Red mud addition to soils with a high TOC content mobilised high aqueous concentrations of organic matter complexing metals such as Cu, Ni and V under anaerobic conditions. Gypsum addition to red mud affected soils showed a reduction in aqueous oxyanion concentrations compared to soils with red mud addition alone indicating that it is potential ameliorant for red mud contaminated soils. The results showed that the extensive remediation efforts by the Hungarian authorities were justified but that red mud should be used with caution as a soil amendment...|$|R
40|$|High-level {{nuclear waste}} {{produced}} from fuel reprocessing {{operations at the}} Savannah River Site (SRS) requires pretreatment to remove {sup 137 }Cs, {sup 90 }Sr and alpha-emitting radionuclides (i. e., actinides) prior to disposal. Separation processes planned at SRS include caustic side solvent extraction, for {sup 137 }Cs removal, and ion exchange/sorption of {sup 90 }Sr and alpha-emitting radionuclides with an inorganic material, monosodium titanate (MST). The predominant alpha-emitting radionuclides in the highly <b>alkaline</b> <b>waste</b> solutions include plutonium isotopes {sup 238 }Pu, {sup 239 }Pu and {sup 240 }Pu. This paper provides a summary of data acquired to measure the performance of MST to remove strontium and actinides from simulated waste solutions. These tests evaluated the influence of ionic strength, temperature, solution composition and the oxidation state of plutonium...|$|R
