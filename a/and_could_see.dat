5|$|The {{loss of the}} {{long-range}} radar station at Poling caused few problems. The Chain Home Low radar there was working <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> almost as far out to sea. Along the surrounding coastline, for 70 miles, another six radar stations gave interlocking stations which provided cover, {{so there was no}} hole in the system. Within a few days, mobile units were moved into wooded areas nearby to provide cover until Poling was repaired.|$|E
5|$|While {{the film}} was still untitled, Javed Akhtar was signed to write the lyrics, and even wrote and {{recorded}} one song. However, when the movie was titled Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he found the title mediocre, obscene, and vulgar and decided to quit the project. Akhtar later regretted leaving the film, as he found it decent <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that the title has become quite a buzz-word, realizing {{that he was the}} only one who disliked the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather in}} the area had wind up towards , with clouds and heavy rain, and some reports of turbulence. The {{aircraft}} was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required. There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), but the airline had chosen to install the latter. Interviews with the surviving passengers showed {{that none of them}} perceived that there was any problems with the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path.|$|E
60|$|But it {{was before}} this that father {{returned}} one afternoon. Ernest was with me, <b>and</b> we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that father was angry--philosophically angry. He was rarely really angry; but a certain measure of controlled anger he allowed himself. He called it a tonic. <b>And</b> we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that he was tonic-angry {{when he entered the}} room.|$|R

5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York, he and Thomashefsky jointly leased The People's Theater, {{intending}} {{to use it}} on different nights of the week. Adler, exhausted from his Russian trip, was often leaving his nights unused, and Thomashefsky offered to buy him out for $10,000 {{on the condition that}} he would not return to performing in New York. Adler was so insulted that the two did not speak for months, even though at the time they were living across a courtyard from one another, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> into each other's St. Mark's Place apartments. Adler decided to perform Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness, and decided that he would do his own translation from Russian to Yiddish. The play was a great success, the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the U.S., and Thomashefsky was so obviously happy for Adler that their friendship was renewed. Adler followed with equally successful productions of Gordin's dramatization of Tolstoy's Resurrection and the Gordin original The Homeless.|$|E
5|$|The Australians on 400 Plateau had {{for some}} time been {{subjected}} to sniping and artillery fire <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Turkish troops digging in on Gun Ridge. Around 13:00 a column of Turkish reinforcements from the 27th Infantry Regiment, in at least battalion strength, were observed moving along the ridge-line from the south. The Turks then turned towards 400 Plateau and advanced in extended order. The Turkish counter-attack soon forced the advanced Australian troops to withdraw, and their machine-gun fire caused them heavy casualties. It {{was not long before}} the attack had forced a wedge between the Australians on Baby 700 and those on 400 Plateau. The heavy Turkish fire onto Lone Pine forced the survivors to withdraw back to the western slope of 400 Plateau. At 14:25 Turkish artillery and small arms fire was so heavy that the Indian artillerymen were forced to push their guns back off the plateau by hand, and they reformed on the beach.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E
5|$|The next day, 24 September, {{the brigade}} {{continued}} its advance by heading towards Suweileh, with the Wellingtons protecting the open flank. The {{next day the}} ANZAC mounted division was ordered to capture Amman. The Wellingtons provided the vanguard, and at 07:45, two miles north-west of Amman, the 9th Squadron, in the lead, was engaged by machine-gun and rifle fire <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Turkish cavalry in the distance. At 08:10 the 2nd Squadron moved forward to support the 9th, but came under fire from two redoubts. They took cover {{and were able to}} bring enfilade fire onto the redoubts and also onto a force of Turkish reinforcements preparing a counter-attack. At 10:00 the 9th Squadron were relieved by the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade. Manoeuvring enabled the division to press forward, forcing the Turkish defenders to retire. At 11:30 the regiment, with the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, were ordered to assault Amman. Leaving the 2nd Squadron to deal with concealed machine-gun posts, the rest continued the attack. By 14:40 they had closed on Amman and the 9th Squadron had captured a hill in front of Stone Tower. At 15:00 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles galloped into the town and all resistance there ceased. The regiment pressed forward along the Wadi Amman and captured three artillery pieces. By 16:30 all Turkish positions had been taken, along with hundreds of prisoners. That was the last battle of the campaign fought by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. The regiment camped beside the town until 29 September, when they left for Ziza to assist the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, who had captured five thousand prisoners. On 1 October they set out to return to the Jordan Valley.|$|E
25|$|After the interruption, Dyer {{came forward}} and {{delivered}} his speech. During his speech, Dyer {{explained that he was}} a separationist, though not to the extremes as some of the Separation League, a supporter of the elimination of the House of Representatives, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no reason why the Chinese could not come to New Zealand like any other people.|$|E

25|$|The Sudanese {{government}} and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue peace. The JEM has the most to gain from the talks <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> semi-autonomy much like South Sudan. However, talks were disrupted by accusations that the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the Tolu agreement. The JEM, the largest rebel group in Darfur, vowed to boycott negotiations.|$|E
25|$|In July 1897, {{both the}} West Lancashire and the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railways were {{absorbed into the}} Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L). The L had a large {{terminus}} at Southport Chapel Street <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no sense in operating two termini at very close proximity. In 1901, the L completed a remodelling of the approach lines to Central to allow trains to divert onto the Manchester to Southport line and into Southport Chapel Street Station. Southport Central was closed to passengers {{and it became a}} goods depot eventually amalgamating with Chapel Street depot. It survived intact well into the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|One {{police officer}} then {{drove down the}} road past Seascape and past the {{disabled}} car of Linda White. He looked {{at it for a}} moment and continued down to the Fox and Hound. After he informed his partner, they proceeded back to Seascape. At about 2:00p.m., they were back at Seascape <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the BMW on fire. At some point, they were fired upon, and eventually had to hide in a ditch {{at the side of the}} road. Bryant fired at them whenever they tried to escape, and they were not able to move from that position for many hours.|$|E

25|$|UPCI {{doctrine}} also {{distinguishes between}} {{the fruit of}} the Spirit, as mentioned in Galatians 5:22–23, and the initial act of speaking in tongues. The fruit of the Spirit takes time to develop or cultivate and therefore does not qualify as an immediate, outward and identifiable sign of receiving the Holy Ghost. Speaking in other tongues, on the other hand, does serve as that sign and is therefore considered an indispensable part of any person's salvation process. Acts 2:33, they knew they had the Holy Ghost because they could hear them <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them speak with tongues. 1 Cor. 14:22, tongues is for a sign, not to them that believe but to them that believe not.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of Gullknapp attracted criticism from some sources. This was mostly {{concerned with the}} services at Kjevik. Professor Frode Steen stated that Kjevik {{has a hard time}} attracting international routes and retaining competition on the route to Oslo. If a significant amount of patronage is redirect to Gullknapp, this could be a pivoting cause of insufficient volume on certain routes <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> airlines pull out of Kjevik or hinder the establishment of new routes. Also the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise in Agder stated that they were opposed to an expansion, stating that Agder was best served with one primary airport. Similarly, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries opposed the expansion, stating that it would weaken Kjevik and Torp.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} many later {{stories of the}} origins of the Delphic Oracle. One late explanation, which is first related by the 1st century BC writer, Diodorus Siculus, tells of a goat herder named Coretas, who noticed one day that one of his goats, who fell into a crack in the earth, was {{behaving}} strangely. On entering the chasm, he found himself filled with a divine presence <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> outside of the present into the past and the future. Excited by his discovery he shared it with nearby villagers. Many started visiting the site to experience the convulsions and inspirational trances, though some were said to disappear into the cleft due to their frenzied state. A shrine was erected at the site, where people began worshiping in the late Bronze Age, by 1600 BC. After the deaths of a number of men, the villagers chose a single young woman as the liaison for the divine inspirations. Eventually she spoke on behalf of gods.|$|E
60|$|When La Hire entered, one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the {{surprise}} {{in his face}} at Joan's beauty and extreme youth, <b>and</b> one <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> too, by Joan's glad smile, that it made her happy to get sight of this hero of her childhood at last. La Hire bowed low, with his helmet in his gauntleted hand, and made a bluff but handsome little speech with hardly an oath in it, <b>and</b> one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that those two took {{to each other on}} the spot.|$|R

500|$|About the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: [...] "It took such a {{long time}} to film the 'Mama' video, but it was nice that our mums were there <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what we're doing. It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} day and I said to my mum: 'Ha! Now you know how I feel every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E
500|$|Also that month, Cosmopolitan {{published}} {{the first interview}} with Manning in prison, conducted by mail. Cosmo reported that Manning was optimistic about recent progress but said that not being allowed to grow her hair long was [...] "painful and awkward … I am torn up. I get through each day okay, but at night, when I'm alone in my room, I finally burn out and crash." [...] Manning said it was [...] "very much a relief" [...] to announce {{that she is a}} woman and did not fear the public response. [...] "Honestly, I'm not terribly worried about what people out there might think of me. I just try to be myself." [...] According to Cosmo, Manning had her own cell with [...] "two tall vertical windows that face the sun", <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> [...] "trees and hills and blue sky and all the things beyond the buildings and razor wire". Manning denied being harassed by other inmates and claimed some had become confidantes.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} tour took visitors {{only on a}} small circular {{stretch of}} the Underground City. Inside the complex, visitors could see signposts to major landmarks accessible by the tunnels, such as Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> chambers labeled with their original functions, such as cinemas, hospitals, or arsenals. A portrait of Mao Zedong could be seen amidst murals of locals volunteering to dig the tunnels and fading slogans such as [...] "Accumulate Grain", and [...] "For the People: Prepare for War, Prepare for Famine". [...] Rooms with bunk beds and decayed cardboard boxes of water purifiers {{could be seen in}} areas not open to tourists. Visitors on the official tour would also pass by a functioning silk factory in one of the underground staff meeting rooms of the complex, and be given a demonstration of the process of obtaining silk from silkworm cocoons. [...] They had a chance to buy souvenirs at a tourists' shop operated by the state-owned Qianmen Arts and Crafts Center and the China Kai Tian Silk Company.|$|E
