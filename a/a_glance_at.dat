5|$|It is {{also said}} that on the {{southern}} side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.|$|E
5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E

25|$|Ursa Minor is not {{the only}} {{constellation}} that does not look very much like what it represents; very few do. This has led to nicknames for some of the constellations. These nicknames are another variety of asterism. <b>A</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the stick-figures shown in the charts under the constellation names will easily explain the origin of these asterisms.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems that}} overall sales volumes {{were from the}} start lower than Panhard had {{anticipated}} for the car, which {{may have contributed to}} arguments against progressing development of the four-door version that had been envisaged. Although mid-size two-door saloons sold in reasonable numbers in Germany and the Alpine countries, <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the sales data suggests that in the French market four doors were a precondition for healthy sales volumes.|$|E
25|$|In the {{examples}} {{seen so far}} the same metre is used for several lines at a time; but <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> Moore’s database shows that iambic and trochaic lines are often mixed together, as in the passage below from Terence’s Phormio (485-492), which Moore discusses in an article.

500|$|John Buckley {{attributed}} the hyperbole about Wittmann to the lingering {{influence of the}} German propaganda campaign and criticised D'Este and Meyer for exaggerating his role and implying that he single-handedly stopped the 7th Armoured Division. Buckley wrote that Russell A Hart's claim that Wittmann [...] "all but annihilated" [...] the 7th Armoured Division spearhead was wrong and that [...] "the complete German propaganda treatment" [...] was available from Gary Simpson. Badsey called Wittmann's attack and the attention it has received, [...] "remarkable but massively over-written". In 2013, Buckley wrote that unquestioning regurgitation of Nazi propaganda by writers and historians was inexcusably casual, when <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the facts showed that {{the defeat of the}} 7th Armoured Division by one Tiger crew led by Wittmann was a myth. Wittmann made a bold attack, which helped to stop the advance of the 4th CLY but did not make a solo effort; the action at Point 213 was led by Rolf Möbius.|$|E
500|$|Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine {{was more}} {{critical}} in his review, though {{he gave it}} a 2.5star (out of 4) rating. While he positively called Gaga's performances outrageous and [...] "occasionally fierce", he questioned Gaga's authenticity, both on stage and in the pre-concert scenes. Ultimately, he wrote, [...] "Unsurprisingly, HBO's Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden raises more questions about Stefani Germanotta (Gaga's birth name) than it answers, which is probably as it should be." [...] Radio host Howard Stern also compared the black-and-white scenes of the special to Madonna: Truth or Dare, adding that when he darts <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> Lady Gaga, she is occasionally registered in his brain as Madonna. On his show, Stern was also critical of inappropriateness and unreasonability of the numerous speeches Gaga gave between the songs in the special, calling them [...] "", [...] "drivel", and [...] "condescending". Dedicating over {{half an hour of}} his show on May 9 and 10, 2011, to express his criticism of the concert, Stern compared the manner of Gaga's speaking to professional wrestling due to echoing, Gaga's gasping between the words, and the audience's arguable inability to hear the words enough to understand them. In particular, Gaga claimed in the concert that her incentive to work is to [...] "set [...] free", not money. Stern attempted to debunk that claim by arguing that Gaga takes potentially psychiatric problems of her audience lightly by urging her fans to [...] "forget all of [...] insecurities" [...] overnight.|$|E

[...] He has served up England's most [...] "attractive and praise-worthy" [...] characters of the previous century, overflowing with [...] "simplicity, honesty, modesty, hospitality, and good-nature." [...] This compliments his hosts' [...] "national and Tory prejudices; and coupled with literal or exaggerated portraits of Yankee peculiarities, could hardly fail to please." ...|$|E
