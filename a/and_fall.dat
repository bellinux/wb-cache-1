30|$|We devised 26 non-fall <b>and</b> 15 <b>fall</b> {{scenarios}}, {{where some}} fall scenarios have several variants (e.g., fall backward or forward). The test subjects were not instructed {{on how to}} perform the <b>falls</b> exactly <b>and</b> were told to just fall as they think they would in a real-life situation. Scenarios included most of the common ways a person can fall: tripping or stumbling, slipping, fainting (no hands), collapse (drop attack), arising from a bed <b>and</b> <b>falling,</b> arising from a chair <b>and</b> <b>falling</b> (including grabbing a table or chair to try <b>and</b> prevent the <b>fall),</b> missing the bed <b>and</b> <b>falling</b> on the ground, {{sitting on the edge}} of a chair <b>and</b> <b>falling</b> down, hitting a closet <b>and</b> <b>falling,</b> rolling out of bed, walking and losing balance, dizziness, <b>and</b> <b>falling</b> when picking up something. Due to safety reasons, we did not record more dangerous scenarios, such as falling down the stairs.|$|R

40|$|Slips <b>and</b> <b>falls</b> are a {{major cause}} of serious injury, {{disability}} and death at work. This research focus on slips <b>and</b> <b>falls</b> events due to contamination factors on different ramp angles among workers because employees are exposed to such danger at the workplace. The goals of this study were to identify; the main factors that cause slips <b>and</b> <b>falls</b> on inclined surfaces, the effects of contaminants on gait, and walking speed downhill before the slips occur. Three different contaminants variaty in viscosity (water, suds and oil), three ramp angels (3 ?, 7 ? and 14 ?) and two shoe types (Saftey boot and Sneaker) were used during the trials. In addition, eight healthy male subjects (22 - 28 years) were asked to walk as naturally as possible throught testing. This project produced an outcome of the slip distance based on the interaction of the factors that causes the incident of slips <b>and</b> <b>falls.</b> As a resualt, slope and contaminant factors are known as the main elements that increase the risk of sliping <b>and</b> <b>falling</b> on ramps. Furthermore, the walking speed increase while the ramp angle will rise. Based on the result, suggestion and guideline can be produce to overcome the slips <b>and</b> <b>falls</b> instance...|$|R
