40|$|Abstract—Dynamic Programming (DP) {{problems}} arise {{in a wide}} range of application areas spanning from logistics to computational biology. In this paper, we show how to obtain high-performing parallel implementations for a class of DP problems by reducing them to highly optimizable flexible kernels through cache-oblivious recursive divide-and-conquer (CORDAC). We implement parallel CORDAC algorithms for four non-trivial DP problems, namely the parenthesization problem, Floyd-Warshall’s all-pairs shortest path (FW-APSP), sequence alignment with general gap penalty (gap problem) and protein <b>accordion</b> <b>folding.</b> To the best of our knowledge our algorithms for protein <b>accordion</b> <b>folding</b> and the gap problem are novel. All four algorithms have asymptotically optimal cache performance, and all but FW-APSP have asymptotically more parallelism than their looping counterparts. We show that the base cases of our CORDAC algorithms are predominantly matrix-multiplication-like (MM-like) flexi-ble kernels that expose many optimization opportunities not offered by traditional looping DP codes. As a result, one can obtain highly efficient DP implementations by optimizing those flexible kernels only. Our implementations achieve 5 − 150 × speedup over their standard loop based DP counterparts while consuming order-of-magnitude less energy on modern multicore machines with 16 − 32 cores. We also compare our implementations with parallel tiled codes generated by existing polyhedral compilers: Polly, PoCC and PLuTo, and show that our implementations run significantly faster. Finally, we present results on manycores (Intel Xeon Phi) and clusters of multicores obtained using simple extensions for SIMD and shared-distributed-shared-memory architectures, respectively, demonstrating the versatility of our approach. Our optimiza-tion approach is highly systematic and suitable for automation.

40|$|AbstractThe Mesoproterozoic Wumishan Formation, {{composed}} of dolomite {{is a widely}} distributed stratigraphic unit in the Beijing area. It was formed {{over a long period}} of time in the Yan-Liao aulacogen, a stable peritidal environment that was ideal for recording earthquakes in the form of soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDS). Numerous examples occur in the upper part of the Wumishan Formation, along the Yongding River Valley. In addition, brittle structures include intrastratal fault and seismically cracked breccias. The soft-sediment deformation structures include liquefied features (diapirs, clastic dykes, convolute bedding), compressional deformation features (<b>accordion</b> <b>folds,</b> plate-spine breccias, mound-and-sag structures), and extensional plastic features (loop-bedding). Based on the regional geological setting and previous research, movements along the main axial fault of the Yan-Liao aulacogen are considered as the triggers for earthquakes since the Early Mesoproterozoic. The number and distribution of the SSDS suggest the major earthquake frequency in the Wumishan Formation of 20 to 32 thousand years...|$|R

The visual and narrative systems at play in Mundus Subterraneus layer a history of book production, science, science fiction, myth, and cosmology.
