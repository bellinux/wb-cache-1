40|$|Abstract — Lossy coding of speech, {{high-quality}} <b>audio,</b> <b>still</b> images, and <b>video</b> is commonplace today. However, in 1948, few {{lossy compression}} systems were in service. Shannon introduced and developed {{the theory of}} source coding with a fidelity criterion, also called rate-distortion theory. For the first 25 years of its existence, rate-distortion theory had relatively little impact on the methods and systems actually used to compress real sources. Today, however, rate-distortion theoretic concepts are an im-portant component of many lossy compression techniques and standards. We chronicle the development of rate-distortion theory and {{provide an overview of}} its influence on the practice of lossy source coding.

40|$|Video {{information}} retrieval requires {{a system to}} find information relevant to a query which may be represented simultaneously in di#erent ways through a text description, <b>audio,</b> <b>still</b> images and/or <b>video</b> sequences. We present a novel approach that uses pseudo-relevance feedback from retrieved items that are NOT similar to the query items without further inquiring user feedback. We provide insight into this approach using a statistical model and suggest a score combination scheme via posterior probability estimation. An evaluation on the 2002 TREC Video Track queries shows that this technique can improve video retrieval performance on a real collection. We believe that negative pseudo-relevance feedback shows great promise for very difficult multimedia retrieval tasks, especially when combined with other di#erent retrieval algorithms...|$|R

Along this vein, free platforms have been seen to allow budding enthusiasts to create multimedia content. For example, Google sites (Wee, 2012 b) offer creative opportunities in website development that enable text insertion, <b>still</b> image, <b>video</b> and animation embedding, along with audio and hyper-interactive links to simulations (Christian & Esquembre, 2012; Wee, 2013; Wee, Goh, & Chew, 2013; Wee, Goh, & Lim, 2013; Wee, Lee, Chew, Wong, & Tan, 2015). This chapter focuses on the video aspect of multimedia, which can be positioned as a component to any effective self-paced on-line lesson that would be available anytime, anywhere via computer or mobile devices.

Speech-Only Hypermedia Since the introduction of Hypercard for the Macintosh, the ideas behind hypertext systems have become commonplace.

In AAF these kinds of data are called metadata, which is defined as data about other data.

40|$|This paper gives a short {{introduction}} to digital watermarks {{and their use}} in copyright protection of <b>audio,</b> <b>video,</b> <b>still</b> images and similiar inexact data, but does not include discussion of specic algorithms. The specic uses covered are copyright assertion, usage control and content ngerprinting. Emphasis is given to invisible watermarking schemes, where it is not desirable for the original content to be perceivably altered {{in order to preserve}} its value. After consideration of the issue, one must conclude that while digital watermarking may prevent the casual pirate from copying the marked content, large-scale pirates cannot be stopped by them and even dedicated home pirates are not signicantly hampered except perhaps in the very short term. Additionally, the average home user may suer from these protection schemes by not being able to use the licensed content to the extent allowed by law (this, of course, varying from country to country). Copyright assertion and ngerprinting techniques are more eective, but, with current watermarking algorithms, mostly because they discourage potential attackers from attempting infringement by making it at least theoretically possible for them to be caught...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates novel {{applications of}} the wavelet transform in the analysis and compression of <b>audio,</b> <b>still</b> images, and <b>video.</b> Most recently, some surveys have been published on the restoration of noisy audio signals. Based on these, we have developed a wavelet-based denoising program for audio signals that allows flexible parameter settings. The multiscale property of the wavelet transform can successfully be exploited {{for the detection of}} semantic structures in images: A comparison of the coefficients allows the extraction of a predominant structure. This idea forms the basis of our semiautomatic edge detection algorithm. Empirical evaluations and the resulting recommendations follow. In the context of the teleteaching project Virtual University of the Upper Rhine Valley (VIROR), many lectures were transmitted between remote locations. We thus encountered the problem of scalability of a video stream for different access bandwidths in the Internet. A substantial contribution of this dissertation is the introduction of the wavelet transform into hierarchical video coding and the recommendation of parameter settings based on empirical surveys. Furthermore, a prototype implementation proves the principal feasibility of a wavelet-based, nearly arbitrarily scalable application. Mathematical transformations constitute a commonly underestimated problem for students in their first semesters of study. Motivated by the VIROR project, we spent a considerable amount of time and effort on the exploration of approaches to enhance mathematical topics with multimedia; both the technical design and the didactic integration into the curriculum are discussed. In a large field trial on "traditional teaching versus multimedia-enhanced teaching", the objective knowledge gained by the students was measured. This allows us to objectively rate positive the efficiency of our teaching modules...|$|R

40|$|Taking as its {{starting}} point the spatiotemporal rhythms of landscapes of hyper-mobility and transit, this paper explores {{how the process}} of “marooning” the self in a radically placeless (and depthless) space—in this instance a motorway traffic island on the M 53 in the northwest of England—can inform critical understandings and practices of “deep mapping”. Conceived of as an autoethnographic experiment—a performative expression of “islandness” as an embodied spatial praxis—the research on which this paper draws revisits ideas set out in JG Ballard’s 1974 novel Concrete Island, although, unlike Ballard’s island Crusoe (and sans person Friday), the author’s residency was restricted to one day and night. The fieldwork, which combines methods of “digital capture” (<b>audio</b> soundscapes, <b>video,</b> <b>stills</b> photography, and GPS tracking), {{takes the form of}} a rhythmanalytical mapping of territory that can unequivocally be defined as “negative space”. Offering an oblique engagement with debates on “non-places” and spaces of mobility, the paper examines the capacity of non-places/negative spaces to play host to the conditions whereby affects of place and dwelling can be harnessed and performatively transacted. The embodied rhythmicity of non-places is thus interrogated from the vantage point of a constitutive negation of the negation of place. In this vein, the paper offers a reflexive examination of the spatial anthropology of negative space...|$|R
