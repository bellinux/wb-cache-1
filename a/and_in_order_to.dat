5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act.

This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, European {{colonialism}} in Africa {{had reached}} its height. Having {{lost control of}} the vast territory of Brazil in South America, the Portuguese began to focus on expanding their African outposts. This brought them into direct conflict with the British. Since David Livingstone had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.|$|E

The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate.

Peter Smedley bought it from Rees-Mogg in 1977 or 1978 and carried out further restoration and converted it into a hotel. Notoriously he allowed the BBC to film his Dignitas assisted suicide. The house was sold again in 2001 to Von Essen Hotels.|$|E
