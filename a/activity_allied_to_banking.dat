Service users (n= 7) were involved in three focus groups; one just prior to a new garden facility opening, and then again at the six and twelve month points, which explored the personal impacts upon service users’ health and wellbeing. The garden was itself an upshot of participant involvement; service users were involved in all aspects of the garden design and maintenance, and also assisted with dissemination of the research goals and findings. Service users reported numerous personal health benefits {{as a result of their}} engagement with horticultural <b>activities,</b> <b>allied</b> <b>to</b> personal development enhancements in respect of gardening knowledge, employability skills, personal achievements and positive changes in behaviour towards self and others. Particularly, underlying these outputs, participants identified reduced stress, and a general “feel good” factor as key to their improved life-satisfaction. The mechanisms providing for these impacts included: interaction with a natural environment; enhanced intrinsic motivation derived from participation in a variety of tasks; and opportunities to develop specific horticultural skills.

Included in this niche segment is the high adrenalin, high-risk activity of rock climbing. There is currently limited research or academic literature investigating how rock climbing fits in to the adventure tourism continuum, both as a tourism product and as a recreational activity.

The second survey focused on active climbers and looked at the nature of the activity itself, as well as their economic expenditure on rock climbing. The paper concludes that there is real potential for rock climbing as an adventure tourism product from a socio-economic perspective. Results also indicate that the sport is viewed very differently amongst tourist and active climbers with regards to risk.

30|$|Chennai, {{formerly}} known as Madras, was formed in 1600 and is {{the capital city of}} Tamil Nadu state. The city is located at the southern east coast of India, bounded by the Bay of Bengal in the east. The region has persistent as well as eventful archaeological and colonial history. The City is drained by three major rivers, namely Adyar (to the south), Cooum (through the centre) and Kosasthalaiyar (to the north). The city faces a number of risks which include climate-related as well as human-induced reasons (Gupta and Nair 2010). Chennai receives an average approximately 1300  mm of rainfall per year, but the majority of this (~[*] 800  mm) falls during the north-east (NE) monsoon months (October–December). The population of the city was 777, 481 (1941 Census of India) before the independence of the country, which drastically increased thereafter to a current population of 10.16 million in 2016 (UNDESA 2016). This number is projected to continue increasing to 13.29 million in 2030. The rise in population leads to intensive developmental activities and land-use changes. The region has plain terrain, thus lacking a natural gradient for free run-off. In order to wade off a potential flood, the city requires natural buffering mechanisms such as wetlands, marshes and open lakes. These buffering factors are significantly affected by the construction and developmental <b>activities</b> <b>allied</b> <b>to</b> the city growth as well as encroachments. For example, the alarming decreases {{in the area of the}} Pallikaranai marshland from 5000  ha in 1970 to 988  ha in 2008 (Stephen 2016). Recent devastation by the flood waters in the region was wrought mainly by the shrinkage of wetlands and marshes. Major impacts of flooding on the booming IT industry in the region and sustainability of housing sector can be expected in the years to come (Suriya et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} impact of {{physical}} fitness and physical activity on the threat of older adults without cognitive impairment becoming institutionalized. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 195 non-institutionalized (80. 1 ± 4. 4 yrs) and 186 institutionalized (83. 8 ± 5. 2 yrs) participants. Cognitive impairment was assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination, measures of physical fitness were determined by the Senior Fitness Test, and physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results: Multivariate binary logistic analysis selected 4 main determinants of institutionalization in both genders: the likelihood of becoming institutionalized increased by + 18. 6 % for each additional year of age, while it decreased by - 24. 8 % by each fewer kg/m 2 in BMI, by - 0. 9 % for each additional meter performed in the aerobic endurance test and by - 2. 0 % for each additional 100 MET-min/wk of physical activity expenditure (p< 0. 05). Values ≤ 50 th percentile (age ≥ 81 yrs, BMI ≥ 26. 7 kg/m 2, aerobic endurance 367. 6 m, and physical activity 693 MET-min/wk) were computed using Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis as cut-offs discriminating institutionalized from non-institutionalized older adults. Conclusions: The performance of physical <b>activity,</b> <b>allied</b> <b>to</b> an improvement in physical fitness (mainly BMI and aerobic endurance), may avoid the threat of institutionalization of older adults without cognitive impairment {{only if they are}} above the 50 th percentile; the following is highly recommend: expending ≥ 693 MET-min/wk on physical activity, being ≤ 26. 7 kg/m 2 on BMI, and being able to walk ≥ 367. 6 m in the aerobic endurance test, especially above the age of 80 years.

40|$|Introduction Institutionalization in {{a nursing}} home restricts autonomy, most notably free will, free choice, and free action. Decreased {{physical}} activity and fitness are predictive of disability and dependence (Rikli & Jones, 2013; Tak, Kuiper, Chorus, & Hopman-Rock, 2014); however {{little is known about the}} impact of these factors on institutionalization. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the impact of physical activity and fitness and on the risk of elderly people without cognitive impairment become institutionalized. Methods This cross-sectional study involved 195 non-institutionalized (80. 1  4. 4 yrs) and 186 institutionalized (83. 8  5. 2 yrs) participants. Cognitive impairment was assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination, physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and measures of physical fitness were determined by the Senior Fitness Test. Results: Multivariate binary logistic analysis selected 4 main predictors of institutionalization in both genders. The likelihood of becoming institutionalized increased by + 18. 6 % for each additional year of age, while it decreased by - 24. 8 % by each fewer kg/m 2 in BMI, by - 0. 9 % for each additional meter performed in the aerobic endurance test and by - 2. 0 % for each additional 100 MET-min/wk of physical activity expenditure (p< 0. 05). Values ≤ 50 th percentile (age ≥ 81 yrs, BMI≥ 26. 7 kg/m 2, aerobic endurance ≤ 367. 6 m, and physical activity ≤ 693 MET-min/wk) were computed using Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis as cut-offs discriminating institutionalized from non-institutionalized elderly people. Conclusion The performance of physical <b>activity,</b> <b>allied</b> <b>to</b> an improvement in physical fitness (mainly BMI and aerobic endurance) may prevent the institutionalization of elderly people without cognitive impairment only if they are above the 50 th percentile; the following is highly recommend: expending ≥ 693 MET-min/wk on physical activity, being ≤ 26. 7 kg/m 2 on BMI, and being able to walk ≥ 367. 6 m in the aerobic endurance test, especially above the age of 80 years.

40|$|The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) has {{recently}} been introduced as a new therapeutic target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). In a recent case report it was demonstrated that alpha frequency oscillations appear in PPN after the administration of levodopa in PD, indicating a possible physiological role of these oscillations. Here we confirm this result and investigate the functional connectivity and reactivity of subcortical alpha activity by recording LFP activity from the PPN area and EEG in six patients with PD while at rest and in four of them while they performed ipsi- and contralateral self-paced joystick movements. Levodopa strongly promoted 7 - 11 Hz oscillatory synchronization {{in the region of}} PPN and coupling of this activity with similar activity in the cortical EEG. Such coupling was bidirectional. Moreover, the 7 - 11 Hz oscillatory synchronization in the PPN area increased about 3 s prior to self-paced movements, but only following levodopa treatment. These findings suggest that alpha oscillations in the PPN area may represent a physiological pattern of activity. The subcortical oscillations are coupled to cortical alpha <b>activity</b> and possibly <b>allied</b> <b>to</b> motor related attentional processes...|$|R
