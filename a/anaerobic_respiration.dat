Dysbiosis of bacteria {{has been proposed}} to initiate UC but to date neither the nature of dysbiosis nor mucosal breakdown has been explained. Method: To assess whether a dysbiosis of <b>anaerobic</b> nitrate <b>respiration</b> could explain the microscopic, biochemical and functional changes observed in colonocytes of ulcerative colitis by measuring the effect of NO on human colonocytes and observing colonic NO production. Results: <b>Anaerobic</b> nitrate <b>respiration</b> yields nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide. Colonic bacteria produce NO and UC in remission has a higher luminal NO level than control cases. NO with sulphide but not NO alone impairs lipid and protein synthesis of epithelial cells explaining the membrane, tight junctional, ion channel and beta oxidation changes observed in colonocytes of UC. The observations complement therapeutic mechanisms of those probiotics, prebiotics and antibiotics useful in treating UC.

Shewanella putrefaciens strain CN 32 was examined for its growth with O 2, nitrate, ferrihydrite, ferric citrate, and sulfite as electron acceptors. The same parameters were also measured for Desulfovibrio desulfuricans strain G- 20, Geobacter metallireducens strain GS- 15, Thioploca spp., two strains of magnetotactic bacteria (Magneteospirilum magnetotactium marine vibrioid strain MV- 1 and M. sp. strain AMB- 1), and environmental sediments. Microorganisms with aerobic respiratory of oxygen (MV- 1 and AMB- 1) have high ratios of monounsaturated to saturated straight chain PLFA and ubiquinone to menaquinone ratios; while those that conduct strict <b>anaerobic</b> <b>respirations</b> (G- 20 with sulfate and GS- 15 with ferric iron) have low ratios of monounsaturated to saturated straight chain PLFA and uniquinone to menaquinone ratios. The facultative respiratory of nitrate (Thioploca) has these parameters in the middle. The ratios of menaquinones to ubiquinones in CN 32 cells systematically increase according to the increase of redox potential and bioavalibility of electron acceptors.

40|$|Respiratory {{versatility}} and psychrophily are {{the hallmarks}} of Shewanella. The ability to utilize {{a wide range of}} electron acceptors for respiration is due to the large number of c-type cytochrome genes present in the genome of Shewanella strains. More recently the dissimilatory metal reduction of Shewanella species has been extensively and intensively studied for potential applications in the bioremediation of radioactive wastes of groundwater and subsurface environments. Multiple Shewanella genome sequences are now available in the public databases (Fredrickson et al., 2008). Most of the sequenced Shewanella strains were isolated from marine environments and this genus was believed to be of marine origin (Hau and Gralnick, 2007). However, the well-characterized model strain, S. oneidensis MR- 1, was isolated from the freshwater lake sediment of Lake Oneida, New York (Myers and Nealson, 1988) and similar bacteria have also been isolated from other freshwater environments (Venkateswaran et al., 1999).

Under anaerobic conditions, ferric iron respiration with the electron donors formate and elemental sulfur could energize glycine uptake.

Pyrosequencing of SSU rRNA genes of all domains of life confirmed that ICNO 3 storage was most likely due to diatoms rather than other known nitrate-storing microorganisms (i. e., large sulfur bacteria and the eukaryotic foraminifers and gromiids). Sedimentary ICNO 3 concentrations reached up to 22. 3 µmol dm- 3 at the sediment surface and decreased with sediment depth to negligible concentrations below 5 cm. Similarly, the ICNO 3 /fucoxanthin ratio and porewater nitrate (PWNO 3) concentrations decreased with sediment depth, suggesting that ICNO 3 of diatoms is in equilibrium with PWNO 3, but is enriched relative to PWNO 3 by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude. Cell-volume-specific ICNO 3 concentrations in a diatom mat covering the sediment surface during spring were estimated at 9. 3 - 46. 7 mmol L- 1.

40|$|Acetate is a {{critical}} compound in the soil carbon cycle, {{as it is a}} terminal product of complex organic matter fermentation under anaerobic conditions and is a major substrate for aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>respirations.</b> Our goal was to use modern molecular methods to identify microbes involved in soil acetate turnover under different oxygen tensions/soil saturation conditions. We showed that incubation of several soils (two from the Imperial Valley, California, and one from a Korean rice paddy) with water alone caused significant shifts in microbial community composition, but that the addition of acetate caused further detectable shifts. We developed a method, known as stable isotope probing (SIP), which allowed us to directly link the ability to utilize acetate as a carbon source to the identity of the organism. Applying this technique to soils in microcosm incubation experiments showed that the acetate-utilizing community is a subset of the greater overall community and that, under anaerobic conditions, iron (III) - and sulfate-reducing bacteria simultaneously utilize acetate, a finding that contradicts predictions based on bulk chemistry studies. We are currently pursuing the dynamics of acetate utilization, i. e., whether the acetate-utilizing community changes over incubation time and changes in O 2 tension. Over the longer term, these studies promise to provide insight into soil carbon loss and transformation under anaerobic conditions, methane production in water-logged soils, quantification of impacts of anthropogenic inputs of water on transformations and transport of carbon in soils, and the overall soil carbon cycle...|$|R

AIM: To assess whether a dysbiosis of <b>anaerobic</b> nitrate <b>respiration</b> could explain the microscopic, biochemical and functional changes observed in colonocytes of UC. METHODS: Published results in the gastroenterological, biochemical and microbiological literature were reviewed concerning colonocytes, nitrate respiration and nitric oxide in the colon in health and UC. A best-fit explanation of results was made regarding the pathogenesis and new treatments of UC. RESULTS: <b>Anaerobic</b> nitrate <b>respiration</b> yields nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide. Colonic bacteria produce NO and UC in remission has a higher lumenal NO level than control cases. NO with sulphide, but not NO alone, impairs beta-oxidation, lipid and protein synthesis explaining the membrane, tight junctional and ion channel changes observed in colonocytes of UC. The observations complement therapeutic mechanisms of those probiotics, prebiotics and antibiotics useful in treating UC. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged production of bacterial NO with sulphide can explain the initiation and barrier breakdown, which is central to the pathogenesis of UC. Therapies to alter bacterial nitrate respiration and NO production need to evolve.

Respiratory electron transport of P. denitrificans appeared to be strongly inhibited by Cu(DMP) 2 NO 3 and to a somewhat lesser extent by CuSO 4.

Microbial diversity in the rocks was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing (Expedition 304), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing, and functional gene microarray analysis (Expedition 305). The gabbroic microbial community was relatively depauperate, consisting of a low diversity of proteobacterial lineages closely related to Bacteria from hydrocarbon-dominated environments and to known hydrocarbon degraders, and there was little evidence of Archaea. Functional gene diversity in the gabbroic samples was analyzed with a microarray for metabolic genes ("GeoChip"), producing further evidence of genomic potential for hydrocarbon degradation [...] genes for aerobic methane and toluene oxidation. Genes coding for <b>anaerobic</b> <b>respirations,</b> such as nitrate reduction, sulfate reduction, and metal reduction, as well as genes for carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, and ammonium-oxidation, were also present.

This rare glimpse of the gabbroic ecosystem provides further support for the recent finding of hydrocarbons in deep ocean gabbro from Hole 1309 D.
