40|$|AbstractThe {{ultimate}} goal of weapon system employing an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) is to defeat a target at the longest standoff. In order to do this, an EFP must be aerodynamically stable so as to strike the target at a small angle of obliquity, and the decay velocity per meter of EFP must be smaller at extended standoff. As the angle of attack increases, the penetration ability of EFP greatly reduces. The fins improve the EFP aeroballistic characteristics and decrease the flight drag of EFP as well. EFP with fins formed by three-point initiation is presented. The formation of EFP with fins is studied by LS-DYNA, and the <b>aeroballistics</b> is studied through experiment. The experimental {{results show that the}} decay velocity per meter of EFP with fins is much smaller than that of normal EFP, and the attitude angle steadily decreases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{ballistic}} range {{has long}} been employed {{in a variety of}} engineering fields such as high-velocity impact engineering, projectile aerodynamics, and <b>aeroballistics,</b> since it can create an extremely high-pressure state in a very short time. Of many different types of ballistic ranges developed to date, a two-stage light-gas gun is being employed most extensively. Since the oper-ation of the ballistic range involves many complicated gas dynamic processes, optimization of various design parameters of the ballistic range is important for the durability of its components. In the present study, a theoretical analysis has been carried out to investigate various unsteady processes involved in the operation of the ballistic range and to assess the performance of the ballistic range. The results obtained are validated with the available experimental data. A shock tube is added in between the pump tube and launch tube and its effect on the performance of the ballistic range is quantified using the present theoretical analysis. Several methods are employed to define the ballistic efficiency. The effect of ratio of pump tube area to launch tube area on the performance is also investigated. A significant performance enhancement is obtained in the ballistic range {{with the addition of a}} shock tube...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{phenomenon}} of flutter and tumble {{of objects in}} free fall has been studied using two-dimensional numerical simulations of uniform flow past a plate which is free to rotate about a fixed axis through its centroid. Particular {{focus is on the}} effect of Reynolds number and plate thickness-to-length ratio on the flutter-to-tumble transition and on the observed frequency of the angular motions. Simulations indicate that the tendency to tumble increases with increasing Reynolds number and decreasing thickness ratio. A case is also made that the tumbling frequency for two-dimensional plates is governed by a Kar-man type vortex shedding process. These results for this pinned plate have also been verified by simulating a limited number of free-fall cases. The motion of objects falling in a fluid has been of interest to physicists since at least the time when Maxwell first examined the motion of falling paper in 1854 [1]. The phenomenon exhibits rich physics with a number of regimes of motion including periodic or chaotic side-to-side motion (“flutter”) and end-over-end rota-tion (“tumble”). The motion of falling objects is also of direct relevance in areas as diverse as the functional morphology of plants and animals [2], meteorology and <b>aeroballistics</b> [10]. Recently there has been a surge of interest in this problem [4]–[7], and resulting studies have greatly increased our understanding of this phenomenon.

From the telemetered sensor data, ARDEC and ATK were able to quantify and update the projectile aerodynamics via the ARDEC <b>Aeroballistics</b> Division’s six degree of freedom simulation, TELA.

In addition, biases and scale factors can be extracted {{in order to determine the}} effects of the gun launch on the sensors. These biases and scale factors can then be introduced into the projectile guidance and navigation systems for modeling the errors from the sensors. In the trajectory reconstruction effort, meteorological data such as wind magnitude, wind direction, atmospheric pressure and temperature as a function of altitude, wind tunnel aerodynamics, projectile mass properties, gun launch initial conditions, firing test data and test time, sun azimuth and elevation and the gun longitude and latitude were all incorporated into the six degree of freedom simulation to insure that the match would simulate the most accurate conditions at the time of the test firings.

40|$|On the {{occasion}} of the Distinguished Scientist Award presentation at HVIS 1992, the technical and scientific promotion of the Impact Physics Division at EMI in the field of <b>aeroballistics,</b> free flight dynamics, terminal ballistics and impact physics is described. This development is closely related to the work of the recipients. The activities began in the late fifties when a small pressurized ballistic range with a gas gun was built. The problems to construct a well working facility with observation stations are reported that arose, at those early times, from the lack of experience, money and suitable locations. In the mid-sixties, the experimental possibilities were extended by building a two-stage light gas gun that could also be used as a gun tunnel. These facilities have been the foundation for research in the field of free flight aerodynamics, such as the study of near and far wakes behind a blunt hypersonic body or the study of shock wave boundary layer interactions. In 1972, th e division took the first step into terminal ballistics and, because of increasing interest, impact physics became the main research area. The division grew and with it the instrumentation. Today, diverse gas guns, powder guns and two-stage light gas guns are in operation. One topic of main interest during the years has been the penetration of rod shaped projectiles. Here the best-known result may be mentioned, the so-called 'Hohler-Stilp S-shaped penetration curves`. In addition to this, many other topics have been investigated that can be summarized under the title "penetration mechanics and impact physics". Based on a well developed launching technique and instrumentation, problems were investigated at low velocities of a few hundred m/s, at ordnance velocities and especially at hypervelocities up to 10 km/s. It has been recognized that dynamic material behavior and microstructural effects {{play an important role in}} understanding the interaction of projectiles with targets. Therefore, a VISAR, an electronic raster microscope, a Hopkinson bar and further equipment have been installed. Basing on the work of a period of more than 20 years, EMI has come into contact with national and foreign institutions and has become a partner for many cooperations...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the results of the {{research}} on the influence of aerodynamic coefficient values on the trajectory elements and the stability parameters of classic axisymmetric projectiles. It presents the characteristic functions of aerodynamic coefficients with regard to aerodynamic parameters and the projectile body shape. The trajectory elements of the model of classic axisymmetric projectiles and the analyses of their changes were presented with respect to the aerodynamic coefficient values. Introduction Classic axisymmetric projectiles fly through atmosphere using muzzle velocity as initial energy resource, so the aerodynamic force and moment have the most significant influence on the motion of projectiles. The aerodynamic force and moment components represented as aerodynamic coefficients depend on motion velocity i. e. flow velocity, the flow features produced by projectile shape and position in the flow, and angular velocity (rate) of the body. The functional dependence of aerodynamic coefficients on certain influential parameters, such as angle of attack and angular velocity components is expressed by the derivative of aerodynamic coefficients. The determination of aerodynamic coefficients and derivatives enables complete definition of the aerodynamic force and moment acting on the classic projectile. The projectile motion problem is considered in relation to defining the projectile stability parameters and the conditions under which the stability occurs. The comparative analyses of aerodynamic coefficient values obtained by numerical methods, semi empirical calculations and experimental research give preliminary evaluation {{of the quality of the}} determined values. The flight simulation of the motion of a classic axisymetric projectile, which has the shape defined by the aerodynamic coefficient values, enables the comparative analyses of the trajectory elements and stability characteristics. The model of the classic projectile flight The velocity of the projectile flight in relation to the Earth represents the relative velocity, and the time derivatives of the velocity projections to coordinate frame axis represent the relative acceleration components. The mass of classic axisymetric projectile is constant during the flight, because there is no mass change caused by the rocket engine. The values of components of aerodynamic force and moment depend on the angle of attack being the basic parameter. The projections of the total aerodynamic force, because of the nature of its effect on the projectile, are given in an <b>aeroballistics</b> coordinate frame with the coordinate origin positioned in the center of gravity. The determination of aerodynamic coefficients with respect to projectile construction, i. e. the projectile geometry, is based on the theoretical approach of fluid mechanic equation and it leads to numerical solving of the partial differential equation system with the given boundary conditions and experimental results of tunnel research, i. e. measured flight parameters. In this part of the article, the aim is to describe the functions of dependence of aerodynamic coefficients on given parameters. Flight simulation of the classic projectile The determination of aerodynamic coefficients, i. e. the determination of the motion trajectory elements and stability parameters according to the model of six degrees of freedom, is done on the classic 40 mm axisymmetric projectile model, the shape of which is based on the geometric characteristics of the front ogive part and the back cone with the flat bottom. The equations of the model of six degrees of freedom are given in the <b>aeroballistics</b> coordinate frame. The initial data in the simulation are given for the values of aerodynamic coefficients and derivatives obtained by the calculations and experiments. The analysis of the change of trajectory elements and stability characteristics is done with respect to two given kinds of aerodynamic characteristics. The analysis of the trajectory element change and stability characteristics is also done in relation to the possible discrepancy of the values of aerodynamic coefficients and derivatives. The possible discrepancies are given in accordance with the analysis of the values of aerodynamic coefficients obtained by the calculation and experiment. The influence of aerodynamic coefficients on the classic projectile motion analysis The individual analysis of the influence of aerodynamic coefficients on the motion trajectory key elements and stability characteristics is done. The influence of axial aerodynamic coefficients, normal and side force derivatives, as well as the influence of the pitching, yawing and rolling moment derivatives, is considered. The most important influences of each of the components of aerodynamic coefficients are given and the values of the trajectory elements discrepancies are determined - of range, velocity, angular velocity, derivation, angle of attack and angle of yawing, i. e. stability characteristics - of dynamic and gyroscope stability factors and stability equation coefficients. Conclusion The need for a proper description of aerodynamic coefficients, in physical and mathematical sense, is a precondition of their adequate and reliable calculation. The highest values of aerodynamic coefficients, according to the calculation result analysis, are those of axial force coefficients, normal force and pitching moment, which means that they have the greatest influence on the overall aerodynamic resistance during the projectile motion. The influences of other aerodynamic coefficients are quantitatively lesser, but not insignificant, because they influence directly on the motion stability parameters. The character of the position change of the point of attack is almost the same according to experimental and calculation results. The trajectory elements of the model projectile for aerodynamic coefficients determined by calculation and experiment show considerable compliance in the flight simulation in a computer program with six degrees of freedom in a wide range of initial angles. The difference in values of calculation and experimental values of aerodynamic coefficients demonstrated the difference in the values of the obtained trajectory elements, and particularly in stability parameters. Dynamic derivatives of aerodynamic coefficients (stability derivatives) have great influence on stability motion parameters. Experimental measurement of derivatives of aerodynamic coefficients is very complex and expensive because it entails the use of gauges for each of the derivatives. The importance of improvement of existing calculations and the development of new numerical solutions is evident in the reduction of the experimental research expenses...|$|E
