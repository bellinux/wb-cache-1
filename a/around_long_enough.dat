500|$|Radcliffe is a {{supporter}} of the Labour Party. Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election Radcliffe endorsed Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to the Labour Party, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He told The Big Issue: [...] "...I feel like this show of sincerity by a man who has been <b>around</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> and stuck to his beliefs long enough that he knows them and doesn't have to be scripted is what is making people sit up and get excited. It is great." ...|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable aspect of Johnson's game was his {{blocking}} abilities, for which he received heavy praise. He took pride in it, saying [...] "It {{gave me a chance}} to hit all those people who hit me all the time." [...] Quarterback Bobby Layne, a teammate of Johnson with both the Lions and Steelers, listed Johnson as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. [...] "By 'mean,' I mean vicious, unmanageable, consistently tough," [...] said Layne. [...] "I don't mean dirty." [...] Layne also called Johnson his [...] "bodyguard," [...] saying [...] "Half the good runners will get a passer killed if you keep them <b>around</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough.</b> But a quarterback hits the jackpot when he gets a combination runner-blocker like Johnson." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Distant Worlds II {{concert in}} Stockholm, the {{additional}} pieces performed {{were added to}} the setlist, and for every concert afterward different songs out of that rotation have been chosen for each performance. [...] "Kiss Me Goodbye" [...] from Final Fantasy XII was played at the June 18, 2010 Detroit show, though it was not officially added to the general setlist. It was played again at the April 1, 2011 concert in New York City, which featured an expanded setlist over two concerts. In April 2011 Square Enix announced that the concert series was expected to run for at least three more years. Uematsu has said that he prefers for the tour to add arrangements of older pieces from the series, as he feels that they are what fans are more interested in; he and Roth intend to continue to add more arrangements to the setlist. He was hesitant for pieces from Final Fantasy XIII and XIV to be added, as he did not feel that they had been <b>around</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to build a strong following like the older songs.|$|E

5000|$|After his {{dismissal}} as {{the commander}} of the Berlin Defense Area, Reymann was given a weak division near Potsdam. The division received a dubious designation [...] "Army Group Spree". Reymann's unit was unable at that time to link-up with General Walther Wenck unit just south of Potsdam due to strong Soviet Red Army forces. Thereafter on 28/29 April, Wenck's 12th Army was able to hold open the area <b>around</b> Beelitz <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> for about 20,000 of Reymann's men to escape through the narrow route to the Elbe.|$|R

500|$|On January 22, 2011, Spears tweeted {{from the}} video shoot, {{saying it was}} [...] "an {{incredible}} experience" [...] and would [...] "be {{one of the best}} videos I have ever done." [...] On February 2, 2011, accusations came from TMZ.com that Åkerlund had decided to use a dance double for Spears when it seemed like she had not rehearsed her moves enough. Both her representatives and the director denied the rumors, and Åkerlund commenting, [...] " [...] been great throughout the entire process. [...] I've been <b>around</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to know when an artist gives it their all, and to me it doesn't get better than this. This video is gonna be fucking awesome! It's all Britney." [...] Her manager Larry Rudolph later confirmed that a body double was actually used, but only for the scenes in which Spears fights herself. The fight scene was choreographed by Steven Ho. He commented that Spears incorporated the moves learned during rehearsals, but also incorporated [...] "her own flavor", by adding a small shuffle of steps in her heels. The length of the dresses also presented a problem, and there were discussions about shortening the trains for safety issues. They were later added as 'weapons', as Ho explained, [...] "as if they were sharp blades, giving Britney reason to jump and evade around them." ...|$|E

[...] He also attempted to verify the water catastrophe by analyzing records of various cultural backgrounds. [...] Though he found many accounts of the water catastrophe unclear, he did believe that such an event occurred at the brink of human history nonetheless.|$|E

50|$|After being {{released}} by the Phillies, Carlton joined the San Francisco Giants; he also broke his self-imposed boycott of the media, giving a press conference after signing with the team. Unfortunately, Carlton mostly pitched ineffectively — except for seven shutout innings {{in a game against}} the Pittsburgh Pirates, in which he also hit a 3-run homer, for his only win as a Giant. Overall, he went 1-3 with a 5.10 ERA in six games for the Giants, hanging <b>around</b> just <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to collect his 4,000th strikeout (against Eric Davis), before announcing his retirement.|$|R
50|$|A single dance runs <b>around</b> ten minutes, <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to {{progress}} 15-20 times. If the sets are {{short to medium}} length the caller will often try to run the dance until each couple has danced with every other couple both as a 1 and a 2 and returned to where they started. With longer sets (more than ~40 people) this would require <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> sets that the caller will usually only run the dance {{all the way around}} on (rare) non equal-turn dances.|$|R

Since there was no runway <b>around</b> Tokyo <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to land a B-29, the crew picked up the photos at Iwo Jima {{where they had been}} delivered by a B-17.

One way that online communities work on retention is through the use of entry barriers and initiation rituals because making it difficult to join should increase their commitment.

25|$|Trains on the Fast lines {{pass the}} station through {{platforms}} 3 and 4, usually without stopping to serve it; {{access to these}} platforms is now by staff-operated gates which are opened when necessary. Southern and London Midland stopping services generally use platforms 5 and 6 on the Slow lines but all can use either pair of platforms when needed since the four Main Line platforms were lengthened to take 12-coach trains. Platform 2 on the Up DC line has unusually been maintained at a length of 182m rather than the usual DC line length of <b>around</b> 125m, <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> for an 8-coach train; on rare past occasions in recent years involving total closure of the Fast and Slow lines, main line trains have been diverted over the DC line between Watford Junction and Euston but without stopping at intermediate stations.|$|R
