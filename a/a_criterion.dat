McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and {{to begin the process}} of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection. Historical significance to the United States was <b>a</b> <b>criterion</b> of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -Criteria A 1 and A 2 for {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) have been discussed extensively, with several studies in adults or adolescents supporting the removal of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 2. However, solid research in children is missing. Objective: This study evaluated the DSM-Criteria A 1 and A 2 in predicting {{posttraumatic stress}} in children. Method: A sample of 588 Dutch school children, aged 8 - 18 years, completed a self-report questionnaire {{to determine if they}} met <b>Criteria</b> <b>A</b> 1 and/or A 2. Their posttraumatic stress response was assessed using the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale. Results: The contribution of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 2 to the prediction of posttraumatic stress in children is of greater importance than the contribution of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 1. Children who met <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 2 reported significantly higher levels of posttraumatic stress and were nine times more likely to develop probable PTSD than children who did not meet <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 2. When <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 1 was met, a child was only two times more likely to develop probable PTSD as compared with those where <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 1 was not met. Furthermore, the low sensitivity of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 1 suggests that children may regularly develop severe posttraumatic stress in the absence of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 1. The remarkably high negative predictive value of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 2 indicates that if a child does not have a subjective reaction during an event that it is unlikely that he or she will develop PTSD. Conclusions: In contrast to most adult studies, {{the findings of this study}} emphasize the significant contribution of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 2 to the prediction of posttraumatic stress in children and raise fundamental questions about the value of the current <b>Criterion</b> <b>A...</b>|$|R
