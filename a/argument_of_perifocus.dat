40|$|There {{are many}} astronomical records of comets in Korean history books. We {{collected}} {{those of the}} comet {{that appeared in the}} winter of the year 1664. These records were written in Daily Reports of the Royal Observatory on Astronomical Events, Final Reports of the Royal Observatory on An Astronomical Events, the Daily Records of the Royal Secretariat of the Joseon Dynasty, and the Chronicle of the Joseon Dynasty. We used the Olbers' method for determination of preliminary orbit of the comet, and compared the result with the previous researches. In the Oblers' method the orbit is assumed to be parabolic (e= 1). We obtained the following orbital elements: perifocal distance q= 1. 07 +- 0. 008 AU, perifocal passage time T= 2329 165. 50 +- 0. 72 days, <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> the <b>perifocus</b> omega = 318 ° 2 +- 2 ° 29, longitude of ascending node Omega = 85 ° 23 +- 2 ° 53 (J 1665), inclination i= 160 ° 28 +- 1 ° 56...|$|R
40|$|The Quadrantid shower, one of {{the most}} intense showers, has been {{observed}} at the beginning of January each year. However, the origin of the meteors is still unknown. It was Hasegawa (1979) who first suggested comet C/ 1490 Y 1 to be the likely origin of the shower based on the historical records of East Asia. We analyse the records of Jo-Seon-Wang-Jo-Sil-Lok (the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty in ancient Korea) and calculate the preliminary orbital elements of comet C/ 1490 Y 1 using a modified Gauss method. We find that comet C/ 1490 Y 1 was a periodic one and its orbital path was very {{similar to that of the}} Quadrantid meteor stream. The determined orbital elements are perifocal passage time Tp= 2265652. 2983 days (7. 8 Jan. 1491 in UT), perifocal distance q= 0. 769 AU, eccentricity e= 0. 747, semimajor axis a= 3. 04 AU, <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> the <b>perifocus</b> omega= 164. 03 degrees, longitude of ascending node Omega= 283. 00 degrees, and inclination i= 70. 22 degrees for the epoch of J 2000. 0. We, therefore, conclude that our result verifies the suggestion that the comet C/ 1490 Y 1 is the origin of the Quandrantid meteor shower, but was a periodic comet. We dicuss a possible link between this comet and the asteroid 2003 EH 1 as well. Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

30|$|In this respect, {{it should}} be pointed out that, if 60 is the shared {{structure}} for 56 – 59, it can be seen that NP 2 in 60 may or may not be a semantic <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> the matrix verb.

Although wo in 58 and ta in 59 both correspond to the NP 2 in 60 and can both be understood as a semantic <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding main predicate, ta in 59 semantically is an Agent <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> zou ‘to walk’ and wo in 58 can be interpreted as the Patient <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> qi ‘to annoy’.

40|$|The {{language}} {{surrounding the}} {{decision to go to war}} in American political discourse is often very divisive and draws upon numerous rhetorical traditions. Early research on the question of what types <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> favoring war has been largely inconclusive. Alongside the facts concerning conflict are numerous orators drawing upon various discourses and intellectual traditions seeking to sway their audience either toward or away from conflict. One such study is the work of James Andrews who conducted case studies to develop an ?American adolescence? theory suggesting that <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> honor and principle were the most persuasive in convincing men to take up arms. This research, however, fails to convincingly answer this question. In this dissertation, I use a rhetorical framework to investigate the types <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> used in early-American history that try to influence {{the decision to}} go to war. Primarily, this dissertation examines Andrews? theory <b>of</b> principled <b>arguments</b> and employs a second variable, that is, <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> expediency. I argue that principled arguments are not as successful as Andrews concludes and instead <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> expediency are more commonplace than <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> principle. Additionally, I argue that expedient rhetoric is a necessary component for mobilizing mass support for a war but expedient rhetoric is not necessary when arguing for inaction. Rather, principled arguments can also serve to motivate audiences toward inaction. To examine whether Andrews? theory <b>of</b> principled <b>arguments</b> is largely correct, I first demonstrate that Machiavelli used <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> expediency in an attempt to convince the Medici to go to war. From this example, I conduct three case studies where <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> principle and <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> expediency are both present. I find that in arguments prior to the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Mexican-American War are largely a mixed bag. In the American Revolution and the War <b>of</b> 1812, <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> expediency are often capable in convincing men to take up arms. However, I demonstrate that in the Mexican-American War, <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> principle may help to limit the severity of conflict...|$|R

40|$|This {{questionnaire}} {{focuses on}} control structures that are instantiated by predicates that take a state <b>of</b> affairs (SOA) <b>argument.</b> Noonan (1985) has called these predicates 'complement-taking predicates'; I {{will use the}} notion of SOAAtaking predicates (SOAA = state <b>of</b> affairs <b>argument).</b> Prototypically, complement control is instantiated by certain classes of verbs; however, adjectives (be eager to) and nouns (e. g. nominalizations such as promise) may function as control predicates as well. 'Control' refers to the pattern <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> identification between an <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> the SOAA-taking predicate and an <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> the SOAA-head. In the literature the notion of 'equi deletion' or 'equi-NP deletion' has been used (following Rosenbaum 1967), which refers to structures in which an overt <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> the matrix predicate is identified with a covert <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> the embedded predicate.
