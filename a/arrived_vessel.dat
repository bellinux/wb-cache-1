60|$|Bonnet {{was greatly}} {{inclined}} to punish with an unwonted severity this breach of rules, but Black Paul {{assured him that}} it was always the custom for the crew of a newly <b>arrived</b> <b>vessel</b> to go ashore and have a good time, and that if they were denied this privilege they would be sure to mutiny, and he might be left without any crew at all. Bonnet grumbled and swore, but, as he was aware there were several things concerning a nautical life with which he was not familiar, he determined to let pass this trespass.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vessels</b> <b>arriving</b> {{alone at}} Bermuda {{generally}} had no protection until they neared the archipelago where HMS Evadne patrolled the surrounding Atlantic, and also met and escorted <b>arriving</b> <b>vessels</b> to the channel through the reefs, {{where they were}} met by the converted tugboat, HMS Castle Harbour, crewed by local-service ratings, which brought the pilot (who steered the visiting ship through the reefs) and the naval examination officer tasked with inspecting <b>arriving</b> <b>vessels.</b> The Castle Harbour also carried out anti-submarine patrols within the reef (although the likelihood of anyone unfamiliar with the local waters navigating through the reef in a vessel of any size was unlikely, the events at Scapa Flow, on 14 October 1939, illustrated the dangers of complacency).|$|R

25|$|In 1863, Stodder was {{commander}} of the USS Adela, a former blockade runner which {{was attached to the}} East Gulf Blockading Squadron. Before departing to join the squadron, the Adela was in need of coal and arrived on August 4, 1863, at Port Royal, South Carolina, to resupply the ship. After waiting ten days, Stodder soon realized that the coal supplies were exhausted. During his wait, another ship, the bark Faith, laden with coal, struck the nearby shoals and bilged. Stodder requested and received permission from her senior officer to salvage the Faiths coal. For three days, the crew of the Adela were up to their necks in water salvaging about 25 tons. During this time, another supply <b>vessel</b> <b>arrived,</b> carrying 1400 tons of coal. His crew exhausted, Stodder ordered the salvaging operation to stop, hoping to obtain a supply from the <b>arriving</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
40|$|Anchorages are {{important}} resources for certain hub ports, {{and they are}} increasingly in demand during peak periods. We evaluate the capacity of multiple anchorages by reproducing realistic mix of <b>arriving</b> <b>vessels,</b> dwelling time and the current practices in choosing anchoring spots within an anchorage. The model is validated by using historical data. We also propose methods for improving space utilization of anchorages. Our experiments with four real anchorages show that the space utilization is improved by 6 - 10 % with MHDF and WALLPACK_MHDF algorithms. This finding opens up possibilities of designating vessel anchoring spots for improved utilizations in the future. Decision support system Anchorage capacity Disc packing algorithms...|$|R

Ships' owners soon saw this as a lucrative opportunity. They recruited Europeans to emigrate without payment up front and allowed anyone in the new world to redeem the travelers.

Ships would arrive at Bermuda singly, where Charles Fairey's converted yacht, , patrolled beyond the reefline, and the converted tugboat, , crewed by local ratings, patrolled nearer to shore and transported the pilots (who steered the visiting ships through the treacherous reefs that protected the harbours and anchorages) and the naval examination officer tasked with inspecting <b>arriving</b> <b>vessels.</b> Most convoys from Bermuda (coded BHX), once assembled, joined at sea with convoys originating at Halifax, Nova Scotia (coded HX), before crossing the Atlantic, it having been shown mathematically that - {{the area of}} a circle increasing disproportionately to its circumference as its radius is increased - it required relatively fewer warships to protect one large convoy than two smaller ones.|$|R

60|$|From {{nearly every}} pirate {{ship in the}} {{anchorage}} {{the proceedings of the}} newly <b>arrived</b> <b>vessels</b> had been watched. No one wanted to board them or in any way to interfere with them until it was found out what they intended to do. The Revenge was a stranger in that harbour, although her fame was known on not a few pirate decks; but if she came to Belize to fraternize with the other pirate vessels there gathered together, why didn't she do it? No idea of importance and dignity, which his position imposed upon Captain Stede Bonnet, entered their piratical minds. When the long-boat put forth from the Revenge, a good deal of interest was excited in the anchored vessels. The great Blackbeard himself stood high upon his deck and surveyed the strangers through a glass.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Long range multi-hop {{wireless}} broadband services are {{an alternative to}} satellite {{for the provision of}} Internet connectivity. In a maritime network scenario, they can potentially offer solutions close to ports or relatively narrow water channels; over such a multi-hop network one could enable various services ranging from simple file transfers to real-time communication. Concentrating on the latter case, which poses the biggest challenges, we develop and evaluate strategies for dynamic and predictive network resource allocation in order to support Voice over IP. We analyse how the ability to monitor the mobility of seaborne vessels through the Automatic Identification System provides us with a critical advantage in anticipating topology changes. The algorithms developed maintain high resource uti-lization levels but also offer significant enhancements in Quality of Service by withholding resources for <b>arriving</b> <b>vessels</b> in order to satisfy their imminent data traffic demands.

The application software is presented through a detailed discussion of its features, as these appear on panel for system definition and analysis. The simulator computes point and interval estimates for system performance measures. Statistical computations are based upon the issue of batching elementary observations either within the same run or across multiple runs. Simulation experiments are presented and discussed {{with the aim of}} recommending a cost-effective method for interval estimates in quantitative scenario analysis...|$|R
