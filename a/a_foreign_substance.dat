40|$|Macrophages {{are vital}} {{regulators}} {{of the host}} defense in organisms. In response to different local microenvironments, resting macrophages (M 0) can be polarized into different phenotypes, pro-inflammatory (M 1) or anti-inflammatory (M 2), and perform different roles in different physiological or pathological conditions. Polarized macrophages can also be further reprogrammed by reversing their phenotype according to the changed milieu. Macrophage polarization and reprogramming play essential roles in maintaining the steady state {{of the immune system}} and are involved in the processes of many diseases. <b>As</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>substances,</b> nanoparticles (NPs) mainly target macrophages after entering the body. NPs can perturb the polarization and reprogramming of macrophages, affect their immunological function and, therefore, affect the pathological process of disease. Optimally-designed NPs for the modulation of macrophage polarization and reprogramming might provide new solutions for treating diseases. Systematically investigating how NPs affect macrophage polarization is crucial for understanding the regulatory effects of NPs on immune cells in vivo.

2500|$|In her {{introduction}} to The Womanist Reader, Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism's characterization, its {{main concern is}} not the black woman per se but rather the black woman {{is the point of}} origination for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the black community and extend itself into other non-white communities. [...] "Purple is to Lavender" [...] illustrates this through experiences that Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss. Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In [...] "Purple is to Lavender", Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty. They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities. Jain is south Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino (Jain & Turner, pp.67–70). They go on to describe the concept of [...] "The Politics of Naming" [...] which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism (Jain & Turner, pp.73–75). Jain states: [...] "I knew that the term feminism was contested and that I did not like how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>substance</b> that I was being forced to consume as the White women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.68). Here Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. She feels like she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain's statement that, [...] "The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.73). This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals want something to identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: [...] "I don't choose womanism because it is [...] "better" [...] than feminism...I choose it because I prefer the sound, the feel, the fit of it… because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see" [...] (quoted in Jain & Turner, pp.77–78).|$|E

60|$|A fair, sweet, {{and honest}} country face was revealed, reposing in {{a nest of}} wavy {{chestnut}} hair. It was between pretty and beautiful. Though her eyes were closed, one could easily imagine the light necessarily shining in them as {{the culmination of the}} luminous workmanship around.

The grief had been there so shortly as to have abstracted nothing of the bloom, and had as yet but given a dignity to what it might eventually undermine. The scarlet of her lips had not had time to abate, and just now it appeared still more intense by the absence of the neighbouring and more transient colour of her cheek. The lips frequently parted, with a murmur of words. She seemed to belong rightly to a madrigal--to require viewing through rhyme and harmony.|$|E

50|$|On April 23, Michael Pineda started {{another game}} against the Red Sox. This game was away at Fenway Park. Not unlike the start against the Boston Red Sox on April 10, Pineda had another <b>foreign</b> <b>{{substance}}</b> on his body. Shockingly, {{it was a large}} amount of the substance on his neck. This occurred in the second inning, as the Red Sox manager John Farrell decided to appeal against the pitcher. As a result, umpire Gerry Davis examined the substance on Michael Pineda's neck. The substance was indeed pine tar, <b>an</b> illegal <b>foreign</b> <b>substance.</b> Thus, Davis immediately ejected Michael Pineda from the game and Pineda was put on a 10-game suspension. The controversy triggered analysts to discuss the possibility of Major League Baseball changing the rules and making a small amount of pine tar available for pitchers to use in very cold weathers to gain a grip on the ball. However, the substance wouldn't be allowed in decent weather. Analysts believe the rule, if looked into, could be made effective as of the 2015 season. Pineda took responsibility for cheating, however, and claimed that he would learn from his mistake.|$|R

30|$|A major {{challenge}} in bone tissue engineering {{is to develop}} a scaffolding material that is mechanically strong and yet biodegradable. To engineer bone tissue, which is hard and functions to support the body, the scaffold material must be strong and tough. Ideally, the scaffold needs to be degradable, as this biodegradation would avoid the detrimental effects of <b>a</b> persisting <b>foreign</b> <b>substance</b> and allow its gradual replacement with the new bone. Unfortunately, in this context, mechanical strength and biodegradability counteract each other. In general, mechanically strong materials (e.g., crystalline hydroxyapatite, Ti alloys, and crystalline polymers) are virtually inert and remain part of the repaired bone, while biodegradable materials (e.g., amorphous hydroxyapatite and glasses) tend to be mechanically fragile. This forms the greatest challenge in the design of bioceramics for bone engineering at load-bearing sites, but there are processing approaches such as sintering of 45 [*]S 5 Bioglass® (Chen and Boccaccini [2006 a]), for example, may offer opportunities to address the above dilemma (see the ‘Na-containing silicate bioactive glasses’ section).|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{and molecular}} events taking place during epidermal antigen exposure in sensitized individuals are principally well understood. Epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) {{are supposed to}} take up, process, and express <b>a</b> given <b>foreign</b> <b>substance</b> on their cell surface. The antigen is then recognized by T cells bearing the appropriate T-cell receptor (TCR). Because LC do not bear variable antigen (Ag) - specific binding sites, one could postulate that the epidermal exposure of any substance should activate LC and other cells of the skin immune system. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed immunophenotypically the cellular trafficking events in positive (n = 5) and negative epicutaneous patch-test reactions (n = 10), using a panel of monoclonal antibodies against CD 1 a, CD 11 c (Ki- M 1, LeuM 5), CD 68 (Ki-M 6), Ki-M 8, and CD 3 (Leu 4). We can demonstrate that irrespective {{of whether or not}} an antigen will be responded to by the immune system (i. e., positive or negative test reaction), epidermal antigen exposure causes a decrease of LC density in the epidermis and simultaneously causes an increase of LC in the dermis. More- over, monocytes and T cells immigrate into the dermis both in positive and negative patch-test reactions. As is to be expected, the degree of this cellular traffic is more pronounced in positive test reactions, which may be due to amplification mechanisms caused by antigen recognition of sensitized T cells. This finding demonstrates that human skin contains cell migration programs that ensure that any <b>foreign</b> <b>substance</b> will be accessible to the skin immune and phagocytic system...|$|R

40|$|After {{treatment}} with factor (F) VIII concentrate {{a significant number}} of patients with hemophilia A develop inhibitory antibodies that neutralize FVIII. Epitope mapping revealed that antibodies bind to selected regions within the A 2, A 3, and C 2 domains of FVIII. Anti-A 2 and anti-A 3 antibodies interfere with assembly of FVIIIa with FIXa, whereas anti-C 2 antibodies impede the interaction of FVIII with phospholipids. The immunologic mechanisms underlying inhibitor development in hemophilia A have not been fully elucidated.
