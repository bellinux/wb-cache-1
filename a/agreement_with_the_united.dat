5|$|The Tube Alloys {{programme}} in Britain and Canada was {{the first}} nuclear weapons project. Due to the high costs, {{and the fact that}} Britain was fighting a war within bombing range of its enemies, Tube Alloys was ultimately subsumed into the Manhattan Project.

5|$|In May 1940, during World War II, the United Kingdom {{initiated}} {{an invasion}} of politically neutral Iceland, fearing it would otherwise fall to the forces of Nazi Germany which had recently conquered Denmark. Iceland's indigenous population was generally opposed to the British occupation, instead preferring troops of the United States, which was neutral at that phase in the war. Iceland signed a defense <b>agreement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States in which United States troops would be stationed on the island nation. The U.S. Marine Corps hastily assembled the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in Charleston, South Carolina, to move to Iceland {{as part of the}} agreement. The brigade was first activated on 14 July 1941. Its elements were taken from the 2nd Marine Division, which was training at Marine Corps Base San Diego and Camp Elliott, both in San Diego, California. This brought the force up to a strength of 4,095 men. They were the first of 28,000 men occupying Iceland under Major General Holland M. Smith and his 1st Marine Division. While the 1st Marine Division was building its forces, though, the Provisional Brigade would hold Iceland. However, priorities soon changed and the 1st Marine Division was moved elsewhere. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was instead joined by units of the United States Army.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, many {{countries}} in the Near East and North Africa region have reformed the agricultural sector by lowering agricultural tariffs, liberalizing domestic prices and reducing consumer food subsidies. However, trade restrictions and domestic price support mechanisms are still prevalent for a few strategic commodities (such as wheat), and there is wide divergence among the countries {{in terms of the}} extent and depth of liberalization. Under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership launched in 1995, ongoing and future bilateral free trade agreements between the European Union and several Arab Mediterranean countries could lead to further trade liberalization. In addition, some countries have recently signed free trade <b>agreements</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States of America, and more countries in the Near East and North Africa region are expected to sign bilateral trade <b>agreements</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States in <b>the</b> near future.
