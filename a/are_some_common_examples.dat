25|$|Kinematic {{constraints}} are {{constraints on}} the movement of components of a mechanical system. Kinematic constraints can be considered to have two basic forms, (i) constraints that arise from hinges, sliders and cam joints that define {{the construction of the}} system, called holonomic constraints, and (ii) constraints imposed on the velocity of the system such as the knife-edge constraint of ice-skates on a flat plane, or rolling without slipping of a disc or sphere in contact with a plane, which are called non-holonomic constraints. The following <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>common</b> <b>examples.</b>|$|E
50|$|Humans {{exposed to}} {{carbophenothion}} show {{a wide variety}} of symptoms. It produces illness typical of cholinesterase inhibitors. Vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and excessive salivation <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>common</b> <b>examples.</b> When someone is exposed via inhalation, he or she may suffer from rhinorrhea and a tight feeling in the chest. As carbophenothion affects the activity of the nerves and the brain, symptoms like mental confusion, profound weakness and drowsiness are observed as well. When someone is exposed by absorption through the skin, they get muscle contractions as well. The only long term effect found in humans so far is a reduction of the amount of red blood cells and increase of the adrenal gland. These last two phenomenons only have been found in females. Other studies on long term effects only have been performed on animals and statements about possible extrapolations have not been made so far.|$|E
50|$|Child ProtectionOut of 440 million {{children}} in India, over 176 million are in urgent need of care & protection. The {{protection of children}} is {{the primary goal of}} DEHAT, so they divided efforts into three areas: preventing violations of children’s rights, implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and other relevant legal means of protecting children.At DEHAT, it believe that the most vulnerable children are those who are not safe in their own homes. Substance abuse, domestic violence, child marriage and criminal activities <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>common</b> <b>examples</b> of destructive forces throughout childhood. Most children we work with have undergone severe trauma & abuse at different stages in their life but do not have sufficient, if any, access to counselling that would help them with recovery and rehabilitation. We believe that protection against trafficking and other forms of violence can only be achieved when the following are in place:1.Personal Safety - Safe home environment.2.Educational Rights - Access to quality education.3.Financial Stability - Access to all financial instruments by children’s parents.4.Freedom from Exploitation- To give children the ability to fight against exploitative elements.|$|E

5000|$|Articulation {{disorders}} may {{be attributed}} to a variety of causes. A child with hearing loss {{may not be able to}} hear certain phonemes pronounced at certain frequencies, or hear the error in their own production of sounds. Oral-motor problems may also be at fault, such as developmental verbal dyspraxia (a problem with coordination of speech muscles) or dysarthria (abnormal facial muscle tone, often due to neurological problems such as cerebral palsy). Abnormalities in the structure of the mouth and other speech muscles can cause problems with articulation; cleft palate, tongue thrust, and dental-orthodontia abnormalities <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>common</b> <b>examples.</b> Finally, it is difficult for children to hear and produce all of the different phonemes of a given language. Development is slow, and may take up to seven years. Sometimes, as children grow, articulation problems fade and disappear without treatment. Often, however, therapy is necessary. Treatment therapies may target semantic differences related to phonemic differences (e.g., teaching a child the difference between toe and toad, underlining the importance of the final consonant), physical-motor differences (e.g., using a mirror to show a child the correct tongue placement for a particular sound), or behavior-modification techniques (e.g., repetitive production through prompts and fun learning games). Support and reinforcement of therapy practices, both in the classroom and at home, are crucial to the success of articulation disorder treatment (Boone 122-24, 259-62, 274-76).|$|E

40|$|Optical (visual) {{tracking}} is {{an important}} research area in computer vision {{with a wide range}} of useful and critical applications in defence and industry. The tracking of targets that pose a threat or potential threat to a country’s assets and resources is a critical component in defence and security. In order to complement radar sensing applications, an optical tracker provides additional functions such as target detection, target identification and intent detection at the visual level. A tracker for the maritime environment is an optical system that performs the automatic tracking of an above water target. Ideally, a track of the target is required for as long as is possible. Some examples of targets include boats, yachts, ships, jet-skis and aircraft. A number of factors mitigate the performance of such a system — change in target appearance, target occlusions, platform vibration and scintillation in the atmosphere <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>common</b> <b>examples.</b> We present the implementation of a first-generation system that is robust to platform vibration, target appearance changes and short-term occlusions. The optical tracker is developed using a particle filter and an appearance model that is updated online. The system achieves real-time tracking through the use of non-specialized computer hardware. Promising results are presented for a number of real-world videos captured during field trials...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [76]- 77) During normal operation, {{a controlled}} dynamic process occasionally experiences {{a change in}} its physical characteristics due to environmental disturbances. Temperature, pressure or variations {{in the structure of}} the process <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>common</b> <b>examples</b> of such disturbances. This situation may produce undesirable response and, in severe cases, the stability of the process may be compromised. In order to achieve a desired response in the presence of disturbances, researchers have developed a new class of control systems called adaptive control systems. Many adaptive control systems involve two central process control stages: 1) estimating the time-varying process parameters and 2) modifying the controller's parameters so as to achieve a desired system response. Such schemes include the Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) systems where a model of the controlled process is used to specify the desired performance of the actual process. This work will introduce two new MRAC design approaches to control linear, time-variant systems. In the first approach, the actual controlled process and its model are described by two difference equations. The individual terms of the actual process are equated to the corresponding terms of the model. The unknown process parameters are recursively estimated using the least squares method. From these equations, one can solve for the appropriate controller's parameters that will force the actual process to be consistant with its model. In the second scheme, the controller is designed using the output-to-input relationship. The second scheme updates the controller's parameter values whenever the process parameters change. M. S.

It is common that drivers operate a vehicle and, {{at the same}} time, interact {{with a variety of}} devices and applications. Texting while driving, looking up an address for the navigation system, and taking a phone call <b>are</b> just <b>some</b> <b>common</b> <b>examples</b> that add value for the driver, but also increase the risk of driving. Novel interaction technologies create many opportunities for designing useful and attractive in-car user interfaces. With technologies that assist the user in driving, such as assistive cruise control and lane keeping, the user interface is essential to the way people perceive the driving experience. New means for user interface development and interaction design are required as the number of factors influencing the design space for automotive user interfaces is increasing. In comparison to other domains, a trial and error approach while the product is already in the market is not acceptable as the cost of failure may be fatal. User interface design in the automotive domain is relevant across many areas ranging from primary driving control, to assisted functions, to navigation, information services, entertainment and games.

30|$|Synthesis of non-fossil fuels through {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{recycling}} via thermochemical or electrochemical pathways has received significant research interest {{in recent years}} as a complementary option to mitigate carbon emissions [2, 6, 13, 30]. Thermochemical redox cycles driven by concentrated solar power (CSP) have been widely studied for simultaneous splitting of H 2 O and CO 2 for syngas (a mixture of H 2 and CO) production [43, 44, 50], which can be further processed to valuable compounds via established industrial processes like the Fischer–Tropsch process. Of the numerous multi-step thermochemical redox cycles that have been proposed, the two-step metal-oxide redox pair systems have shown considerable potential for synthetic solar fuel generation [40, 49, 55]. These thermochemical cycles utilize the transition between a higher valence oxidized (MeOoxd) and lower valence reduced (MeOred) form of a metal-oxide usually having multiple oxidation states [2]. At first, MeOoxd undergoes a highly irreversible and endothermic thermal reduction (TR), thereby releasing oxygen and generating MeOred. Subsequently, MeOred is oxidized back to a higher valence state by taking oxygen from water and/or CO 2 (often present in industrial effluent gases, viz., oxyfuel power plant exhausts) via an exothermic reaction, in turn, generating H 2 and CO in water splitting (WS) and CO 2 splitting (CDS) reactions, respectively. This results in the reduction temperature (TRED) to be much higher (often above 1400  °C) than the oxidation temperature (TOXI) [3]. In a solar-driven cycle, this highly endothermic reduction reaction is sustained by concentrated solar power, for which multiple solar reactor types have been investigated. Packed beds reactors [52], porous structures [8, 19], rotating components [15, 29] and moving particles [41, 56] <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>common</b> <b>examples</b> of such reactors.|$|E
40|$|My primary {{interests}} {{lie in the}} field of geometric variational problems. So far, I have applied geometric measure theory to optimal transport problems, intersection homology theory of singular varieties, and isoperimetric minimizers with a transporting volume constraint. I have also worked on problems coming from Mathematical Biology such as description of the dynamic formation of a tree leaf, as well as modeling blood vessel structures in placentas of babies. 1 Ramifying structures in optimal transport The transport problem introduced by Monge in 1781 has been studied in many works in the last 10 years ([1], [5], [6], [8], [10], [17], [19], [21] and others). In these works, the cost of a transport mapping or a transport plan is usually an integral of some function of the distance. However, in many real applications, the actual cost of the transport procedures is not necessarily determined by just knowing some optimal mapping from the starting position to the target position. For example in shipping two items from nearby cities to the same far away city, it may be less expensive to first bring them to a common location and put them on a single truck for most of the transport. In this case, a “Y shaped ” path is preferable to a “V shaped ” path. In both cases, the transport mapping is trivially the same, but the actual transport path naturally gives the total cost. In general, a ramifying structure is more cost efficient than a “linear ” structure. The phenomenon of ramifying structure is very common in nature.
