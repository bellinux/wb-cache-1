40|$|This Essay {{questions}} whether Extra Credit Agencies should provide such long-term commercial risk insurance in project finance transactions. It {{can be argued}} that ECA-provided commercial risk insurance in project financings lifts from commercial banks the onus of rigorously analyzing the commercial risks of a project and that ECAs lack the institutional experience and commercial orientation to sufficiently <b>appraise</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> 2 ̆ 7 s commercial risk. This leads to the very real possibility that projects will be undertaken that on their own (i. e., without commercial risk insurance) might not be commercially viable...|$|E
40|$|Economic and {{participatory}} {{methods of}} project appraisal {{have traditionally been}} viewed as mutually exclusive alternatives, as they address different decision making criteria. Participatory methods such citizens' juries (or value juries) have been suggested {{as a means of}} better coping with some of the problems associated with economic evaluation methods such as contingent valuation. However, participatory methods have not offered the quantitative outputs of economic methods, nor have they addressed the issue of efficiency in resource allocation. In this paper we compare results from the use of contingent valuation and citizens' juries to <b>appraise</b> <b>a</b> woodland restoration <b>project</b> in Southern Scotland. We also investigate the potential of a third alternative which seeks to combine the strengths of contingent valuation and citizens' juries, the valuation workshop. 3 I...|$|R

40|$|Context: Participatory {{research}} (PR) is the co-construction {{of research}} through partnerships between researchers and people affected by, and/or responsible for action on, the issues under study.

Methods: Our review team consisted of a collaboration among researchers and decision makers in public health, research funding, ethics review, and community-engaged scholarship.
