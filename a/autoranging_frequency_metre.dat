50|$|The group's aim is {{to prove}} the {{existence}} of ghosts and to this end they carry out investigations using an array of scientific equipment; from infra-red cameras to electromagnetic <b>frequency</b> <b>metres.</b> They also perform vigils {{to look out for}} ghosts. The vigils are limited to twenty investigators at one time.|$|R
25|$|The 1215kHz <b>frequency</b> (247 <b>metres)</b> was used, in {{selected}} areas only, by the BBC Light Programme until 1967. It was then used nationally {{as the original}} home of BBC Radio 1 until 22 November 1978 and from 23 November 1978 until 28 February 1992 by BBC Radio 3.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and {{through to the}} early 1980s Edwards began live {{broadcasts}} (which were also broadcast with DJ Jeff Young on Capital Radio's 95.8 MHz FM <b>frequency</b> and 194 <b>metres</b> medium wave) of his show from the Lyceum Ballroom in the Strand, London.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{launching}} as Radio 210 (Two-One-Oh), {{the station}} commenced broadcasting in March 1976 on its medium-wave <b>frequency</b> of 210 <b>metres</b> (1431 kHz). It later {{became known as}} 2-Ten FM and by 2008, was part of The One Network group of stations {{owned and operated by}} Global Radio. The station was rebranded a year later as part of the Heart Network.|$|R
25|$|Another RSL {{broadcast}} {{ran from}} 7 August until 3 September 2004, {{with the ship}} moored at the cruise liner terminal jetty at Tilbury in Essex. It commemorated the 40th anniversary of Radio Caroline and promoted the station's legal internet and satellite programmes. The medium wave <b>frequency</b> was 235 <b>metres</b> (1278kHz) and programmes were sent through ISDN landline to Maidstone and via the internet and broadcast on satellite. The supermarket chain Asda and English Heritage were among the backers.|$|R
50|$|Omega {{stations}} used very extensive antennas {{to transmit}} at their very low frequencies (VLF). This is because wavelength is {{inversely proportional to}} <b>frequency</b> (wavelength in <b>metres</b> = 299,792,458 / frequency in Hz), and transmitter efficiency is severely degraded if {{the length of the}} antenna is shorter than 1/4 wavelength. They used grounded or insulated guyed masts with umbrella antennas, or wire-spans across both valleys and fjords. Some Omega antennas were the tallest constructions on the continent where they stood or still stand.|$|R
5000|$|CKSO radio {{signed on}} as Sudbury's first radio station in 1935, but prior to CKSO's sign-on in the 1930s there was a radio station named CFCR {{under the name of}} {{licensee}} [...] "Laurentide Air Service, Ltd.", operating on the <b>frequency</b> of 410 <b>metres</b> as of 1924. As of date, there's unknown historical information on this radio station, when it began broadcasting or ceased broadcasting, however, according to the Canadian Communications Foundation page, it's believed the station began broadcasting in 1923 up until around 1925.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark I Oboe {{was derived}} from Chain Home Low technology, {{operating}} at upper-range VHF <b>frequencies</b> of 1.5 <b>metres</b> / 200 MHz. The two stations emitted a series of pulses {{at a rate of}} about 133 per second. The pulse width could be made short or long so it was received by the aircraft as a Morse code dot or dash. The Cat station sent continuous dots if the aircraft was too close and continuous dashes if the aircraft was too far and from these the pilot could make course corrections. (The Germans used a similar method with Knickebein.) ...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1950s, {{sponsorship}} of the English service had begun to grow once more, and while initially some of the English-language programmes continued via Radio Luxembourg I on long wave, a second but less powerful wavelength was opened up as Radio Luxembourg II on medium wave. The English programmes of Radio Luxembourg moved on July 2, 1951 from long wave to the medium wave <b>frequency</b> of 208 <b>metres</b> (1439kHz). The controversy over the station's broadcasting frequencies had been resolved with the 1948 Copenhagen plan (which this time the Luxembourg government did sign), which allocated the country two high-power frequencies, one on long wave and the other on medium wave. Eventually all English programming moved to medium wave, with long wave being dedicated to French programmes, [...] while German, Dutch and other languages used medium wave during the daytime.|$|R
5000|$|High {{frequency}} (HF) is the ITU designation for {{the range}} of radio frequency electromagnetic waves (radio waves) between 3 and 30 megahertz (MHz). It {{is also known as}} the decameter band or decameter wave as its wavelengths range from one to ten decameters (ten to one hundred <b>metres).</b> <b>Frequencies</b> immediately below HF are denoted medium frequency (MF), while the next band of higher frequencies is known as the very high frequency (VHF) band. The HF band is {{a major part of the}} shortwave band of frequencies, so communication at these frequencies is often called shortwave radio. Because radio waves in this band can be reflected back to Earth by the ionosphere layer in the atmosphere - a method known as [...] "skip" [...] or [...] "skywave" [...] propagation - these frequencies are suitable for long-distance communication across intercontinental distances. The band is used by international shortwave broadcasting stations (2.31 - 25.82 MHz), aviation communication, government time stations, weather stations, amateur radio and citizens band services, among other uses.|$|R
50|$|The {{height of}} the mast determines the {{radiation}} properties. For high power transmitters in the MW range, masts with heights around half of the radiated wavelength are preferred because they focus the radiated power better to the ground than structures with heights of quarter wavelengths, which are preferred for economical reasons for low power medium wave transmitters. A focus of radiated power towards the ground is much desired on frequencies below 3 megahertz, because groundwave propagation is very stable. Masts longer than five eighths of the wavelength are normally not used, because they show bad vertical radiation patterns, so masts for mediumwave transmitters do not normally exceed 300 metres. For longwave transmitters, however, the construction of masts with heights of half-wave wavelength is generally not economically viable {{and in most cases}} impossible. The only longwave radio mast with a {{height of the}} half length of the radiated wavelength was the Warszawa Radio Mast at Konstantyn√≥w, Poland. At the time of its collapse in 1991 it was the tallest manmade structure in the world, at 646.38 metres (2,120.67 ft) tall, for a wavelength of 1292.76 <b>metres</b> (<b>frequency</b> 232 kHz). For frequencies below longwave, masts are electrically enlarged by loading coils or capacity hats on the top, because masts of even quarter wavelength would be too high to be practical.|$|R
