Rabbi Wahrman attributes his success to Rabbi Silver’s insistence and encouragement to hone his writing skills and record his copious chidushei Torah. Rabbi Wahrman writes in the short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times he screamed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> lack of understanding-however, even then I sensed his great love and concern for me and not the slightest hint of hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose very essence was giving to others-his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) knew no bounds…he saw every Jew as an extension of himself.|$|E

500|$|C. L. R. James {{wrote about}} Small {{in his book}} Beyond a Boundary. He {{described}} an unimportant match where Small was facing the fast bowler George John; he deliberately hit the ball hard back at John's feet to make him angry. He also wrote about practising with Small: [...] "International cricketers are not as ordinary men. There might be only two boys fielding, but if you bowled Joe a half-volley outside the off stump, he hit with all his force, though {{he would have to}} wait until the ball came back from 150 yards. Then he would bowl <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> ten minutes." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{negative}} reviews, {{like the}} one from New York Times film critic, Janet Maslin, killed the publication of Honeycutt's piece. Maslin said of the final scene of the movie, [...] "Anything this moment reveals about Vietnam and about America, not to mention about dogs and merry-go-rounds, has been said better elsewhere." [...] Critic Richard Freeman found Barbara Hershey's character [...] "moronic", and referred to the film as [...] "twaddle." [...] Freeman said it was [...] "fraught with symbolism. Or maybe it is just fraught". He further said of the film, [...] "Actually, it's about David Carradine, of whom the less said the better". The Kokomo Tribune called the story [...] "pointless". When Carradine read the reviews, {{he went back to}} the hotel bathroom and threw up. It wasn't just that the critics didn't like the picture; they were angry <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> making it,' Carradine said. 'I'll never figure that out.|$|E
500|$|Metropolis Records {{announced}} in mid-2006 it would reissue KMFDM's entire Wax Trax!-era studio album back catalog, {{which had been}} out of print since the early 2000s. The albums were released in chronological order in groups of two or three from September 2006 to May 2007. Konietzko said the remastering was done over concerns about losing the rights to the back catalog after TVT defaulted on a loan, explaining, [...] "The original agreement was that the catalog would have reverted back to me in 2008, anyway, but TVT and Rykodisc were thinking of just making a KMFDM compilation, which would have eliminated my catalog, and I didn't want that." [...] Konietzko commented in 2006 that the current line-up was the best he had worked with, and said in a separate interview that his former bandmates were [...] "looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> handouts". Konietzko {{announced in}} October 2007 that he was packing up and moving back to Germany in the next three months.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you going to do with an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} immediately after Johnston finished the Britain's Got Talent live tour over a six-week period in London. The track listing, which contained both religious and popular songs, {{was chosen by}} Cowell; Johnston said [...] "I hadn't sung many of the tracks before. But I knew them all and, anyway, I like a challenge." [...] Johnston described recording the album as [...] "great", and said [...] "All I’ve ever wanted {{to do is go}} into a studio and record an album and it was everything I’ve ever dreamed of." [...] Johnson recorded [...] "Walking in the Air" [...] as a duet with fellow Britain's Got Talent contestant Faryl Smith, and the song was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. The recording was finished by September 2008, after which Johnston began to make appearances to publicise the release, including appearances on GMTV, Channel 5 News, BBC Breakfast, This Morning and Radio 2's Friday Night Is Music Night. In preparation for the album's promotion, Johnston received confidence tutoring. He said that [...] "I've got no confidence and sometimes people get on <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> being moody so I've had some help with that." [...] Johnston also received vocal training from Yvie Burnett, who was, at the time, coaching Leona Lewis and Leon Jackson, and with whom Smith trained during Britain's Got Talent. The album was produced by Nigel Wright.|$|E
500|$|... "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" [...] emulates {{the style}} of Ben Folds. According to music critic Nathan Rabin, the song [...] "amplifies the noxious {{self-absorption}} of the American character to hilarious extremes" [...] by describing a narrator who, upon hearing {{about a number of}} horrible tragedies, only complains about the (minor) inconveniences that affect him. [...] Folds himself plays piano on the track. Yankovic later told The A.V. Club: [...] "Ben and I are old friends at this point, and of course I sought his keyboard work for that song. So he came in and knocked it out. I think that’s an F-Sharp, so he was kind of mad <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> that." [...] "Bob" [...] is a style parody of Bob Dylan, composed entirely of palindromes (for instance, the song's first line is [...] "I, man, am regal—a German am I", which reads the same when reversed). Rabin argues that the song's lyrics [...] "sound cryptic enough to be genuine Dylanesque, but are in fact palindromes deliver in an uncanny re-creation of Dylan's nasal whine." [...] The album's closer, [...] "Genius in France", emulates the idiosyncratic style of Frank Zappa. Zappa's son, Dweezil performed the song's intro guitar solo. Lyrically, the song describes a person who, although rejected elsewhere, finds acceptance in France.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Democracy Now!, Cole noted {{that he had not}} applied for the Yale job: [...] "Some people at Yale asked if they could look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a senior appointment. I said, 'Look all you want.' So that's up to them. Senior professors are like baseball players. You're being looked at by other teams all the time. If it doesn't result in an offer, then nobody takes it seriously." [...] He described the so-called [...] "scandal" [...] surrounding his nomination as [...] "a tempest in a teapot" [...] that had been exaggerated by [...] "neo-con journalists": [...] "Who knows what their hiring process is like, what things they were looking for?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1997, {{during a}} pre-game interview, Gaston accused {{specific}} members of Toronto's sports media (Toronto Sun columnist Steve Simmons, Globe and Mail sports editor Dave Langford, and Fan 590 sports {{talk show host}} Bob McCown) of racism against him, stating [...] "There's a couple (of sports writers) who continue to take shots <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> no reason at all. I just wonder if they would take the same shot at me if I was white." [...] After the game against the Oakland A's on April 17, Gaston spoke briefly about his pre-game comments. [...] "I've got one statement that I'm going to say, and I'm {{not going to say}} another word", Gaston said. [...] "Whatever has been said, whatever has been written, if it has offended someone and it's unjustly offended them, I apologize. If it hasn't, then I don't apologize." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Egypt Independent {{reported}} that police forces dragged a protester, stripped him naked, {{beat him up}} with batons, {{and took him to}} a security truck. The incident sparked criticism against the administration of Morsi for tolerating the security force's excessive use of force. The presidency said it [...] "was pained by the shocking footage of some policemen treating a protester in a manner that does not accord with human dignity and human rights." [...] State television {{reported that}} the 48-year-old beaten man, from a police hospital and without a lawyer present, said that the police had in fact saved him from thieving protesters. The man's daughter, who says she was present {{at the scene of the}} attack, said that her father is simply [...] "afraid to talk", while his nephew said [...] "he is lying because there is a lot of pressure on him." [...] In new twist, Hamada Saber finally retracted his earlier testimony: [...] "I told [...] today that [...] shot me in the leg, beat me and dragged me," [...] he said. [...] "When I resisted, they tore off my shirt. After I resisted some more, they tore off my pants and underpants. They kept telling me to stand up and I kept telling them I was injured". [...] "Now my family has disowned me; my wife and kids won't talk to me. The whole country is angry <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> ," [...] Saber added.|$|E
