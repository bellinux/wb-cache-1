5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

500|$|Since 1996, Madonna {{went through}} a number of [...] "life-changing experiences" [...] which {{included}} giving birth to her daughter Lourdes, gaining interest in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, as well as earning the title role on the film adaptation of the musical Evita (1996). A year later she started working on Ray of Light, her eighth studio album. Madonna wrote songs with William Orbit, Patrick Leonard, Rick Nowels and Babyface. The album would reflect the singer's changed perspectives about life. Author Carol Benson noted that it was a [...] "deeply spiritual dance record", with the crux of it based on Madonna's career, her journey and the many identities she had assumed over the years. Motherhood had softened the singer emotionally, which was reflected in the songs. She started talking about ideas and used words which implied deep and personal thoughts, rather than the regular dance-floor anthemic tunes she had composed. The singer began introspecting herself with motherhood being a [...] "big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> before", she said to Q magazine.|$|E
500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E

500|$|... "Nothing Really Matters" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna and American {{producer}} and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was inspired by Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, whom {{she gave birth to}} in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection for the singer. [...] "That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> before," [...] she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including [...] "Nothing Really Matters". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to her, which included a demo version of [...] "Nothing Really Matters"'s music. According to Madonna, she had been a fan of Orbit's work {{for a long time and}} was pleased with the demo version, which he started to work on.|$|E

It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> before," [...] she said to Q magazine, in 2002.

[...] Madonna felt that there was a [...] "whole piece" [...] of her voice left unused, which she decided to utilize for the album. By May 1997, Madonna had started writing songs for the album. She began collaborating with Babyface, who had first worked with her on her previous album Bedtime Stories. The two wrote a couple of songs together before Madonna decided the collaborations were not going in the musical direction she wanted for the album. According to Babyface, the songs [...] "had a 'Take a Bow-ish' kind of vibe, and Madonna didn't want, or need, to repeat herself." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, the Brewers renewed Braun's {{contract}} for $455,000, a $75,000 increase. Braun then signed an 8-year, $45–$51 million contract extension (the total depending on his [...] "Super 2" [...] service-time ranking after the 2009 season) on May 15, 2008. [...] The contract {{is through the}} year 2015. The deal included Braun's $455,000 salary for 2008, and a $2.3 million bonus in 2008. It could increase to $51 million through incentives. Braun also has a no-trade clause {{for the first four}} years, and then a limited no-trade clause allowing him to block deals to 12 teams from 2012 to 2013, and 6 teams from 2014 to 2015. The contract will keep Braun locked up through his age-31 season. It was the largest contract in Brewers' history, surpassing Jeff Suppan's. It was also the largest contract in baseball history given to a player with less than three years' experience. [...] Braun's agent, Nez Balelo, crunched enough numbers to show him what he potentially could have made over the life of this contract if he had chosen not to sign it. [...] "But the question I ultimately <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> was, `What can't I buy with that amount of money?"' Braun said.|$|E

500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sobers went on {{his first}} {{overseas}} tour {{in the early months}} of 1956 when, aged 19, {{he was part of the}} West Indian tour of New Zealand. The series was not successful personally for Sobers, who struggled on the foreign batting wickets. West Indies pitches had little or no grass to speak of, while in New Zealand the pitches were green. [...] "I took one look and <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> how I could possibly bat on that? How could I make runs? I was out before I even walked to the crease," [...] Sobers later wrote. Playing in all four Tests, he totalled 81 runs and two wickets. As a batsman, Sobers needed time to develop at Test level and, in nine Tests as a teenager, he scored only one half century, and averaged 29.33 with the bat.|$|E
