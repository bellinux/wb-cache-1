5|$|Before {{applying}} the top coats of paint, the LMS would <b>apply</b> <b>a</b> matt undercoat of shop grey {{in which it}} was customary to photograph the locomotive for the first time. The ensuing LMS top coats for the Coronation Class came in two basic colours during this period: Caledonian blue and crimson lake. Linings for streamliners involved the renowned 'speed whiskers' comprising stripes emerging from a fixed point in the lower centre of the front of the locomotive to run in parallel along the sides. Non-streamliners carried the standard LMS-style lining.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, several U.S. Navy {{submarines}} {{were forced}} back to base to repair {{damage caused by}} cookiecutter shark bites to the neoprene boots of their AN/BQR-19 sonar domes, which caused the sound-transmitting oil inside to leak and impaired navigation. An unknown enemy weapon was initially feared, before this shark was identified as the culprit, and the problem was solved by installing fiberglass covers around the domes. In the 1980s, some thirty U.S. Navy submarines were damaged by cookiecutter shark bites, mostly to the rubber-sheathed electric cable leading to the sounding probe used to ensure safety when surfacing in shipping zones. Again, the solution was to <b>apply</b> <b>a</b> fiberglass coating. Oceanographic equipment and telecommunications cables have also been damaged by this species.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of fabric {{production}} natural dyes {{have been used to}} <b>apply</b> <b>a</b> form of colour, with dyes from plants, including indigo from Woad, having dozens of compounds whose proportions may vary according to soil type and climate; therefore giving rise to variations in shade. In the case of the Saltire, variations in shades of blue have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue. When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century, the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly {{selected on the basis of}} the durability of darker dyes, with this dark blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land. Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour trend of the Union Flag for the Saltire itself, leading to a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to <b>apply</b> <b>a</b> constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E
