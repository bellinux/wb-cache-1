40|$|Twenty {{years after}} the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation has struggled to construct a new foreign policy paradigm in a world that is no longer bipolar. Instead of the Cold War era arms stockpiles, Moscow has signed multiple Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START), and instead of physically taking over neighboring territories, increasing diplomacy and economic incentives have become Moscow’s primary tool to garner and maintain influence in its near abroad. Soft power initiatives, that can all roughly fit into a foreign aid model, from the Russian Federation to the near abroad come in different forms: oil subsidies, <b>aid</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> and direct financial investment. The Russian Federation has used all three of these strategies in Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union in an attempt to keep the country in its sphere of influence. The use of foreign aid, be it oil subsides, <b>aid</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> or direct financial aid, all work towards the same goal of promoting Russian policies and interests in the near abroad. Ukraine, with its unique political, cultural and geographical importance, demonstrates the new struggle between Russia and the West. The struggle’s main actors are the Russian Federation against the eastern half of NATO and the EU, and the conclusion is unclear. Foreign aid and soft power are now playing a critical role in the outcome...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} {{economic}} and political context, significant changes are taking place in food security issues. Nowadays, emphasis is being placed on developing seamless and sensible links between various food security programmes, including emergency aid and overall development policies. In 1996, the European Union adopted a new community programme with flexible, trans-sectoral tools designed to: ? improve market supply through support to local food production (local purchases, and so-called triangular operations); ? facilitate the access of vulnerable groups to basic food supply, instead of simply providing food; ? create a stable and responsive political and economic climate to encourage long-term food security policies. Between October and December 1997, CTA and the Food Aid and Food Security Unit of the Directorate-General for Development of the European Commission organised {{a series of three}} seminars based on this new set of measures. This was done against a background of alarming perspectives, especially with regard to sub-Saharan Africa. The seminars were intended to inform and encourage discussion about the measures with ACP decision-makers (Permanent Secretary level of Ministries of Agriculture, Economic Affairs and Trade) and with representatives of NGOs and regional organisations, all of whom were actively involved in this domain. The four regions of Africa, and the Caribbean, were represented *. Each participant approached the seminars with their own particular experience and vision, and together discussed various sections of the new measures and their tools, such as <b>aid</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> financial aid, counterpart funding and foreign exchange arrangements. A set of case studies underlined just how diverse (e. g. countries in a critical state, in the process of rehabilitation, and {{with a high level of}} food insecurity) and complex situations of food insecurity are, as well as the difficulties of implementing corrective steps. It was recognised that it was the role of the State to create an institutional and economic framework to protect the poorest of the poor. Further, the importance of making national, regional and international policies coherent and complementary was stressed. Participants also emphasised the need for communication and consultation between various partners. * West Africa: Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger Central Africa and Caribbean: Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haïti, Madagascar, Rwanda, São Tomé and Principe East Africa: Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Somalia, Uganda, Zimbabwe; Yemen also participated.

40|$|Background: Regulated intramembranous {{proteolysis}} of the amyloid-b {{precursor protein}} by the c-secretase yields amyloidb, {{which is the}} major component of the amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the APP intracellular domain (<b>AID).</b> <b>In</b> vitro studies have involved <b>AID</b> <b>in</b> apoptosis and gene transcription. In vivo studies, which utilize transgenic mice expressing <b>AID</b> <b>in</b> the forebrain, only support a role for <b>AID</b> <b>in</b> apoptosis but not gene transcription. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we have further characterized several lines of AID transgenic mice by crossing them with human Tau-bearing mice, to determine whether over-expression of <b>AID</b> <b>in</b> the forebrain provokes AD-like pathologic features in this background. We have {{found no evidence that}} AID overexpression induces AD-like characteristics, such as activation of GSK- 3 b, hyperphosphorylation of Tau and formation of neurofibrillary pathology. Conclusions/Significance: Overall, these data suggest that AID transgenic mice do not represent a model that reproduces the overt biochemical and anatomo-pathologic lesions observed in AD patients. They can still be a valuable tool to understand the role of <b>AID</b> <b>in</b> enhancing the cell sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, whose pathways still need to b...|$|R
