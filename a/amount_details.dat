But in this system having two draw backs, first one is weight of the material may be inaccurate due to human mistakes and secondly, if not buy the materials {{at the end of the}} month, they will sale to others without any intimation to the government and customers. In this paper, proposed an Automatic Ration Materials Distribution Based on GSM (Global System for Mobile) and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology instead of ration cards. To get the materials in ration shops need to show the RFID tag into the RFID reader, then controller check the customer codes and details of amounts in the card. After verification, these systems show the <b>amount</b> <b>details.</b> Then customer need to enter they required materials by using keyboard, after receiving materials controller send the information to government office and customer through GSM technology. In this system provides the materials automatically without help of humans...|$|E

50|$|Six Sigma {{practitioners}} use {{the term}} Business Process Architecture to describe the mapping of business processes as series of cross-functional flowcharts. Under this school of thought, each flowchart is of a certain level (between 0 and 4) based on the <b>amount</b> of <b>detail</b> the flowchart contains. A level 0 flowchart represents the least <b>amount</b> of <b>detail,</b> and usually contains one or two steps.

In addition, the aim was also to study whether repeated interviews with the child leads to a more detailed report. The results revealed that the majority of the children reported a great <b>amount</b> of <b>details</b> about what happened before, during, and after the homicide in the police interviews, where most of the children provided great <b>amount</b> of <b>details</b> concerning sensitive information (i. e., severe and critical information) about the violence. Witnessing repeated violence did not significantly affect the <b>amount</b> of <b>details</b> given. Repeated interviews did not affect the <b>amount</b> of <b>details</b> provided.

40|$|Memory for {{repeated}} {{events is}} relevant to legal investigations about repeated occurrences. We investigated how two measures of specificity (number of events referred to and <b>amount</b> of <b>detail</b> reported about the events) were influenced by interviewees' age, number of experienced events, interviewer, perceived unpleasantness, and memory rehearsal. Transcribed narratives consisting of over 40. 000 utterances from 95 dental patients, and the corresponding dental records, were studied. <b>Amount</b> of <b>detail</b> was measured by categorizing the utterances as generic, specific, or specific-extended. We found that the two measures were affected differently by all five factors. For instance, number of experienced events positively influenced number of referred events but {{had no effect on}} <b>amount</b> of <b>detail</b> provided about the events. We make suggestions for future research and encourage reanalysis of the present data set and reuse of the material...|$|R

A themed analysis of prosecutors’ responses indicated threemajor concerns about these interviews: the interviewer using wordy instructions, the lack ofchronology and logical structure, and the relentless pursuit of unnecessary detail. Thesefindings suggest that prosecutors’ concerns are primarily due to police using cognitive interviewmethods that attempt to enhance the <b>amount</b> of <b>detail</b> recalled by a complainant. Theauthors discuss why generating large <b>amounts</b> of <b>detail</b> may be problematic in interviews withsexual assault complainants and provide recommendations for how police can adapt interviewpractices to better meet evidential needs...|$|R
