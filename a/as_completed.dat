5|$|Furious {{was laid}} down on 8 June 1915 at Armstrong Whitworth's Low Walker {{shipyard}} in Newcastle upon Tyne. The ship was launched on 18 August 1916 and commissioned on 26 June 1917. <b>As</b> <b>completed,</b> her complement numbered 737 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{testing of}} the {{prototype}} QF 25-pounder Short was completed in early December 1942. The 2/1st Field Regiment also trialled the gun in New Guinea during early 1943. Large-scale production began in early 1943, after minor modifications {{were made to the}} design, and the Army placed an initial order for 112 guns. A second order was later placed for 100 more. This lot incorporated the Mark II carriage, which had larger wheels and tyres to prevent the problem with wheel bounce encountered by the first lot. Altogether, 213 guns were manufactured by the time production ceased in 1944. <b>As</b> <b>completed,</b> the gun's full designation was Ordnance QF 25-pounder Short (Aust) Mark I, but it was nicknamed the 'snort' by Australian soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The band {{recorded}} the album {{during the winter}} of 1996–1997. With lyrical material written on the band's nonstop tours over the previous years, as well <b>as</b> <b>completed</b> songs, the band recorded with Trombino in sessions that lasted for five weeks. During the production for Dude Ranch, the members of Blink-182 were plagued with difficulties only made worse by the rushed schedule: bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge, co-vocalists for the band, were having vocal problems and Raynor had to record his drum tracks with both heels broken, on crutches.|$|E

5|$|Leaving Lebanon, {{the line}} ascended a small gully and then headed north-northeasterly across the {{highlands}} to Dodds. The never-used grade from Dodds to Waynesville descended into the Little Miami River valley via Newman Run before turning north and ending at the latter village. Portions of the right-of-way and stone abutments for several never-built bridges remain {{on what is}} now farmland. The line <b>as</b> <b>completed</b> turned north at Dodds, and required several cuts and fills to traverse the rolling terrain. At Hempstead, just north of Hempstead Road, the line split. The original route continued north, parallel to Woodman Drive, to the old Dayton and South Eastern Railroad (now the Iron Horse Trail) at Lebanon Junction. A 1915 extension was built parallel to the ex-D, and ended at the Panhandle Route (now the Creekside Trail to the east) at Clement. Part of this line is still operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway, and to the south the right-of-way is being used for {{an extension of the}} Iron Horse Trail. The other branch headed northwesterly into downtown Dayton, steadily descending as it passed south of the University of Dayton and alongside the Great Miami River. The main passenger and freight depots were at Washington Street, which the CL passed over on the first such grade separation in Dayton. The first freight depot opened with the line in 1912, and was replaced in 1930 by a larger structure, itself torn down in 1966.|$|E

25|$|The Lord Nelsons {{were the}} last British battleships to have an {{armoured}} ram built into their bow. They cost just over £1,600,000 each, the 2005 equivalent of about £110,000,000. The ships <b>as</b> <b>completed</b> were homely but intimidating in appearance, and looked more like French battleships than the previous British pre-dreadnought pattern.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>completed</b> the Dyott Bomber was a four-bay tractor biplane with equal-span wings. It was {{powered by}} two Beardmore 120 hp {{water-cooled}} six-cylinder engines which were mounted, without cowlings, between the wings. The aircraft had a fixed nosewheel undercarriage, with the nosewheel balanced {{by a large}} tailskid. It carried a crew of three, with a pilot and two gunners, in nose and dorsal positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} engines were {{mounted on a}} platform supported by iron scaffolding at the aft end of the vessel. Cooling water was stored in tanks mounted above-deck. <b>As</b> <b>completed,</b> the Type AF had a speed of six knots, {{and a range of}} 60 nautical miles unless auxiliary fuel tanks were fitted. Disadvantages of this set-up included an inability to back the vessel astern, limited maneuverability and the deafening noise of the engines which would have made voice commands problematic.|$|E

25|$|The opera was {{unfinished}} at {{the time}} of Puccini's death in 1924, and was completed by Franco Alfano in 1926. The first performance was held at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 25 April 1926 and conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions. The first performance of the opera <b>as</b> <b>completed</b> by Alfano was the following night, 26 April, although it is disputed whether this was conducted by Toscanini again or by Ettore Panizza.|$|E
25|$|This design philosophy, {{common in}} Britain and France (and, after 1941, the United States) tended towards {{eliminating}} fuselage mounted guns altogether. For example, the original 1934 specifications for the Hawker Hurricane were {{for a similar}} armament to the Gloster Gladiator: four machine-guns, two in the wings and two in the fuselage, synchronized to fire through the propeller arc. The illustration opposite is of an early mock-up of the prototype, showing the starboard fuselage gun. The prototype (K5083) <b>as</b> <b>completed</b> had ballast representing this armament; production Hurricane Is, however, were armed with eight guns, all in the wings.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>completed,</b> the {{overriding}} exterior {{form of the}} Winter Palace's architecture, with its decoration {{in the form of}} statuary and opulent stucco work on the pediments above façades and windows, is Baroque. The exterior has remained as finished during the reign of Empress Elizabeth. The principal façades, those facing the Palace Square and the Neva river, have always been accessible and visible to the public. Only the lateral façades are hidden behind granite walls, concealing a garden created during the reign of Nicholas II. The building was conceived as a town palace, rather than a private palace within a park, such as that of the French kings at Versailles.|$|E

25|$|The {{outcome was}} {{a class of}} ships {{exceeding}} 2,500 tons. Solutions to the stability problems of earlier classes were incorporated in the design, with a lower bridge and a slightly wider and deeper hull. Weaponry was restored to the six 5inch guns of the Fubukis, in Type C mountings, and eight 24inch torpedoes, in two quadruple mountings with improved reloading facilities, were also fitted. New engines and machinery layouts were used to improve performance and weight. <b>As</b> <b>completed,</b> there was no improvement to anti-submarine and anti-aircraft (AA) weaponry, somewhat surprisingly in view of Japan's commitment to naval aviation and the anti-aircraft capability of the subsequent Akizuki class. During 1943 and 1944, however, the AA outfit was improved on the surviving ships and radar was fitted.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} August 1935, work on the airframe, {{performed}} at Hawker's Kingston upon Thames facility, had been completed and the aircraft components were transported to Brooklands, Surrey, where Hawker had an assembly shed; on 23 October 1935, the prototype was fully re-assembled. Ground testing and taxi trials took place over the following two weeks. On 6 November 1935, the prototype K5083 took to the air {{for the first time}} at the hands of Hawker's chief test pilot, Flight Lieutenant George Bulman. Bulman was assisted by two other pilots in subsequent flight testing; Philip Lucas flew some of the experimental test flights, while John Hindmarsh conducted the firm's production flight trials. <b>As</b> <b>completed,</b> the prototype had been fitted with ballast to represent the aircraft's armament prior to the acceptance of the final multi-gun wing armament.|$|E
25|$|The weather on {{the next}} day, November 6, was stormy, so Du Pont {{postponed}} the attack for one more day. During the delay, Commander Charles Henry Davis, Du Pont's fleet captain and chief of staff, had the idea of keeping the ships in motion while bombarding the forts. This was a tactic that had recently been used successfully at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet. He presented his idea to the flag officer, who agreed. The plan <b>as</b> <b>completed</b> by Du Pont called for his fleet to enter the harbor at mid-channel. On the way in, they would engage both forts. After passing the forts, the heaviest ships would execute a turn to the left in column and go back against Fort Walker. Again past the fort, they would once more turn in column, and repeat the maneuver until the issue was decided. While the main fleet was thus engaged, five of his lighter gunboats would form a flanking column that would proceed {{to the head of}} the harbor and shield the rest of the fleet from Tattnall's flotilla.|$|E
