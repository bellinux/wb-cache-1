50|$|In 685, John Maron, who {{recognized}} {{the legitimacy of}} Paul the Jew <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>successors</b> until Byzantium began to appoint titular Patriarchs of Antioch ending with Theophanes (681-687), was elected Patriarch of Antioch by the Maradite army. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian II sent an army to dislodge John from the see; John <b>and</b> <b>his</b> followers retreated to Lebanon, where they formed the Maronite Church, whose succession of Patriarchs have continued to the present day. The Byzantines appointed Theophanes of Antioch in his stead. Thus there were now three rival patriarchs: those that recognized Severus <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>successors,</b> those that recognized John Maron <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>successors,</b> <b>and</b> those that recognized Theophanes <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>successors.</b> It was the successors of Theophanes who were recognized as legitimate by the Byzantine government.|$|R

5|$|Chrysippus, {{the son of}} Apollonius of Tarsus, {{was born}} at Soli, Cilicia. He was slight in stature, and is reputed to have trained as a long-distance runner.

5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>successor</b> Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This {{is at odds with}} the traditional Egyptian system where the legitimacy of the new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|English colonial {{traders and}} explorers from Carolina, since its {{founding}} in 1670, had established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended {{all the way to the}} Mississippi.
