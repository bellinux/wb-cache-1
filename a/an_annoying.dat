Writing for AOL TV, Jay Black called [...] "Product Recall" [...] "wonderful" [...] and highlighted the Jim-Dwight impersonations and Andy's discomfort upon discovering his girlfriend was a high school student.

Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A–.|$|E
500|$|Albert Daniels as Brooklyn, a New York {{transplant}} {{and one of}} Rashad's closest friends.

[...] "He was <b>an</b> <b>annoying</b> little kid who got fired every time he was a P.A. because he was so inquisitive. But every time they fired him I'd bring him back because I felt like he always had something." [...] Eight years later, Robinson ran into Daniels at a poetry reading in New York City, and told him to audition for the film. Daniels didn't have any money to get to Atlanta where he had to audition, so he hustled money doing poetry in subways, and bought a bus ticket to get there.|$|E

He proceeded to only provide the basic structure of his lines in the script, instructing him to retroscript the rest.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become <b>an</b> <b>annoying</b> thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} SpongeBob was {{originally}} used by Kenny for a minor background character in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he}} was coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. When Hillenburg heard Kenny do the voice, he said, [...] "That's it—I don't want to hear anybody else do the voice. We've got SpongeBob." [...] He said that to Nickelodeon; however, the network said, [...] "Well, let's just listen to 100 more people." [...] Kenny said, [...] "But {{one of the advantages of}} having a strong creator is that the creator can say, 'No, I like that—I don't care about celebrities.'" [...] Kenny says that SpongeBob's high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique, stating that they wanted <b>an</b> <b>annoying</b> laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.|$|E

500|$|Nimoy said Meyer {{gave the}} script [...] "the kind {{of humor and}} social comment, gadfly {{attitude}} I very much wanted". He added that his vision was for [...] "no dying, no fighting, no shooting, no photon torpedoes, no phaser blasts, no stereotypical bad guy. I wanted people to really {{have a great time}} watching this film [...] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed a couple of big ideas at them, well, then that would be even better." [...] One of Meyer's earlier films, Time After Time, was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that The Voyage Home had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as punk rock—The Voyage Homes scene where Kirk and Spock meet <b>an</b> <b>annoying</b> punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from Time After Time.|$|E
500|$|While Hillenburg, Drymon and Hill {{were writing}} the pilot, Hillenburg was also {{conducting}} auditions to find voices {{for the show}} characters. He had created the character of SpongeBob with Tom Kenny, in which he utilised Kenny's and other people's personalities to help create its personality. Drymon said, [...] "Tom came in a few times so we could pitch him what we were working to help him find the right voice. Tom had already worked on lots of other animated shows, and Steve wanted to find an original sounding voice." [...] The voice of SpongeBob was originally used by Kenny for a very minor female alligator character named Al in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he was}} coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. Kenny says that SpongeBob's high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique, stating that they wanted <b>an</b> <b>annoying</b> laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.|$|E
500|$|The LFR {{navigation}} system required, at a minimum, only a simple AM radio receiver {{on board the}} aircraft to accurately navigate the airways under instrument meteorological conditions, and even execute an instrument approach to low minimums. On the downside, however, it had only four course directions per station, was sensitive to atmospheric {{and other types of}} interference and aberrations, and required pilots to listen for hours to <b>an</b> <b>annoying</b> monotonous beep, or a faint stream of Morse codes, often embedded in background [...] "static". Its eventual replacement, the VHF band VOR {{navigation system}}, had many advantages. The VOR was virtually immune to interference, had 360 available course directions, had a visual [...] "on course" [...] display (with no listening needed), and was far easier to use. Consequently, when the VOR system became available in the early 1950s its acceptance was rapid, and within a decade the LFR was mostly phased out. VOR itself is gradually being phased out today in favor of the far superior Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|E

500|$|After riders enter a Krusty-themed ride vehicle, Homer orders {{everyone}} to sit down, {{telling them that}} all the seats are the same, except {{the ones that are}} better and threatens to make <b>an</b> <b>annoying</b> noise until they sit down. Even when riders do sit down, Homer always makes the annoying noise, regardless. Jeremy Freedman then appears on a TV screen in the ride cabin and assures the riders that their comfort and safety {{are in the hands of}} highly qualified teens, like himself and explains the operators' requirements. He then tells the riders to enjoy themselves, but keep the screaming down so he can study for a math test, because if he does not get a C or higher, he will get kicked out of the audio-visual club. He then begins reading his textbook upside down (unknown to him) while quiet elevator music, utilizing part of the instrumental to [...] "The Simpsons Theme" [...] begins playing in the background. If the ride takes longer than usual to begin, a visual reading 'Krustyland, where fun takes a holiday," [...] with Krusty and Mr. Teeny dancing appears, and the music changes tempo, getting more upbeat.|$|E
500|$|Rare {{decided to}} make an action-based game that focused totally on Banjo and his abilities. Kazooie was later {{conceived}} during the planning of such abilities. According to Mayles, [...] "We {{came up with the}} [...] idea that a pair of wings could appear from his backpack to help him perform a second jump. We also wanted Banjo to be able to run very fast when required [...] we added a pair of 'fast-running' legs that appeared {{from the bottom of the}} backpack. [...] we came up with the logical conclusion that these could belong to another character, one that actually lived in Banjo's backpack." [...] The character was named after a kazoo, which was considered <b>an</b> <b>annoying</b> instrument, [...] "much like the personality of the bird", Mayles explained. Instead of actual dialogue, all the characters in the game feature [...] "mumbling" [...] voices. This choice was made to convey their personalities without them actually speaking, as Rare felt the actual speech [...] "could ruin the player's perception of the characters." [...] The witch Gruntilda was inspired by Grotbags from the Grotbags British television series.|$|E
500|$|Amir {{first came}} to {{national}} prominence in 2004 {{when he was a}} semi-finalist during Yahoo's inaugural national IM Live contest, losing to the eventual champions. [...] Now, he is best known for appearing in the web series Jake and Amir with Jake Hurwitz, in which he plays <b>an</b> <b>annoying</b> and exaggerated version of himself. Originally made by Hurwitz and Blumenfeld in their spare time, the series was then produced by CollegeHumor. Blumenfeld's acting in the series gained him a Webby Award for Best Individual Performance in 2010. In 2011, CollegeHumor released Jake and Amir: Fired, a 30-minute special that is the company's first paid content. Episodes of Jake and Amir average over 500,000 views; by 2012, over 500 had been produced. [...] The pair have also hosted numerous live shows, and started the advice podcast If I Were You in 2013. In December 2013, it was announced that Jake and Amir would be adapted into a TBS television comedy with Ed Helms as an executive producer. TBS never filmed the pilot, despite a fan-created #GreenlightJakeAndAmir Twitter campaign that garnered tens of thousands of tweets. Instead, sister network truTV picked up the pilot and filmed it, though it was never aired.|$|E
