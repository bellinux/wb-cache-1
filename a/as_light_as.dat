25|$|The GT-R {{began as}} a sedan, but a 2-door coupé version was debuted in October 1970 and {{introduced}} in March 1971. The cars were stripped of unnecessary equipment to be <b>as</b> <b>light</b> <b>as</b> possible for racing, and performed well at the track. The sedan racked up 33 victories {{in less than two}} years, and the coupé stretched this to 50 through 1972.|$|E
25|$|Waterstarting {{in light}} wind is also possible, but more {{difficult}} to perform, and may even require a different technique such as controlling the rig by {{the foot of the}} sail and lower part of the mast (i.e. controlling the sail at a point lower than the boom). As such, it is considered an expert-level skill. Experts can waterstart in winds <b>as</b> <b>light</b> <b>as</b> 7-10kt.|$|E
25|$|The planing {{hull form}} is {{configured}} to develop positive dynamic pressure {{so that its}} draft decreases with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the drag. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is {{to have at least}} one chine, which makes for more efficient planing and can throw spray down. Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective planing hull must be <b>as</b> <b>light</b> <b>as</b> possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping. Sail boats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.|$|E

In an interview following his induction into the Canadian Songwriters' Hall of Fame, Cohen explained that the album was intended {{to be a kind of}} notebook or scrapbook of themes, and that a more formal record had been planned for release shortly afterwards, but that this was put on ice by his legal battles with his ex-manager.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in New York in 1967, Purim and Moreira became {{immersed}} in the emerging Electric Jazz. They toured Europe with Stan Getz and Gil Evans. In 1972, alongside Stanley Clarke and Joe Farrell, they were, {{for the first two}} albums, members of Chick Corea's fusion band Return to Forever, which released first a self-titled album, Return to Forever, in 1972, followed the same year <b>as</b> <b>Light</b> <b>as</b> a Feather; both received glowing reviews. In 1973, Purim released her first solo album in the United States, titled Butterfly Dreams. It was well received, and soon after she was chosen by the Down Beat reader's poll {{as one of the top}} five jazz singers. Purim also worked with Carlos Santana and Mickey Hart at outdoor festivals and on jazz and classical albums through the 1970s. In the early 1970s, Purim was arrested and briefly incarcerated for cocaine possession.|$|E
25|$|The contractor's {{locomotive}} {{was a small}} tank locomotive specially {{adapted for}} use by civil engineering contractor firms engaged {{in the building of}} railways. The locomotives would be used for hauling men, equipment and building materials over temporary railway networks built at the worksite that were frequently re-laid or taken up and moved elsewhere as building work progressed. Contractor's locomotives were usually saddle or well tank types (see above) but required several adaptations to make them suitable for their task. They were built to be <b>as</b> <b>light</b> <b>as</b> possible so they could run over the lightly built temporary rails and had deeply flanged wheels so they did not de-rail on the tracks which were often very uneven. At the same time they had to be very powerful with good traction as they would often have to haul trains of wagons up very steep gradients, such as the sides of railway embankments or spoil heaps. Many were designed so that large iron ballast blocks could be fitted to the frames when extra weight and traction was required, then removed when it was not. Most had sanding gear fitted to all wheels for maximum traction. Some method of keeping mud and dust from clogging the wheels and brake shoes was also required – this either took the form of scraper bars fitted to {{the leading edge of the}} wheels or wheel washer jets supplied from the water tank. To handle long trains of loose-coupled (and often un-sprung) wagons, contractor's locomotives usually had very effective steam-powered brakes. Most lacked a full cab, often only having a front 'spectacle plate'. If a cab was provided it was usually removable along with the chimney, and sometimes the dome, so that the locomotive could be loaded onto a flatbed wagon for transport to new locations by rail whilst remaining within the loading gauge.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} a generally positive reception and holds a 76% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 145 reviews. Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman gave The Young Victoria a B+; he gave praise to Emily Blunt's performance and concluded, [...] "The Young Victoria has a subtler flow {{than you might}} expect, and at times it's calmer than you may like. Director Jean-Marc Vallée's images have a creamy stateliness, {{but this is no}} gilded princess fantasy — it's the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings, and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it a [...] "frivolously entertaining film" [...] and believed it was [...] "directed with some snap by Jean-Marc Vallée". Dargis finished her review, [...] "Despite the filmmakers’ efforts to persuade us that The Young Victoria is a serious work, and despite some tense moments and gunfire, the film’s pleasures are <b>as</b> <b>light</b> <b>as</b> its story. No matter. Albert may never rip Victoria’s bodice, but he does eventually loosen it, to her delight and ours." ...|$|E

2500|$|Developed in the 1950s, steam catapults {{have proven}} {{exceptionally}} reliable. Carriers equipped with four steam catapults {{have been able}} to use {{at least one of them}} 99.5 percent of the time. However, there are a number of drawbacks. One group of Navy engineers wrote, [...] "The foremost deficiency is that the catapult operates without feedback control. With no feedback, there often occurs large transients in tow force that can damage or reduce the life of the airframe." [...] The steam system is massive, inefficient (4–6%), and hard to control.

2500|$|Ultra-light {{spinning}} and casting rods are generally shorter ( [...] is common) lighter, and more limber than normal rods. Tip actions vary from slow to fast, depending upon intended use.
