5|$|But now my <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> {{getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. I really wanted to do {{something}} which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.|$|E
5|$|Later at the Warsaw Tavern, Drew {{is hanging}} out with his friends when Mimi walks in and confronts him. Drew talks to her {{honestly}} about why she {{did not get the}} job, telling her that her <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> the problem and she has to {{deal with the fact that}} her looks might stop her from getting some jobs. Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar. Needing to fill the cosmetics position quickly, Drew believes he has found an ideal candidate in Natalie (Natasha Silver) until Kate turns up to apply for the job. Drew admits that he is worried that Kate will hate him if he has to fire her. However, Mr. Bell insists Drew hire Kate, having seen her in the lobby and Drew agrees. Kate later comes to Drew's house to ask him, Lewis and Oswald, which perfume samples to promote. The episode ends with Drew playing pool in his garden in the rain, while the others watch through the window.|$|E
5|$|The Earl {{can be a}} {{grotesque}} caricature of a Victorian gentleman: a rotund figure in cape and top hat (hiding his horns), with a perpetual enormous grin and pince-nez spectacles. Although his <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> often cheerful, he is quick to reveal his more intimidating, malicious side. The Earl has a golem named , a pink umbrella with a small, talking jack-o-lantern at its tip. It usually talks excitedly or screams, adding {{its name to the}} end of almost every sentence. Lero, used by the Earl as a Mary Poppins-type flying umbrella, is very loyal to him and guards his sword. Road often takes Lero against its will, using it as a witch's broom or an ordinary umbrella. It {{has been used as a}} beacon to summon Akuma, to transport several exorcists to the Ark and to guard the Noah. Lero has a sword similar to Allen Walker's sword of exorcism, which surprises him when they clash on Noah's Ark. Despite his antipathy to the Noah Nea, the Earl grows depressed when he talks about him.|$|E
40|$|The social {{psychology}} literature on <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> reviewed. The structure of <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> examined {{in terms of}} two conceptual issues: whether <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> made up of one or three components and whether the evaluative aspect of <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> unidimensional or bidimensional. The possible functions of <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> considered, and the relations between attitudes and higher-order constructs such as values and ideologies are discussed. Numerous characteristics of <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> defined, including accessibility, ambivalence, and strength. The processes involved in <b>attitude</b> formation <b>are</b> summarized, {{and the effects of}} attitudes on information processing are discussed. Finally, the issue of attitude-behavior consistency is examined, focusing on the conditions under which attitudes predict behavior strongly...|$|R
50|$|Your <b>attitude</b> should <b>be</b> {{large or}} small {{according}} to the situation. Upper, Lower and Middle <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> decisive. Left Side and Right Side <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> fluid. Left and Right <b>attitudes</b> should <b>be</b> used {{if there is an}} obstruction overhead or to one side. The decision to use Left or Right depends on the place.|$|R
40|$|Some {{models of}} {{attitude}} {{have speculated that}} affectively based <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> more accessible than cognitively based <b>attitudes.</b> However there <b>are</b> also reasons to expect that affectively based <b>attitudes</b> may not <b>be</b> generally faster and that any accessibility advantage would hold only at high levels of attitude extremity. Two studies of attitudes with affective and cognitive structural bases examined this possibility. In both studies, no overall effect of attitude bask on extremity emerged, but attitude extremity did moderate the effects of basis. Affectively based <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> expressed faster than cognitively based ones only when <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> more extreme, and they tended to be expressed more slowly when <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> less extreme. These results may have arisen because only strong affect is seen as more diagnostic of true attitude, producing faster responses...|$|R
5|$|To {{the right}} of Sapieha are {{reformer}} Stanisław Staszic (26) and, with his hand around Staszic, Andrzej Zamoyski (27), author of the Zamoyski Codex, an earlier attempt to reform the state. To the left of Staszic, the head of bishop of Smoleńsk, Tymoteusz Gorzeński (28), is visible in the crowd. Beneath Staszic and Zamoyski, with an outstretched hand, is Kazimierz Konopka (29), Kołłątaj's secretary {{and one of the}} Polish Jacobins; Konopka has a French blue-white-red flower in his hat and a czekan, an ax- and hammer-like weapon, in his hand. Above them is an unnamed Eastern Orthodox priest (30); the figure on his right (31) is either Paweł Ksawery Brzostowski, pioneer of agricultural reforms, or Józef Stępkowski, a less progressive figure. This line of figures ends with Antoni Tyzenhauz (32), Lithuanian official and reformer. To {{the right of}} Zamoyski is an unnamed peasant (33). His passive <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> seen as a representation of the unconcerned attitude of Polish peasantry towards the reforms.|$|E

40|$|This article {{adds to the}} {{literature}} on worker attitudes towards unions by investigating the impact of cultural attitudes and the call centre labour process on union attitudes among call centre workers in Britain and India. It is hypothesised that workers with egalitarian and collectivist cultural <b>attitudes</b> will <b>be</b> {{more likely to have}} pro-union attitudes than other workers, although if the impact of cultural <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> mediated by history and institutions, it might be expected that this relationship is stronger for British than Indian workers. Conversely, if union <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> largely a function of the call centre labour process, we would expect union <b>attitudes</b> to <b>be</b> similar among workers in both countries. Our results only partially support our hypotheses. Collectivist <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> only weakly related to union attitudes among the British sample but are more strongly related in the Indian sample. There are significant differences between union attitudes among our British and Indian samples. The article concludes that relationship between cultural attitudes and union <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> heavily dependent on institutional context. Cultural <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> unlikely to be either a constraint or a facilitator of union efforts to organise workers...|$|R
50|$|Thus, <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> {{not always}} a clear {{prediction}} of behavior, resulting in the ‘value-action gap’. The decision-making process is hard to predict as positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> not followed by positive intentions, and what shapes behavior is a complex process. Even if values are high, few people take environmental actions which involve changes to their lifestyle and often environmental actions can be unrelated to particular concerns an individual may have. The result <b>is</b> that <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> not necessarily a clear determinant of behavior.|$|R

50|$|People do not {{necessarily}} agree on which <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> socially desirable. Moreover, these <b>attitudes</b> may <b>be</b> situational (see below) and vary from setting to setting. Therefore, {{the ways in which}} <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> biased by social desirability may be interesting in its own right. Therefore, social desirability may not invalidate measures of internal factors such as personality {{in the same way as}} it invalidates studies of behavior.|$|R

25|$|Jung's {{theory of}} {{neurosis}} {{is based on}} a psyche that consists of tensions between various opposite attitudes in a self-regulating dynamic. The ego, being the center of consciousness, represents the coalescing attitude of consciousness. The ego's <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> in tension with a complementary and balancing attitude in the unconscious.|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} {{individual}} differences in <b>attitudes</b> <b>was</b> examined {{in a survey of}} 195 pairs of monozygotic twins and 141 pairs of same-sex dizygotic twins. A principal components analysis of the 30 attitude items in the survey identified 9 attitude factors, of which 6 yielded significant heritability coefficients. Nonshared environmental factors accounted for the most variance in the attitude factors. Possible mediators of <b>attitude</b> heritability <b>were</b> also assessed, including personality traits, physical characteristics, and academic achievement. Analyses showed that several of these possible mediators correlated at a genetic level with the heritable attitude factors, suggesting that the heritability of the mediator variables might account for part of the heritable components of some <b>attitudes.</b> There <b>was</b> also some evidence that highly heritable <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> psychologically "stronger " than less heritable attitudes. A truism in the social psychological literature on <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> that <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> learned (e. g., see Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Olson & Zanna, 1993; Oskamp, 1991).

Because such an <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> highly irregular, the captain incorrectly assumed the indicators to be faulty. Without any visual references (due to the clouds) and having rejected the information from the ADIs, the captain and first officer became spatially disoriented.|$|E
25|$|Actions or {{objects are}} not seen impure in themselves, rather the <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> the {{determinant}} factor. Spiritual ignorance {{is the only}} impurity and knowledge is pure. As long as one is identified with the supreme consciousness, there is nothing impure. The adept is unaffected by any external impurity and makes use of what is reprehensible to attain transcendence. Here arises the antinomian and asocial character of Kaula and the left-handed forms of Tantra.|$|E
40|$|Abortion <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> studies {{within a}} {{framework}} of feminist object relations theory. 80 subjects from a small coeducational college participated. <b>Attitudes</b> <b>were</b> assessed by a questionnaire containing: background information, Bem sex role inventory, Kalin sex role ideology measure, an abortion attitude inventory, and an adapted form of the Thematic Apperception Tests. There was a link between sex and abortion attitude, traditional ideology, and verbal TAT response. Abortion <b>attitude</b> <b>was</b> also related to primary issue used to determine their attitude, and verbal TAT response.

25|$|Broadly defined, Religious Zionism is a {{movement}} that embraces the idea of Jewish national sovereignty, often {{in connection with the}} belief in the ability of the Jewish people to bring about a redemptive state through natural means, and often attributing religious significance to the modern State of Israel. (This <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> rejected by most Haredim – but not all, particularly the Hardal movement.) Thus, in this sense, Religious Zionism in fact encompasses a wide spectrum of religious views including Modern Orthodoxy.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this alleged <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> the {{previous}} displaying of the picture of an Ulster Volunteer Force member who was allegedly involved, among others, {{in the murder of}} 26 people in Dublin in the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, and who was himself killed by the Provisional IRA in 1976. His picture had appeared at FAIR rallies and an organiser of the Love Ulster demonstration previously told a republican newspaper that he would not guarantee that images of the murder suspect would not be displayed during the demonstration.|$|E
25|$|The early 18th {{century is}} often {{considered}} the nadir of English heraldry. The heraldic establishment was not held in high regard by the public; {{the authority of}} the Court of Chivalry (though not its armorial jurisdiction) was challenged, and an increasing number of 'new men' simply assumed arms, without any authority. This <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> evident even in the appointment of the heralds themselves—Sir John Vanbrugh, a prominent dramatist and architect who knew nothing of heraldry, was appointed to the office of Clarenceux King of Arms, the second-highest office in the College of Arms. No new grants were made between November 1704 and June 1707.|$|E
