5|$|After Whitlam left, Kerr {{called in}} Fraser, {{informed}} {{him of the}} dismissal, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would form a caretaker government, to which Fraser agreed. Fraser later stated that his overwhelming sensation at the news was relief. Fraser left to return to Parliament House, where he conferred with Coalition leaders, while Kerr joined the luncheon party that {{had been waiting for}} him, apologising to his guests and offering the excuse that he had been busy dismissing the Government.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Jamal Al-Durrah (born 1988) was {{in fifth}} grade, but his school was closed on 30 September 2000; the Palestinian Authority {{had called for}} a general strike and day of {{mourning}} following violence in Jerusalem the day before. His mother {{said he had been}} watching the rioting on television <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could join in. Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction. Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat, Motro wrote, and Muhammad loved cars, so they went to the auction together.|$|E
5|$|Newt Lee, {{the night}} watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was {{normally}} calm, came bustling {{out of his}} office. Frank told Lee {{that he had not}} yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before coming back.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{negotiations}} with the union ended, the mine owners met secretly with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado Springs. They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of nonunion workers, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could protect such a large force of men. Bowers said he could not, for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm {{more than a few}} deputies. The mine owners offered to subsidize an initial force of a hundred or so men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{started the}} 2003 season 4–4, but lost their final eight games. With two games {{remaining}} in the season, Jim Fassel requested a meeting with team management, <b>and</b> <b>asked,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was to be fired, that they do so now rather than wait {{until the end of}} the season. Management complied with his request, formally firing Fassel on (or around) December 17, 2003, but allowing him to coach the team's final two games.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division. Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> should attack {{in an effort to}} relieve the pressure on the 27th Infantry, or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division's area, move south to Kumch'on, and then turn toward Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division. The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position.|$|E

5|$|Elvis Presley as Vince Everett, a {{prisoner}} who, after being released, becomes a star for his singing talent. Producer Pandro S. Berman's wife {{convinced him to}} make a film with Presley starring in the leading role. Berman contacted Presley's manager, Colonel Thomas Parker, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could send Presley or Parker the script to read it. Parker was uninterested and denied the request. Berman asked Parker under which conditions would he take the project, to which Parker replied that he was only interested in the music score of the movie and owning the rights for record sales and publishing royalties. Presley's payment was settled at 250,000 and 50% of the royalties from the distribution of the movie.|$|E
5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate {{the sound of a}} choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at 09:35, two USAF F-15C fighter {{aircraft}} {{from the}} 53d Fighter Squadron, piloted by Captain Eric Wickson and Lieutenant Colonel Randy W. May, departed Incirlik AB. Their {{mission was to}} perform an initial fighter sweep of the TAOR to clear the area of any hostile aircraft prior to the entry of coalition forces. The air tasking order (ATO) {{that was supposed to}} list all scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before takeoff, mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would be operating in the TAOR that day but did not list takeoff times, routes, or flight durations for them. At 10:15, Wickson radioed Martin on the AWACS <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had any information to pass to them to which Martin replied in the negative.|$|E

5|$|When Skerritt {{first read}} the {{screenplay}} for Alien, he declined the project, unimpressed with its writing quality and budget. After the screenplay was edited {{and the budget}} enlarged, Skerritt was approached again and signed on. Halfway through production, he approached writer and executive producer Ronald Shusett <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could trade his salary for a one-half percentage point (.5 percent) share in the film. In a deleted scene, Ellen Ripley detours while escaping from the Nostromo and finds Dallas alive in the Alien nest; she kills Dallas and destroys the nest with a flamethrower {{in an act of}} mercy. According to Skerritt, the scene was cut because its quality was below par and it disrupted the pace of Ripley's escape; it was included in the 2003 director's cut.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, the Spanish {{approached}} the chiefdom of Altamaha, {{led by a}} chief named Zamuno, who always bore arms in case of attack by Cofitachequi. It is unclear if De Soto entered the main town at the Shinholser site. Zamuno exchanged gifts with De Soto <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> should pay tribute directly to him, instead of to his overlord Ocute. De Soto replied that the previous relationship should stand. De Soto erected a cross and left behind a cannon somewhere in the chiefdom. He summoned the paramount chief of Ocute, and then visited his main town, apparently at the Shoulderbone site, on April 9. He received gifts and set up another cross, and the army rested for two days. On April 12, De Soto visited another subject chiefdom, Cofaqui, which was governed by a young noble named Patofa {{on behalf of his}} elderly uncle. Patofa reiterated his compatriots' policy of amity and gave the army provisions and porters.|$|E
5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired {{to work on}} the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E

25|$|In late 1916, Zelle {{travelled}} to Madrid, {{where she}} met with the German military attaché, Major Arnold Kalle, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could arrange {{a meeting with the}} Crown Prince.

The two {{had known each other}} from their work together in Meany's previous band Earthsuit. Occasionally Paul would receive instrumental demo CDs from Darren. Fairly impressed with his efforts, Paul contacted Darren <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could mess with the demos a bit, adding some ideas of his own. Darren obliged and the two would set in motion a sort of songwriting ping-pong match that would carry on for several months.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to prepare her {{daughter}} Bernice, then only five years old, for the funeral, she {{tried to explain to}} her that the next time she saw her father he would be in a casket and would not be speaking. When asked by her son Dexter when his father would return, King lied and told him that his father had only been badly hurt. Senator Robert Kennedy ordered three more telephones to be installed in the King residence for King and her family to be able to answer the flood of calls they received and offered a plane to transport her to Memphis. Coretta spoke to Kennedy the day after the assassination <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could persuade Jacqueline Kennedy to attend her husband's funeral with him.|$|E
25|$|The Far Right – The National Front, long {{dismissed}} as a fringe party, stunned many when its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, reached {{the second round of}} the 2002 elections. Le Pen's points of focus – law and order and immigration – are now openly taken up by politicians such as Nicolas Sarkozy. Ironically, Le Pen on 12 April criticised Sarkozy for being Hungarian <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> should run for the president of Hungary. Le Pen is 79 years old, the same age which Charles de Gaulle was when he stepped down from the presidency in 1969. His approval rating in opinion polls markedly increased after France's riots in 2005. As a counterweight, the Left and the cultural elite and athletes (like Lilian Thuram) have risen to oppose Sarkozy's response to the riots.|$|E
