25|$|Dependency-related overaccommodation: {{this occurs}} in {{situations}} where the older person {{is dependent on the}} younger person. The younger person’s speech is dominating and controlling. This pattern can be seen in interactions between <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person</b> and their caregiver.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this {{situation}} occurs with a special form of liver transplant in which the recipient suffers from familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, a disease where the liver slowly produces a protein that damages other organs. The recipient's liver can then be transplanted into <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person</b> for whom {{the effects of the}} disease will not necessarily contribute significantly to mortality.|$|E
25|$|One {{recommended}} diagnostic {{approach is}} as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss, new seizures, new weakness, new confusion, further workup with imaging {{and possibly a}} lumbar puncture should be done (see red flags section for more details). If the headache is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography test {{to look for a}} brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the CSF, as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. If there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person,</b> a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal arteritis should be performed and immediate treatment should be started.|$|E

500|$|Blake's {{philosophical}} {{interpretation of}} time is similar to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's depiction {{of the relationship between}} time and the state of limbo within his poem [...] "Limbo". Both claim that their understanding {{of time is}} connected to the common, contemporary view, but they alter their perspective of time within their works to that of <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person.</b> The figure of time appears in other works by Blake, including as the figure Los and in the illustration Blake made for Edward Young's Night Thoughts.|$|E
500|$|Sherri Stoner created Slappy the Squirrel {{when another}} writer {{and friend of}} Stoner, John McCann, made fun of Stoner's career in TV movies playing troubled {{teenagers}}. When McCann joked that Sherri would be playing troubled teenagers when she was fifty years old, the latter developed the idea of Slappy's characteristics as <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person</b> acting like a teenager. Stoner {{liked the idea of}} an aged cartoon character because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and [...] "have the dirt on [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The third type of {{disorder}} discussed by Boris and Zeanah is termed [...] "disrupted attachment". This type of problem, {{which is not}} covered under other approaches to disordered attachment, results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. The young child's reaction to such a loss {{is parallel to the}} grief reaction of <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person,</b> with progressive changes from protest (crying and searching) to despair, sadness, and withdrawal from communication or play, and finally detachment from the original relationship and recovery of social and play activities.|$|E

60|$|In fact, {{it might}} have puzzled <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person</b> {{to account for the}} sudden and {{confused}} pause which the Lady Peveril made, as she gazed on her unexpected guest, as if dubious whether she did, or did not recognise, in her still beautiful though wasted and emaciated features, a countenance which she had known well under far different circumstances.|$|E
60|$|He did not say, as <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person</b> might, {{that she}} was not to be held {{accountable}} for what she did under the stress and tumult of that day; but he unconsciously did so regard her actions, led to do so by the changed conditions.

60|$|I know I {{am not a}} bird, {{but that}} is the very reason why they should listen to me. I bring a fresh mind to bear upon the subject. I am not tied down by bird convention. February, my dear friends--in these {{northern}} climes of ours at all events--is much too early. You have to build in a high wind, and nothing, believe me, tries a lady's temper more than being blown about.

60|$|As it was {{impossible}} for one of Gabriel's simple nature to keep his plans entirely secret, Olly was perfectly aware of his intention, and prepared for the formal announcement, which she knew would come in Gabriel's quaint serious way. In the critical attitude which the child had taken toward him, she was more or less irritated, as <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person</b> might have been, with the grave cautiousness with which Gabriel usually explained that conduct and manner which was perfectly apparent and open from the beginning. It was during a long walk in which the pair had strayed among the evergreen woods, when they came upon the little dismantled cabin. Here Gabriel stopped. Olly glanced around the spot and shrugged her shoulders. Gabriel, more mindful of Olly's manner than he had ever been of any other of her sex, instantly understood it.|$|E

50|$|Anne had won many awards, {{including}} {{best actress}} at the Thailand National Film Association Awards She {{also is a}} television producer, producing the Thai TV show English on Tour and Sanam Dek Len. Her mother has three children; her mother raised her older and younger brother while leaving her with her grandmother. Her grandmother had raised her all alone, {{just the two of}} them because her grandfather had died. From time to time, her mother would send money for her school and money for other stuff that she needed. Anne said that when she opened up her eyes she saw <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>person</b> who took care of her since she was a child, at that time her grandmother was about 70 years old. Anne feels that even though she was born without having a mom and a dad, she never felt anything missing in her life because her grandmother had given her everything, like love in a family, and by taking care and being concerned about her welfare. So Anne gave back to her grandmother what her grandmother had done for her, ‘just like a twin,' said Anne. Where ever her grandmother went, she would follow, living her life like <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>person,</b> like going to ‘wat’ (temple), and her grandmother would teach Anne how to pray, massage, and take care of <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>person.</b>|$|R
60|$|Indeed, one aunt {{had nothing}} {{on her head}} at all but a little black velvet and lace, {{not much more than}} Mary {{sometimes}} wore, and the other only a very light cap. Kate thought great-aunts must be as old at least as Mrs. Brown, and was much astonished to see that these ladies had no air of age about them. The one who sat on the sofa had a plump, smooth, pretty, pink and white face, very soft and pleasant to look at, though <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person</b> than Kate would have perceived that the youthful delicacy of the complexion showed that she had been carefully shut up and sheltered from all exposure and exertion, and that the quiet innocent look of the small features was that of a person who had never had to use her goodness more actively than a little baby. Kate was sure that this was aunt Jane, and that she should get on well with her, though that slow way of speaking was rather wearisome.|$|E
60|$|Like Miss Fennimore, Honor was {{surprised}} by Phoebe's composure under her share of the evil report. The strictures {{which would have been}} dreadful to <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person</b> seemed to fly over her innocent head, their force either uncomprehended or unfelt. She yielded implicitly to the propriety of the change, but her grief was at the family quarrel, the leaving home, and the unmerited degree of blame cast on Mervyn, not the aspersions on herself; although, as Honor became vexed at her calmness, she withheld none of them in the desire to convince her of the expediency of leaving Beauchamp at once for the Holt. No, even though this was Robert's wish, Phoebe could still not see the necessity, as long as Mervyn should be alone. If he should bring any of his discreditable friends, she promised at once to come to Miss Charlecote, but otherwise she could perceive no reason for grieving him, and astonishing the world, by implying that his sisters could not stay in his house. She thought him unwell, too, and wished to watch him, and, on the whole, did not regret her guardian's gout, which would give her a little more time at home, and put off the discussion till there should be less anger.|$|E

I own {{it is hard to}} have one's {{predecessor}} flung constantly in one's teeth, and by the very people who were the greatest thorns to dear Underwood himself. Then Clem, who was a born prig, though a very good boy, gave some of his little interfering bits of advice before he went away, and it has all been set down to Felix's account! One Sunday, Smith made a complaint of Felix having the biggest boys in the school. It was the consequence of his having taken them whenever his father could not, till it came to his having them entirely. He always took great pains with them, and there was a fellow-feeling between him and them that could hardly be with <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>person.</b> I said all this--too strongly, most likely--and the Rector put in a mild word, as to his goodness in coming at all. Smith thought there was nothing wonderful in liking what ministered to his conceit; and at last it came out that a baker's boy had met Felix and Smith consecutively in the street, and only touched his hat to one, and that the wrong one.' ...|$|E
