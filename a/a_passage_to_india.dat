25|$|In {{the years}} after her last stage {{appearance}} Ashcroft made occasional, but highly successful, television and film appearances. For The Jewel in the Crown she won a BAFTA award for best actress in 1984, and for her portrayal of Mrs Moore in David Lean's 1985 film <b>A</b> <b>Passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India</b> she won another BAFTA best actress award and the 1985 Oscar for best supporting actress.

25|$|There {{followed}} another comic novel, A Saturday Life (1925), {{and then}} Adam's Breed (1926), {{a novel about}} an Italian headwaiter who, becoming disgusted with his job and even with food itself, gives away his belongings and lives as a hermit in the forest. The book's mystical themes have been compared to Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha. It sold well, was critically acclaimed, and won both the Prix Femina and the James Tait Black Prize, a feat previously achieved only by E. M. Forster's <b>A</b> <b>Passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India.</b>|$|E

25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} <b>A</b> <b>Passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India,</b> the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Ray wrote {{a script}} {{for a film}} to be called The Alien, based on his short story [...] "Bankubabur Bandhu" [...] ("Banku Babu's Friend"), which he wrote in 1962 for Sandesh, the Ray family magazine. Columbia Pictures was the {{producer}} for what was a planned US-India co-production, and Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers were cast as the leading actors. Ray found that his script had been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Mike Wilson. Wilson had initially approached Ray through their mutual friend, Arthur C. Clarke, to represent him in Hollywood. Wilson copyrighted the script credited to Mike Wilson & Satyajit Ray, although he contributed only one word. Ray later said that he never received a penny for the script. After Brando {{dropped out of the}} project, the project tried to replace him with James Coburn, but Ray became disillusioned and returned to Calcutta. Columbia expressed interest in reviving the project several times in the 1970s and 1980s, but nothing came of it. When E.T. was released in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similarities in the film to his earlier Alien script. Ray claimed that this film plagiarized his script. Ray said that Steven Spielberg's movie [...] "would not have been possible without my script of 'The Alien' being available throughout America in mimeographed copies." [...] Spielberg denied any plagiarism by saying, [...] "I was a kid in high school when this script was circulating in Hollywood." [...] (Spielberg actually graduated high school in 1965 and released his first film in 1968). Besides The Alien, two other unrealised projects that Ray had intended to direct were adaptations of the ancient Indian epic, the Mahābhārata, and E. M. Forster's 1924 novel <b>A</b> <b>Passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India.</b>|$|E

50|$|On 1 June, the Pakistani {{occupation}} army took hostage 185 Marwari {{men to the}} Saidpur cantonment. The Pakistanis {{were led}} by local Bihari leaders. Major Gul of the Pakistani occupation army employed them in renovation of the Saidpur airbase and digging trenches for military purposes. A few days later, Major Gul stated that he would send them <b>to</b> <b>India</b> though the border outpost at Haldibari.

They rushed to their houses in the joy of freedom and soon returned with their families. The Pakistani soldiers and the Bihari Muslims segregated the crowd into men and women. A special train had arrived at the Saidpur railway station at 8 A.M. They were boarded into separate compartments, two each for the men and the women. The doors and the windows were locked from inside. While boarding no less 20 married and unmarried women were detained by the Pakistani soldiers and later taken to the Saidpur cantonment.|$|R
2500|$|Sir Alec Guinness, [...] (born Alec Guinness de Cuffe, 2 April 1914– 5 August 2000) was an English actor. After {{an early}} career on the stage, Guinness was {{featured}} {{in several of the}} Ealing Comedies, including The Ladykillers and Kind Hearts and Coronets in which he played nine different characters. He is also known for his six collaborations with David Lean: Herbert Pocket in Great Expectations (1946), Fagin in Oliver Twist (1948), Col. Nicholson in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor), Prince Faisal in Lawrence of Arabia (1962), General Yevgraf Zhivago in Doctor Zhivago (1965), and Professor Godbole in <b>A</b> <b>Passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India</b> (1984). He is also known for his portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi in George Lucas's original Star Wars trilogy, receiving a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.|$|E
2500|$|Guinness won {{particular}} acclaim for {{his work}} with director David Lean, which today is his most critically acclaimed work. After appearing in Lean's Great Expectations and Oliver Twist, {{he was given a}} starring role opposite William Holden in The Bridge on the River Kwai. For his performance as Colonel Nicholson, the unyielding British POW commanding officer, Guinness won an Academy Award for Best Actor and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Despite a difficult and often hostile relationship, Lean, referring to Guinness as [...] "my good luck charm", continued to cast Guinness in character roles in his later films: Arab leader Prince Feisal in Lawrence of Arabia; the title character's half-brother, Bolshevik leader Yevgraf, in Doctor Zhivago and Indian mystic Professor Godbole in <b>A</b> <b>Passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India.</b> He was also offered a role in Lean's Ryan's Daughter (1970) but declined. At that time, Guinness [...] "mistrusted" [...] Lean and considered the formerly close relationship to be strained—although, at his funeral, he recalled that the famed director had been [...] "charming and affable". Guinness appeared in five Lean films that were ranked in the British Film Institute's top 50 greatest British films of the 20th century: 3rd (Lawrence of Arabia), 5th (Great Expectations), 11th (The Bridge on the River Kwai), 27th (Doctor Zhivago) and 46th (Oliver Twist).|$|E

50|$|The main {{market for}} the food at this stage was the British Army and Royal Navy. By 1817 Donkin {{recorded}} that he had sold £3000 worth of canned meat in six months. In 1824 Sir William Edward Parry took canned beef and pea soup with him on his voyage to the Arctic in HMS Fury, during his search for <b>a</b> northwestern <b>passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India.</b> In 1829, Admiral Sir James Ross also took canned food to the Arctic, as did Sir John Franklin in 1845. Some of his stores were found by the search expedition led by Captain (later Admiral Sir) Leopold McLintock in 1857. One of these cans was opened in 1939, and was edible and nutritious, {{though it was not}} analysed for contamination by the lead solder used in its manufacture.|$|R
50|$|Imperialism in Asia traces {{its roots}} {{back to the}} late 15th century {{with a series of}} voyages that sought <b>a</b> sea <b>passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India</b> in the hope of {{establishing}} direct trade between Europe and Asia in spices. Before 1500 European economies were largely self-sufficient, only supplemented by minor trade with Asia and Africa. Within the next century, however, European and Asian economies were slowly becoming integrated through the rise of new global trade routes; and the early thrust of European political power, commerce, and culture in Asia gave rise to a growing trade in lucrative commodities—a key development in the rise of today's modern world capitalist economy. European colonies in India were set up by several European nations beginning {{at the beginning of the}} 16th century. Rivalry between reigning European powers saw the entry of the Dutch, British and French among others.|$|R
60|$|Such was {{the swarm}} of Spanish expeditions {{immediately}} {{resulting from the}} enterprises of Columbus; but others were also undertaken by foreign nations. In the year 1497, Sebastian Cabot, son of a Venetian merchant resident in Bristol, sailing {{in the service of}} Henry VII of England, navigated to the northern seas of the New World. Adopting the idea of Columbus, he sailed in quest of the shores of Cathay, and hoped <b>to</b> find <b>a</b> northwest <b>passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India.</b> In this voyage he discovered Newfoundland, coasted Labrador to the fifty-sixth degree of north latitude, and then returning, ran down southwest to the Floridas, when, his provisions beginning to fail, he returned to England. [98] But vague and scanty accounts of this voyage exist, which was important as including the first discovery of the northern continent of the New World.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of the Raj films produced in Britain during the 1980 s, namely: Heat and Dust (Ivory, 1982), Gandhi (Attenborough, 1982) and <b>A</b> <b>Passage</b> and <b>to</b> <b>India</b> (Lean, 1984), and the TV series The Jewel in the Crown (1982) and The Far Pavilions (1984). As a genre, this kind of film has often been accused of promoting an old-fashioned notion of British identity, based on those Victorian values of the past. On the other hand, I believe that a close analysis of the films may reveal a certain degree of criticism of the past as well as traces of dissatisfaction with the present, especially in terms of ethnic and gender relationships. Hence, what I try to demonstrate, or rather explore, is the presence of different discourses in these productions, their complexity and ambivalence and their cultural importance in both reflecting and constructing – or refracting – the social reality of their historical context...|$|R

50|$|In April 1971, {{a member}} of the Razakar forces, Kenan Uddin Sarkar of Ramchandrapur village under Parbatipur {{sub-division}} of Dinajpur district, assured 50 Hindu families of neighbouring Badarganj, Kholahati, Birampur, Aftabganj and Sherpur of <b>a</b> safe <b>passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India.</b> He kept the Hindus confined at a place called Baraihat in present-day Phulbari Upazila. The Razakars and the Al-Badr militia looted the money and jewelry from Hindus during their confinement. After that another Razakar, an associate of Kenan Uddin Sarkar informed the Pakistani army. The Pakistani army took the hostage Hindus to Akhira, 100 metres from south of Baraihat. It was about 11 A.M. The Hindus were made to stand in a row beside a pond, the men in one line and the women and children in another. They were burst fired from machine guns. A few children and teenagers who were survived the burst fire, were bayonetted to death. According to eye witness account, after gunning down the men, the Pakistani soldiers turned their attention to the females, and brutally gang raped them at that spot. After the victory in the Liberation War, the local people executed Kenan Uddin Sarkar by the method of Jabiha.|$|R

The Indian population totaled 1,207, of whom only 251 were still indentured by the end of 1867. Only the Indian workers that had arrived on board the Ulysses had not completed their indenture period. The majority of the Indian workers who had completed their indenture period requested <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>India.</b> However, the Governor of Saint Lucia wanted them to remain in Saint Lucia and offered cash in exchange for forfeiting the right to return.

5000|$|Johanns {{was ordained}} priest on 1 August 1914 at Louvain, {{three days before}} World War I broke out and Germany invaded Belgium. He had studied {{philosophy}} under the prestigious metaphysician and mystic, Pierre Scheuer. Johanns' superior intelligence, nearing genius, had been recognized and he was destined to further studies while awaiting <b>a</b> still impeded <b>passage</b> <b>to</b> <b>India.</b> He took <b>a</b> full Licentiate in Philosophy from the Catholic University of Leuven (Belgium), and was then sent to Oxford {{as soon as the}} end of the war permitted it, in 1919. To evaluate his doctoral dissertation on [...] "The Agent Intellect in the Western and Eastern Philosophies," [...] Oxford University could not find suitable examiners, and had to have recourse to Cambridge. From there came the extraordinary verdict: [...] "only once in a hundred years does one meet such an intellect." [...] Oxford gave him the doctorate with the highest honours and offered him, despite his being a Roman Catholic and Jesuit, a professorship. But his call was for Calcutta, which he reached in November 1921. He taught philosophy at St. Xavier's College, Calcutta, at St Mary's, the Jesuit theologate at Kurseong, Darjeeling, and even in a Vaisnava monastery. He studied ever more deeply the Hindu tradition. Because he always approached the Real in terms of Value, he felt attuned to the aims and methods of Vedanta. As early as October 1922, he and another Oxford graduate and Jesuit confrere, Georges Dandoy, started The Light of the East, a monthly directed to the Hindu intelligentsia as an instrument of interfaith reflection and dialogue. His contributions amounted to 216, 146 of which constitute the work To Christ through the Vedanta. In 1938 ill health forced him to go back to Belgium, where he nevertheless founded an [...] "Indian Juniorate" [...] which, until 1955, would train young Jesuits for work in Bengal.|$|R
