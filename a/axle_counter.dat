They are linked by LAN or cables to the interlocking system {{from which they}} receive indications of switch positions, signal indications, and track circuit or <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> occupancy. Finally, the route center's computers communicates with controlled trains via the cable loops previously described.|$|E
50|$|Axle {{counters}} {{can be used}} {{in conjunction}} with the WIPD ™ device to correlate the faulty wheel with the train <b>axle</b> <b>counter.</b> <b>Axle</b> <b>counter</b> assemblies can be bolted or clamped to the rail.|$|E
50|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> {{are used}} in rail yards to detect train cars as they are sorted. <b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> are placed on the track before each switch and on each track that exits the switch. Rail yard {{management}} software uses occupancy data from the <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> to lock in switches and prevent cars from being routed to tracks that are occupied by other cars.|$|R
50|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> are {{particularly}} useful on electrified railways as they eliminate traction bonding and impedance bonds. <b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> require no bonding and less cabling {{in comparison to}} track circuits, and are therefore generally less expensive to install and maintain.|$|R
50|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> {{are also}} useful in {{instances}} {{where there are}} issues with water on the track. Generally wheel sensors work under water, {{as long as the}} wiring is above the water. <b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> do not suffer problems with railhead contamination, e.g. due to rust, grease or compacted leaf residue. Sometimes a train puts down anti-slip sand to increase the deceleration while using a emergency brake, but the sand contaminates the rail and the track circuit stops working. <b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> are immune to these problems because they do not rely on the contact of wheel with the rail head to provide an electrical circuit.|$|R
5000|$|Preparatory reset - Once a preparatory reset {{is applied}} to the system, the <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> {{continues}} to show the section as occupied until one train movement takes place in the section. Logically, if a train has successfully traversed the section, then the section is clear and the <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> is set back to unoccupied.|$|E
50|$|The first US {{patent for}} an <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> was filed on 3 June 1960 by Ernst Hofstetter and Kurt Haas.|$|E
50|$|Another {{alternative}} is the <b>axle</b> <b>counter,</b> which {{can reduce the}} number of track circuits and thus the number of insulated rail joints required.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are four}} methods of {{securing}} the reset and restoration of <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> into service: ...|$|R
50|$|Track {{circuits}} in {{the tunnel}} had problems because of wetness; in 2015 these were replaced with <b>axle</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|R
50|$|TCOCs are {{ineffective}} where {{train detection}} {{is not by}} means of track circuits, such as <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> or treadles.|$|R
5000|$|... {{technicians}} in {{the relay}} room at Severn Tunnel Junction had reset the <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> while investigating the earlier fault, thus clearing the signal for the Sprinter.|$|E
50|$|An {{electronic}} treadle uses {{the disruption of}} an electromagnetic field to detect an axle, rather than a depression bar. Hence, it can count individual axles. Electronic count heads are used in <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> circuits that can replace track circuits completely.|$|E
50|$|The {{two main}} methods of {{mounting}} an <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> is firstly drilling through the rail, this {{is seen as}} time consuming and possible damaging to the rail. However this {{eliminates the need for}} leveling which can help reduce maintenance costs.|$|E
5000|$|Level 3: As level 2, but train {{location}} and train integrity supervision no longer rely on trackside {{equipment such as}} track circuits or <b>axle</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Besides its {{signalling}} solutions, Thales additionally develops electronic interlocking systems, <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> {{that can}} replace track circuits, {{various types of}} point machines, and railway worker protection systems.|$|R
50|$|Unlike track circuits, <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> do {{not require}} {{insulated}} rail joints to be installed. This avoids breaking the continuity of long welded rails for insulated joints to be inserted.|$|R
50|$|Axle {{counters}} {{are used}} {{in places such as}} wet tunnels (such as the Severn Tunnel), where ordinary track circuits are unreliable. Axle counters are also useful on steel structures (such as the Forth Bridge), which may prevent the normal operation of track circuits if insulating the rails from the structure proves impracticable. Axle counters are also useful on long sections where several intermediate track circuits may be saved. A Thales <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> sensor, for example, can be 10,500 m from the evaluation unit when connected using the ISDN communication only, but with the addition of an Ethernet converter the distance is limited by the transmission system, while the latest ALTPRO <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> sensor model ZK24 can be up to 49 km from the evaluation unit.|$|E
50|$|Axle {{counters}} may 'forget' {{how many}} axles {{are in a}} section for various reasons such as a power failure. A manual override is therefore necessary to reset the system. This manual override introduces the human element which may be unreliable. An accident occurred in the Severn Tunnel and {{is thought to be}} due to improper restoration of an <b>axle</b> <b>counter.</b> This, however, was not proven during the subsequent inquiry. In older installations the evaluators may use eight-bit logic, causing numerical overflow when a train with 256 axles passes the <b>axle</b> <b>counter.</b> As a result, this train will not be detected. This imposes a length limit of 255 axles on each train. Modern systems are not restricted by train wheel numbers.|$|E
50|$|Where {{there are}} {{interlocked}} turnouts, an <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> unit {{needs to be}} provided for each leg of that turnout. On lines with non-interlocked/hand operated switches, detection of the switch points would have to be monitored separately, whereas on track circuited lines misaligned points can be set to automatically break the track circuit.|$|E
25|$|The line {{past the}} station {{received}} automatic train stop and {{centralized traffic control}} on 12 and 14 December 1993, respectively. The station received <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> instead of track circuits in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Since CAWS is {{dependent}} on track circuits for its operation, it cannot be applied where <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> are used for train detection (i.e., [...] "mini-CTC" [...] areas) without the additional cost.|$|R
40|$|Tests {{performed}} by Deutsche Bahn AG {{have shown that}} eddy-current brake introduced in modern high speed trains disturb signals of <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> causing excess <b>axle</b> counts. Apart from design modifications at the eddy-current brake, it was also considered to improve the <b>axle</b> <b>counter's</b> detection mechanism. In a project at IITB a patent pending mechanism based on pattern recognition methods was developed to differentiate the signal patterns of wheels and eddy-current brake. Pattern recognition was necessary, because due {{to a wide range}} of train velocities and wheel diameters, only the general shape of signals remains sufficiently constant to be recognized...|$|R
50|$|The {{load cells}} {{can also be}} used as a {{rudimentary}} <b>axle</b> <b>counter.</b> Load cells can also take the place of the seismic elements to measure the seismic phase impulses as opposed to using MEMS or piezoelectric type seismic sensors. Load cell assemblies can be bolted, clamped or strain gauges might be glued directly to rail.|$|E
50|$|The {{computers}} are programmed with fixed {{information from the}} route such as speed limits, gradients, and thelocation of block boundaries, switches, and signals. They are linked by LAN or cables to the interlocking system from which they receive indications of switch positions, signal indications, and track circuit or <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> occupancy. Finally, the route center's computers communicates with controlled trains via the cable loops previously described.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} reasons why a driver would be {{required}} to pass a signal at danger with authority, such as track circuit or <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> failure. The driver will have been advised by the signaller to pass the signal at danger, proceeding with caution and being prepared to stop short of any obstruction and to obey all other signals. Immediately before moving, the driver will press the [...] "Trainstop Override" [...] button on the TPWS panel to pass the signal without triggering a TPWS brake demand.|$|E
25|$|Høn became unstaffed on 1 January 1971. The line {{past the}} station {{received}} automatic train stop and {{centralized traffic control}} on 12 and 14 December 1993, respectively. The station received <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> instead of track circuits in 2012.|$|R
50|$|The WIPD ™ {{systems are}} used in {{combination}} with seismic sensors, RFID, High Speed Cameras, Weighing load cells, <b>Axle</b> <b>Counters,</b> thermal imaging (FLIR) and post processing computers connected wired or wirelessly to enhance the results provided by the WIPD ™ device.|$|R
5000|$|Because track {{circuits}} were unreliable in the unusually wet tunnel environment (10 to 20 {{million gallons of}} water are pumped out per day), <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> were used instead. The official report into the accident could not reach a firm conclusion, but speculated that the cause was either: ...|$|R
50|$|On 2 March 1972 a through {{freight train}} (Dg 6563) ran through Ingolstadt Hbf at about 60 km/h and {{collided}} with a loaded tanker train (Üg 18263). This stood {{at the entrance of}} the station and had no rear lighting. Due to an <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> fault on the signalling block, the dispatcher had to manually intervene and mistakenly directed the through freight train on to the track occupied by Üg 18263. As a result of the collision, the 20 wagons of the tanker train exploded in fire. The drivers of the colliding train and two residents of a nearby signalman’s house were killed. The dispatcher who had caused the accident committed suicide a few hours after the accident. Due to the complicated salvage, the adjacent neighbourhood had to be evacuated.|$|E
50|$|An <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> is {{a device}} on a railway that detects {{the passing of}} a train between two points on a track. A {{counting}} head (or 'detection point') is installed {{at each end of}} the section, and as each train axle passes the counting head at the start of the section, a counter increments. A detection point comprises two independent sensors, therefore the device can detect the direction and speed of a train by the order and time in which the sensors are passed. As the train passes a similar counting head at the end of the section, the counter compares count at the end of the section with that recorded at the beginning. If the two counts are the same, the section is presumed to be clear for a second train.|$|E
30|$|Traffic Management Systems (TMS) provide {{movement}} {{authority to the}} trains with a guaranteed increased level of safety and capacity utilization. All signalling systems continuously communicate with the interlocking systems {{in order to get}} the information about track circuits or <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> and route status [39].|$|E
50|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> {{are also}} used for the {{switching}} on and switching off of railway crossings. Closing the crossing to pedestrian and motor vehicles when {{the presence of a}} train is detected, and allowing them to open back up when the successful traverse of the train has been recorded.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic brakes {{are used}} {{on high speed}} \ higher speed trains (maximum speed greater than 160 km/h (99.4 mph)). These are {{physically}} large pieces of metal mounted on the bogie of the vehicle, only a few centimetres above the track. They can sometimes be mistakenly detected by <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> as another <b>axle.</b> This can happen only {{on one side of}} a track block, because of magnetic field curvature, defects of track geometry, or other issues, leading the signalling system into confusion and also requiring reset of the detection memory. Modern <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> are 'eddy current' brake proof and the magnetic effect of the braking system as described above is overcome, therefore count information remains stable even when a vehicle fitted with magnetic brakes is braking whilst traversing the rail contacts of a detection point.|$|R
25|$|When {{insulated}} {{to prevent}} conduction through the ties, steel ties {{may be used}} with track circuit based train detection and track integrity systems. Without insulation, steel ties may only be used on lines without block signaling and level crossings or on lines that use other forms of train detection such as <b>axle</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|R
