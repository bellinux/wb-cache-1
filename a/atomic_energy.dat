On the committee's own recommendation, it was superseded by the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Policy Committee in April 1952. This in turn was replaced by the Australian <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Commission (AAEC) in November. The AAEC was run by a three commissioners, with Jack Stevens as chairman, Baxter as vice-chairman and Hugh Murray from the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company as the third member.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of intramolecular <b>atomic</b> <b>energies</b> and charges, obtained from QTAIM, strongly and unambiguously {{suggests that the}} most stable HL+ form of a linear triamine H 2 N(CH 2) 2 NH(CH 2) 3 NH 2 (L) has the secondary nitrogen atom protonated, contradicting earlier reports. This {{is supported by the}} G(aq) value (at the RX 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory in solvent, CPCM/UAKS) which is lower by about 4 kcal mol– 1 (equivalent to three log units of a protonation constant log KH) when compared with remaining HL+ tautomers. The most stable H 2 L 2 + form of L found from QTAIM has two terminal nitrogen atoms protonated, which is in agreement with the existing views. A new rule governing the protonation sequence of linear polyamines is proposed stating that at thermodynamic equilibrium the protonation sequence in a solution results in the formation of tautomers which (i) minimizes the differences in the <b>atomic</b> <b>energies</b> and net <b>atomic</b> charges of both terminal atoms, N and C, in all partially protonated forms, HL+ and H 2 L 2 +, and (ii) have a symmetrical distribution of the <b>atomic</b> <b>energies</b> and net <b>atomic</b> charges on the terminal fragments –CH 2 –NH 2 of a linear molecule. Several conditions, involving the <b>atomic</b> <b>energies</b> and charges of the terminal N- and carbon atoms, are defined and incorporated in a protocol which results in a definite prediction of the protonation sequence of linear aliphatic triamines.

5|$|The May-Johnson bill soon {{ran into}} difficulties. Although the Interim Committee was {{discharged}} in November, it met {{one more time}} in December to discuss amendments to the May-Johnson bill. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative Senate bill on <b>atomic</b> <b>energy,</b> which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of <b>atomic</b> <b>energy,</b> although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control of <b>atomic</b> <b>energy.</b> In 1946, several major revisions were made to the McMahon bill in order to appease the more conservative elements in the Senate. The resulting bill passed both the Senate and the House without major modifications. On August 1, 1946, Truman signed the McMahon bill into law as the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Act of 1946.|$|E
5|$|This was at {{odds with}} the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and {{resulted}} in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on the nuclear weapons program. In 1953 the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> for consideration. After some debate, this resulted in the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Act of 1954.|$|E

Our numerical studies focus on Ne and Kr in this paper, but apply in principle to all other rare gases lacking hyperfine structure. These diatomic potentials are essential for applications in which homonuclear rare-gas pairs interact at large internuclear separations, greater than about 20 Bohr radii. Among such applications are the study of cold atomic collisions and photoassociative spectroscopy...|$|R

50|$|The excimer {{formation}} {{is a critical}} step in energy-efficient conversion of the <b>atomic</b> electron excitation/ionization <b>energy</b> into the radiation energy in rare gas plasma for the excimer lasers.

A comparison between the <b>atomic</b> kinetic <b>energies</b> measured by the two methods on the same samples is made. Some results are also compared with calculated <b>atomic</b> kinetic <b>energies</b> obtained using the harmonic approximation where the vibrational frequencies were taken from IR/Raman optical measurements.

40|$|We show in {{this note}} how many {{electron}} irreducible {{representations of the}} Lorentz group L can be {{expressed in terms of}} the sums of Slater determinants and principal minors. In this way the full configuration wave function of quantum chemistry is derived without any appeal to the Schrodinger equation and Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In particular the number n of exchange-correlations between the orbiting electrons and those in the nucleus may be calculated and therefore the ground state electronic exchange-correlation energy E readily obtained by dividing the <b>atomic</b> <b>energies</b> by n. Comparison with measured <b>atomic</b> <b>energies</b> yields values of E very close to - 1 hartrees for the 3 neutral atoms Be, B, and C. This tallies within a few percent with the best available E estimates. Although calculations were performed for only 3 atoms the method is perfectly general, however because E is estimated for metals only, gases are not considered in this paper. The intimate relationship with density function theory is discussed in the conclusion. Comment: 7 pages, 2 tables, LaTeX format, to be submitted for publicatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{attack of}} {{lithium-ion}} battery cathodes by stray aqueous HF, with resultant dissolution, protonation, and possibly other unintended reactions, {{can be a}} significant source of capacity fade. We explore the calculation of reaction free energies of lithium cobaltate in acid by a “hybrid” method, in which solid-phase free energies are calculated from first principles at the generalized gradient approximation + intrasite coulomb interaction (GGA+U) level and tabulated values of ionization potentials and hydration energies are employed for the aqueous species. Analysis of the dissolution of the binary oxides Li 2 O and CoO suggests that the <b>atomic</b> <b>energies</b> for Co and Li should be shifted from values calculated by first principles to yield accurate reaction free energies within the hybrid method. With the shifted <b>atomic</b> <b>energies,</b> the hybrid method was applied to analyze proton-promoted dissolution and protonation reactions of LiCoO 2 in aqueous acid. Reaction free energies for the dissolution reaction, the reaction to form Co 3 O 4 spinel, and the proton-for-lithium exchange reaction are obtained and compared to empirical values. An extension of the present treatment to consider partial reactions is proposed, with a view to investigating interfacial and environmental effects on the dissolution reaction...|$|R
