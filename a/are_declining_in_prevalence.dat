40|$|Research in {{causation}} {{of cancer}} {{is an important}} part of cancer research in general and is an essential prerequisite for cancer prevention. The effective primary prevention is not visible without evidence based knowledge in the causation of cancer in humans. There is sufficient evidence that certain life style and environment factors cause cancer in humans. These factors include: smoking and other types of tobacco consumption, overweight and obesity, lack of physical activity, diet rich in processed meat and poor in vegetables and fruits, certain types of viral and bacterial infection, ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation, ambient air pollution, carcinogens at workplace, exogenous hormones. Cancer mortality is decreasing in majority of developed countries, including Russia. This mortality trend is mostly due to decrease in incidence and death rates of lung and other smoking related cancers and <b>is</b> caused by <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> smoking <b>prevalence</b> and change <b>in</b> tar content of cigarette smoke. In Russia trend in mortality from all cancers is as well determined by decrease in incidence and mortality from gastric cancer, which <b>is</b> due to <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>prevalence</b> of Helicobacter pylori infection and improvement of diet, increase in consumption of fruits and vegetables. Thus the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> cancer mortality <b>is</b> mostly the result of primary prevention which is the most effective avenue of cancer control.  </p...|$|R

In recent times, there has <b>been</b> a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the <b>prevalence</b> of atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis –related deaths possibly due to effective management of the risk factors that predispose to this disorder. The major identified risk factors are elevated LDL-cholesterol, reduced HDL-cholesterol [26] hypertension and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [27]. Lowering of serum lipid concentrations, particularly LDL and VLDL fractions is therefore considered {{as one of the}} strategies that can delay the on-set of chronic disorders associated with hyperlipidemia in humans.

TLS was used to collect information as a second cross-sectional survey to an earlier TLS assessment. Data on behavior (e. g., sexual history and sexual behavior) were analyzed. Blood specimens were drawn for HIV and syphilis testing. To determine the changes <b>in</b> the <b>prevalence</b> of HIV and syphilis, we analyzed these results and compared them to the results of our first survey. A total of 965 participants were recruited, including 489 MSWs and 476 ncMSM. Overall, the prevalence of HIV was 9. 7 %: 2. 9 % for MSWs and 16. 8 % for ncMSM (P< 0. 001). 10. 9 % of the 965 participants tested positive for syphilis: 4. 5 % among MSWs and 17. 4 % among ncMSM (P< 0. 001). The HIV <b>prevalence</b> <b>in</b> MSWs decreased from 4. 5 % in 2008 to 2. 9 % in 2014 (P = 0. 143) but increased in ncMSM (7. 0 % in 2008 vs 16. 8 % in 2014, P< 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{introduce}} the uncommonly used Co-Plot method which is called the multivariate graphical analysis and to apply this method to a data set including tobacco control in European region. METHODS: This study uses the data from the World Health Organization database according to Human Development Index of European countries. It takes into account variables such as smoking <b>prevalence</b> <b>in</b> young people and adults, the proportion of smoking-related deaths and domestic legislations cases pertaining to tobacco products and analyses the data using the Co-Plot method. RESULTS: Results of the study demonstrated that smoking prevalence and restrictions on advertising of tobacco products were highly negatively correlated. The proportion of deaths associated with smoking-related diseases increased parallel to the increase <b>in</b> the smoking <b>prevalence</b> <b>in</b> young people and adults. Norway, France and Finland have enforced legal limitations on direct and indirect advertising, and thus there has <b>been</b> a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> smoking <b>prevalence</b> among young people and adults. In some countries, including Ireland, Italy and Serbia, the prevalence of smoking among the young has decreased due to the new or increased legal restrictions on the sale distribution of tobacco products. The governments in the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Estonia, Croatia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Poland have placed restrictions on direct and indirect advertising. The distribution of other causes-related deaths and lung cancer-related deaths are high. CONCLUSION: The restrictions on tobacco products were tightened in time with the increased prevalence of smoking and proportion of smoking-related deaths. It can be said that the significant relationships identified in this study have even more pertinence in developed countries. Consequently, Co-Plot method has enabled deeper data interpretations of the relationships between the countries and the variables in this study...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} oral health status and coherent determinants in children and adolescents with foreign background compared to children with Swedish background. Methods: In 1993 and 2003 cross-sectional studies with random samples of individuals in the age groups 3 -, 5 -, 10 - and 15 -years were performed in Jönköping, Sweden. All individuals were personally invited to a clinical and radiographic examination of oral health status. They were also asked about their attitudes and knowledge about teeth and oral health care habits. The final study cohort comprised 739 children and adolescents, 154 with Foreign background (F-cohort) and 585 with Swedish background (S-cohort). Results: Both in 1993 and 2003 more 3 - and 5 -year-olds in the S-cohort were caries-free compared to the F-cohort. In 1993 dfs/DFS was higher among 3 - and 5 -year-olds in the F-cohort (p= 0. 01). In 2003 dfs/DFS was significantly higher in all age groups in the F-cohort compared to the S-cohort. The cumulative percentage of proximal caries-free, initial and manifest lesions and restorations among 10 -year-olds in the F-cohort were in 1993 55 %, 23 %, 4 % and 18 %. The corresponding figures for the S-cohort were 69 %, 20 %, 6 % and 5 %, respectively. In 2003 figures in the F-cohort were 54 %, 29 %, 4 % and 13 % compared to 82 %, 12 %, 1 % and 5 % in the S-cohort (p= 0. 037). Among males with foreign background and lived in families with low education, the odds was four times higher (OR= 4. 0 + 95 %CI; 2. 2 - 7. 2) to be exposed to dental caries, then among their Swedish counterparts. Conclusions: There had <b>been</b> a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> caries <b>prevalence</b> between 1993 and 2003 in all age-groups except among the 3 -year-olds.

Here, we report findings four years after vaccination. PCV- 7 was given to all children below 30 months of age enrolled in the trial and to those born during its course in all study villages. Villages were randomized (older children and adults) to receive PCV- 7 (wholly vaccinated villages) or serogroup-C-meningococcal-conjugate-vaccine (partly vaccinated villages). Cross-sectional surveys (CSS) to collect nasopharyngeal swabs were conducted before and at various intervals after vaccination. Sixteen of these randomized villages (8 wholly vaccinated and 8 partly vaccinated) participated in a CSS conducted four years after vaccination started. Four years after vaccination, the prevalence of VT pneumococcal carriage was slightly higher in partly than in wholly vaccinated villages [6. 4 % versus 3. 9 % (p =  0. 120) ] compared to 24. 4 % in the pre-vaccination CSS (p< 0. 001). Prevalence of NVT four years after vaccination was similar between study groups [32. 7 % versus 29. 8 % (p =  0. 392), respectively] compared to 51. 1 % in the pre-vaccination CSS (p< 0. 001). Four years after vaccination started, lower prevalence of serotype 6 A was detected in wholly vaccinated than in partly vaccinated villages (1. 6 % versus 3. 5 %, p =  0. 093) whilst the prevalence of serotype 19 A was similar between groups (2. 9 % versus 2. 5 %, p =  0. 779). The most prevalent serotype 19 A clone was ST 847. The most prevalent serotype 6 A clone before vaccination was ST 3324 whilst after vaccination ST 913 and ST 1737 predominated. Fourteen out of 26 STs detected among the serotype 6 A isolates were new while no new 19 A serotype ST <b>was</b> found.

Methods An analytical framework based on the Avahan evaluation design was used, addressing assessment questions on program implementation, intermediate outcomes and association of outcomes with Avahan. Data from routine program monitoring, two rounds of cross-sectional Integrated Behavioural and Biological Assessments (IBBAs) conducted in 2006 (Round 1 - R 1) and 2009 (Round 2 – R 2) and quality assessments of program clinics were used. Bi-variate and multivariate analysis were conducted using the complex samples module in SPSS 15 ® (IBM, Somers NY). Results The Avahan program achieved coverage of over 66 % of FSWs within four years of implementation. The IBBA data showed increased contact by peers in R 2 compared to R 1 (AOR: 2. 34; p= 0. 001). Reported condom use with clients increased in R 2 and number of FSWs reporting zero unprotected sex acts increased from 76. 2 % (R 1) to 94. 6 % (R 2) [AOR: 5. 1, p= 0. 001]. Significant <b>declines</b> <b>were</b> observed <b>in</b> <b>prevalence</b> of syphilis (RPR) (15. 8 % to 10. 8 %; AOR: 0. 54; p= 0. 001), chlamydia (8 % to 6. 2 %; AOR:. 0. 65; p= 0. 010) and gonorrohoea (7. 4 % to 3. 9; AOR:. 0. 60; p= 0. 026) between R 1 and R 2. HIV prevalence increased (25. 8 % to 27. 5 %; AOR: 1. 29; p= 0. 04). District-wise analysis showed <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> three districts and increase in Mumbai and Thane districts. FSWs exposed to Avahan had higher consistent condom use with occasional (94. 3 % vs. 90. 6 %; AOR: 1. 55; p= 0. 04) and regular clients (92. 5 % vs. 86. 0 %; AOR: 1. 95, p= 0. 001) compared to FSWs unexposed to Avahan. <b>Decline</b> <b>in</b> high titre syphilis was associated with Avahan exposure. Conclusion The Avahan program was scaled up and achieved high coverage of FSWs in Maharashtra amidst multiple intervention players. Avahan coverage of FSWs was associated with improved safe sexual practices and <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> STIs. <b>Prevalence</b> of HIV increased requiring more detailed understanding of the data and, if confirmed, new approaches for HIV control. </p...|$|R

INTRODUCTION One principal aim of tobacco control programs is the prevention of smoking initiation. Adolescent smoking prevalence peaked during the 1940 s for males and during the early 1970 s for females. Since the 1940 s, there has <b>been</b> a substantial <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> smoking <b>prevalence</b> among adoles-cent males.

40|$|AbstractEvidence {{suggests}} substantial <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> HIV <b>prevalence</b> <b>in</b> {{parts of}} sub-Saharan Africa. However, the observed aggregate declines {{at the national}} level may obscure local variations in the temporal dynamics of the infection. Using spatial scan statistics, we identified marked spatial variability <b>in</b> the within-country <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> HIV <b>prevalence</b> <b>in</b> Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya, and Zimbabwe. Our study suggests that the <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> the national HIV <b>prevalence</b> <b>in</b> some of the SSA countries may not be representative of downward trends <b>in</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>in</b> areas of high HIV prevalence, as much as the result of sharp <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>in</b> areas of already low HIV prevalence.

40|$|Dental caries is {{the most}} common oral disease in the world, and in {{developed}} nations, it affects almost everyone. Worldwide, large variations in the trends with regard to the prevalence and the severity of dental caries have been reported. In South Africa, numerous studies to determine the caries prevalence and severity of different population groups have been carried out in the past. However, only three studies were conducted on a national scale; Williams in 19842 reported on the dental health status of 12 -year-old children representing the whole country, the National Department of Health conducted a National Oral Health Survey in 1988 / 19893 to determine the oral health status of adults and children in the five major metropolitan areas in South Africa, and the most recent National Oral Health Survey was conducted during the period July 1999 to June 20024 and was restricted to 4 - to 5 - year-, 6 -year-, 12 -year and 15 -year-old children in South Africa. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the trends <b>in</b> dental caries <b>prevalence</b> and severity amongst South African children over a period of time by comparing the results obtained from the 1982 / 1983 National Oral Health Survey with results obtained from the 1988 / 1989 National Oral Health Survey and/or with results obtained from the 1999 / 2002 National Oral Health Survey. The statistical methods employed, appeared to be useful to determine the trends <b>in</b> dental caries <b>prevalence</b> and severity amongst South African children, over the period 1982 to 2002, in selected (identified) geographical locations and also in terms of age, race and gender. Although it became evident, through this research, that there <b>is</b> a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the <b>prevalence</b> of dental caries amongst all the population groups, from 1982 to 2002, Coloured children presented with a relatively higher prevalence and severity of dental caries when compared with Asian, Black and White children in South Africa. The results mainly showed a higher prevalence and severity of dental caries in the primary than permanent dentition amongst 6 -year-old children; and there was also a significant increase <b>in</b> the <b>prevalence</b> and severity of dental caries from the 12 -year-old to the 15 -year-old group. Through this research, it became evident that there is higher dental caries prevalence and severity rates in the coastal regions (Metro Cape, Port Elizabeth and Durban) as compared to an interior region (Bloemfontein). It was also observed that although the severity (dmft/DMFT) of dental caries decreased during the past 20 years; the percentage of untreated caries in 12 -year and 15 -year-old children increased; however, at the same time the percentage of untreated caries in 6 -year-old children decreased. It was found that the number of filled teeth (FT) contributes the most to the caries experience amongst 12 -year- and 15 -year-old White children. However, more than 70 percent of dental caries, in 6 -year-, 12 -year- and 15 -year-old children, go untreated. These results obtained from this study entitled: Trends <b>in</b> dental caries <b>prevalence</b> and severity <b>in</b> South Africa; can be useful in attempting to design intervention strategies to address dental caries in South Africa.

40|$|The HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} in Kenya has been tracked through annual sentinel surveillance in antenatal clinics since 1990. The system started with 13 sites {{and now has}} over 35. Behaviours have been measured through national Demographic and Health Surveys in 1993, 1998, and 2003. The surveillance data indicate that prevalence has <b>declined</b> substantially starting <b>in</b> 1998 {{in five of the}} original 13 sites and starting in 2000 in another four sites. No <b>decline</b> <b>is</b> evident <b>in</b> the other five original sites although the 2004 estimate is the lowest recorded. Nationally, adult prevalence has declined from 10 % in the late 1990 s to under 7 % today. Surveys indicate that both age at first sex and use of condoms are rising and that the percentage of adults with multiple partners is falling. It is clear that HIV <b>prevalence</b> <b>is</b> now <b>declining</b> <b>in</b> Kenya in a pattern similar to that seen in Uganda but seven or eight years later. Although the coverage of preventive interventions has expanded rapidly since 2000 this expansion was too late to account for the beginnings of the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>prevalence.</b> More work <b>is</b> needed to understand fully the causes of this <b>decline,</b> but it <b>is</b> encouraging to see Kenya join the small list of countries experiencing significant <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> HIV <b>prevalence...</b>|$|R
