500|$|Lost Horizons {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, although several critics critiqued the album's near-constant mellowness. Stuart Mason of AllMusic called the album [...] "a delightful but slightly faceless blend of lounge pop, subtle beats, found sound, with mellow jazz influences." [...] A reviewer for Entertainment.ie praised the band for approaching electronica {{from a new}} angle, writing, [...] "this London-based duo employ Playschool pianos, acoustic guitars and sprightly beats to create laid-back instrumentals guaranteed to soothe even the most restless of souls. [...] What really marks Lemon Jelly as exciting new talents is their quirky sense of humour, which they use to brighten up their sound with skilful use of nursery rhymes, brass bands and offbeat samples. Pascal Wyse of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Everything is approachable and purely crafted, but Lost Horizons cheats banality with some choice quirks: Magnificent Seven strings, astronauts chatting, panoramic sound effects." [...] Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork felt that the album {{was a little too}} saccharine at times, but that it is [...] "the perfect disc to throw on <b>after</b> <b>your</b> four-disc Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix has put the whole party to sleep. It's like eight flavors of ribbon candy, beach balls hitting the ground like hail, and a big plastic clown face that blows helium." ...|$|E

500|$|A fourth 1928 novel, Ladies Almanack by the American writer Djuna Barnes, {{not only}} {{contains}} a character based on Radclyffe Hall but includes passages {{that may be}} a response to The Well. Ladies Almanack is a roman à clef of a lesbian literary and artistic circle in Paris, written in an archaic, Rabelaisian style and starring Natalie Barney as Dame Evangeline Musset. Much as Sir Phillip paces his study worrying about Stephen, Dame Musset's father [...] "pac his library in the most normal of Night-Shirts". When, unlike Sir Phillip, he confronts his daughter, she replies confidently: [...] "Thou, good Governor, wast expecting a Son when you lay atop of your Choosing... Am I not doing <b>after</b> <b>your</b> very Desire, and is it not the more commendable, seeing that I do it without the Tools for the Trade, and yet nothing complain?" [...] Ladies Almanack is far more overtly sexual than The Well; its cryptic style, full of in-jokes and ornate language, may have been intended to disguise its content from censors. It could not in any case be prosecuted by the Home Office, since it was published only in France, in a small, privately printed edition. It did not become widely available until 1972.|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally planned}} {{to add a}} feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, [...] "We thought about what people {{would want to do}} in order to survive. We explored different ideas, and one of them was fashioning weapons to defend yourself. That was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger." [...] Another cancelled feature was the alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was implemented at one point, it was eventually removed from the game because the developers felt it would change the course of the game in a [...] "weird" [...] direction. In addition, the developers considered the possibility for the game to be played from a third-person perspective, but then realised that it would significantly change the experience. Hope explained that it would become [...] "a game about jockeying the camera and looking <b>after</b> <b>your</b> avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move." [...] The actual development of the game took overall four years to complete after the Creative Assembly first pitched the idea to Sega. The game went gold on 9 September 2014 and is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer of the game, who died during its development.|$|E
500|$|On 7October 1942, Walters took {{command of}} a new formation, No.1 (Fighter) Wing, at RAAF Station Richmond. Established to boost the air defence {{capability}} of Australia's North-Western Area, the wing comprised three Supermarine Spitfire squadrons that had been transferred from Europe: No.54 Squadron RAF, No.452 Squadron RAAF and No.457 Squadron RAAF. With Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring flying ace of the war, as his wing leader, Walters began deploying aircraft and men to Darwin, Northern Territory, in December, providing a filip for morale in the region. Proudly declaring himself Australia's oldest fighter pilot, Walters was reported as taking every opportunity to join his men in the air. He flew as Caldwell's wingman in No.1 Wing's first major action against the Japanese over Darwin on 2May 1943. [...] Eight Spitfires crashed and several others made forced landings, {{for the destruction of}} one Japanese bomber and five fighters. Walters himself narrowly avoiding being shot down when he warned Caldwell of an attacking enemy fighter, to the detriment of his own safety. After they landed, Caldwell chided his commander, [...] "You silly old so-and-so. You want to look <b>after</b> <b>your</b> own skin instead of worrying about someone else's!" [...] On 20June, Walters participated in the wing's most successful combat against the Japanese to that time, personally accounting for one of fourteen raiders claimed by the Spitfires, for the loss of two of their own number. He posted out of Darwin a few days later, having earned the admiration of Caldwell {{and the rest of the}} wing's personnel.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave a mixed {{review of}} Most Wanted, stating that [...] "hardcore fans will be hard-pressed {{for a reason}} to add this to their collection" [...] and that the new songs—"Wake Up", [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] and [...] "Break My Heart"—"sound a bit like leftovers". Although he wrote that Most Wanted [...] "isn't a terrible album by any means, it's not {{particularly}} a good one, since Duff's two pop albums [...] have distinctive personalities that don't necessarily mesh together , and are both more fun than this." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com noted that the three new songs [...] "seem to be marking time instead of finding a new direction" [...] but said that [...] " [...] remaining bulk of this collection is strong." [...] Anthony Miccio, from the Baltimore City Paper, wrote that the album [...] "doesn't signify the closure of a brief career" [...] but is [...] "meant to satisfy an audience that won't be offended by the opportunity to buy their favorite songs again and again." [...] He noted that Duff's voice was not strong enough and stated that the [...] "rock tracks are surprisingly sluggish." [...] Talia Kraines of BBC Music commented that [...] "... there isn't enough here to warrant a purchase if you're already the owner of her back catalogue. But if you're <b>after</b> <b>your</b> first taste of Duff-flavoured pop to listen to in the background as you do your homework, then this album can do no harm." ...|$|E
500|$|Themes in Lavigne's music include {{messages}} of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. Lavigne believes her [...] "songs are about being yourself {{no matter what}} and going <b>after</b> <b>your</b> dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true." [...] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as [...] "Losing Grip", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as [...] "Complicated", saying that [...] "the songs I did with the Matrix... were good for my first record, but I don't {{want to be that}} pop anymore." [...] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that [...] "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about... Like boys, like dating or relationships". Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style. [...] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. [...] "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [...] Her objective in writing the album was simply to [...] "make it fun". The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as [...] "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". Ian McKellen defined her as [...] "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" [...] on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.|$|E
