Ethnic work culture ‘ewuh pakewuh’ is someone’s behavior of worrying his/her attitude or remark wiil offend other people. This research used qualitative approach. Informants are selected using purposive sampling of civil servants from Javanese ethnic group who work in West Pasaman administration. The sample are also selected using snowball and convenience/accidental method. The research is conducted in local inspectorate, plantation <b>agency,</b> civil <b>servant</b> <b>agencies,</b> education and training agency, and local secretariat. Informants consist of 2 echelon III officials, 2 echelon IV and 8 staff. Data is interpreted using thick description method; so that the cultural significance of this work ethic can be explored more intensely in order to elaborate deeply the ewuh pakewuh work culture beyond what is visible. The results obtained indicate that the ethnic work culture ewuh pakewuh have positive and negative sides. The positive side shows high appreciation for higher authority, and an effort to respect and implement sincerely the policies made by the authority. However the ewuh pakewuh ethnic work culture discourages the staff to give suggestions and opinions, causing uncritical (nrimo) work culture. A change is needed to encourage them implement less the ewuh pakewuh that leads to ethnic work culture {{in order to create}} creative and innovative work culture.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{qualitative}} evaluation of a scheme called Discovery Teams, offered by the Christian <b>agency</b> <b>Servants</b> to Asia's Urban Poor. It examines the experiences of twenty-two New Zealanders who have spent between one and four weeks staying as guests {{in the home of}} Filipino squatter families, and evaluates the various ways this experience has generated ongoing changes in their lives. The study concludes that participating in a discovery team has acted as a catalyst for change in most team members' lives. This is especially true for those who have already begun to ask questions about poverty and suffering - and their own response to these issues - before their trip to Manila. Most team members fit this description, thanks to a thorough program of personal and team preparation. The study also reveals that participating in a discovery team during a time of personal transition - such as a change in employment or marital status - increases the probability of team members implementing changes on return to their home country. Being immersed in an urban poor community, building relationships with local people, and reflecting regularly on these experiences all contribute to team members gaining {{a deeper understanding of the}} many ways that poverty impacts the lives of real people. Those who come to understand that there are connections between their own abundance and the poverty of others are very likely to develop a deeper sense of personal responsibility toward the poor. They are consequently more likely to continue responding to poverty through different aspects of their lifestyle, vocation and the practice of their faith. However, for most this requires some level of resolve to grow in personal maturity - particularly their ability to look beyond themselves - and a willingness to allow their Christian faith to adapt to a more complex understanding of reality. Responsible leadership, exercised by mature team leaders, also positively influences each of these outcomes in team members' lives...|$|R

40|$|In {{attempting}} to reform public services, governments worldwide {{have sought to}} effect change through policies aimed at both transforming structures of public-service provision and facilitating the <b>agency</b> of public <b>servants</b> working within these. Various obstacles have been found, however, to impede the effectiveness of such efforts. In this article, the authors examine the role of organizational networks and distributed leadership—two prominent policies aimed at structure and agency, respectively—in the establishment and consolidation of service reform in the English National Health Service. Using a comparative case-study approach, they contrast the trajectories of two attempts to introduce and gain acceptance for service reform, noting important differences of context, process, and outcome between the sites. The findings indicate the importance of dispersed, as well as distributed, leadership in achieving change in a networked public-service setting. Effective leaders may indeed achieve change through the structures and processes of the network. However, the coexistence alongside the network of other organizational forms constrains the ability of leaders to achieve change without complementary action {{beyond the boundaries of}} the network...|$|R

40|$|The {{legacy of}} the 2000 s whole-of-government reform agenda {{promotes}} that public sector agencies work across the sector, encouraging an inter-agency collaborative approach to resolve the so called ‘wicked problems’ facing New Zealand. The initial 1980 s public service reform agenda, established on a neoliberal philosophy, afforded greater decision-making autonomy to public servants and hierarchical simplification. Yet the author’s experience of inter-agency collaboration as a mid-level public sector official is that, despite best intentions, it is difficult in practice due to the paradoxical requirement of autonomous decision-making power and obligation to individual departments and their Chief Executives. These paradoxes manifest as tensions between the collaborative causal powers (<b>agency)</b> of public <b>servants</b> and the structure and practices of New Zealand’s Westminster system of governance that remains palpably hierarchical. This research uses Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as a methodological means of validating this hypothesis {{within the context of}} a case study of the National Maritime Coordination Centre. This theoretically driven research presents CDA as an alternative and instructive lens that provides an enhanced understanding of the real world issues associated with collaboration within New Zealand’s public sector to present possibilities for change...|$|R

Several agencies were recently created outside of the government using a strategy known as agencification to support the implementation of public policy in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. However, there is little available information explaining {{the rationale for the}} choice of the strategy, no evidence-based scholarly evaluation found on the effectiveness of these types of agencies, and therefore limited information on whether this strategy results in effective public policy. The purpose of this case study was to gain an in-depth understanding of these semi-autonomous agencies in the implementation of public policy in Trinidad and Tobago as part of the Caribbean Community. The central research question sought to explore the successes, failures, and experiences with executive agencies created through agencification. Principal-agent theory provided the theoretical framework for this qualitative case study. Using a purposive sampling strategy, data were acquired through interviews with 10 individuals representing public <b>servants,</b> <b>agency</b> officials, and academics and a review of public documents. The data were inductively coded and then organized across themes.
