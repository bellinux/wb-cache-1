5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in <b>a</b> <b>semester</b> class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E
