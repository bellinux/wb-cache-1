5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> is that proper credit {{should be}} given where credit is due; {{if any of the}} {{conclusions}} derived by the forensic entomologist were seconded by another professional, that person’s name and qualifications should be presented as well.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the essence}} of theft {{consists}} in taking <b>another's</b> <b>thing</b> secretly ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Night Of The Long Knives": [...] "Its like {{a horror}} movie. <b>Another</b> power <b>thing.</b> It just sounded nice." ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{when does}} {{something}} [...] "become" [...] an organization? When does an organization become (<b>an)other</b> <b>thing(s)?</b> Can one organization [...] "house" [...] another? Is the organization still a useful entity/thing/concept, or has the social/political environment {{changed so much}} that {{what we now call}} [...] "organization" [...] is so different from the organization of even a few decades ago that it cannot be usefully tagged with the same word - [...] "organization"? ...|$|R
25|$|There {{is a large}} {{difference}} between {{the numbers of people}} whose native language is Russian and people who adopted Russian as their everyday communication language. <b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> {{to keep in mind is}} that the percentage of Russian-speaking citizens is significantly higher in cities than in rural areas across the whole country.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> {{to mention}} about Han's studies {{is that she}} uses a rather small number of {{participants}} and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in France or Ho Chi Minh City).|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} in September 2008 that Eoin Colfer, author of Artemis Fowl, had been commissioned to write the sixth instalment entitled And <b>Another</b> <b>Thing...</b> {{with the support of}} Jane Belson, Adams's widow. The book was published by Penguin Books in the UK and Hyperion in the US in October 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The story builds {{from one}} small event to <b>another.</b> <b>Things</b> climax during one long New Year's Eve night, as a {{dramatic}} event {{and the final}} admission of the secret definitively {{put an end to}} the Fields' [...] "pretend normal" [...] family life. The ending is left open, leaving the viewer to guess whether or not the characters will be able to start a new and more honest life and reconstruct family bonds.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you {{are about}} to behold <b>another</b> strange <b>thing</b> David," [...] Monsieur Gratiot continued. [...] "To-day you are on French territory." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> amazing <b>thing</b> of Tokai {{is that he}} {{is known}} by the name of his class rather than a real proper name! ...|$|R
25|$|The unmoved mover {{argument}} asserts that, {{from our}} experience of motion in the universe (motion being the transition from potentiality to actuality) {{we can see that}} there must have been an initial mover. Aquinas argued that whatever is in motion must be put in motion by <b>another</b> <b>thing,</b> so there must be an unmoved mover.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> {{that may}} cause visual {{hallucinations}} is prolonged visual deprivation. In a study where 13 healthy people were blindfolded for 5 days, 10 {{out of the}} 13 subjects reported visual hallucinations. This finding lends strong support {{to the idea that}} the simple loss of normal visual input is sufficient to cause visual hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|Donald's {{drifting}} {{from job}} to job was reportedly inspired by Barks' own experiences. So was his usual lack of success. And even in those that he was successful this would be temporary, just until a mistake or chance event caused another failure, another disappointment for the frustrated duck. Barks also reported that this was <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> he was familiar with.|$|E
30|$|<b>Another</b> {{interesting}} <b>thing</b> is {{to investigate}} the extinction property of species x_ 1 in system (1.1). For this case, we have the following.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> {{interesting}} <b>thing</b> to note is {{that track}} {{one on the}} album- [...] "Manifestation Of The New Armies"- is misspelled as [...] "Mannifestation".|$|R
6000|$|... "This suited Captain Abner, and Sam {{went on to}} say: 'There'll be <b>another</b> good <b>thing</b> about that; if you get her {{and bring}} her back--' ...|$|R
25|$|One of the fair's major crowd-attracting and {{financial}} shortcomings was {{the absence of}} a midway. The fair's organizers were opposed, on principle, to the honky-tonk atmosphere engendered by midways, and this was <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> that irked the BIE, which insisted that all officially sanctioned fairs have a midway. What amusements the fair actually had ended up being largely dull. The Meadow Lake Amusement Area was not easily accessible, and officials objected to shows being advertised.|$|E
25|$|A forest f {{consists}} of a list of trees, while a tree t {{consists of}} a pair of a value v and a forest f (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one thing with the value, and <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> with the children.|$|E
25|$|BBC Radio 4 also {{commissioned}} a third Dirk Gently radio series {{based on the}} incomplete chapters of The Salmon of Doubt, and written by Kim Fuller; but this was dropped in favour of a BBC TV series based on the two completed novels. A sixth Hitchhiker novel, And <b>Another</b> <b>Thing...,</b> by Artemis Fowl author Eoin Colfer, was released on 12 October 2009 (the 30th anniversary of the first book), published {{with the support of}} Adams's estate. A BBC Radio 4 Book at Bedtime adaptation and an audio book soon followed.|$|E
60|$|Here is <b>another</b> little <b>thing</b> that I {{have worked}} out, which is {{superior}} to parlour games in that it combines their intense excitement with sound out-of-door exercise.|$|R
6000|$|... "'So it is,' replied Mr. Beaver, {{stretching}} {{first one}} leg and then <b>another.</b> 'But <b>things</b> worth having are worth working for,' {{and with that}} he began cutting again.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{remarkable}} <b>thing</b> {{about this}} temple is that leeches {{very common in}} most parts of Wayanad are not found in the surrounding area of this temple. According to the legend, goddess Seetha cursed the leeches that bit Lava and Kusa. <b>Another</b> significant <b>thing</b> about this place is {{that a large number of}} termite mounds(valmeekam) can be seen at different spots. The festival of this temple celebrated in the first week of January is considered to be the regional festival attended by large number of people belonging to different castes and creed.|$|R
25|$|In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 {{animated}} {{film version of}} The Lord of the Rings, the Nazgûl hack and slash the Hobbits' beds at The Prancing Pony inn themselves. In the book, the assailants are not precisely identified, but Tolkien implies that the attack {{was carried out by}} agents of the Nazgûl, possibly including one Bill Ferny, rather than the Nazgûl themselves (though they were present in the town). <b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> to note is that after the beds are destroyed, the Ringwraths remove their hoods, revealing hideous black masks and the armour they wear beneath their cloaks. They remain unhooded, but masked, throughout the remainder of the film.|$|E
25|$|Atwater: But Reagan did {{not have}} to do a {{southern}} strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|It is {{one thing}} to impose a tax {{dependent}} upon the conduct of the taxpayers, or of the state in which they live, where the conduct to be stimulated or discouraged is unrelated to the fiscal need subserved by the tax in its normal operation, or to any other end legitimately national. … It is quite <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> to say that a tax will be abated upon the doing of an act that will satisfy the fiscal need, the tax and the alternative being approximate equivalents. In such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>thing</b> ANFA is set {{to introduce}} is the registration of players. The ANFA has already corresponded with all the clubs to complete the registration by August 26.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he said to}} the ostler, [...] "can't you put me up to <b>another</b> good <b>thing,</b> just as {{you told}} that gentleman you were {{speaking}} to me about?" ...|$|R
50|$|Rerum. When {{one person}} let, and <b>another</b> hired, a <b>thing.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. <b>Another</b> <b>thing,</b> when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites have}} recently showed a value {{in social and}} political movements. In the Egyptian revolution, Facebook and Twitter both played an allegedly pivotal role in keeping people connected to the revolt. Egyptian activists have credited social networking sites with providing a platform for planning protest and sharing news from Tahrir Square in real time. By presenting a platform for thousands of people to instantaneously share videos of mainly events featuring brutality, social networking can be a vital tool in revolutions. On the flip side, social networks enable government authorities to easily identify, and repress, protestors and dissidents. <b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> that social media helps with in political applications is getting the younger generations involved in politics and ongoing political issues.|$|E
25|$|The main {{consideration}} with SIMS is {{ensuring that}} the sample is stable under ultra-high vacuum, or pressures less than 10−8 torr. The nature of the ultra-high vacuum is that it ensures the sample remains constant during analysis as well as ensuring the high energy ion beam strikes the sample. Ultra-high vacuum solves {{many of the problems}} that need to be considered during sample preparation. When preparing the sample for analysis, <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> that should be considered is the thickness of the film. Typically, if a thin monolayer can be deposited onto the surface of a noble metal, analysis should be successful. If the film thickness is too large, which is common in real world analysis, the problem can be solved by methods such as depositing a perforated silver foil over a nickel grid onto the film surface. This yields similar results to thin films deposited directly onto a noble metal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{significant}} <b>thing</b> about Pandamangalam is the two God's Carts Lord Vishnu and Goddess Maariamman,which is {{been pulled}} {{off during the}} festival time half around the town,with a huge people gathering.|$|R
5000|$|Ba azini ma afasi ba ze oli oli (Because {{of someone}} else's things, you defecate air): If {{you rely on}} <b>another</b> man's <b>things,</b> you won't enjoy fully nor have peace of mind! ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> face of <b>things</b> was seen, and I {{became a}} Tory.|$|R
