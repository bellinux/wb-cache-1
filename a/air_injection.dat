Years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> system was introduced.

Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{made from}} cast iron through oxygenation: The {{earliest}} known production of steel {{is a piece}} of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and is about 4,000 years old. Other ancient steel comes from East Africa, dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese, who had been producing cast iron from the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), produced steel by the 2nd century BC through a process of decarburization, i.e. using bellows to pump large amounts of oxygen on to molten cast iron. This was first described in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) book Huainanzi, compiled by scholars under Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). For steel, they used both quenching (i.e. rapid cooling) and tempering (i.e. slow cooling) methods of heat treatment. Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> to reduce carbon content of iron; his invention anticipated the Bessemer process of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|E
25|$|This is an {{experimental}} method that employs {{a number of}} vertical <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> wells above a horizontal production well located {{at the base of}} the bitumen pay zone. An initial Steam Cycle similar to CSS is used to prepare the bitumen for ignition and mobility. Following that cycle, air is injected into the vertical wells, igniting the upper bitumen and mobilizing (through heating) the lower bitumen to flow into the production well. It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD.|$|E

25|$|The Stingers {{competed in}} Class D Production, which was {{dominated}} by the Triumph TR4, which was very quick in racing trim; however in its first race in January 1966, the Stinger was able to come in second by only one second. By {{the end of the}} 1966 season, Jerry Thompson had won the Central Division Championship and placed fifth in the 1966 Nationals, Dick Thompson, a highly successful Corvette race driver, had won the Northeast Division Championship, and Jim Spencer had won the Central Division Championship, with Dino Milani taking second place. The next year, however, Chevrolet dropped the Corsa line, and the Monza line was not initially available stock with the four carburetor engine; the engine was eventually offered as a special performance option, however, along with the 3.89 differential. The Monza instrumentation did not have a tachometer or head temperature gauges, which had to be separately installed. The SCCA, on the other hand, had relaxed its ruling regarding color, and the cars were available in red or blue. It is believed that only fourteen 1967 Stingers were built, but Dana Chevrolet, who distributed Stingers on the U.S. West Coast, ordered an additional three similar cars to be built to Stinger specifications, but with the <b>AIR</b> <b>injection</b> system to meet California emissions laws, with Yenko's permission. A total of 185 Stingers are believed to have been built, the last being YS-9700 built for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company as a tire test vehicle in 1969–1970. Comedian, television star, and car enthusiast Tim Allen owned and raced Yenko Stinger #YS-043 until he sold it around June, 2009.|$|E

40|$|Mobile Polar Highs (MPHs) are {{masses of}} cold air that move out aperiodically from the Antarctic Icecap and {{eventually}} cross Australia. Their movement from the Weddell Sea and the Lambert Glacier was monitored between 26 March and 20 July 2004 using daily satellite images and synoptic charts. Their leading edge appears on these images as a distinct arced cloudband. The patterns of MPHs were then linked to significant rainfall events— 3 ̆e 50 mm in 24 hrs—in southeastern Australia. Although most of this area of Australia was in drought over the study period, three major rainfall events resulted from the passage {{of three of the}} eleven MPH events mapped. All three events either originated or received cold <b>air</b> <b>injections</b> from the Lambert Glacier. Analysis of MPHs between January and March 2000 also indicated that polar air originating from this latter location could be linked to major rainfall events over southeastern Australia.

50|$|As {{emission}} control strategies grew {{more sophisticated and}} effective, the amount of unburned and partially burned fuel in the exhaust stream shrank, and particularly when the catalytic converter was introduced, the function of secondary <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> shifted.

40|$|This work {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} {{investigation of a}} flame propagating through a propane-air mixture in a rectangular duct where the ignition end is kept shut. Flame propagation through a homogeneous charge with equivalence ratios 0. 8, 0. 9, 1. 0 and 1. 1 was investigated initially. The flames were tested with the exit end fully open and fully closed. In all the cases, propagation of the flame occurs {{through a series of}} acceleration and deceleration periods. This movement was termed the “Leap Frog” phenomenon. The flame develops a shape called the “tulip flame” at the first period and “flame inversions” during the subsequent periods. The formation of the tulip flame and inversions occur right after the acceleration period in a sequence, suggesting that the Leap Frog phenomenon is influenced by the Rayleigh–Tayler (R-T) instability. Flame images of the tulip flame occurrence are qualitatively similar to the interface evolution of two fluids during the R-T instability. The pressure variation at the ignition end of the duct correlates well with the tulip and inversion formations; with a peak pressure at the inversions and tulip flame formation positions. The pressure was filtered with a low pass filter of 25 Hz. This frequency is less than the first harmonic of the longitudinal acoustic frequency of the duct, suggesting that acoustic pressure oscillations do not heavily influence the Leap Frog phenomenon. Next, the flame propagating through a stratified medium, was examined (initial equivalence at 1. 1) for the open–exit end condition. Stratification was achieved by <b>air</b> and propane <b>injections</b> to the duct. Also, a mixture the same as the initial charge was injected to the propagating flame to identify effects of pure flow perturbation. Large quantities of air, fuel and mixture were injected when the flame front was within 200 mm from the injector. The flames extinguished at the first inversion for fuel injections of more than 34. 6 mg, while the tulip flame position was unchanged. However, for <b>air</b> <b>injections</b> of more than 37 mg, the flames did not extinguish and the tulip flame position was displaced downstream. The flame behavior was similar to large <b>air</b> <b>injections</b> with mixture injections. However, a threshold mass of mixture could not be determined. The tulip flame was displaced when the flames were within 100 mm from the injector at the start of injection. When less than 34. 6 mg of fuel and less than 37 mg of air were injected, the tulip flame was not displaced nor did the flames extinguish; but the position of the first inversion shows a good correlation with the injection timing. These experiments suggest that the flame propagation reverts to the “Leap Frog” phenomenon irrespective of extreme stratification and heavy perturbations, suggesting a single dominating factor influencing the formation of the tulip flame and inversions in all of these extreme conditions. It is postulated that the R-T instability is this factor...|$|R
