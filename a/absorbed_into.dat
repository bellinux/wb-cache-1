5|$|Following the Anschluss, the {{historical}} {{aim of the}} German nationalists who supported the union between Austria and Germany was completed. The pan-Germanists were then fully <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the Nazi Party (NSDAP).|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Felling was twinned with Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray, France. When it was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> Gateshead in 1974, the {{twinning}} arrangement {{was transferred to}} Gateshead.|$|E
50|$|It quickly <b>absorbs</b> <b>into</b> the skin, {{replenishing}} {{moisture and}} creating a protective barrier on the skin to help prevent dehydration.|$|R
50|$|Lignosulphonates: Wood pulp derived polymers. Effective in all Portland cements {{and added}} in {{concentrations}} of 0.1% to 1.5% BWOC. It <b>absorbs</b> <b>into</b> the C-S-H gel and {{causes a change}} of morphology to a more impermeable structure.|$|R
5000|$|Surfrider Foundation {{released}} {{preliminary results}} of their study [...] "State of the Beach" [...] in which they found that Corexit appears to make it tougher for microbes to digest the oil. Organic pollutants (PAHs) stay above carcinogenic levels by NIH and OSHA standards due to Corexit inhibiting the microbial degradation of hydrocarbons in crude oil.Through the use of 'newly developed' UV light equipment, researchers were able to detect PAHs in sand and on human skin. Corexit, they said, allows these toxins to <b>absorb</b> <b>into</b> the skin and cannot be wiped off. The mixture of Corexit and crude <b>absorbs</b> <b>into</b> wet skin faster than dry.|$|R
5|$|Poole {{is made up}} of {{numerous}} suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or hamlets that were <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> Poole as the town grew.|$|E
5|$|The Society's medical {{collections}} were {{donated to}} the Warren Anatomical Museum around 1870, while its library was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the Boston Medical Library in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively dsRNA can be {{supplied}} without genetic engineering. One {{approach is to}} add them to irrigation water. The molecules are <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
50|$|After {{entering}} the intestines, the oxygen from the cocktail <b>absorbs</b> <b>into</b> the blood, where it stimulates metabolism, blood circulation, redox and the immune system. The activated metabolism also stimulates the digesting of other cocktail’s ingredients, thereby enhancing their medical action.|$|R
25|$|The Ink or Toner {{does not}} <b>absorb</b> <b>into</b> the substrate, as does {{conventional}} ink, but forms a layer {{on the surface}} and may be fused to the substrate by using an inline fuser fluid with heat process (toner) or UV curing process (ink).|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the good}} {{permeability}} of blonanserin, the volume of distribution in {{the central nervous system}} is greater than that in the periphery (Vd central = 9500 L, Vd periphery = 8650 L) although it is slower to <b>absorb</b> <b>into</b> the central compartment.|$|R
5|$|By 1882, Castle {{contained}} some 79 undergraduates out of 205 at {{the university}} as a whole. Despite the university largely failing to gain recognition and prestige, {{a number of other}} colleges had opened {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century. Of these, Cosin's Hall failed to become financially viable and was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> University College in 1864. Enrolment numbers continued to fluctuate.|$|E
5|$|Copper is a {{constituent}} of tobacco smoke. The tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals, such as copper {{from the surrounding}} soil into its leaves. These are readily <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the user's body following smoke inhalation. The health implications are not clear.|$|E
5|$|Ickenham had {{a parish}} council but came within the Uxbridge Rural District until 1925, {{when this was}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the Municipal Borough of Uxbridge. This {{remained}} until 1965, when the borough {{was included in the}} newly established London Borough of Hillingdon. Within the borough of Hillingdon, Ickenham has its own ward, with Conservative Councillors John Hensley, Raymond Puddifoot and David Simmons representing it.|$|E

5|$|Testaroli is {{sometimes}} served with pesto sauce, {{which is a}} common addition {{to it in the}} Liguria and Tuscany regions of Italy. Another dressing method includes the addition of olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, garlic and basil. Significant amounts of sauce may <b>absorb</b> <b>into</b> testaroli.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION This chapter {{addresses}} the following question: To {{what extent do}} smoking-machine-derived tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide ratings of cigarettes predict how much of those substances smokers actually <b>absorb</b> <b>into</b> their bodies?

5|$|In 1923 the L was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the Southern Railway, {{and began}} an upgrade programme. All locos & coaches were repainted in Southern Maunsell Green livery, the wagons were repainted in Southern Umber livery and track and {{buildings}} were improved. A fifth locomotive, Lew was purchased in 1925, with {{improvements to the}} original Manning Wardle design.|$|E
5|$|In June 1962, the Atomic Energy Commission {{released}} its custody and {{ownership of the}} weapons to the Air Force. The personnel and property of the later named Caribou Air Force Station were <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the adjacent Loring Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|In September 1623, {{a second}} colony led by Governor-General Robert Gorges {{was created in}} the {{abandoned}} site at Wessagusset. This colony was rechristened as Weymouth and was also unsuccessful, and Governor Gorges returned to England the following year. Despite that, some settlers remained in the village and it was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630.|$|E

50|$|Patients {{who have}} Endotine {{implants}} in their foreheads risk moving their newly adjusted tissues with relatively small movements {{just after the}} operation and before complete healing takes place. While the implant <b>absorbs</b> <b>into</b> the body, the Endotine generally {{does not support the}} very thick forehead flesh and heavy brows often seen in some overweight males.|$|R
5|$|In {{the adult}} fish, the four {{chambers}} are not {{arranged in a}} straight row but, instead form an S-shape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described {{as part of the}} aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having been <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{is a global}} issue since lead mining and smelting, and battery manufacturing/disposal/recycling, are common in many countries. Lead enters the body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled lead is <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the body; for ingestion, the rate is 20–70%, with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults.|$|E
5|$|No.80 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing of World War II. The {{unit was}} formed on 15May 1944 and {{eventually}} comprised three squadrons equipped with Spitfire fighter aircraft. The wing's headquarters was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> {{the newly formed}} No. 11 Group on 30July 1945.|$|E
5000|$|Setting spray {{is used as}} {{the last}} {{step in the process}} of {{applying}} makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An alternative to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products are claimed to keep makeup from <b>absorbing</b> <b>into</b> the skin or melting off.|$|R

5|$|Plutonium-239 and 240 emit {{ionizing}} radiation {{in the form}} of alpha particles. Inhalation is the primary pathway by which plutonium enters the body, though plutonium can also enter the body through a wound. Once inhaled, plutonium increases the risk of lung cancer, liver cancer, bone cancer, and leukemia. Once <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the body, the biological half life of plutonium is about 200 years.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller's fourth main philanthropy, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Foundation, {{was created}} in 1918. Through this, he {{supported}} work in the social studies; this was later <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> the Rockefeller Foundation. In total Rockefeller donated about $550 million.|$|E
5|$|The first {{incarnation}} of M-68 {{existed in the}} Upper Peninsula before being <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> M-35. The current designation was created in 1936. A segment of highway once used by US Highway23 (US23) was incorporated into the trunkline as a discontinuous section in the early 1940s until it was later connected in 1946.|$|E
