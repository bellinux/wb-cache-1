500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let <b>anybody</b> <b>know</b> that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2000, he was {{the subject}} of an {{in-depth}} documentary by Louis Theroux, in the When Louis Met... series. In it, Theroux asked about rumours he was a paedophile. Savile said: [...] " [...] live in a very funny world. And it's easier for me, as a single man, to say [...] "I don't like children" [...] because that puts a lot of salacious tabloid people off the hunt.... How do they know whether I am [...] or not? How does <b>anybody</b> <b>know</b> whether I am? Nobody knows whether I am or not. I know I'm not." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dylan {{returns to}} Beverly Hills towards the {{beginning}} of the ninth season, apparently because he misses his home and friends, although he admits to Kelly that he misses her especially. He also relapses and is once again on heroin (however, all references to his alcoholism are absent and he is frequently seen drinking alcoholic beverages in casual, social situations). After failing to win Kelly back, he starts dating the new bad girl Gina Kincaid, despite obviously still having feelings for Kelly. Dylan and Kelly battle a mutual attraction, despite being in on-and-off relationships with Gina and Matt Durning respectively. This is especially noticeable when Kelly blames Gina and others for Dylan's drug problems (as with the case back in Season 5 with Kelly blaming Valerie for Dylan's drug problems), and gets Steve to take the credit for a heroic act (in Dylan's stead) to avoid having <b>anybody</b> <b>know</b> that she and Dylan were out together.|$|E
2500|$|Táhirih {{was educated}} {{particularly}} {{well for a}} girl of her era. A literate woman was itself a rare phenomenon and surprisingly her father decided to break from protocol and personally tutor his daughter. Though still living in a strict religious home, Táhirih was educated in theology, jurisprudence, Persian literature, and poetry. She was allowed to undertake Islamic studies, and was known for her ability to memorize the Qur'an {{as well as being}} able to grasp hard to understand points of religious law. Her father was reported to have lamented at {{the fact that she was}} not a son. Táhirih was said to have surpassed her father’s male students which further convinced him of her literary talents. Her father even allowed her to listen to his lessons which he gave male pupils, on the condition that she hide behind a curtain and not let <b>anybody</b> <b>know</b> her presence. Her father affectionately knew her as [...] "Zarrín Táj" [...] ("Crown of Gold").|$|E

[...] Giles remarks, [...] "they are kind of dependent." [...] Although the Baltimore ACORN staffer pointed out their plans were illegal, after O'Keefe says, [...] "we {{are going to be}} putting a roof over [...] head", the ACORN employee states, [...] "well then you know what you can always claim them as dependents." [...] Later, the employee says, [...] "you are gonna use three of them they are gonna be under 16 so you is eligible to get child tax credit and additional child tax credit." [...] When O'Keefe asks, [...] "what {{if they are going to}} be making money because they are performing tricks too?" [...] the employee replies, [...] "but if they making money and they are underage, then you shouldn't be letting <b>anybody</b> <b>know</b> anyway."
