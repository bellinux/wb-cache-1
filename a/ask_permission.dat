5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E

Although his return ship was overtaken by an English privateer, Audubon and his hidden gold coins survived the encounter.|$|E
25|$|Publication of {{the plans}} enraged the Canadian public opinion as it was {{regarded}} as a breach and disregard of sovereignty and prompted the government to take preventive measures in defending Canada’s arctic territories. The U.S. never recognized Canada’s claim over the Northwest passage but nevertheless, the two countries reached an agreement two years later which stipulated that in the future, the U.S. would <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> before navigating the disputed waters.|$|E

25|$|Following the Mishnah (see “In {{classical}} rabbinic interpretation” above), Maimonides {{acknowledged that}} based on Phinehas’s slaying of Zimri, a zealot would be considered praiseworthy to strike {{a man who has}} sexual relations with a gentile woman in public, that is, in the presence of ten or more Jews. But Maimonides taught that the zealot could strike the fornicators only when they were actually engaged in the act, {{as was the case with}} Zimri, and if the transgressor ceased, he should not be slain, and if the zealot then killed the transgressor, the zealot could be executed as a murderer. Further, Maimonides taught that if the zealot came to <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> from the court to kill the transgressor, the court should not instruct the zealot to do so, even if the zealot consulted the court during the act.|$|E
25|$|The first {{quadripartite meeting}} {{ended with the}} {{students}} reaching an agreement concerning eight preconditions on further negotiations although the government denied the request to ensure security to demonstrators. However, Aung Min, a President’s Office Minister, told the students that he would <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> from the president {{the responsibility of the}} students' safety until they arrived in Popa in Mandalay Region. The first three preconditions from the students –issuing a public statement after every meeting, having information on education reforms available to the public, making sure all the parties involved in the meeting have equal opportunities to participate – were readily accepted while agreement on officially recognizing student and teacher unions was reached after four-hour long discussion albeit many details pending for further discussions. Furthermore, the meeting ended without any discussions on the eleven-point demands that the ACDE issued even though the students reached to an official agreement to continue the negotiations on February 3.|$|E
25|$|Edward Shelley (who {{was one of}} {{the first}} English {{soldiers}} to be killed at the battle of Pinkie) reported that he had 40 thousand-weight of biscuit on 20 April. At Berwick, Shelley had problems getting enough coal or wood for baking and brewing. He had to <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> to impress more supplies and hold sales to rotate his stock. 4000 border horsemen waited at Berwick for Hertford's signal. At first it was planned that they would make a diversionary attack on Haddington. Their commander Ralph Eure wrote from Alnwick on 28 April that these 'countrymen' were so poor he had to lend them money. He also asked for 1000 Yorkshire archers as reinforcement so that they could come to Edinburgh to support the landing. In the event, it was agreed that Hertford would summon Eure when he had disembarked his troops. When Eure's men arrived in Edinburgh they would get their pay.|$|E

25|$|Ullrich had 2 wins {{before the}} 1997 Tour; {{a stage in}} the Tour de Suisse and the {{national}} Road Race championship {{a week before the}} tour. He became favorite in the 1997 Tour de France. He started strongly, finishing second in the prologue behind Chris Boardman. On stage 9, the first mountain stage which was won by Laurent Brochard, Ullrich worked for Riis. Only on the last ascent when Richard Virenque attacked did Ullrich react. Riis struggled to keep up and finished 30 seconds behind Virenque, Marco Pantani and Ullrich. On stage 10 from Luchon to Andorra Arcalis, with Riis again falling back, Ullrich dropped back to the teamcar to <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> to attack. He returned to the lead group and pushed up the climb leaving Pantani and Virenque. He finished a minute ahead which earned his first yellow jersey. L'Équipe, greeted Ullrich with Voilà le Patron ("Here is the boss"). Ullrich won the Stage 12 time trial with three minutes between himself and the second placed rider, Virenque, who had started three minutes in front of him.|$|E
25|$|Japanese forces {{around the}} landing area {{were limited to}} no more than platoon strength, as they had not {{expected}} a landing in the area and their logistics system was unable to support greater numbers. When word of the landings reached Rabaul, Vice Admiral Tomoshige Samejima, Commander Japanese Eighth Fleet, immediately embarked a thousand troops from the II Battalion, 54th Infantry Regiment onto five destroyer-transports at Rabaul and sent them to Cape Torokina to effect a counterlanding. Escorting the transports was a force of two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers and six destroyers led by Vice Admiral Sentaro Omori. During the night voyage to Torokina, the Japanese ships were spotted by an American submarine and possibly by a search plane. Concerned that he had lost the element of surprise, Omori radioed Samejima to <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> to send the slow-moving transports back to Rabaul, but to continue with the combat ships to attack the American transports that he assumed were still in Empress Augusta Bay. Samejima concurred, and Omori pressed ahead with his cruisers and destroyers.|$|E
25|$|The Duke de Broglie was {{carefully}} preparing {{a way to}} bring down Thiers. He modified the rules of the Assembly so that the President had the power to veto laws passed by the Assembly, but also requiring that the President <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> from the head of the Assembly before he spoke to the body. On 2 April, the moderate republican president of the Assembly, Jules Grévy, was forced to resign by a personal scandal and was replaced by a deputy of the center-right, Buffet, who supported a constitutional monarchy. Soon afterwards, on 27 April, an election was held in Paris to fill a vacant seat in the Assembly. Both the candidate of the monarchists and the moderate republican candidate supported by Thiers was defeated by a more radical republican named Barodet, who was supported by Leon Gambetta and the left wing of the republicans. Further elections were held on 11 May: five of the six open seats were won by republicans. The right wing of the Assembly became alarmed that the country was moving too far to the left and {{decided it was time to}} get rid of Thiers.|$|E

500|$|Mansour's run {{for office}} came as a {{surprise}} to Edmund Szoka, the Archbishop of Detroit. At the time, the Vatican allowed members of religious orders to hold political office, but the candidate was required to gain the approval of the local bishop. Mansour did not do so. She told reporters that canon law was an [...] "old set of rules that are invoked when somebody wants to invoke them, and ignored when someone wants to ignore them." [...] Szoka accepted her excuse that she did not know to <b>ask</b> <b>permission.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{artist who}} {{became known as}} Toyohara Kunichika was born Ōshima Yasohachi on June 30, 1835, in the Kyōbashi district, a {{merchant}} and artisan area of Edo (present-day Tokyo). His father, Ōshima Kyujū, was the proprietor of a sentō (public bathhouse), the Ōshūya. An indifferent family man, and poor businessman, he lost the bathhouse sometime in Yasohachi's childhood. The boy's mother, Arakawa Oyae, {{was the daughter of}} a teahouse proprietor. At that time, commoners of a certain social standing could <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> to alter the family name (myōji gomen). [...] To distance themselves from the father's failure, the family took the mother's surname, and the boy became Arakawa Yasohachi.|$|E
500|$|... "You do {{not need}} to <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> from anyone to be a journalist," [...] {{explains}} the Periodical Publishers Association; [...] "however, it is sometimes useful to be able to identify yourself as a journalist when needed." [...] To this end, journalistic agencies issue press cards to their reporters, editorialists, writers, and photographers. [...] These do not have the legal merits of government-issued cards, and they will not replace event-specific passes; the card only serves as proof of its bearer's status as a legitimate newsperson according to the issuing organization. [...] As such, card-carriers may be better able to obtain interviews, acquire information from law-enforcement, or gain access to exclusive venues.|$|E

500|$|Anonymus {{writes that}} Glad took shelter in [...] "the castle of Kovin", while the Magyars marched to [...] "the {{borders of the}} Bulgarians" [...] and encamped at the Ponjavica River. Zovárd, Kadocsa and Vajta laid siege to Kovin, forcing Glad to {{surrender}} it three days later. In short, they also seized Orșova where they lived [...] "for a whole month", according to the Gesta. Vajta returned to Árpád, taking with him the hostages and the booty, while Zovárd and Kadocsa sent an envoy to Árpád to <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> to invade the Byzantine Empire. Ioan-Aurel Pop writes that Glad must have survived his defeat and recovered at least parts of his duchy in exchange for paying {{a tribute to the}} Magyars, because his descendant, Ahtum, ruled the territory some decades later, according to Anonymus.|$|E
500|$|Once on the throne, Cædwalla {{attacked}} the South Saxons again, this time killing Berthun, and [...] "the province {{was reduced to}} a worse state of subjection". He also conquered the Isle of Wight, which was still an independent pagan kingdom, and set himself to kill every native on the island, resettling it with his own people. Arwald, the king of the Isle of Wight, left his two young brothers as heirs. They fled the island, but were found at Stoneham, in Hampshire, and killed on Cædwalla's orders, though he was persuaded by a priest to let them be baptised before they were executed. Bede also mentions that Cædwalla was wounded; he was recovering from his wounds when the priest found him to <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> to baptise the princes.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year in 1964, Tittle's final season, the Giants went 2–10–2 (...) , the worst {{record in the}} 14-team league. In the second game of the year, against Pittsburgh, he was blindsided by defensive end John Baker. The tackle left Tittle with crushed cartilage in his ribs, a cracked sternum, and a concussion. However, he played in every game {{the rest of the}} season, but was relegated to a backup role later in the year. After throwing only ten touchdowns with 22 interceptions, he retired after the season at age 39, saying rookie quarterback Gary Wood not only [...] "took my job away, but started to <b>ask</b> <b>permission</b> to date my daughter." [...] Over seventeen seasons as a professional, Tittle completed 2,427 out of 4,395 passes for 33,070 yards and 242 touchdowns, with 248 interceptions. He also scrambled for 39 touchdowns.|$|E
