5|$|Henry Fuseli {{would later}} create {{one of the}} more famous portrayals of the Three Witches in 1783, {{entitled}} The Weird Sisters or The Three Witches. In it, the witches are lined up and dramatically pointing at something all at once, their faces in profile. This painting was parodied by James Gillray in 1791 in Weird Sisters; Ministers of Darkness; Minions of the Moon. Three figures are lined up with their faces in profile in a way similar to Fuseli's painting. However, the three figures are recognisable as Lord Dundas (the home secretary at the time), William Pitt (prime minister), and Lord Thurlow (Lord Chancellor). The three of them <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>a</b> moon, which contains the profiled faces of George III and Queen Charlotte. The drawing is intended to highlight the insanity of King George and the unusual alliance of the three politicians.|$|E

25|$|Human Rights Cities {{have grown}} {{in part because of}} the {{enhanced}} efforts by international agencies like UN Habitat to connect international legal regimes with municipal programs. As a result of globalized economic development processes, cities around the world <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>a</b> similar host of urban problems, including a lack of affordable housing, traffic congestion and insufficient public services. Cities have looked to international forums like the UN Conferences on Human Settlements and the World Associations of Cities and Local Authorities to help address these problems. Shulamith Koning, founder of the People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning (PDHRE), worked closely with human rights organizers in some of the first formally designated human rights cities, including Rosario Argentina, which became the first Human Rights City in the world in 1997 and the first U.S.-based Human Rights City of Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|The art {{of playing}} the dhak is now being {{referred}} to as a dying profession,this is sad but true. While some of the dhakis may be lucky to retain old contacts, many <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>a</b> decline and some are moving away from the traditional profession. Take the example of the seventy dhaki families in Amrul, a village in Bankura district. Ancestors of the dhakis were on the rolls of Malla kings of Bishnupur. Daily pujas were organised for the deities in the palace and the dhakis played a significant role. Times have changed. One of them was offered Rs. 800 for playing the dhak for five days. It is a pittance. Some of the younger generation even took to work as shoe shine boys, but the older generation still has pride in being artists. They look down upon such misadventures of the younger generation, but do not have an alternative before themselves.|$|E

They <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>a</b> two-floor platform where the worship is performed, and a text called [...] "The Halo of Consciousness" [...] ("L'Auréore de la Conscience") which is written on the back wall. In France only, the highest platform is adorned, from left to right, with a representation of the [...] "tree of science of the sight of evil", the Antoinist symbol, then a photo of Antoine and another one of Catherine; the photo of the Father is slightly higher than the other two. On the left and the right, side rooms of around 15 m³ are used as consulting offices whose walls are orned with five tables; the most impressive of them is Antoine's image. There is also a cloakroom and, adjacent to the temple, a small apartment continuously occupied by an Antoinist healer.|$|E

2500|$|The claims {{regarding}} Aymara {{involve the}} moving-ego metaphor. Most languages conceptualize the ego as moving {{forward into the}} future, with ego's back to the past.

In contrast, Aymara seems to encode the past as in front of individuals and the future behind them; this is typologically a rare phenomenon [...]|$|E

Before 2004, all lecturers in public tertiary institutions were required to have some post-graduate award as a qualification. In October 2004, this requirement was removed and the Higher Education Ministry announced that industry professionals who added value to a course could apply for lecturing positions directly to universities {{even if they did}} not have postgraduate qualifications. To head off possible allegations that the universities faced a shortage of lecturers, Deputy Higher Education Minister Datuk Fu Ah Kiow said [...] "This is not because we <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>a</b> shortage of lecturers, but because this move will add value to our courses and enhance the name of our universities... Let's say Bill Gates and Steven Spielberg, both [...] well known and outstanding in their fields, want to be teaching professors. Of course, we would {{be more than happy to}} take them in." [...] He went on to offer as an example the field of architecture whereby well-known architects recognised for their talents do not have master's degrees.|$|E
