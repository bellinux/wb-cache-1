50|$|Before {{the formal}} 1971 Oregon Bottle Bill, Oregon had already {{set up a}} less formal bottle return system that most stores {{and some of the}} public cooperated with. Inspired by the early Vermont bottle return system before it was repealed, Oregon's limited system paid 1 cent for beer bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans</b> <b>and</b> 3 cents for soda bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans,</b> <b>and</b> was started in the mid-1950s, and lasted {{through the rest of the}} 50s, {{throughout}} the 1960s and into the early 70s until the more formal and expanded Bottle Bill was enacted. The emphasis was on bottles, as bottlers were washed and re-used for fresh product sold to the public before health laws were enacted that stopped the re-wash system. And because of the low payout for the return of bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans,</b> <b>and</b> in spite of various anti-litter PSA advertising campaigns on Oregon television, only a relatively small percentage of Oregonians participated in the return of bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans,</b> <b>and</b> thus many bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans</b> still littered Oregon's highways and scenic areas throughout this entire early bottle-can recycling period.|$|R
25|$|Americans alone {{dispose of}} 130 billion bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans</b> every year, <b>and</b> 340 billion {{beverage}} bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans</b> are not recycled every year worldwide.

According to an analysis by Carbon Trust, SodaStream is 75 per cent less greenhouse gas-intensive than generic colas sold in plastic (PET) bottles in the UK.|$|R
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent <b>and</b> <b>can</b> be difficult to meet in cultivation.

A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business <b>and</b> <b>can</b> often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
