5|$|In {{the late}} 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's {{position}} compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 2008, Major League Baseball set a revenue record of $6.5billion, matching the NFL's {{revenue for the}} first time in decades. A new MLB revenue record of $6.6 billion was set in 2009. On the other hand, the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 16%, compared to pro football at 31%. In 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. Because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. In 2008, total <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year. The following year, amid the U.S. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million. <b>Attendance</b> <b>at</b> games held under the Minor League Baseball umbrella also set a record in 2007, with 42.8 million; this figure does not include <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> games of the several independent minor leagues.|$|E
