5|$|Ellis was {{an outspoken}} {{individual}} who advocated {{for the rights}} of players and African Americans. He also had a substance abuse problem, and he acknowledged after his retirement that he never pitched without the use of drugs. After going into treatment Ellis remained sober and devoted the remainder of his life to counseling drug addicts in treatment centers and prisons. He died of <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> ailment at age 63 in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Ellis was {{diagnosed}} with cirrhosis in 2007 and {{was placed on the}} list for <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> transplant. Though he had no health insurance, friends from his baseball career helped him to pay his medical bills. However, Ellis suffered heart damage in his last weeks of life, which made a transplant impossible.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is possibly}} reversible with treatment. This typically involves supportive care and addressing the triggers of the event.

5|$|Hepatorenal {{syndrome}} (often abbreviated HRS) is {{a life-threatening}} medical condition {{that consists of}} rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. HRS is usually fatal unless <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as dialysis, can prevent advancement of the condition.|$|E
5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> transplant; this provides <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E

5|$|In acute liver failure, the {{development}} of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost {{as important as the}} nature of the underlying cause of the liver failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation, such as King's College Criteria, are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria. The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in people with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> transplant.|$|E
5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection). Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision may need to be made on whether to prepare for <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> transplant.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{lived with}} Smith {{and his wife}} for the {{majority}} of his childhood, and Smith taught the young Lennon to read, read him nursery rhymes at night, and later taught Lennon how to solve crossword puzzles.

5|$|There is no totally {{reliable}} {{test for}} Wilson's disease, but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in the blood, as {{well of the}} amount of copper excreted in urine during a 24-hour period, are together used to form an impression {{of the amount of}} copper in the body.

5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive condition {{due to a}} mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. For a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent.

Genetic testing {{may be used to}} screen family members of those affected.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{typically}} treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements.

The first Cocker Spaniel recorded in America was <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878. In 1881, the American Cocker Spaniel Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and {{is now known as}} the oldest breed club for dogs in the United States. The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the Cocker Spaniel in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which would take over 20 years, only being completed in 1905.|$|E
5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> transplant. Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E
