5|$|Chlamys hastata, {{the spear}} scallop, spiny scallop or {{swimming}} scallop, is {{a species of}} bivalve mollusc in the family Pectinidae found {{on the west coast}} of North <b>America</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Alaska to San Diego, California. A limited number of these scallops are harvested by divers or by narrow trawls off the west coast of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Davis's {{paternal}} grandparents each immigrated separately to North <b>America</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{region of}} Snowdonia in North Wales {{in the early}} 18th century. The rest of his ancestry was English. After arriving in Philadelphia, Davis's paternal grandfather Evan settled in the colony of Georgia, which was developed chiefly along the coast. He married the widow Lydia Emory Williams, who had two sons from a previous marriage. Davis was an Episcopalian.|$|E

5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South <b>America.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E

5|$|In the Cretaceous, {{a shallow}} seaway spread into the {{interior}} of North <b>America</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North America into two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from {{being part of the}} Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway. Alternating layers of nonmarine, intertidal, and marine sediments lay {{on top of each other}} as a result.|$|E

5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of the}} 19th century the area which is today Minnesota was not {{recognized}} as a single entity. The Mississippi River had divided the eastern British/French lands of North <b>America</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> western Spanish lands and even after the Louisiana Purchase this was for a time seen as a separation between territories. The division between the U.S. territories {{in the region and}} the British territories remained ambiguous until the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which set the border with British North America at the 49th parallel west of the Lake of the Woods (except for a small chunk of land now dubbed the Northwest Angle). Border disputes east of the Lake of the Woods continued until the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{pelicans}} {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica. They primarily inhabit warm regions, although breeding ranges extend to latitudes of 45° South (Australian pelicans in Tasmania) and 60° North (American white pelicans in western Canada). Birds of inland and coastal waters, they are absent from polar regions, the deep ocean, oceanic islands (except the Galapagos), and inland South America, {{as well as}} from the eastern coast of South <b>America</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Amazon River southwards. Subfossil bones have been recovered from as far south as New Zealand's South Island, although their scarcity and isolated occurrence suggests that these remains may have merely been vagrants from Australia (much as is the case today).|$|E
5|$|Mountains {{continued}} to rise in the Sevier orogenic belt to the west during the Cretaceous while the roughly north-south trending Western Interior Basin expanded. Rifting in the Gulf of Mexico helped {{the southern end of}} the basin to subside, which allowed marine water to advance northward. At the same time, the shoreline advanced inland from the Arctic region. The seas advanced and retreated many times during the Cretaceous until one of the most extensive interior seaways ever, called the Western Interior Seaway, drowned much of western North <b>America</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The western shoreline of the seaway was in the vicinity of Cedar City, Utah while the eastern margin was part of the low-lying, stable platform ramp in Nebraska and Kansas.|$|E

5|$|Sonic X {{aired in}} Japan on TV Tokyo's 8:30 am time slot from April 6, 2003, to March 28, 2004. It {{consisted}} of three seasons, each of them 26 half-hour episodes long. The series suffered from poor ratings in Japan, so the third season was never aired on TV or released on DVD there, but was available through rental streaming services. 4Kids licensed the series in North <b>America</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning; ShoPro Entertainment was also made a license holder in November 2003. It aired in North America on the Fox Box block of Fox channels. The series was also localized for other countries in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In June 2012, the bankrupt 4Kids sold its Sonic X license to Saban Brands's Kidsco Media Ventures. In 2015, Discotek Media took over the series' rights and released seasons 1 and 2 on DVD.|$|E
5|$|The {{leopard shark}} (Triakis semifasciata) is {{a species of}} houndshark, in the family Triakidae. It is found along the Pacific coast of North <b>America,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> U.S. state of Oregon to Mazatlán in Mexico. Typically {{measuring}} 1.2–1.5 m (3.9–4.9ft) long, this slender-bodied shark is immediately identifiable by the striking pattern of black saddle-like markings and large spots over its back, from which it derives its common name. Large schools of leopard sharks are a common sight in bays and estuaries, swimming over sandy or muddy flats or rock-strewn areas near kelp beds and reefs. They are most common near the coast, in water less than 4m (13ft) deep.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsia {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in Asia, as all of the earliest members are found there. Fragmentary remains, including teeth, which appear to be neoceratopsian, are found in North <b>America</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Albian stage (112 to 100 million years ago), indicating that the group had dispersed across {{what is now the}} Bering Strait {{by the middle of the}} Cretaceous Period. Almost all leptoceratopsids are North American, aside from Udanoceratops, which may represent a separate dispersal event, back into Asia. Ceratopsids and their immediate ancestors, such as Zuniceratops, were unknown outside of western North America, and were presumed endemic to that continent. The traditional view that ceratopsoids originated in North America was called into question by the 2009 discovery of better specimens of the dubious Asian form Turanoceratops, which confirmed it as a ceratopsid. It is unknown whether this indicates ceratopsids actually originated in Asia, or if the Turanoceratops immigrated from North America.|$|E
