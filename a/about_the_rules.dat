5|$|The track {{had been}} patched up {{prior to the}} weekend's racing using a {{synthetic}} rubber compound, and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions, {{as well as the}} Grand-Am and Indy Lights races. However, the Dallara DW12's aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull the compound out. After assessing the track conditions, {{the decision was made to}} attempt to repair the track and restart the race. Marshalls and track workers started to pull the loose strips up from the track, and a quick drying concrete was used to fill the troughs. The repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more of the concrete, as the on-site resources had been used up, but eventually the race director was happy the race could restart. Kanaan and Power drove around to survey the repairs, acting as driver representatives, and although Kanaan particularly did not sound confident that they would hold up, they agreed to try and continue racing. There was some confusion <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the restart; no repairs were allowed, and the teams could change tires, but had to remain on the same compound. This led to J.R. Hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work, and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on the harder tires, which were the slower compound.|$|E

This has caused some controversy as well as confusion <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the Academy, which would have accepted a submission from either Germany or Austria. Martin Schweighofer, head of the Austrian Film Commission, has expressed that he isn't happy with the decision: [...] "The discomfort arises because of the vague rules of the Academy.

[...] It {{has been reported that}} the American distributor, Sony Pictures Classics, pressured Germany to submit it rather than Austria for tactical reasons, since Austrian films have been nominated {{two years in a row}} with 2007's The Counterfeiters and 2008's Revanche.|$|E

Lost show runner Damon Lindelof said the fifth season of the show has [...] "flung major characters across decades, leaving them — and the audience — feverishly attempting to keep events straight and the end game in sight." [...] In [...] "The Variable", the viewers would get a few more pieces of the puzzle, Lindelof said, and added: [...] "We're not promising any big whiz-bang flash pyrotechnics, but it does serve as a companion piece to another memorable episode, last season's 'The Constant', in which Desmond endured vicious, turbulence-caused side effects from traveling in time." [...] Lindelof also commented that the fifth season is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of time travel as explained by Daniel, and said, [...] "We've never done a flashback story for Daniel, so he's very mysterious. Some of those mysteries will be answered in this episode." [...] Since Lindelof and his show runner partner Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "The Constant", they thought the [...] "sister episode" [...] should be written by someone other than them, which led to Kitsis and Horowitz writing it.
