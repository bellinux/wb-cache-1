50|$|Congenital {{syphilis}} in {{the newborn}} {{can be prevented}} by screening mothers during early pregnancy and treating those who are infected. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends universal screening of all pregnant women, while the World Health Organization recommends all women be tested at their first antenatal visit {{and again in the}} third trimester. If they are positive, it is recommend their partners also be treated. Congenital syphilis is still common in the developing world, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not receive antenatal care at all, and the antenatal care others receive does not include screening, and it still occasionally occurs in the developed world, as those most likely to acquire syphilis (through drug use, etc.) are least likely to receive care during pregnancy. Several measures to increase access to testing appear effective at reducing rates of congenital syphilis in low- to middle-income countries. Point-of-care testing to detect syphilis appeared to be good although {{more research is needed to}} assess its effectiveness and into improving outcomes in mothers and babies.|$|E
50|$|Those {{who support}} {{prohibition}} or abolition of prostitution argue that keeping prostitution illegal {{is the best}} way to prevent abusive and dangerous activities (child prostitution, human trafficking etc.). They argue that a system which allows legalized and regulated prostitution has very negative effects and does not improve the situation of the prostitutes; such legal systems only lead to crime and abuse: many women who work in licensed brothels are still controlled by outside pimps; many brothel owners are criminals themselves; the creation of a legal and regulated prostitution industry only leads to another parallel illegal industry, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not want to register and work legally (since this would rob them of their anonymity) and other women can not be hired by legal brothels because of underlying problems (e.g., drug abuse); legalizing prostitution makes it more socially acceptable to buy sex, creating a huge demand for prostitutes (both by local men and by foreigners engaging in sex tourism) and, as a result, human trafficking and underage prostitution increase in order to satisfy this demand.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{statistics}} in South Africa shows that women mostly experience poverty {{as compared to}} their male counterparts. In {{the context of the}} experience of poverty by women, several Old Testament scholars have convincingly explored the theme of poverty in the Hebrew Bible. In her contextual rereading of the Naomi-Ruth Story, Madipoane Masenya (ngwan’a Mphahlele) links the issue of poverty to the theme of land. Also, from the historical-critical and partly, the contextual approach to ancient texts, Esias E. Meyer argues that Leviticus 25 : 8 – 55 holds liberating possibilities for women who are invisible in such a text. Based on the argument made by the preceding scholars, firstly, this article argues that in the context from which the texts of Ruth 4 and Leviticus 25 : 8 – 55 emerged, some women were both landless and poor. Secondly, it is argued in this article that the context of these texts carries a striking resemblance to the situation of women in modern South Africa, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not own productive land and are poor. Thirdly, this article poses the question: What implications do the ideologies of Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara and the hermeneutical approach of Fernando F.

40|$|Introduction: HIV {{prevalence}} among {{pregnant women}} in Kenya is high. Furthermore, {{there is a}} high risk of maternal mortality, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not give birth with a skilled healthcare provider. Previous research suggests that fears of HIV testing and unwanted disclosure of HIV status may be important barriers to utilizing maternity services. We explored relationships between women's perceptions of HIV-related stigma and their attitudes and intentions regarding facility-based childbirth. Methods: 1, 777 pregnant women were interviewed at their first antenatal care visit. We included socio-demographic characteristics, stigma scales, HIV knowledge measures, and an 11 -item scale measuring health facility birth attitudes (HFBA). HFBA includes items on cost, transport, comfort, interpersonal relations, and services during delivery at a health facility versus at home. A higher mean HFBA score indicates a more positive attitude towards facility-based childbirth. The mean HFBA score was dichotomized at the median and analyses were conducted with this dichotomized HFBA score using mixed effects logit models. Results: Women who anticipated HIV-related stigma from their male partner had lower adjusted odds of having positive attitudes about giving birth at the health facility (adjusted OR =. 63, 95 % CI 0. 50 - 0. 78) and less positive attitudes about health facility birth were strongly related to women's intention to give birth outside a health facility (adjusted OR = 5. 56, 95 % CI 2. 69 - 11. 51). Conclusions: In this sample of pregnant women in rural Kenya, those who anticipated HIV-related stigma were less likely to have positive attitudes towards facility-based childbirth. Furthermore, negative attitudes about facility-based childbirth were associated with the intention to deliver outside a health facility. Thus, HIV-related stigma reduction efforts might result in more positive attitudes towards facility-based childbirth, and thereby lead to an increased level of skilled birth attendance, and reductions in maternal and infant mortality...|$|E

40|$|Carrier {{screening}} for hemoglobinopathies (HbPs; {{sickle cell disease}} and thalassemia) aims to facilitate autonomous reproductive decision-making. In {{the absence of a}} Dutch national HbP carrier screening program, some primary care midwives offer screening on an ad hoc basis. This qualitative descriptive study explores how pregnant women perceive an offer of HbP carrier screening by their midwife. Semi-structured interviews (n = 26) were conducted with pregnant women at risk of being a HbP carrier, and whom were offered screening at their booking appointment in one of two midwifery practices in Amsterdam. The results showed that half of the respondents were familiar with HbPs. Generally, women perceived the offer of HbP carrier screening as positive, and most women (n = 19) accepted screening. Seven declined, of whom two already knew their carrier status. Important reasons to accept screening were to obtain knowledge about their own carrier status and health of their unborn child, and the ease of the procedure. A multistep process of decision-making was observed, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>did</b> not give follow-up testing (e. g. partner, invasive diagnostics) much consideration while deciding on accepting or declining HbP screening. Women experienced information overload, and preferred receiving the information at a different moment (e. g. before the intake by a leaflet, or preconceptionally). In conclusion, while prenatal HbP carrier screening is perceived as positive, informed decision-making seems to be suboptimal, and both the content and timing of the information provided needs improvemen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Overweight {{and obesity}} are {{prevalent}} among {{young women and}} are greater among minority and low-income women. The postpartum period is critical in women’s weight trajectories <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not lose their pregnancy weight, and others lose some and then plateau or experience weight gain. Excess weight puts women {{at greater risk of}} chronic disease and thus weight loss in the postpartum period may be key to the long-term health of young women. This paper describes the design and methods of a randomized clinical trial of Fresh Start, an innovative narrative-based group intervention aimed at promoting postpartum weight loss among low-income, diverse women. Methods/design Study participants were recruited from the five sites of the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program in central Massachusetts. Participants were English-speaking, age[*]≥[*] 18  years, 6  weeks to 6  months postpartum, with a body mass index (BMI) [*]≥[*] 27  kg/m 2. The Fresh Start postpartum weight loss intervention, adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in collaboration with WIC staff and clients, consisted of an 8 -week group-based curriculum followed by nine monthly telephone calls. It included a narrative component (i. e., storytelling), group discussions, print materials and access to exercise facilities. The study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial. The control condition included print materials and access to exercise facilities. In-person assessments were conducted at baseline and at 6 and 12  months following the eight-week intervention phase.

It was women's talk that Asmund the Priest {{was the father of}} this child also; but when he heard it he was angry, and said that no witchwoman should bear a bairn of his, howsoever fair she was. Nevertheless, it was still said that the child was his, and it is certain that he loved it as a man loves his own; but of all things, this is the hardest to know. When Groa was questioned she laughed darkly, as was her fashion, and said that she knew nothing of it, never having seen the face of the child's father, who rose out of the sea at night. And for this cause some thought him to have been a wizard or the wraith of her dead husband; but others said that Groa lied, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> have <b>done</b> on such matters.

40|$|Pakistan is {{the sixth}} most populous {{country in the}} world, with about 180 million people and an annual growth rate of 2. 1 %. The {{statistics}} show that the population will increase, as by 2025 the population estimated is 229. 6 million people (Population reference bureau 2012). This increase may be possible, <b>as</b> there are <b>many</b> factors influencing the fertility and birth rate. For example, the social set-up of unequal power relation, the gender issue and the traditional scenario of Pakistani society, along with the high desire of large family size {{makes it difficult for}} women to adopt contraceptive methods, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> of the <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not seem to have the decision right. Therefore, this study found it relevant to explore some of the factors influencing the decision-making process in contraceptive uptake by interviewing Pakistani women from Lahore, the second largest city in the country. By using a qualitative approach, with individual interviews conducted, the analysis showed that factors such as the husbands pressure, the socio-cultural influences, the lack of autonomy rights among women, the role of mother in law as well as rural/urban and economic differences mpact on the decision making process on contraception. The finding suggests {{that there is a need}} to address some of the factors, such as educating/empowering women and raising awareness on contraception, as some women declared that they never heard about it.

40|$|Pain is a {{subjective}} phenomenon and is, in varying degrees, an inherent {{part of the}} childbirth experience. However, most Western societies view suffering as unacceptable and as such, regard analgesia <b>as</b> a necessity. <b>Many</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not anticipate the intensity of pain experienced in childbirth and are, therefore, not ready to manage this amount of pain when it occurs. This prospective study compared the expected and experienced labour pain of 99 primiparous women, aged 17 - 40 years. The relationship between expected and experienced pain and acceptance of pregnancy; identification with the motherhood role; relationship with mother; relationship with husband/partner; preparation for labour (knowledge); fear of pain, helplessness and loss of control in labour; concern {{for the well-being of}} self and baby; age, and obstetric history was also investigated. The Prenatal Self Evaluation Inventory was completed at 35 - 39 weeks gestation. Visual Analogue Scales and the Present Pain Intensity of the McGill Pain Questionnaire assessed I) the expected pain, prenatally, and 2) the experienced pain, intrapartum (3 ̆c 3 cm, 4 - 7 cm and 3 ̆eBern cervical dilatation) and two hours postpartum. A significant difference was found between expected pain and pain experienced during early and transitional labour. Generally, the level of pain expected was that of active labour and not the intensity of reported pain experienced in transitional labour. The findings demonstrated positive correlations between expected pain and pain reported in early and transitional labour. A positive relationship was revealed between conflict in the relationship with mother, fear of pain, helplessness and loss of control during labour and expected pain. Women with less preparation for labour were more likely to expect increased pain. There was also a positive relationship between conflict in the acceptance of the pregnancy, concern for the well-being of self and the baby, one or more terminations of pregnancy and experienced childbirth pain. A profile of women more likely to experience increased pain was developed. Caregivers should direct interventions and strategies towards women with this profile in order to prepare women more realistically for childbirth pain...|$|R
