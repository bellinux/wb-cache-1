5|$|Brooks Robinson won 16 Gold Gloves {{with the}} Baltimore Orioles, leading both the American League and all third basemen in awards won. Mike Schmidt {{is second in}} wins at third base; he won 10 with the Philadelphia Phillies and leads National League third basemen in Gold Gloves. Scott Rolen has the third-highest total, winning eight awards with the Phillies, the St. Louis Cardinals, and the Cincinnati Reds. Six-time winners <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base</b> are Buddy Bell, Eric Chavez, and Robin Ventura. Ken Boyer, Doug Rader, and Ron Santo have each won five Gold Gloves <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base,</b> and four-time winners include Adrián Beltré, Gary Gaetti, Nolan Arenado and Matt Williams. Hall of Famers who have won a Gold Glove at the {{position}} include Robinson, Schmidt, Santo, Wade Boggs, and George Brett.|$|E
5|$|Ken Boyer and Clete Boyer are {{the only}} pair of {{brothers}} to have won Gold Glove Awards <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base.</b> Older brother Ken won five Gold Gloves in six years with the Cardinals (19581961, 1963), and Clete won in 1969 with the Atlanta Braves.|$|E
5|$|Uribe began 2013 as {{a utility}} player. However, he made {{frequent}} starts <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base,</b> and by June, {{he had taken}} over the position. On July 5, Uribe had seven RBIs and was a single short of hitting for the cycle in a 10–2 victory over the Giants.|$|E

40|$|In the {{evolution}} of highly conserved genes, a few "synonymous" substitutions <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>bases</b> that would not alter the protein sequence are forbidden or very rare, presumably {{as a result of}} functional requirements of the gene or the messenger RNA. Another 10 % or 20 % of codons are significantly less variable by synonymous substitution than are the majority of codons. The changes that occur at the majority of <b>third</b> <b>bases</b> are subject to codon usage restrictions. These usage restrictions control sequence similarities between very distant genes. For example, 70 % of <b>third</b> <b>bases</b> are identical in calmodulin genes of man and trypanosome. Third-base similarities of distant genes for conserved proteins are mathematically predicted, {{on the basis of the}} G+C composition of <b>third</b> <b>bases.</b> These observations indicate the need for reexamination of methods used to calculate synonymous substitutions...|$|R
5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base</b> draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base,</b> but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{statistical}} analysis indicates Robinson was an outstanding fielder throughout his {{ten years in}} the major leagues and at virtually every position he played. After playing his rookie season at first base, Robinson spent most of his career as a second baseman. He led the league in fielding among second basemen in 1950 and 1951. Toward the end of his career, he played about 2,000 innings <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base</b> and about 1,175 innings in the outfield, excelling at both.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Orioles signed {{free agent}} shortstop Mike Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to third base permanently. General manager Pat Gillick {{said that the}} move was made not because of {{problems}} by Ripken but because more defensive options were available at shortstop than <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base.</b> Had Ripken not wanted {{to move back to}} third base, the Orioles likely would have signed Tim Naehring instead.|$|E

5|$|Trent Durrington {{became the}} only Australian {{position}} player to pitch in an MLB game when he appeared for the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 April 2004 against the Houston Astros. Durrington had already entered the game initially as a pinch hitter and remained in the game playing <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base.</b> With two outs {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning, Durrington faced one hitter and induced a fly ball out.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting one}} {{out in the}} top of the 7th, Steve Trachsel allowed a single and a walk to pinch hitters Brent Mayne and Armando Ríos respectively. The Cubs double switched, {{bringing}} in Matt Karchner to relieve Trachsel and Orlando Merced to play left field. Karchner induced another out before loading the bases on a single by Shawon Dunston. Félix Heredia entered in relief of Karchner and got Barry Bonds to ground out to first base to end the inning. The Cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the 8th inning. After Alvin Morman got Morandini to strike out to open the inning the Giants double switched to bring in José Mesa to pitch and Bill Mueller <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base.</b> Mesa allowed a single to Sammy Sosa and a double to Mark Grace which advanced Sosa to third. Following a ground out Mesa threw a wild pitch while facing Gaetti and Sosa scored to make the game 5–0.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2014 season, {{he was set}} {{to compete}} for {{a spot on the}} bench, as Amaro {{declared}} that he was not good enough, particularly defensively, to play everyday. However, the Phillies placed him on the disabled list (DL) due to a strained oblique; his estimated recovery time was around the end of April or the beginning of May. When Ruf returned, he played for the IronPigs, but suffered another injury on June 3, fracturing his left wrist when sliding into the wall while playing left field. He returned to the major league Phillies on July 22 when John Mayberry, Jr. landed on the disabled list, but struggled in his first several games; in his first 17 at-bats, he had just two hits. Nevertheless, the Phillies toyed with platooning him with Ryan Howard, who was also struggling, at first base, and Ruf also played two innings <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base.</b> Overall, Ruf amassed only 117 major league plate appearances, and was significantly hindered by injuries.|$|E

5|$|Huggins {{continued}} {{to tinker with}} his roster during the offseason. He traded Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins, and acquired Lyn Lary from the Pacific Coast League. He tried Lary <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base</b> and Leo Durocher at shortstop, while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases. The Yankees fell behind the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and as {{it became clear that}} the Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey about the future of the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel in left field. However, by August 1929 Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling ill.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Uribe {{signed with}} the Giants and was again used as utility player. He spent most of 2010 as the Giants' shortstop, hit a career-high 24 home runs, and had several key hits in the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Following that season, he signed a three-year {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The next two years were plagued by injuries and poor hitting, but he regained his starting role <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base</b> and made strong contributions to the team in 2013 and 2014. Uribe {{was traded to the}} Braves in late May of the 2015 season and again to the Mets in July of the 2015 season. Before the start of spring training in 2016, he signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was injured by a ground ball on June 12, 2016 and was later diagnosed with a testicular contusion. The Indians designated him for assignment on August 1 and released him on August 5.|$|E
5|$|Nevin {{suffered}} a dislocated shoulder {{in spring training}} in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had surgery on his left shoulder {{and returned to the}} Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season in left field. Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base,</b> Nevin's favorite position. Nevin offered to be used in a utility role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier Nady in right field. In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBI {{for the third time in}} his career, but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in July.|$|E

5|$|Of the 70 players picked in {{the first}} round by the Sox, 31 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 20 of these were right-handed, while 11 were left-handed. 19 of the players picked in the initial round were outfielders, while nine shortstops, four first basemen, four catchers, and two second basemen were {{selected}}. The team also selected one player <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base.</b> Ten of the players came from high schools or universities in the state of California, while Texas and South Carolina follow with seven and six players, respectively.

5|$|The third son of Arthur Percival Howell Kippax and {{his wife}} Sophie Estelle (née Craigie), Alan Kippax {{was born in the}} inner-city Sydney suburb of Paddington. He {{attended}} both Bondi and Cleveland Street Public schools. At 14, Kippax joined Waverley (now Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club) and was a regular in the first-grade team within three years. At this stage, first-class cricket was suspended because of World War I, but when competition resumed in the 191819 season he made his debut for New South Wales (NSW). However, the state possessed a lot of batting talent, which was supplemented by the return to Australia of the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team that played in England after the armistice. Therefore, Kippax’s opportunities were restricted for a number of seasons. He also played a lot of baseball with the Waverley Baseball Club (usually <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base)</b> and represented Australia against touring teams from American universities.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} McGwire and Sosa were honored, Cal Ripken, Jr. and Tony Gwynn, {{both of whom}} retired after the 2001 season, {{received}} the award and were honored at the 2001 MLB All-Star Game; Ripken {{was elected to the}} American League All-Star team as a starter <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base,</b> while Gwynn was later added as an honorary member of the National League team. During the first inning of the game, Rodriguez, who had been elected the starter at shortstop—the position at which Ripken played for most of his career—switched positions with Ripken for the first inning of the game as a tribute. Including the presentation of the award to the Mariners following the season, the 2001 season's three awards are the most presented in a single year.|$|E

50|$|The Astros' {{patience}} with Yelding paid early dividends, as he became their full-time leadoff hitter in 1990 and {{finished second in}} the National League with 64 stolen bases.

Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez has won three American League Silver Sluggers at the position, and has ten wins in his career as he {{accumulated}} seven wins at shortstop with the Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers. Two National League third basemen have also won three Silver Sluggers. Matt Williams won the award in 1990, 1993, and 1994, {{when he was on}} pace to tie Roger Maris' home run record of 61 before the players' strike; Vinny Castilla won three awards in four years for the Colorado Rockies (1995, 1997–1998). Chase Headley and Miguel Cabrera are the most recent winners.|$|E
5|$|Game 3 {{matched the}} Giants' Juan Marichal against Johnny Podres, though Dodgers' manager Walt Alston had {{considered}} starting reliever Larry Sherry. The pair kept the game scoreless through two innings before the Giants opened the scoring {{in the top}} of the third. José Pagán singled to lead off the inning, Marichal reached on a throwing error by the pitcher on a throw to second base which allowed Pagán to move to third, and Pagán scored on a Harvey Kuenn single. Then, while Chuck Hiller was batting, John Roseboro made an error in attempting to pickoff Marichal on second base, allowing him to advance to third. Hiller hit a fly ball to shallow left field and Marichal held <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base.</b> Left fielder Duke Snider threw home but the ball was cut off by the third baseman, who threw to second to try to catch Kuenn in a rundown between first and second. However, the second baseman's throw to first hit Kuenn in the back, leaving him safe at first and allowing Marichal to score, to make the game 2–0. Felipe Alou then singled, Kuenn went to third, and Alou advanced to second on the throw. Podres intentionally walked Willie Mays to load the bases with one out, and induced a double play from Orlando Cepeda to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} inning, after {{striking}} out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem {{gave up a}} solo home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came {{into the bottom of}} the first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run <b>at</b> <b>third</b> <b>base,</b> Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up to the plate with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a solo home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.|$|E
