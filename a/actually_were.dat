5|$|In July 2015, Mark Webber {{released}} his long-awaited autobiography, Aussie Grit. The book covers his journey from Queanbeyan to {{the pinnacle of}} Formula 1 and during his book tour he candidly discusses his relationship with former Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel and how the media portrayed things differently to how they <b>actually</b> <b>were.</b>|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} 1995 Sugar Bowl by virtue of winning the Big East football championship. The Hokies, who finished 92 during the regular season, <b>actually</b> <b>were</b> co-Big East champions. The University of Miami, which tied the Hokies, was ineligible for post-season play due to sanctions imposed as a result of recruiting rules violations. The Hokies played the University of Texas, which finished 1011 during the regular season en route to becoming Southwest Conference champions. The Southwest Conference was scheduled to disband after the football season, but its champion was guaranteed one of the at-large spots in the Bowl Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Dalmazzo urged Roatta {{to expand}} Italian links with Serb {{nationalist}} groups into {{an alliance with}} them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were {{under the impression that}} the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they <b>actually</b> <b>were.</b> For example, Roatta {{was under the impression that}} Jevđević represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, and that they were aligned with Dangić. In early March, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jevđević sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorović and were concentrating around Nevesinje ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.|$|E

Micropsia is an abnormal visual condition, usually {{occurring in the}} context of visual hallucination, in which affected persons see objects as being smaller than those objects <b>actually</b> <b>are.</b> Macropsia is a condition where the individual sees everything larger than it <b>actually</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R

5|$|Hotze was sorely missed. Despite mis-communication {{between and}} among the British, the Austrians and the Russians, the British miscalculation {{of the size of}} troops (consistently 10–25percent higher than they <b>actually</b> <b>were),</b> the lack of Swiss volunteers, and failed {{promises}} of transport mules, Suvorov organized his impressive march across the Alps from northern Italy, counting on Korsakov and his Austrian allies to hold Zürich. His soldiers took the pass at St. Gotthard in a bayonet charge, and endured incredible hardships navigating the narrow trails of the Alps. By the time the Russian army reached Schwyz, preparing to descend from the mountains into the Zürich plain, Masséna's army already had crushed the incompetent Korsakov's force at Zürich, and, in Hotze's absence, Jean-de-Dieu Soult's French division overwhelmed the Austrian flank at Schänis and crossed the Linth unhindered. When Suvorov cleared the mountains, he had nowhere to go; he was forced to withdraw in another arduous march into the Vorarlberg, where his starving and ragged army arrived in late October. Between Korsakov's inability to hold the French at Zürich, and Hotze's death at Schänis, the Swiss campaign degenerated to an utter shambles.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in {{the year}} since {{publication}} received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) <b>actually</b> <b>were</b> contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E

40|$|Consider the {{following}} counterfactual claims: (1) that, if the World Trade Center had not collapsed, everything {{else would have}} been maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>was</b> (2) that, if the World Trade Center had not collapsed and everything else had been maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>was,</b> everything else would have been maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>was.</b> Robert Stalnaker says: Consider a possible world in which A is true, and which otherwise differs minimally from the actual world. “If A, then B ” is true (false) just in case B is true (false) in that possible world. (1968, pp. 33 ‐ 34) On Stalnaker’s analysis, (1) and (2) are equivalent to (S 1) and (S 2), respectively: (S 1) that, in the nearest possible {{world in which the}} World Trade Center did not collapse, everything else is maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>is</b> (S 2) that, in the nearest possible world in which the World Trade Center did not collapse and everything else is maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>is...</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the same}} interview, Borges also criticized famed Marxist poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca, who was {{abducted}} by Nationalist soldiers and executed without trial during the Spanish Civil War. In Borges' opinion, Lorca's poetry and plays, when examined against his tragic death, appeared {{better than they}} <b>actually</b> <b>were.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} high regard for natural law and {{for the idea of}} a {{universe}} without miracles, deists were especially susceptible to the temptations of determinism. Reflecting the intellectual climate of the time, there were differences among deists about freedom and determinism. Some, such as Anthony Collins, <b>actually</b> <b>were</b> necessitarians.|$|E

25|$|During the offensive, {{the work}} done by the 1st Aero Squadron was of the most importance, giving divisional commanders the vital {{information}} as to where the front line elements <b>actually</b> <b>were,</b> where artillery barrages need to be laid down {{in advance of the}} infantry and for causing disruption to enemy forces behind his lines. Later, as positions became stabilized, photographs were obtained behind enemy lines to learn the dispositions of enemy forces.|$|E
25|$|Nupedia was {{powered by}} NupeCode {{collaborative}} software. NupeCode is free/open source software (released under the GNU General Public License) designed for large peer review projects. The code was available via Nupedia's CVS repository. One {{of the problems}} experienced by Nupedia during much of its existence was that the software lacked functionality. Much of the missing functionality had been mocked-up using underlined blocks of text which appeared to be hyperlinks, but <b>actually</b> <b>were</b> not.|$|E
25|$|The {{relatives}} of those executed {{in and around}} Surdulica were harassed and persecuted by Bulgarian authorities following the massacre. An American writer named William A. Drayton visited Macedonia and southern Serbia between December 1918 and January 1919 {{as part of a}} Serbian commission investigating Bulgarian war crimes in these regions. Drayton noted in his diary that he interviewed fifteen eyewitnesses who charged that Bulgarian forces deported Serbs to Surdulica and executed a portion of them there in accordance with pre-determined lists of names. The rest, according to the witnesses, <b>actually</b> <b>were</b> deported to Sofia.|$|E

25|$|The Khan also {{employed}} {{tactics that}} made his numbers seem greater than they <b>actually</b> <b>were.</b> During night operations he ordered each soldier to light three torches at dusk to give the illusion of an overwhelming army and deceive and intimidate enemy scouts. He also sometimes had objects tied to the tails of his horses, so that riding on open and dry fields raised {{a cloud of dust}} that gave the enemy the impression of great numbers. His soldiers used arrows specially notched to whistle as they flew through the air, creating a terrifying noise.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 Sagan was {{a member}} of the AdHoc Committee to Review Project Blue Book, the U.S.Air Force's UFO {{investigation}} project. The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the Condon Committee (1966–68), led by physicist Edward Condon, and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of them <b>actually</b> <b>were,</b> did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security.|$|E
25|$|On {{the flight}} home, Musk {{realized}} that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket <b>actually</b> <b>were</b> only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration, producing around 85% of launch hardware in-house, and the modular approach from software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price {{by a factor of}} ten and still enjoy a 70 percent gross margin. SpaceX started with the smallest useful orbital rocket, instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle, which could have failed and bankrupted the company.|$|E

25|$|To deceive the Americans {{into believing}} {{there were more}} British troops than there <b>actually</b> <b>were,</b> Brock's force carried out several bluffs. At the {{suggestion}} of Major Thomas Evans, the Brigade Major at Fort George, Brock gave his militia the cast-off uniforms of the 41st Regiment to make Hull believe most of the British force were regulars. The troops were told to light individual fires instead of one fire per unit, thereby creating {{the illusion of a}} much larger army. They marched to take up positions in plain sight of the Americans then quickly ducked behind entrenchments, and marched back out of sight to repeat the manoeuvre. The same trick was carried out during meals, where the line would dump their beans into a hidden pot, then return out of view to rejoin the end of the queue.|$|E
25|$|Machen {{also was}} at this time {{investigating}} Celtic Christianity, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Publishing his views in Lord Alfred Douglas's The Academy, for which he wrote regularly, Machen concluded that the legends of the Grail <b>actually</b> <b>were</b> based on dim recollections of the rites of the Celtic Church. These ideas also featured strongly in the novel The Secret Glory which he wrote at this time, marking the first use in fiction {{of the idea of}} the Grail's surviving into modern times in some form, an idea much utilised ever since, as by Charles Williams (War in Heaven), Dan Brown (The Da Vinci Code) and George Lucas (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). In 1907, The Hill of Dreams, generally considered Machen's masterpiece, was finally published, though it was not recognized much at the time.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Cold Harbor in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's 1864 Overland Campaign, the Union Army of the Potomac {{slipped away}} from Gen. Robert E. Lee and began {{crossing}} the James River. Although the Overland Campaign's objective {{had been to}} defeat Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in a decisive battle, Grant changed his objective to be the city of Petersburg, an important rail junction that controlled the supplies leading to the Confederate capital of Richmond. Grant knew that Lee could not protect Richmond if Petersburg fell {{and he would be}} forced to battle Grant in the open. He also knew from the unsuccessful first assaults on June 9 how weak the Petersburg defenses <b>actually</b> <b>were.</b> Speed was essential to Grant's plan, requiring success before Lee realized Grant's objective and could reinforce Petersburg. Lee was not in fact fully cognizant of Grant's moves until June 18, assuming until then that Grant would target Richmond. Beauregard, however, had been loudly warning of the danger to Petersburg since June 9.|$|E
