5|$|<b>An</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> the 16th and 17th floors {{has been}} the {{official}} residence of the premier of Quebec since 2001. These two floors, the highest habitable ones since the 18th floor is taken up by machinery, had originally been reserved for a CDP executive suite. There had been a previous attempt at offering the premier an official residence. In 1994, the Quebec City Chamber of Commerce had bought a large residence at 1080 rue des Braves and donated it to then premier Jacques Parizeau. There were issues of security and neighbour relationships, however, and Lucien Bouchard declined to use it. He {{lived in a small}} apartment on Parliament Hill for most of his mandate.|$|E

5|$|Reich {{first met}} Sigmund Freud in 1919 {{when he asked}} Freud for a reading list for a seminar {{concerning}} sexology. It seems they left a strong impression on each other. Freud allowed him to start meeting with analytic patients in September that year, although Reich was just 22 years old and still an undergraduate, which gave him a small income. He was accepted as a guest member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association, becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own analysis with Isidor Sadger. He lived and worked out of <b>an</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> Berggasse 7, the street on which Freud lived at no. 19, in the Alsergrund area of Vienna.|$|E
