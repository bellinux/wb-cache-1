500|$|Davey {{performed}} a nationwide tour in late May 2007, debuting songs from her follow-up album which she initially {{referred to as}} Silversleeve. All {{but two of the}} songs were recorded in her home. The album, released under the title Tales of Silversleeve and produced by Liam Howe of Sneaker Pimps, was preceded by [...] "Reuben", its first single, on 21 September 2007. Davey explained the title choice, [...] "I had a runny nose when I was a child and let's just say I didn't wipe it with a tissue". This proved to be a successful move as it led to a Choice Music Prize nomination for 2007 Irish Album of the Year. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "even more imaginative" [...] than her debut and gave it four out of five stars. entertainment.ie reviewer Lauren Murphy described the record as [...] "Without doubt, one of the best albums of the year", noting [...] "there's a magic about Tales of Silversleeve that makes it an album you're almost afraid to listen to twice, in case it's not as good <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> the first time". The Irish Independent's reviewer gave the album five stars, describing it as [...] "a record that she can be proud of". Jim Carroll, The Irish Times rock critic, called it [...] "The most charming pop album you'll hear in Zero Seven".|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. As far <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>{{remember}}!</b> Do {{you remember}} her name? (Hears it and bows her head.) Thank you, my husband.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nathoo! Ohe, Nathoo!" [...] said Mowgli, for, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> {{that was}} the name Messua gave him {{when he first came}} to the Man-Pack.|$|E
60|$|Mary and I (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>remember)</b> {{had left}} the bailiff alone at the decoy, and had set forth on our way {{together}} to Dermody's cottage.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are two," [...] {{replied the}} lawyer, [...] "only two; and the sum, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>remember,</b> is five hundred a year--and unburdened, I forgot to add, unburdened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Interestin' beasts, don't you think? But unsociable! Nasty rude {{ways with}} strangers, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>remember.</b> So I rigged this {{framework}} which keeps them from bein' too pressin' in their attentions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> me," [...] {{the visitor}} said, rising awkwardly, as Sewell {{came forward with}} a smile of inquiry. [...] "My name's Barker." ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{the person}} (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> no doubt) {{who led the}} way in these pages, and opened the story. I am also the person who is left behind, as it were, to close the story up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Master, but not easily. Remember, {{it was on}} a chain {{about the}} man's neck, and I could not draw it over his head, for, like his hands, his throat was tied by a cord, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> yours was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] {{continued}} Phil, [...] "George is such {{a splendid}} fellow, and, <b>as</b> maybe <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> lived with us long ago. May {{will be glad to}} meet him; and he saved Mr Blurt's life, so you see--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Do <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> he said, when we {{knew each}} other first? The first morning we met {{you asked me to}} show you the way to the {{matriculation}} class, putting a very strong stress on the first syllable. <b>You</b> <b>remember?</b> Then <b>you</b> used to address the jesuits <b>as</b> father, <b>you</b> <b>remember?</b> I ask myself about you: IS HE AS INNOCENT AS HIS SPEECH? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wife," [...] he said, [...] "here is our cousin, Elsa Brant, come {{to visit}} us from The Hague, though why I know not <b>as</b> yet. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> Elsa, the little Elsa, with whom {{we used to play}} so many years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} to {{interfere}} with your movements," [...] Maraton said calmly. [...] "Where you are is nothing to me. I proposed that you should remain away from London simply because I fancied that it would be easier for you to observe the conditions which exist between us. So long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> them, however, your whereabouts are indifferent to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{thoroughly}} congratulate you,' said Sir Gregory. 'You have justified my choice, {{and done}} your duty with credit to yourself and {{benefit to the}} public. I hope you may go on and prosper. As long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> that your own interests should always be kept in subservience {{to those of the}} public service, you will not fail to receive the praise which such conduct deserves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, then," [...] said Tom, drawing {{aside from}} the step; [...] "Mrs. Vavasour will be anxious about you. And mind! With regard to her first of all, sir, and then with regard to other matters--as long, and only as long, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> that you are John Briggs of Whitbury, I shall {{be the first to}} forget it. There is my hand, for old acquaintance' sake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>remember,</b> two {{or three}} people coming in to dinner," [...] she said. [...] "I have no doubt I could think out some excuse if you would sooner not come down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hardly a present; but {{you shall}} {{look at it}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> Rapinsky, do <b>you</b> not?" [...] Now Rapinsky was the {{jeweller}} in the Grosser Ring, and Nina, though she well remembered {{the man and the}} shop, did not at the moment remember the name. [...] "You will not have forgotten this at any rate," [...] said Trendellsohn, bringing the necklace from out of his pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{course she}} ought--that is what I said all along; {{and she would}} have known if we hadn't been two old fools. Well, give me the {{contents}} of the letter <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can <b>remember</b> them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{never were}} two happier creatures for twenty-two years," [...] said Dr. May, {{his voice low}} with emotion. [...] "Sorrow spared her! Yes, think of her always in undimmed brightness--always smiling <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> her. She was happy. She is," [...] he concluded. His friend had turned aside and hidden {{his face with his}} hands, then looked up for a moment, [...] "And you, Dick," [...] he said briefly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You say {{you feel}} what your sins are; {{think of them}} all as you lie, each one <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> it; say it out in your heart to our Saviour, and pray God to forgive it for His sake, and then think that it cost some of the pain He bore on the Cross, some of the drops of His agony in the Garden. Each sin of ours was indeed of that burden!' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{my story}} must now clamber out of King Pluto's dominions, {{and see what}} Mother Ceres had been about, since she was bereft of her daughter. We had a glimpse of her, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> half hidden among the waving grain, while the four black steeds were swiftly {{whirling}} along the chariot, in which her beloved Proserpina was so unwillingly borne away. You recollect, too, the loud scream which Proserpina gave, just when the chariot was out of sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've one sister, but {{no other}} near relatives. But I expect {{to spend some time}} with people you know. The Chisholms are old family friends, and, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>remember,</b> it was through them that I first {{approached}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{feeling on}} the subject was so strong that, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>remember,</b> I {{declined}} to act as your secretary. I am perhaps over-sensitive, but I could not have written your book <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would have dictated it to me, and <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did indeed dictate it to your various secretaries." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{complete}} {{was your}} {{exposure of the}} methods of those at work to blacken a person whom they knew to be innocent, that, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>remember,</b> they refused to publish your analysis which destroyed their charges and, incidentally, revealed their motives.|$|R
6000|$|And though, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> {{in a fit}} [...] Of wrath and rhyme, when {{juvenile}} and curly, [...] I rail'd at Scots to show my wrath and wit, [...] Which must be own'd {{was sensitive}} and surly, [...] Yet 't is in vain such sallies to permit, [...] They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early: [...] I 'scotch'd not kill'd' the Scotchman in my blood, [...] And love the land of 'mountain and of flood.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I can’t {{say that}} Davidson {{occupied}} a very prominent place. Moral excellence seldom does. He was quietly appreciated {{by those who}} knew him well; but his more obvious distinction consisted in this, that he was married. Ours, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> was a bachelor crowd; in spirit anyhow, if not absolutely in fact. There might have been a few wives in existence, but if so they were invisible, distant, never alluded to. For what would have been the good? Davidson alone was visibly married.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} to have a moral under all its gaiety," [...] assented Syme; [...] "but may I ask you two questions? You need not fear to give me information, because, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police, a promise I shall {{certainly}} keep. So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries. First of all, what is it really all about? What is it you object to? You want to abolish Government?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing till to-night," [...] {{answered}} Ragnall with determination, [...] "when I {{am going}} to look at the snake which the noble Hans has killed and whatever lies beyond the cave, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>remember</b> Harût invited us to do unmolested, if we could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oho!" [...] laughed Zikali again. [...] "What do my ears hear? Am I, {{the poor}} Zulu cheat, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>remember</b> once <b>you</b> called me, Macumazahn, asked {{to show that}} which is hidden from all {{the wisdom of the}} great White People?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR SIR--When you did me {{the favor}} of calling here a few days since, you asked a {{question}} relating to my governess, Miss Gwilt, which I thought rather a strange one at the time, and which caused, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>remember,</b> a momentary embarrassment between us.|$|R
60|$|Where was Bowser the Hound? That was the {{question}} which was puzzling all the little people who knew him. Also it was puzzling Farmer Brown's boy and Farmer Brown and Mrs. Brown. I have {{said that it was}} puzzling all the little people who knew him. This is not quite true, because there were two who could at least guess what had become of Bowser. One was Old Man Coyote, who had, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> led Bowser far away and got him lost. The other was Blacky the Crow, who had discovered Bowser in his trouble and had helped him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had then, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> just {{returned}} to London {{after a lot}} of Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas--a regular dose of the East--six years or so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit I did get tired of resting. Then I began to look for a ship--I should think the hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn't even look at me. And I got tired of that game too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Trickery can't {{account for}} that yellow line. The {{messages}} {{could have been}} written beforehand, but no trick of prepared slates can account for my dictated design. I have had other cases of slate-writing which were almost as inexplicable, and Crookes and Wallace and Zöllner, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> were quite convinced by evidence thus secured. Crookes saw the pencil at work. I have never witnessed the writing, but I have heard it at work under my hands and I have felt it under my feet. I have had writing on ten separate pages in a closed Manila-pad held between my hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Deserted, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>remember</b> Mr Venus, by {{the waning}} [...] moon, [...] When stars, it will {{occur to you}} before I mention it, {{proclaim}} [...] night's cheerless noon, [...] On tower, fort, or tented ground, [...] The sentry walks his lonely round, [...] The sentry walks:" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{confidence}} in me {{ought to be}} returned with full confidence on my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is not, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>remember,</b> my own. I wish {{to tell you what}} that is, and why I am in England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Button-Bright {{from the}} depths of the hole. [...] "I got lost yesterday, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>remember,</b> and in the night while I was wandering around in the moonlight trying to find my way back to you, I suddenly fell into this hole." ...|$|R
