40|$|<b>Actuator</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{theory is}} an {{effective}} approach for analyzing the aerodynamic performance of vertical axis wind turbines at a conceptual design level. Existing <b>actuator</b> <b>cylinder</b> theory can analyze single turbines, but analysis of multiple turbines is often desirable because turbines may operate in near proximity within a wind farm. For vertical axis wind turbines, which tend to operate in closer proximity than do horizontal axis turbines, aerodynamic interactions may not be strictly confined to wake interactions. We modified <b>actuator</b> <b>cylinder</b> theory to permit the simultaneous solution of aerodynamic loading {{for any number of}} turbines. We also extended the theory to handle thrust coefficients outside of the momentum region and explicitly defined the additional terms needed for curved or swept blades. While the focus of this paper is a derivation of an extended methodology, an application of this theory was explored involving two turbines operating in close proximity. Comparisons were made against two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) simulations, across a full 360 ° of inflow, with excellent agreement. The counter-rotating turbines produced a 5 – 10  % increase in power across a wide range of inflow conditions. A second comparison was made to a three-dimensional RANS simulation with a different turbine under different conditions. While only one data point was available, the agreement was reasonable, with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predicting a 12  % power loss, as compared to a 15  % power loss for the <b>actuator</b> <b>cylinder</b> method.

This paper introduces a reliability assessment model {{based on a}} local stress–strain approach considering both low-cycle fatigue and high energy impact loads. Two coupling relationships between fatigue and impact are given with effects of an impact process on fatigue damage and effects of fatigue damage on impact performance. The analysis of the former modifies the fatigue parameters and the Manson–Coffin equation for fatigue life based on material theories. On the other hand, the latter proposes the coupling variables and the difference of fracture toughness caused by accumulative fatigue damage. To form an overall reliability model including both fatigue failure and impact failure, a competing risk model is developed.

40|$|A {{product that}} is {{characterized}} by fatigue-induced failure always suffers from complex fatigue loads, and {{the damage caused by}} fa-tigue loads accumulates with time. The existence of shocks not only directly increases the risk of failure but also affects the magnitude of damage caused by fatigue loads.

The comparison covers rotor configurations with two NACA 0015 blades, for several tip speed ratios, rotor solidity and fixed pitch angle, included heavily loaded rotors, in inviscid flow. The results show that the streamtube models are inaccurate, and that correct predictions of rotor power and rotor thrust are an effect of error cancellation which only occurs at specific configurations. The other four models, which explicitly model the wake as a system of vorticity, show mostly differences due to the instantaneous or time averaged formulation of the loading and flow, for which further research is needed.

40|$|A {{product line}} of {{improved}} electrohydraulic linear actuators has been developed. These actuators are designed especially {{for use in}} actuating valves in rocket-engine test facilities. They are also adaptable to many industrial uses, such as steam turbines, process control valves, dampers, motion control, etc. The advantageous features of the improved electrohydraulic linear actuators are best described with respect to shortcomings of prior electrohydraulic linear actuators that the improved ones are intended to supplant. The flow of hydraulic fluid to the two ports of the <b>actuator</b> <b>cylinder</b> is controlled by a servo valve that is controlled by a signal from a servo amplifier that, in turn, receives an analog position-command signal (a current having a value between 4 and 20 mA) from a supervisory control system of the facility.

A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) directly linked to the piston provides a position-feedback signal, which is compared with the position-command signal in the servo amplifier.

Among the aerodynamic models of VAWTs, double multi-streamtube (DMST) and <b>actuator</b> <b>cylinder</b> (AC) models are two favorable methods for fully coupled modeling and dynamic analysis of floating VAWTs in view of accuracy and computational cost. This paper deals {{with the development of}} an aerodynamic code to model floating VAWTs using the AC method developed by Madsen. It includes the tangential load term when calculating induced velocities, addresses two different approaches to calculate the normal and tangential loads acting on the rotor, and proposes a new modified linear solution to correct the linear solution. The effect of dynamic stall is also considered using the Beddoes-Leishman dynamic stall model. The developed code is verified to be accurate by a series of comparisons against other numerical models and experimental results. It is found that the effect of including the tangential load term when calculating induced velocities on the aerodynamic loads is very small. The proposed new modified linear solution can improve the power performance compared with the experiment data. Finally, a comparison of the developed AC method and the DMST method is performed using two rotors and shows that the AC method can predict more accurate aerodynamic loads and power than the DMST method, at least for the considered rotors...|$|E

The THAWT device is a horizontally deployed variant of the Darrieus cross-flow turbine, in which the blades can be oriented into a truss configuration to produce long, stiff multi-bay rotors. This thesis establishes and combines a set of numerical models, which predict the hydrodynamic and structural performance of the THAWT device, with sufficient confidence to assess the feasibility of such a device at a full scale installation and to optimise its performance. Tests of 1 / 20 th scale experimental models of the THAWT device have demonstrated that the truss configured device is capable of producing power with an efficiency close {{to that of the}} parallel configured turbine. In addition, variations in the configuration of the scale models have indicated how several design parameters affect the hydrodynamic performance of the device. A two-dimensional Navier-Stokes blade element model has been developed, in which the THAWT device is represented using an <b>actuator</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The addition of a hydrostatic free surface deformation correction has resulted in a model which is capable of matching experimental results with sufficient fidelity and accuracy.

The numerical and hydrodynamic models are combined with a Linear Channel Momentum model to predict the performance of the THAWT device at a full scale tidal location. The effect that the device has on the channel flow indicates how much energy is available for extraction and how this energy might be most efficiently obtained.
