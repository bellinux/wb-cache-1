5|$|His Defensa de los curas de Riobamba {{was written}} in {{response}} to a report from Ignacio Barreto that accused the clergy in Riobamba of various unethical practices. Among other things, the report said that the large number of religious celebrations in Riobamba (frequented by Indians) were prejudicial to Catholic faith, agriculture, industry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the Crown; also, that priests demanded money from the Indians for entrance into churches and for certain ceremonies, that priests in Riobamba were immoral and finally that most sermons were incomprehensible to the Indians.|$|E
5|$|The Dashnaktsutiun held {{a meeting}} on April 26, 1907, dubbed the Fourth General Congress, at which ARF leaders such as Aram Manukian, Hamo Ohanjanyan and Stepan Stepanian {{discussed}} their engagement in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. They established that the movement was one that had political, ideological and economic components and was thus aimed at establishing law and order, human rights <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> all working people. They also felt that it would work for the benefit and interest of Armenian-Iranians. The final vote was 25 votes in favour and one absentia.|$|E
5|$|The {{transformation}} of Hungary into a Christian state {{was one of}} Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign. Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects {{to give up their}} pagan rituals. His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity. For example, his First Book of Laws from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death. His other laws protected property rights <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.|$|E

5|$|The {{television}} industry in Croatia is {{regulated by the}} Croatian Regulatory Authority for Network Industries (HAKOM). HAKOM was established by the Electronic Communications Act of 26 June 2008; pursuant to Article 5 of the act, HAKOM is tasked with promoting and safeguarding market competition <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> service users {{in the field of}} electronic communication services and infrastructure, while contributing {{to the development of the}} internal market of the European Union. HAKOM's goals include ensuring sustainable development of the electronic communications market at affordable prices for consumers, providing fair conditions for return on investment in the market and contributing to the quality of life in Croatia. Further regulation of the television is performed by the Electronic Media Council, which enacts mandatory regulation applying to both state-run and privately owned broadcasters based in Croatia. One such regulation, aimed at protection of minors, restricts depictions of violence, sexual intercourse, profanity, use of intoxicating substances and tobacco and other scenes which may be harmful to development of minors between seven in the morning and nine, ten or eleven in the evening, depending on rating of specific programmeadvising that the programme is not suitable for persons under 12, 15 or 18 years of age respectively. The restriction does not apply to educational, documentary, science or news programming.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{with the}} pontificate of Pope Martin V (reigned 1417–1431), {{detailed}} payment records {{exist for the}} manufacture of swords and hats for every year, although the recipients are not always known. During the 15th century, popes gradually moved from the practice of presenting the swords and hats to noblemen or princes visiting Rome at Christmas time towards sending them to distant monarchs as either reward or encouragement to defend Christendom <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic Church. The practice accelerated under Pope Nicholas V (r. 1447–1455), who used the gifts to promote a military alliance against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Lanfranc {{accelerated}} {{the process of}} substituting Normans for Englishmen in all preferments of importance; and although his nominees were usually respectable, it cannot be said {{that all of them}} were better than the men whom they superseded. For this admixture of secular with spiritual aims there was considerable excuse. By long tradition the primate was entitled to a leading position in the king’s councils; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the Church demanded that Lanfranc should use his power in a manner not displeasing to the king. On several occasions when William I was absent from England Lanfranc acted as his vicegerent.|$|E

25|$|An opinion {{had long}} been gaining ground {{that it would be}} better for the {{community}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> learning, as well as for the university, if the power to elect the overseers were transferred from the legislature to the graduates of the college. This change was made in 1865, and at the same time the governor and other state officers ceased to form part of the board. The effect of this change was to greatly strengthen the interest of the alumni in the management of the university, and thus to prepare the way for extensive and thorough reforms. Shortly afterward Dr. Thomas Hill resigned the presidency, and after a considerable interregnum Eliot succeeded to that office in 1869.|$|E
25|$|A fiduciary's duty {{must not}} {{conflict}} with another fiduciary duty. Conflicts between one fiduciary duty and another fiduciary duty arise most often when {{a lawyer or}} an agent, such as a real estate agent, represent more than one client, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> those clients conflict. This would occur when a lawyer attempts to represent both the plaintiff and the defendant in the same matter, for example. The rule comes from the logical conclusion that a fiduciary cannot make the principal's interests a top priority if he has two principals and their interests are diametrically opposed; he must balance the interests, which is not acceptable to equity. Therefore, the conflict of duty and duty rule is really {{an extension of the}} conflict of interest and duty rules.|$|E
25|$|Built in the 11th {{century by}} the Lords of Fougères, the first fortification, defended by Raoul II (1130–1194), {{was taken by}} Henry II of England in 1166 and destroyed. Raoul II, stubborn, rebuilt a more {{imposing}} structure, {{and it became a}} stronghold defending the borders of Brittany, from Mont Saint-Michel to Nantes. However, the geographical position <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the Lords of Fougères often tipped in favour of the Kingdom of France. When Raoul III offered its possession to Saint Louis, the Breton prince Pierre Mauclerc captured the city in 1231, which was then taken over by the king. The daughter of Raoul III, Jeanne de Fougères, married to Hugh XII of Lusignan, undertook new fortification work and beautified the city. The end of the 13th century was a period of peace and prosperity for Fougères.|$|E

25|$|Non-refoulement is {{the right}} not to be {{returned}} to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The right to non-refoulement is distinct from the right to asylum. In order to respect the right to asylum states must not deport genuine refugees. In contrast, the right to non-refoulement allows states to transfer genuine refugees to third party countries with respectable human rights records. The portable procedural model, proposed by political philosopher Andy Lamey, emphasizes the right to non-refoulement by guaranteeing refugees three procedural rights (to a verbal hearing, to legal counsel, and to judicial review of detention decisions) and ensuring those rights in the constitution. This proposal attempts {{to strike a balance between}} the interest of national governments <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> refugees.|$|E
25|$|Mithal al-Alusi, {{a secular}} Muslim Iraqi lawmaker, who is openly pro-Israel, paid {{a heavy price}} for visiting Israel in September 2004, criticizing Hamas and Hezbollah as {{terrorist}} organizations, and advocating peace with the Jewish state. Upon his return to Iraq, the Sunni politician was immediately removed from Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress Party (INC). In 2005, apparently as payback, a gunmen opened fire on Alusi's car just after it left his house, killing two of his sons, Ayman, 21, and Jamal, 30, while he escaped unharmed. According to Alusi, there is no Iraqi-Israeli problem, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the two countries are parallel; thus, he advocates strategic relations between Iraq and Israel against terrorism. Alusi returned to Israel for a second visit in September 2008. Upon his return to Iraq, he was stripped of parliamentary immunity {{so that he could}} face charges of traveling illicitly to Israel. Later that year, Iraq's Federal Supreme Court ruled in his favor, maintaining it was no longer a crime for Iraqis to travel to Israel.|$|E
25|$|Much as {{counties}} were subdivided as {{the population}} grew to maintain a government of a size and location both convenient and of citizens with common interests (at least to some degree), as Virginia grew, the portions that remained after the subdivision of Kentucky in 1776 became more populated. For the western areas, problems were {{the distance from the}} state seat of government in Richmond and the difference of common economic interests resultant from the tobacco and food crops farming, fishing, and coastal shipping on the Eastern Continental Divide (waters that drain to the Atlantic Ocean) along the Allegheny Mountains, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the western portion, which drained to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and the Gulf of Mexico. The western area focused its commerce on neighbors to the west, and many citizens felt that the more populous eastern areas were too dominant in the State Legislature and insensitive to their needs. Major crises in the Virginia state government were averted during the period before the American Civil War, but the underlying problems were fundamental and never well-resolved.|$|E
