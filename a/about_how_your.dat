An image of Rodemeyer was shown on the backdrop as Gaga announced: [...] "We lost a Little Monster this week. I wrote this record <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>your</b> identity is really all you've got when you're in school... so tonight, Jamey, I know you're up there looking at us, and you're not a victim... you're a lesson to all of us.

2500|$|The fifth track [...] "Thinking Out Loud" [...] "Is about {{hooking up}} with an ex. And it's <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>your</b> heart hasn't really mended from the way that things ended. You realize that it hurts even more, even though you guys don't have a title; it hurts even more being with that person knowing that they don't feel {{the way that you}} do." [...] The sixth track on the mixtape is a cover of Joni Mitchell's [...] "Free Man in Paris" [...] which, serving as a tribute to Mitchell, was renamed [...] "White Girl in Paris". The mixtape's seventh track and second single from the tape [...] "Andre" [...] was also written by JoJo while {{production}} was handled by Mr. Franks. In discussion of the track, JoJo says [...] "Andre" [...] isn't necessarily a direct tribute to Outkast's André 3000; rather, the 37-year-old rapper/singer provided inspiration for the song. [...] "I absolutely admire André and both of the guys from Outkast — their incredible artistry and creativity," [...] she explains. [...] "The man that André is, I think that's super-sexy — someone who is themselves, who isn't confined and just expresses themselves. He has such a great style. I was inspired by that, for sure." [...] The mixtape includes music from Dropkick Murphys' [...] "I'm Shipping Up to Boston" [...] on the [...] "St. Patrick's Day Interlude".|$|E

5000|$|It {{has become}} a modern ritual {{tradition}} for Japanese students to eat katsudon the night before taking a major test or school entrance exam. This is because [...] "katsu" [...] is a homophone of the verb 勝つ katsu, meaning [...] "to win" [...] or [...] "to be victorious". It is also a famous gag of Japanese police films: many people think that suspects will speak the truth with tears when they have eaten katsudon and are asked, [...] "Did you ever think <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>your</b> mother feels about this?" [...] Even nowadays, the gag of [...] "We must eat katsudon while interrogating" [...] is popular in Japanese films.|$|E

5000|$|Billy {{finds himself}} in the afterlife, which resembles the {{backstage}} area of an extremely sleazy nightclub. His new agent, Max, explains he must go audition on stage, and that his performance will determine whether he goes to heaven or hell. A stage manager pushes him out onto a stage {{in front of a}} bored-looking audience. When Billy tells conventional jokes, the audience grows hostile and they taunt him with remarks such as [...] "tell us <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>your</b> mother died." [...] In order to make the audience laugh, Billy must humiliate himself by recounting all the most shameful and degrading incidents of his life. This produces laughter from the audience. As he escapes the stage {{at the end of the}} set, traumatized by what he has had to reveal, he is told that his act is a massive hit...and that he must spend eternity exposing his shameful acts forever.|$|E

If you're going to fight, make sure it's on your terms and not just because someone is challenging you.' He was trying to make me understand who I was going in the box with. He'd say, 'I don't want to take away from you dropping your gloves, but, I don't want you to think about not doing it. I just want you to think <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>your</b> reaction affects both their team and our team.' So it got me to thinking a little more about my role.

5000|$|The song {{stemmed from}} the {{breakdown}} of Nicole's marriage and the phone call Nicole had with Lewis. It was the first track recorded for the album. Only months later did Lewis inform Nicole of the lyrical meaning; [...] "I didn't even know and I was singing along to it, months later, and she went 'You know when you spoke to me and told me…' and I just went 'Oh my god'", Nicole recalled. Further inspiration came from the group's experiences where [...] "things really come along and change just like that". In an interview for i-D magazine, Nicole explained: [...] "It's not about the divorce, it's about the moment I found out what Gallagher did to me. It's pretty much that." [...] While Lewis clarified:The phrase 'one strike' is <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>your</b> life can just change in one instant.

In 2006, the theme "Latinos in Missouri: Beyond Borders" explored {{the extent to which}} the flow of people, goods and information is changing our notions of what constitutes a border. The conference in 2007, "Latinos in Missouri: Everyone Together - Todos Juntos," underlined the need for all stakeholders - regardless of who they are or where they come from - to engage themselves in the process of integrating everyone into their communities. The 2008 conference, "Latinos in Missouri: Uniting Cultures - Uniendo Culturas," focused on how the Latino population is becoming part of U. S. culture. The abstracts included in this book are a reflection of the discussions that were held during these three events. They provide a diverse array of resources for community groups, access to information for researchers and connections to those who share similar interests in understanding and affecting the changes happening in our communities.

Items represent different types of job crafting behaviors or cognitions, and respondents indicate the frequency with which they engage in each one (1  = hardly ever, 6  = very often). Sample items include: “Introduce new tasks you think better suit your skills or interests” (task crafting), “Think <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>your</b> job gives your life purpose” (cognitive crafting), and “Make an effort to get to know people well at work” (relational crafting). Slemp and Vella-Brodrick (2013) provided evidence of the factorial validity of the scale as well as evidence of convergent validity. For the current study, the overall scale and sub-factors showed high internal consistency (overall: α =  0.91; task: 5 items, α =  0.86; relational: 5 items, α =  0.84; cognitive: 5 items, α =  0.90).|$|E
