50|$|Most of {{the common}} <b>addition</b> <b>polymers</b> are formed from {{unsaturated}} monomers (usually having a double bond). This includes polyethenes, polypropylene, PVC, Teflon, Buna rubbers, polyacrylates, polystyrene, and PCTFE. <b>Addition</b> <b>polymers</b> are also formed from monomers that have a closed ring. Through coordination polymerization, even saturated monomers can form <b>addition</b> <b>polymers.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{exception}} of combustion, {{the backbone of}} <b>addition</b> <b>polymers</b> are generally chemically inert. This {{is due to the}} very strong C-C and C-H bonds and lack of polarisation within many <b>addition</b> <b>polymers.</b> For this reason they are non-biodegradable and hard to recycle. This is, again, in contrast to condensation polymers which are bio-degradable and can be recycled.|$|R

50|$|An <b>{{addition}}</b> <b>polymer</b> is a polymer {{which is}} formed by an addition reaction, where many monomers bond together via rearrangement of bonds without {{the loss of}} any atom or molecule under specific conditions of heat, pressure, and/or {{the presence of a}} catalyst. This is in contrast to a condensation polymer which is formed by a condensation reaction where a molecule, usually water, is lost during the formation.|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} mechanical energy to alter the molecular and supramolecular structure of polymers to create stress-responsive materials. 1 a-l Chemical reactions that are accelerated by force remain poorly understood, and {{there is a need for}} the rapid discovery of new mechanophores (i. e., stress-sensitive units). Screening putative mechanophores, however, is a slow process that requires a high molecular weight polymer having a single testable unit positioned near the midpoint of the chain, the location where stress under elongation is greatest. Here we show that the required mechanophore-linked <b>addition</b> <b>polymers</b> are easily prepared using bifunctional initiators and a living polymerization method.

50|$|Step-growth {{polymers}} {{are defined}} as polymers formed by the stepwise reaction between functional groups of monomers, usually containing heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen. Most step-growth polymers are also classified as condensation polymers, but not all step-growth polymers (like polyurethanes formed from isocyanate and alcohol bifunctional monomers) release condensates; in this case, we talk about <b>addition</b> <b>polymers.</b> Step-growth polymers increase in molecular weight at a very slow rate at lower conversions and reach moderately high molecular weights only at very high conversion (i.e., >95%).|$|R

50|$|One of the {{simplest}} repeat units {{is that of the}} <b>addition</b> <b>polymer</b> polyvinyl chloride, -CH2-CHCln-, whose repeat unit is -CH2-CHCl-. In this case the repeat unit has the same atoms as the monomer vinyl chloride CH2=CHCl. When the polymer is formed, the C=C double bond in the monomer is replaced by a C-C single bond in the polymer repeat unit, which links by two new bonds to adjoining repeat units.|$|E
50|$|The first useful <b>addition</b> <b>polymer</b> {{was made}} by {{accident}} in 1933 by ICI chemists Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett. They were carrying {{out a series of}} experiments which involved reacting organic compounds under high temperatures and high pressures.

They left the reaction vessel overnight, and the next morning they found a small amount of a white waxy solid. It was shown later that this solid was polyethylene.|$|E
50|$|Polymer cement overlays, {{consisting}} of a proprietary blend of Portland cements, various aggregates and polymer resins, were introduced over 20 years ago. The purpose of adding a polymer resin to the cement and aggregate is to greatly increase the performance characteristics and versatility of conventional cements, mortars and concrete materials. Unlike conventional cement and concrete mixes, polymer cement overlays can be applied thinly or thickly without fear of delamination or typical product failure. In <b>addition,</b> <b>polymer</b> cement overlays are much more resistant to damage from salt, petrochemicals, UV, harsh weather conditions and traffic wearing.|$|E
50|$|To {{alleviate}} {{inconsistencies in}} these naming methods, adjusted definition for condensation and <b>addition</b> <b>polymers</b> have been developed. A condensation polymer {{is defined as}} a polymer that involves loss of small molecules during its synthesis, or contains heteroatoms as part of its backbone chain, or its repeat unit does not contain all the atoms present in the hypothetical monomer to which it can be degraded.|$|R
50|$|Condensation {{polymerization}} releases multiple small molecules, {{in contrast}} to polyaddition reactions, which do not. In general, condensation polymers form more slowly than <b>addition</b> <b>polymers,</b> often requiring heat. They are generally lower in molecular weight. Monomers are consumed early in the reaction; the terminal functional groups remain active throughout; and short chains combine to form longer chains. A high conversion rate is required to achieve high molecular weights, per Carothers' equation.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT：In this review, the {{properties}} of buckminsterfullerene and its organic and polymeric reactions were focused. In <b>addition,</b> <b>polymer</b> blending with C 60 will be briefly introduced. As soon as C 60 was discovered, chemists put their efforts to explore its reactivity with other compounds. The knowledge of the organic reactions with C 60 was extended to construct different types of fullerene polymers such as side chain fullerene polymers, main chain fullerene polymers, star shaped fullerene polymers, and dendritic fullerene polymers...|$|E
30|$|In <b>addition,</b> <b>polymer</b> {{composition}} {{was found}} to be affected by the carbon sources used. More specific, glucose consumption led to the production of a copolymer containing as monomers 3 HD (60.2 %), 3 HO (20.8 mol%), 3 HB (10.5 mol%), and 3 HDD (8.5 mol%). When sodium gluconate was utilized as sole carbon source, a copolymer containing both scl and mcl HAs was also accumulated. This copolymer was consisted of 3 HD (65 mol%), 3 HO (23 mol%) as majors constituents and 3 HB (4 mol%) and 3 HV (8 mol%) as minor monomer units.|$|E

50|$|PLGA degrades by {{hydrolysis}} of its ester linkages in {{the presence}} of water. It has been shown that the time required for degradation of PLGA is related to the monomers ratio used in production: the higher the content of glycolide units, the lower the time required for degradation as compared to predominantly lactide materials. An exception to this rule is the copolymer with 50:50 monomers ratio which exhibits the faster degradation (about two months). In <b>addition,</b> <b>polymers</b> that are end-capped with esters (as opposed to the free carboxylic acid) demonstrate longer degradation half-lives.|$|R
50|$|One {{universal}} {{distinction between}} polymerization types is development of molecular weight by the different modes of propagation. <b>Addition</b> <b>polymers</b> form {{high molecular weight}} chains rapidly, with much monomer remaining. Since addition polymerization has rapidly growing chains and free monomer as its reactants, and condensation polymerization occurs in step-wise fashion between monomers, dimers, and other smaller growing chains, {{the effect of a}} polymer molecule's current size on a continuing reaction is profoundly different in these two cases. This has important effects on the distribution of molecular weights, or polydispersity, in the finished polymer.|$|R

40|$|We present {{our results}} {{obtained}} in the Rh-catalyzed carbene copolymerization of diazomethane and diazoesters as {{a new approach to}} functional polymer synthesis. Copolymerization reactions were successful, and high-Mw ethylene-acrylate type copolymers were obtained with a large variation in functional group content, which proved to be tunable by varying the monomer feed ratio and the way of <b>addition.</b> <b>Polymer</b> yields decrease strongly with increasing incorporation of diazomethane due to rapid β-hydride elimination. Sequential insertions of polar monomers were observed to a large extent, giving rise to copolymers with a blocky microstructure, which is a unique feature of this polymerization technique.

30|$|Porous silicon was {{discovered}} by Uhlir (in 1956) and was intensively investigated because of its excellent mechanical and thermal properties [5], its obvious compatibility with silicon-based microelectronics, and its low-cost fabrication [6].

The porosity and average pore size and depth can be tuned by adjusting the electrochemical preparation techniques [7 – 10]. Depositing specific materials, such as polymers and nonlinear materials, into porous templates allows new structures to be tailored [11]. Organic materials such as polymers are favored in many applications because many of these are optically transparent, biocompatible, and/or biodegradable.
