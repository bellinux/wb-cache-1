The heavy work stirring the iron {{was said to}} have strengthened his <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Chambers also won the return match, held on the Tyne on 19 April 1859, even after a collision with a moored boat left him a hundred yards behind.|$|E

25|$|Then the swimmer shrugs their {{shoulders}} and throws their <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> forward, lunging cat-like {{back into the water}} (though the emphasis is to go forward, not down). As the swimmer sinks, they arch their back, and kicks. Timing is very important in order for the kick to transfer all of its force via the arched back, but the optimum time is when the arms are 3/4 extended. Then the swimmer kicks and presses on their chest, undulating a little underwater, and squeezing the gluteus maximus to prevent the legs and feet from rising out of the water. The swimmer has now returned to the streamlined position, and the cycle starts again.|$|E

25|$|The {{giant panda}} has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The {{rest of the}} animal's coat is white. Although {{scientists}} {{do not know why}} these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat. The giant panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A 110.45kg (243.5lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292. Another study had a 117.5kg (259lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.|$|E
25|$|They {{settled in}} Timaru, a town just {{along the coast}} from Lyttelton {{populated}} mainly by Cornish immigrants, and James Fitzsimmons established a blacksmith's forge in the town. Once Fitzsimmons had completed his education at the Timaru Main School, he took {{on a range of}} jobs. He wanted to join the crew of the Isabella Ridley, and do some service as a sailor, hoping that it would toughen him up for a career in boxing, but the ship was badly damaged in storms while still docked in Timaru. Instead, he took on a range of jobs; as a butcher's delivery boy, a carriage painter, striker at an iron foundry, and a decorator, before becoming an apprenticeship at his family's blacksmith's forge, with his brother Jarrett. His time working in the blacksmith's forge helped to develop his upper body, particularly his <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders.</b> During his time working in the blacksmith's forge, there are stories that Fitzsimmons was not averse to fighting quarrelsome, often drunk, customers, and it was suggested that this even boosted business, as customers returned to the forge, hoping to see a fight.|$|E

2500|$|On November 1, 1944, {{following}} his breakout {{season with the}} Bisons, Smith was selected by Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics in the Rule 5 draft. [...] However, Smith's opportunity {{to play in the}} big leagues was delayed by illness. [...] In February 1945, Smith contracted rheumatic fever and was taken to Buffalo General Hospital by ambulance. [...] He was hospitalized for three weeks and lost 20 pounds as the ailment settled into his <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders.</b> [...] In March 1945, The Sporting News reported that Smith would remain [...] "flat on his back" [...] for six more weeks and that he had given up hope of playing baseball in 1945.

2500|$|The work depicts Weda Cook, a [...] "respected Camden vocalist... {{recognized}} for her 'powerful contralto voice, unassuming manner, and thorough training.'" [...] She stands center stage, wearing pink slippers and a low-necked sleeveless pink dress, a luminous and central {{element in the}} picture, fringed with lace and pearl beads. Eakins's realism is notable in the painting of skin tones, with Cook's bare neck, chest, <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> visibly paler than her head and hands. The figure is solidly and subtly modeled, its warm light pinks set against a cooler and darker yellow-green background. Narrative details are minimal. In the lower-left foreground, a conductor's hand and baton are visible, although {{the rest of the}} figure is not pictured. Initially, {{as can be seen in}} the preliminary sketch, the hand grasped the baton as if it were a paint brush. For verisimilitude Eakins had Charles M. Schmitz, the conductor of the Germania Orchestra and Cook's teacher, pose holding the baton. A bouquet at the lower right suggests that the singer is performing an encore; apparently a fresh supply of roses was provided at each sitting by the sculptor William Rudolf O'Donovan, who had fallen in love with Cook.|$|E
2500|$|Women's fashion {{during the}} Empire {{was set to}} a large degree by the Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais and her {{favorite}} designer, Hippolyte Leroy, who was inspired by the Roman statues of the Louvre and the frescoes of Pompeii. Fashions were also guided by a new magazine, the Journal des Dames et des Modes, with illustrations by the leading artists of the day. The antique Roman style, introduced during the Revolution, continued to be popular but was modified because Napoleon disliked immodesty in women's clothing; low necklines and bare arms were banned. The waist of the Empire gowns was very high, almost under the arms, with a long pleated skirt down to the feet. Corsets were abandoned, and the preferred fabric was mousseline. The main fashion accessory for women was the shawl, inspired by the Orient, made of cashmere or silk, covering the <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Napoleon's military campaigns also influenced fashion; after the Egyptian campaign, women began to wear turbans; after the Spanish campaign, tunics with high shoulders; and after the campaigns in Prussia and Poland, Polish furs and a long coat called a pelisse. They also wore jackets inspired by military uniforms, with epaulettes. In cold weather women wore a redingote, from the English word [...] "riding coat", borrowed from men's fashion, or, after 1808, a witchoura, a fur coat with a hood.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2013 second season, a {{flashback}} shows that Hanzo and Bi-Han were childhood friends but driven apart by the mutual disdain of their clans. Two decades later, the Shirai Ryu and Lin Kuei {{have made some}} effort towards reconciliation, but Hasashi, while {{with his wife and}} son, encounters Bi-Han's younger brother, Kuai Liang, who provokes a fight and is killed by Hanzo offscreen. Hanzo and Bi-Han later meet to discuss the incident, and both are shown to be honorable men committed to maintaining the truce between their clans. Bi-Han swears {{that there will be no}} repercussions against the Shirai Ryu for Kuai's death, but after the events of season one, the resurrected Hanzo (now Scorpion) is convinced of Bi-Han's culpability in his family's and clan's deaths, not knowing that Bi-Han is not responsible and is instead incensed about the attack that he believes was carried out by his own Lin Kuei warriors. In the present day, Bi-Han and Scorpion fight in the Mortal Kombat tournament, during which Scorpion stabs his spear into Bi-Han's ankle. Despite Bi-Han's pleas that he was not involved in the death of his clan and family, Scorpion rips out his spine. This storyline was played out over the seventh and eighth episodes and filmed entirely in English. Dale, who has a background in kung fu, said in a 2013 interview with Nerd Reactor that the series [...] "challenge the assumptions that [...] have always been sworn enemies—we have new layers in their story and rivalries."
