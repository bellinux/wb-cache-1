25|$|Al-Arsuzi's {{theories}} about society, language and nationalism, which are collectively part of Ba'athist thought, hold that the Arab Nation will be unified when the Arab people reestablish the Arab identity {{they have lost}} over the past 1000 years. The key to Arab unification, according to al-Arsuzi, is through language. In contrast to the Latin language, al-Arsuzi argued, Arabic was far less arbitrary and far more intuitive. Despite his contributions to Ba'athist thought, al-Arsuzi is barely mentioned in Western or Arab scholarship. This omission {{may be linked to}} the fact that Sati' al-Husri, a contemporary Arab nationalist, had many of the same ideas as al-Arsuzi but was better <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> them.|$|E

Prosser stated, [...] "with due respect to the superlative style in which both [...] are written, neither of them wears well on long acquaintance.

The text, which is both a historical survey and a political essay, argues: [...] "As the Leninist authoritarian order collapsed, societies {{have tended to be}} atomized and deprived of a political center <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> coherent visions of a common good." [...] This process, he argues, favors the recourse to [...] "mythology", and paradoxical situations such as a post-Holocaust antisemitism in the absence of sizable Jewish communities. He also focuses on the revived antisemitic conspiracy theory according to which Jews had played a leading role in setting up communist regimes (see Jewish Bolshevism).|$|E
2500|$|The aim of {{psychoanalysis}} is {{to lead the}} analysand to recognize his/her desire and by doing so to uncover the truth about his/her desire. However this is possible only if desire is articulated in speech: [...] "It is only once it is formulated, named {{in the presence of}} the other, that desire appears in the full sense of the term." [...] And again in The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis: [...] "...what is important is to teach the subject to name, to articulate, to bring desire into existence. The subject should come to recognize and to name his/his desire. But it isn't a question of recognizing something that could be entirely given. In naming it, the subject creates, brings forth, a new presence in the world." [...] The truth about desire is somehow present in discourse, although discourse is never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> the entire truth about desire, whenever discourse attempts to articulate desire, there is always a leftover or surplus.|$|E

2500|$|Whelan theorizes {{that when}} Stieglitz first {{looked at the}} {{negative}} {{he did not see}} the stylistic qualities he was then championing, and he set the negative aside while dealing with more pressing issues. In the period directly before and after taking The Steerage Stieglitz was still producing photos that were primarily pictorialist in style, and it would be several more years before he began to break with this tradition. The Steerage represents a [...] "fundamental shift in Stieglitz's thinking", and, critics have said that while his mind had visualized the image when he took it he was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> his reasons for taking it until later. Also, painter Max Weber claims to have discovered the image while looking through Stieglitz's photos in 1910, and he took credit for first pointing out the aesthetic importance of the image. Whether that is true or not, it was only after Stieglitz began to seriously consider the works of modern American artists like John Marin, Arthur Dove and Weber that he finally published the image. Perhaps Stieglitz had seen the 1900 painting with the same title by George Luks (now in NC Museum of Art). Like the works of those artists,The Steerage is [...] "divided, fragmented and flattened into an abstract, nearly cubistic design" [...] and it has been cited {{as one of the first}} proto-Cubist works of art.|$|E
2500|$|Bernard takes {{a holiday}} with Lenina outside the World State to a Savage Reservation in New Mexico, {{in which the}} two observe natural-born people, disease, the aging process, other languages, and {{religious}} lifestyles for the first time. (The culture of the village folk resembles the contemporary Native American groups of the region, descendants of the Anasazi, including the Puebloan peoples of Acoma, Laguna and Zuni.) Bernard and Lenina witness a violent public ritual and then encounter Linda, a woman originally from the World State who is living on the reservation with her son John, now a young man. She too visited the reservation on a holiday many years ago but became separated from her group and was left behind. She had meanwhile become pregnant by a fellow-holidaymaker (who is revealed to be Bernard's boss, the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning). She did not try to return to the World State because of her shame at her pregnancy. Despite spending his whole life in the reservation, John has never been accepted by the villagers, and his and Linda's lives have been hard and unpleasant. Linda has taught John to read, although from the only two books in her possession: a scientific manual and the complete works of Shakespeare. Ostracised by the villagers, John is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> his feelings only in terms of Shakespearean drama, especially the tragedies of Othello, Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet. Linda now wants to return to London, and John too wants to see this [...] "brave new world". Bernard sees an opportunity to thwart plans to exile him, and gets permission to take Linda and John back. On their return to London, John meets the Director and calls him his [...] "father", a vulgarity which causes a roar of laughter.

40|$|Abstract — Service robots {{deployed}} in domestic environments generally need the capability <b>to</b> deal with <b>articulated</b> {{objects such as}} doors and drawers {{in order to fulfill}} certain mobile manipulation tasks. This however, requires, that the robots are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> perceive <b>articulated</b> furniture objects such as cupboards, dishwashers and cabinets. In this paper, we present an approach for detecting, tracking, and learning 3 D articulation models for doors and drawers without using artificial markers. Our approach uses a highly efficient and sampling-based approach to rectangle detection in dense depth images obtained from a self-developed projected texture stereo vision system. The robot can use the generative models learned for the <b>articulated</b> objects <b>to</b> estimate their mechanism type, their current configuration, and to predict their opening trajectory. In our experiments we demonstrate that (1) we obtain dense depth images in the workspace of our robot using our camera system, (2) we are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> robustly and reliably detect cabinet fronts from depth images, and (3) are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> learn accurate articulation models for the observed articulated objects.
