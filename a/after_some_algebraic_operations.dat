40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, we {{introduce}} a new class of linearizations, based on the generalization of a construction used in polynomial algebra to find the zeros of a system of (scalar) polynomial equations. We show that one specific linearization in this class, which is constructed naturally from the QR factorization of the matrix obtained by stacking the coefficients of A(x), has good conditioning and stability properties. Moreover, while analyzing this class, we introduce a general technique to derive new linearizations from existing ones. This technique generalizes some ad-hoc arguments used in dealing with the existing linearization classes, and can hopefully be used to derive a simpler and more general theory of linearizations. This technique relates linearizations to pencil arithmetic, a technique used in solving matrix equations that allows to extend <b>some</b> <b>algebraic</b> <b>operations</b> from matrix to matrix pencils.

Motivated by some previous and successful efforts {{in the design of}} numerical techniques to estimate the solutions of much simpler forms of the system of equations investigated in the present work [19, 20], we follow a linear approach [21 – 26] to provide a linear and implicit finite-difference discretization of the mathematical model of interest. <b>After</b> <b>some</b> <b>algebraic</b> manipulations, we will readily verify that our technique may be represented conveniently in vector form using a square matrix with real entries which, under suitable conditions, turns out to be an M-matrix, that is, a strictly diagonally dominant matrix with non-positive off-diagonal entries, and positive components in its main diagonal [27, 28].|$|R

Additionally, such treatment explicitely cancells and factorizes a number of terms helping to amortiguate the growing of round-off errors. We have checked the performance of our formulation running a 3 D relativistic hydrodynamical code to solve a standard test-bed problem and found that the improvement in efficiency is of high practical interest in numerical simulations of relativistic flows in Astrophysics.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple, new {{paradigm}} {{for the design}} of collision-free hash functions. Any function emanating from this paradigm is incremental. (This means that if a message x which Ihave previously hashed is modi ed to x 0 then rather than having to re-compute the hash of x 0 from scratch, I can quickly &quot; the old hash value to the new one, in time proportional to the amount of modi cation made in x to get x 0.) Also any function emanating from this paradigm is parallelizable, useful for hardware implementation. We derive several speci c functions from our paradigm. All use a standard hash function, assumed ideal, and <b>some</b> <b>algebraic</b> <b>operations.</b> The rst function, MuHASH, uses one modular multiplication per block of the message, making it reasonably e cient, and signi cantly faster than previous incremental hash functions.
