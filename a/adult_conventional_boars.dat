40|$|Adult mice {{are more}} {{resistant}} than neonatal mice to intestinal colonization with the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. Development of a mature intestinal flora {{may play a}} role in this resistance. We compared susceptibilities to colonization with C. parvum in <b>adult</b> <b>conventional</b> mice, <b>adult</b> germfree mice, and <b>adult</b> <b>conventional</b> mice treated with oral antibiotics to deplete the intestinal flora. Germfree mice of both CD 1 and BALB/c strains were colonized at day 7 following inoculation with C. parvum oocysts isolated from the feces of an infected, diarrheic calf. Age-matched conventional mice of the same strains were comparatively resistant to colonization. Conventional mice treated with antibiotics remained resistant to colonization. These results suggest that the microflora in the intestine was not the sole determinant of resistance or susceptibility to colonization.

40|$|A {{total of}} 94 pigs from seven groups {{considered}} as lean (boars from a synthetic {{line and the}} Pietrain breed), <b>conventional</b> (<b>boars,</b> gilts, and barrows from the Large White breed), fat (barrows from the Meishan x Large White cross), or obese (Meishan barrows) were serially slaughtered between 12 and 110 kg BW. Carcasses were dissected into muscle, bone, skin, and fat, which was further separated into subcutaneous, intermuscular, and kidney fats. Subcutaneous fat accounted for 60 to 70 % of body fat and intermuscular fat for 20 to 35 % of body fat. Relative to total fat, intermuscular fat grew more slowly (allometric growth coefficients generally < 1), subcutaneous fat {{at the same rate}} (b close to 1), and kidney fat more rapidly (1. 12 < b < 1. 33). The leaner the animals genetically, the higher the proportion of intermuscular fat in total fat. The ratio of intermuscular to subcutaneous fat varied from. 31 in Meishan barrows to. 66 in Pietrain boars. Overall, the ratio of intermuscular fat to muscle weight or body weight was positively related to the development of total fat. However, Pietrain pigs were unique in having a high development of intermuscular fat. The present results suggest that 1) the genetic controls of the development of intermuscular and subcutaneous fat are partially independent and 2) the development of intermuscular fat may be determined at an early stage, before 20 kg BW...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) is increasingly used in pulmonary hypertension (PH) {{because of its}} ability to accurately measure right ventricular (RV) volumes and func-tion. 1 In <b>adults,</b> <b>conventional</b> breath-held, cardiac-gated CMR is easy to use and has proven prognostic utility. 1 – 3 However, con-ventional CMR is problematic in pediatric PH because many of these children find breath-holding difficult. Thus, real-time CMR is a more attractive option, and this technique has recently been used to successfully assess the RV in children with PH. 4 Optimal management of PH also benefits from assessment of either mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) or indexed pulmonary vascular resistance (PVRi). Although the reference standard method of measuring mPAP and PVRi is cardiac catheterization, noninvasive methods are used during routine follow-up. For instance, mPAP and PVRi can be noninvasively estimated using CMR by measuring interventricular septa...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of antibody-forming cell (AFC) progenitors lacking previous contact with specific antigen (virgin AFC progenitors) {{has been studied}} using sedimentation velocity and buoyant density separation for the investigation of physically distinct B-cell subpopulations. Functional characterization of isolated subsets was made using a quantitative adoptive immune assay for the IgM AFC progenitors responding to the antigen 4 -hydroxy- 3 -iodo- 5 - nitrophenylacetic acid conjugated polymerized bacterial flagellin. Extensive heterogeneity is present among B lymphocytes, only some subpopulations of which exhibit AFC progenitor function. In the spleen of <b>adult</b> <b>conventional</b> CBA mice, atypically fast sedimenting cells of low buoyant density are active, while typical small B lymphocytes {{do not appear to}} be progenitors of IgM AFC. Spleen of adult specific pathogen-free (SPF), germfree, and athymic nude mice give similar results, although a minor population of typical slowly sedimenting dense cells are active in the latter two sources. <b>Adult</b> <b>conventional</b> bone marrow cells are as physically and functionally heterogeneous as splenic B cells, and although a significant proportion of AFC progenitor activity is found among dense, slowly sedimenting cells, most of the activity is among low density, faster sedimenting cells. In contrast to this situation in adult animals, where most of the unprimed AFC progenitors are large, atypical B cells, the spleens of neonatal mice provide a site where virgin AFC progenitors with the physical properties of typical small B lymphocytes are found. While being present in conventional and SPF neonatal spleens, these virgin cells are predominant in 7 -day-old germfree mouse spleen. These findings suggest that the newborn virgin B cell is a typical small lymphocyte. However, few cells of this type are found in the adult animal. The unprimed AFC-progenitor population in the adult consists of large, fast sedimenting, low buoyant density, adherent cells, the physical properties of which are characteristic of activated B lymphocytes. It is suggested that these atypical cells are derived from the small newborn virgin B cell by the nonspecific effects of environmental antigenic stimuli...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs), which {{are defined by}} their {{capacity}} to reconstitute <b>adult</b> <b>conventional</b> mice, are first found in the dorsal aorta after 10. 5 days post coitus (dpc) and in the fetal liver at 11 dpc. However, lympho-myeloid hematopoietic progenitors are detected in the dorsal aorta from 9 dpc, raising the issue of their role in establishing adult hematopoiesis. Here, we show that these progenitors are endowed with long-term reconstitution capacity, but only engraft natural killer (NK) -deficient Rag 2 γc(-/-) mice. This novel population, called here immature HSCs, evolves in culture with thrombopoietin and stromal cells, into HSCs, defined by acquisition of CD 45 and MHC- 1 expression and by the capacity to reconstitute NK-competent mice. This evolution occurs during ontogeny, as early colonization of fetal liver by immature HSCs precedes that of HSCs. Moreover, organ culture experiments show that immature HSCs acquire, in this environment, the features of HSCs...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Osteosarcomas are {{the main}} {{malignant}} primary bone tumours found in children and young <b>adults.</b> <b>Conventional</b> treatment is based on diagnosis and resection surgery, combined with polychemotherapy. This is a protocol that {{was established in the}} 1970 s. Unfortunately, this therapeutic approach has reached a plateau of efficacy and the patient survival rate has not improved in the last four decades. New therapeutic approaches are thus required to improve the prognosis for osteosarcoma patients. Areas covered: From the databases available and published scientific literature, the present review gives an overview of the drugs currently in early clinical development for the treatment of osteosarcoma. For each drug, a short description is given of the relevant scientific data supporting its development. Expert opinion: Multidrug targeted approaches are set to emerge, given the heterogeneity of osteosarcoma subtypes and the multitude of therapeutic responses. The key role played by the microenvironment in the disease increases the number of therapeutic targets (such as macrophages or osteoclasts), as well as the master proteins that control cell proliferation or cell death. Ongoing phase I/II trials are important steps, not only for identifying new therapies with greater safety and efficacy, but also for better defining the role played by the microenvironment in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma...|$|R

40|$|Early {{childhood}} {{overweight and}} obesity have alarmingly {{increased over the}} years. Adulthood obesity is a well demonstrated significant independent predictor of cardiovascular risk (CVR) and/or mortality, which predisposes to the major components of metabolic syndrome (MS). Evidence of MS in obese children has been also reported associated with biochemical and inflammatory factors that affect vascular physiologic function. Assessment of vascular function can be measured noninvasively in children allowing early detection of endothelial dysfunction and severe increase of arterial stiffness before clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. Impairment of endothelial function related to the severity of obesity and {{to the degree of}} insulin resistance is considered as a condition that confers a premature atherogenicity status and is linked to <b>adult</b> <b>conventional</b> cardiovascular risk factors. Adipose tissue factors that interfere with insulin action and endothelial cell function have also been identified as major precursors of CVR factors. The metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of childhood obesity are well demonstrated and {{have a major impact on}} the development of atherosclerosis and lifetime CVR.

40|$|AbstractMalignant {{brain tumors}} are a {{significant}} health problem in children and <b>adults.</b> <b>Conventional</b> therapeutic approaches have been largely unsuccessful in providing long-term management. As primarily a metabolic disease, malignant brain cancer can be managed through changes in metabolic environment. In contrast to normal neurons and glia, which readily transition to ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate) for energy under reduced glucose, malignant brain tumors are strongly dependent on glycolysis for energy. The transition from glucose to ketone bodies as a major energy source is an evolutionary conserved adaptation to food deprivation that permits the survival of normal cells during extreme shifts in nutritional environment. Only those cells with a flexible genome and normal mitochondria can effectively transition from one energy state to another. Mutations restrict genomic and metabolic flexibility thus making tumor cells more vulnerable to energy stress than normal cells. We propose an alternative approach to brain cancer management that exploits the metabolic flexibility of normal cells {{at the expense of}} the genetically defective and metabolically challenged tumor cells. This approach to brain cancer management is supported from recent studies in mice and humans treated with calorie restriction and the ketogenic diet. Issues of implementation and use protocols are presented for the metabolic management of brain cancer. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bioenergetics of Cancer...|$|R

Previously unrecognized {{virus from}} submaxillary glands of {{gnotobiotic}} and conventional rats. J. Bacteriol. 90 : 1719 – 1729. 1965. —A serially transmissible cytopathic agent was isolated from histologically normal submaxillary glands, {{but not from}} various other tissues or specimens, from 74 of 97 gnotobiotic and conventional rats. Triturates of the glands or subsequent culture supernatant fluids induced specific cytopathic effects (CPE) in monolayer cultures of primary rabbit kidney cells (14 passages), a line of human skin cells (8 passages), and HeLa cells (17 passages). Transfer of supernatant fluids containing infected cells enhanced transmissibility. Neutralization of the CPE was demonstrated with sera of gnotobiotic and conventional rats and with homologous rabbit antiserum. A cold hemagglutinin specific for rabbit erythrocytes is associated with, but separable from, the infectious particle.

40|$|For many years, {{there has}} been debate about the {{suitability}} of traditional and conventional pig breeds in low-input and organic production systems. This review compiles reproductive and finishing performance of traditional and conventional breeds in low-input and organic production systems in Europe, based on literature studies and farm surveys until 2010. In comparison with traditional breeds, conventional breeds wean many piglets, have efficient and fast growth and lean carcasses. They thrive well in North West European climatic conditions with temperate summers and mild winters. Optimal housing may be indoors with outdoor runs, because this provides a controlled environment in which large litters are more easily managed. The lean meat of conventional breeds is suitable for the commodity organic pork market. Traditional breeds comprise a group of prolific breeds with good finishing performance (e. g. Saddlebacks, Pulawska) and breeds kept for special meat production (e. g. Ibérico, Cinta Senese). The prolific and leaner traditional breeds are suitable for commodity organic pork production, especially when crossed with <b>conventional</b> white <b>boar</b> breeds to give some extra leanness to the carcass. Special meat breeds are unsuitable for commodity organic pork production owing to their low fertility and high carcass fatness, but extra added value is obtained by their specific meat and fat quality...|$|R
40|$|<b>Adult</b> <b>conventional</b> rats were {{starved for}} 48 h {{with or without}} {{haemorrhage}} at 24 h, and translocation of caecal coliforms to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) was measured. Translocation was detected in three of 11 rats without haemorrhage, in 6 of 11 starved and sham-operated rats and in 12 of 22 rats after haemorrhage. In contrast, only one of 13 non-instrumented and fed control rats showed translocation. Translocation was associated with more coliforms adhering to caecal epithelium in rats. Coliform isolates from caecum, caecal epithelium and MLNs were characterised and grouped into different biochemical phenotypes (BPTs) by a biochemical fingerprinting method. Of 291 BPTs detected in the caecum of all rats, 108 were also found on caecal epithelium; 36 BPTs were detected in MLNs, of which 17 were not detected either in the caecum or on the caecal epithelium of the corresponding rats. One isolate from each of these 36 BPTs was selected and compared to the others. Four common © BPTs (i. e., C 1 -C 4) were identified among them. Strains of C 1 formed the majority of isolates from the caecum (79 %), caecal epithelium (71 %) and MLNs (91 %). In contrast, C 2 -C 4 had a significantly lower incidence both in the caecum and on the caecal epithelium, {{but not in the}} MLNs. These findings indicate that not all caecal coliforms adhere to the epithelium during catabolic stress and that for translocation to occur, other bacterial properties besides adhesion are needed.

In addition, conviction data {{was used to determine}} subjects’ criminal careers. Conducting face-to-face interviews with these former JJI detainees when they were on average 34 years old, we collected retrospective information on employment history and several important current life course outcomes. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct offending and employment groups. Results Results showed that previously institutionalized youths experience difficulties adjusting to <b>conventional</b> <b>adult</b> life. Most personal and childhood characteristics exert no significant effect on adult outcomes. Criminal behaviour in young adulthood does impact adult life outcomes, as the two chronic offender groups show more difficulties in <b>conventional</b> <b>adult</b> life domains. Employment is associated with better adult outcomes, as the two employment groups that have an increasing or high employment rate in adulthood show higher levels of adult life adjustment. Conclusions Adult life adjustment in this sample of previously institutionalized youths is mainly explained by events during young adulthood, and not so much by childhood risk factors.

The objective of the present review is to discuss the conventional delivery systems available for acne, their drawbacks, and limitations. The advantages, disadvantages, and outcome of using various carrier-based delivery systems like liposomes, niosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and so forth, are explained. This paper emphasizes approaches to overcome the drawbacks and limitations associated with the conventional system and the advances and application that are poised to further enhance the efficacy of topical acne formulations, offering the possibility of simplified dosing regimen that may improve treatment outcomes using novel delivery system...|$|R
30|$|Adult NSC/NPCs {{reside in}} highly complex {{cellular}} environment and themselves are also highly heterogeneous cell populations (Beckervordersandforth et al., 2010; Coskun et al., 2008; Morrison and Spradling, 2008). When {{it comes to}} investigating alterations in molecular characteristics associated with aging in distinct subpopulations of <b>adult</b> NSC/NPCs, <b>conventional</b> RNA sequencing becomes insufficient, because it only reflects the sum and/or average molecular features of all cells (Shapiro et al., 2013; Nolan et al., 2013). To resolve such a problem, single-cell-based transcriptome analyses are essential. Single-cell RNA-seq can precisely reflect the molecular characteristics of individual cells, which might be hidden from total-cell RNA-seq, if these features belong to rare cells in heterogeneous populations (Shalek et al., 2013). However, these features may be of particular importance for critical biological functions. Because of the high resolution of single cell transcriptome analyses, new subtypes of adult NSC/NPCs were gradually discovered in mouse SEZ/SVZ (Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015; Dulken et al., 2017). Single-cell transcriptome analysis, being able to reveal the molecular heterogeneity among cells, has been employed to demonstrate dynamic alterations in various biological processes and innate signals (Luo et al., 2015; Kim DH et al., 2015).|$|R
