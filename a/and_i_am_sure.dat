5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E

500|$|You {{can hear}} (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> most Beatles fans have) [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] {{a lot and}} not know really what it is about. Basically it is saying what {{meditation}} is all about. The goal of meditation is to go beyond (that is, transcend) waking, sleeping and dreaming. So the song starts out by saying, [...] "Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream, it is not dying." ...|$|E

500|$|The game {{levels were}} {{developed}} {{on a level}} editor on the PlayStation Portable, but Zoë Mode {{were not able to}} refine the editor in time for shipping. [...] Mottram said [...] "It would be great to see user generated content and this is something we have been seriously thinking about for the future" [...] and that downloadable content [...] "would work perfectly with the Crush level structure <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> that fans of the game would be eager to see more levels." [...] Mottram has stated they would like to market a sequel based on the highly positive feedback they had received; however, with other Zoë Mode projects such as SingStar and Play taking precedence, he does not know when this could be.|$|E
500|$|A more {{pressing}} problem for Brueys {{was a lack}} of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Constant attacks by Bedouin partisans, however, required escorts of heavily armed guards for each party. Hence, up to a third of the fleet's sailors were away from their ships at any one time. Brueys wrote a letter describing the situation to Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix, reporting that [...] "Our crews are weak, both in number and quality. Our rigging, in general, out of repair, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> it requires no little courage to undertake the management of a fleet furnished with such tools." ...|$|E
500|$|In his dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia {{argued that}} the majority's opinion was a [...] "freedom-destroying cocktail." [...] Although he {{recognized}} anonymous tips may sometimes be reliable, he rejected the majority's conclusion that [...] "anonymous 911 reports of traffic violations are reliable {{so long as they}} correctly identify a car and its location." [...] He wrote, [...] "his is not my concept, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> would not be the Framers’, of a people secure from unreasonable searches and seizures." [...] Justice Scalia argued that anonymous tips are inherently unreliable, because anonymous tipsters can [...] "lie with impunity." [...] While he admitted 911 calls are, in fact, easily traceable, Justice Scalia {{argued that the}}re was no evidence the 911 caller knew they could be identified when they placed the call. Additionally, Justice Scalia distinguished the tip in this case from the tip in White, where [...] "the reliability of the tip was established {{by the fact that it}} predicted the target’s behavior in the finest detail — a detail that could be known only by someone familiar with the target’s business." [...] He argued that the general details provided in this case's 911 call were unreliable, because [...] "everyone in the world who saw the car would have that knowledge, and anyone who wanted the car stopped would have to provide that information." [...] Likewise, Justice Scalia argued that there was no evidence that the report of being run off the road was actually true.|$|E

500|$|Since my {{work was}} announced, several Lives and Memoirs of Dr. Johnson have been published, the most voluminous {{of which is}} one {{compiled}} for the booksellers of London, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight, a man, whom, during my long intimacy with Dr. Johnson, I never saw in his company, I think but once, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> not above twice. Johnson might have esteemed him for his decent, religious demeanour, and his knowledge of books and literary history; but from the rigid formalities of his manners, {{it is evident that}} they never could have lived together with companionable ease and familiarity; nor had Sir John Hawkins that nice perception which was necessary to mark the finer and less obvious parts of Johnson's character. His being appointed one of his executors, gave him an opportunity of taking possession of such fragments of a diary and other papers as were left; of which, before delivering them up to the residuary legatee, whose property they were, he endeavoured to extract the substance. In this he has not been very successful, as I have found upon a perusal of those papers, which have been since transferred to me. Sir John Hawkins's ponderous labours, I must acknowledge, exhibit a farrago, of which a considerable portion is not devoid of entertainment to the lovers of literary gossipping; but besides its being swelled out with long unnecessary extracts from various works, (even one of several leaves from Osborne's Harleian Catalogue, and those not compiled by Johnson, but by Oldys,) a very small part of it relates to the person who is the subject of the book; and, in that, there is such an inaccuracy in the statement of facts, as in so solemn an authour is hardly excusable, and certainly makes his narrative very unsatisfactory. But what is still worse, there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable cast, by which the most unfavourable construction is put upon almost every circumstance in the character and conduct of my illustrious friend; who, I trust, will, be a true and fair delineation, be vindicated both from the injurious misrepresentation of this authour, and from the slighter aspersions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Myrie-Williams was {{released}} by Bristol City. In June 2009, he joined Dundee United on a free transfer, signing a two-year deal with the Scottish Premier League club. Dundee United manager Craig Levein stated [...] "I am excited about the signing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> he will develop into a real talent. Jennison is a player I've known about and admired for some time and up to about two years ago I would have said {{he was one of the}} brightest prospects in the country. He is a player who will not only excite the fans with his direct, quick running at defences, but he will also add pace to the team and strengthen our options going forward". Myrie-Williams made his Dundee United debut on 22 August 2009, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw at St Mirren. He made a further two appearances as a late substitute, before starting his first game for Dundee United in the club's 2–0 away win against Ross County in the League Cup on 22 September 2009. He made his first league start on 17 October 2009, playing 84 minutes in a 1–1 home draw against Hamilton Academical, earning the 'Man of the Match' award for his performance. Myrie-Williams was again named as the 'Man of the Match' for his performance in a 2–1 win against Celtic at Tannadice on 22 November 2009— the club's website reported that he made [...] "the most creative impact during the game" [...] and that he [...] "continued his fine form of late and in doing so gave Celtic left back Danny Fox a torrid 90 minutes". He scored his first competitive goal for Dundee United in a 3–2 home win against St Mirren on 5 December 2009, scoring the club's third with a neat finish. He was on the scoresheet again in January 2010, scoring in a game against St Johnstone, Myrie-Williams' goal gave Dundee United the lead after trailing 2–0 at half-time, although the game ended 3–3. Myrie-Williams received the first red card of his career when he was sent-off for two bookable offences in the side's 2–0 home loss against Celtic on 25 April 2010. He played in the club's 2–0 win over Raith Rovers in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but was not selected for the Hampden Park final itself. He made 27 appearances for the [...] "Tangerines" [...] in his first season at the club, scoring twice.|$|E
