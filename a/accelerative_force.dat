The {{behavior of the}} <b>accelerative</b> <b>force</b> gravitation, is described. This law proposes and quantifies the mutual gravitational attraction existing between all bodies of matter, the force being proportional to the product of masses, and inversely related to {{the square of the}} distance separating them. Gravity orientation, chronic acceleration, and hematology are examined. Systematic responses, such as circulation and renal functions, are also considered, along with animal response to a decreased acceleration field and physiology of hyper- and hypodynamic fields...|$|E
5000|$|Newton {{identified}} how {{to evaluate}} the perturbing effect on the relative motion of the Earth and Moon, arising from their gravity towards the Sun, in Book 1, Proposition 66, and in Book 3, Proposition 25. The starting-point for this approach is Corollary VI {{to the laws of}} motion. This shows that if the external <b>accelerative</b> <b>forces</b> from some massive body happens to act equally and in parallel on some different other bodies considered, then those bodies would be affected equally, and in that case their motions (relative to each other) would continue as if there were no such external <b>accelerative</b> <b>forces</b> at all. It is only in the case that the external forces (e.g. in Book 1, Prop. 66, and Book 3, Prop. 25, the gravitational attractions towards the Sun) are different in size or in direction in their accelerative effects on the different bodies considered (e.g. on the Earth and Moon), that consequent effects are appreciable on the relative motions of the latter bodies. (Newton referred to <b>accelerative</b> <b>forces</b> or <b>accelerative</b> gravity due to some external massive attractor such as the Sun. The measure he used was the acceleration that the force tends to produce (in modern terms, force per unit mass), rather than what we would now call the force itself.) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} shows that {{systemic}} dopamine receptor blockade impaired movement initiation of rats, trained in a simple reaction time task for rapid initiation of locomotion {{in response to a}} combined optic/acoustic cue. Reaction time, movement time and the <b>accelerative</b> <b>force</b> were recorded for each initiation of locomotion. Results indicate a dose-related increase of reaction time following systemic administration of haloperidol (0. 1, 0. 15, 0. 3 mg/kg i. p.). Measures derived from resulting force-time patterns showed a haloperidol-induced decrease (0. 15 mg/kg i. p.) of the mean rate of force development, indicating a decreased initial acceleration. These effects were reversed by systemic co-administration of dizocilpine (MK- 801) (0. 08 mg/kg i. p.), a selective non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. The haloperidol-induced movement initiation deficits in this task are in part comparable to akinesia seen in Parkinson's disease and their reversal by dizocilpine has implications for the treatment of this disease...|$|E
40|$|The hindlimb {{kinematics}} of Hymenochirus boettgeri (Tornier) {{were investigated}} using high-speed cin 6 films. The movement pattern was stereotypic, {{flexion and extension}} of the metatarsal-phalangeals and feet always lagging behind flexion and extension of the femora and tibiofibulae. The right hindlimb was modelled {{as a series of}} linked circular cylinders and a flat plate. A blade-element approach was used to calculate the quasi-steady drag-based and <b>accelerative</b> <b>force</b> components parallel to the direction of motion, based on the hindlimb kinematics of sequence 1 (see preceding paper). Positive thrust is generated primarily during the initial stages of extension (power stroke) because of unsteady (added mass) effects. Negative thrust occurs over the latter half of extension, despite the continued acceleration of the animal. Hindlimb interaction is thought to provide propulsive thrust for {{the latter half of the}} extension phase. It is suggested that a jet and/or reflective effect may be involved...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{different}} limbs in supporting and propelling {{the body has}} been studied in many species with animals appearing to have either similarity in limb function or differential limb function. Differential hindlimb versus forelimb function has been proposed as a general feature of running with a sprawling posture and as benefiting sprawled postured animals by enhancing maneuvering and minimizing joint moments. Yet only a few species have been studied and thus the generality {{of different}}ial limb function in running animals with sprawled postures is unknown. We measured the limb lengths of seven species of lizard and their single-limb three-dimensional ground reaction forces during high-speed running. We found that all species relied on the hindlimb for producing accelerative forces. Braking forces were forelimb dominated in four species and equally distributed between limbs in the other three. Vertical forces were dominated by the hindlimb in three species and equally distributed between the forelimb and hindlimb in the other four. Medial forces were dominated by the hindlimb in four species and equally distributed in the other three, with all Iguanians exhibiting hindlimbbiased medial forces. Relative hindlimb to forelimb length of each species was related to variation in hindlimb versus forelimb medial forces; species with relatively longer hindlimbs compared with forelimbs exhibited medial forces that were more biased towards the hindlimbs. These {{results suggest that the}} function of individual limbs in lizards varies across species with only a single general pattern (hindlimb-dominated <b>accelerative</b> <b>force)</b> being present...|$|E

Food-deprived rats were trained in a modified runway for rapid locomotor initiation, in response to a combined optical/acoustic stimulus, to receive a food reward. Rats rapidly learned this task with small variability, and movement patterns of locomotor initiation are congruent under these conditions. Reaction time, movement time and <b>accelerative</b> <b>forces</b> were recorded from each initiation of locomotion by means of video equipment and a force platform. The quantification modes yielded consistent results and a quantitative description of measured force and time parameters is given.

40|$|Dr. Chang-Diaz gave an {{intriguing}} presentation {{of his research}} in advanced rocket propulsion and its relevance for planning and executing crewed deep space explorations. Though not necessarily exclusively Martian, his thrust looks critically at future Mars missions. Initially Dr. Chang-Diaz showed the time constraints of Mars missions due to orbital mechanics and our present chemically powered rocket technology. Since essentially all the energy required to place current generation spacecraft into a Martian trajectory must be expended in the early minutes of a flight, most of such a mission is spent in free-fall drift, captive to the gravitational forces among Earth, the Sun, and Mars. The simple physics of such chemically powered missions requires nearly a year in transit for each direction of a Mars mission. And the optimal orientations of Earth and Mars for rendezvous require further time on or around Mars to await return. These extensions of mission duration place any crew under a three-fold jeopardy: (1) physiological deconditioning (which in some aspects is still unknown and unpreventable), (2) psychological stress, and (3) ionizing radiation. This latter risk is due to exposure of crew members for extended time to the highly unpredictable and potentially lethal radiations of open space. Any gains in shortening mission duration would reap equivalent or greater benefits for these crew concerns. Dr. Chang-Diaz has applied his training and expertise (Ph. D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in applied plasma physics) toward development of continuous rocket propulsion which would offer great time advantages in travel, and also more launch options than are now available. He clearly explained the enormous gains from a relatively low thrust <b>accelerative</b> <b>force</b> applied essentially continuously versus the high, but short-lived propulsion of present chemical rockets. In fact, such spacecraft could be powered throughout the mission, accelerating to approximately the midpoint and decelerating during the latter half. This would not only provide some level of gravity (acceleration) throughout the mission but also allow very high velocities to be achieved, thus saving many months of travel time. In proposing the design of such a spacecraft propulsion system, Dr. Chang-Diaz was quick to acknowledge {{the need for a}} large power source, which undoubtedly must be nuclear fueled at the solar distances involved. He calls his system the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR). The other major ingredient is a mass (deuterium, which could also function as a radiation shield for crews) for energizing into the ultra hot, high velocity exhaust plasma. He foresees models now functional in the laboratory soon to be tested in space. In fact, some of these concepts have already been tried there. His optimism and determination would have operational rockets in the next decades...|$|E

40|$|A {{miniature}} totally implantable FM/FM telemetry {{system has}} been developed to simultaneously measure blood pressure and blood flow, thus providing {{an appreciation of the}} hemodynamics of the circulation to the entire body or to a particular organ. Developed for work with animal subjects, the telemetry system's transmission time is controlled by an RF signal that permits an operating life of several months. Pressure is detected by a miniature intravascular transducer and flow is detected by an extravascular interferometric ultrasonic technique. Both pressure and flow are calibrated prior to implanting. The pressure calibration can be checked after the implanting by cannulation; flow calibration can be verified only {{at the end of the}} experiment by determining the voltage output from the implanted sensing system as a function of several measured flow rates.

40|$|By {{sponsoring}} research, {{the aerospace}} agencies {{have given a}} great im-petus to investigations dealing with the vestibular organs, the semicir-cular canals, and otolith apparatus. The reasons for their interest are no mystery. Man, in breaking away from the Earth, is transported in vehicles which move in three-dimensional space and generate inertial forces that create environmental factors to which he is not accustomed either by inheritance or experience. The vestibular organs not only are uniquely structured to respond to angular and linear <b>accelerative</b> <b>forces</b> but also they contain the only sensory cells whose sole, and indeed obliga-tory, purpose is to act as transducers signaling forces acting at a distance: the cupula-endolymph system of the canals responding to angular accelera-tions and the cilio-macular system of otolith organs responding to linear accelerations. The vestibular organs may be damaged by overload, respond in curious fashion to stimulation outside their physiological response range, or, within this range, signal appropriately for the force environ...|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of accelerations to be encountered on orbiting spacecraft: (1) quasi-steady accelerations, caused by atmospheric drag or by gravity gradients, 10 (exp - 6) to 10 (exp - 7) g sub o; (2) transient accelerations, caused by movements of the astronauts, mass translocations, landing and departure of other spacecraft, etc.; and (3) oscillary accelerations, caused by running machinery (fans, pumps, generators). Steady accelerations cause continuing displacements; transients cause time-limited displacements. The important aspect is the area under the acceleration curve, measured over a certain time interval. Note that this quantity is not equivalent to a velocity because of friction effects. Transient motions are probably less important than steady accelerations because they only produce constant displacements. If the <b>accelerative</b> <b>forces</b> were not equal and opposite, the displacement would increase with time. A steady acceleration will produce an increasing velocity of a particle, but eventually an equilibrium value will be reached where drag and acceleration forces are equal. From then on, the velocity will remain constant, and the displacement will increase linearly with time...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} altered weight upon animal {{tolerance}} to restraint {{was determined by}} simulating various <b>accelerative</b> <b>forces</b> with directed lead weights using restrained and nonrestrained domestic fowl (chickens). Weighting (increased weight) and conterweighting (reduced weight) produced a stressed condition - reduced relative lymphocyte counts, loss of body mass, and/or {{the development of a}} disorientation syndrome - in both restrained and nonrestrained (caged only) birds. The animal's tolerance to altered weight appeared to be a function of its body weight. Unrestrained birds were stressed by counterweighting (mean plus or minus standard error) 58. 3 plus or minus 41 % of their body weight, whereas restrained birds tolerated only 32. 2 plus or minus 2. 6 % reduction in body weight. A training regimen for restrained birds was not effective in improving their tolerance to a reduced weight environment. It was concluded that domestic fowl living in a weightless (space) environment should be restrained minimally and supported by ventrally directed tension equivalent to approximately 50 % of their body mass (their weight in a 1 G environment) ...|$|R

Fifty-six men completed a single test on a Monark 814 E mechanically braked ergometer fitted with a Schoberer Rad Messtechnik (SRM) powermeter. A commercial software package (Wingate test kit version 2. 21, Cranlea, UK) was used to calculate conventional and corrected (with <b>accelerative</b> <b>forces)</b> values of power based on a resistive load (5 % body mass) and flywheel velocity. The SRM calculated powers based on torque (measured at the crank arm) and crank rate. Values for peak 1 and 5 s power and mean 30 s power were measured.

40|$|BACKGROUND High {{magnitude}} {{loads and}} unusual loading regimes are two important determinants for increasing bone mass. Past research demonstrated that positive Gz-induced loading, providing high loads in an unaccustomed manner, had an osteogenic effect on bone. Another determinant of bone mass {{is that the}} bone response to loading is site specific. This study sought to further investigate the site specific bone response to loading, examining the cervical spine response, the site suspected of experiencing the greatest loading, to high performance flight. METHODS Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) was monitored in 9 RAAF trainee fighter pilots completing an 8 -mo flight training course on a PC- 9 and 10 age-height-weight-matched controls. RESULTS At completion of the course, the pilots had {{a significant increase in}} cervical spine BMD and total body BMC. No significant changes were found for the control group. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that the physical environment associated with flight training may have contributed to a significant increase in cervical spine bone mass in the trainee PC- 9 pilots. The increase in bone mass was possibly a response to the strain generated by the daily wearing of helmet and mask assembly under the influence of positive sustained <b>accelerative</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R
40|$|On November 15, 1967, U. S. Air Force {{test pilot}} Major Michael J. Adams was killed while flying the X- 15 rocket-propelled {{research}} vehicle in a parabolic spaceflight profile. This flight {{was part of}} a joint effort with NASA. An electrical short in one of the experiments aboard the vehicle caused electrical transients, resulting in excessive workload by the pilot. At altitude Major Adams inappropriately initiated a flat spin that led to a series of unusual aircraft attitudes upon atmospheric re-entry, ultimately causing structural failure of the airframe. Major Adams was known to experience vertigo (i. e. spatial disorientation) while flying the X- 15, but all X- 15 pilots most likely experienced vertigo (i. e. somatogravic, or "Pitch-Up", illusion) as a normal physiologic response to the <b>accelerative</b> <b>forces</b> involved. Major Adams probably experienced vertigo to a greater degree than did others, since prior aeromedical testing for astronaut selection at Brooks AFB revealed that he had an unusually high degree of labyrinthine sensitivity. Subsequent analysis reveals that after engine burnout, and through the zenith of the flight profile, he likely experienced the oculoagravic ("Elevator") illusion. Nonetheless, painstaking investigation after the mishap revealed that spatial disorientation (Type II, Recognized) was NOT the cause, but rather, a contributing factor. The cause was in fact the misinterpretation of a dual-use flight instrument (i. e. Loss of Mode Awareness), resulting in confusion between yaw and roll indications, with subsequent flight control input that was inappropriate. Because of the altitude achieved on this flight, Major Adams was awarded Astronaut wings posthumously. Understanding the potential for spatial disorientation, particularly the oculoagravic illusion, associated with parabolic spaceflight profiles, and understanding the importance of maintaining mode awareness in the context of automated cockpit design, are two lessons that have direct application to the commercial space industry today...|$|R
