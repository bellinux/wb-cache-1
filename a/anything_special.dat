They enjoyed how Messiah Riser was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting. Famitsu writers thought that Card Summoner rules were very complex, but noted that the tutorial made it easy to learn.|$|E

The 2007–08 season confirmed that, with Alvertis being the soul of the Greens, who won both the Greek League championship and the Greek Cup, even though his contribution on the court was again limited.|$|E

Compared {{to the rest of the}} panchakanya, Mukherjee considers Mandodari's life as [...] "less colourful and eventful". He adds: [...] "Mandodari seldom got prominence ... Her image lacks substance and fades quickly", though he lays stress on her love and loyalty towards her husband. Pradip Bhattacharya, author of the book Panchkanya: Women of Substance notes that [...] "there is hardly <b>anything</b> <b>special</b> that Valmiki (Ramayana) has written about her (Mandodari) except that she warns her husband to return Sita and has enough influence to prevent his raping her." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} also {{featured}} in UK-based magazine Mean Machines in May1991. Matt Regan {{said that he}} was not impressed with the game, saying that similar platforming games such as DuckTales and [...] were superior to Ironsword and had a more original approach in gameplay. He also criticized the fact that players cannot hit enemies while in mid-air. However, he noted the game's good gameplay. Julian Rignall also said that the game was fun, but it was not spectacular. However, just as Regan noted, Rignall said that the game did not offer <b>anything</b> <b>special</b> like with better titles such as Mega Man2 or Super Mario Bros.2. However, he noted the game's good graphics and challenge, though both noted that the backgrounds [...] "are slightly bland". Both reviewers said the game was well-presented with good introductions and a password mode, easy controls, fair challenge, and [...] "fairly good tunes and effects which fit the action well". Overall, they said that Ironsword was [...] "a fun but ultimately limited game that will appeal to platform fans".|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{criticized the}} music videos for {{the songs on}} B'Day Anthology Video Album, writing that [...] "none of them are <b>anything</b> <b>special,</b> though most will please narrow-minded fans". To {{celebrate}} the album's tenth year anniversary, Billboard published [...] "Beyoncé's Best Fashion Moments from Her Decade-Old 'B'Day Anthology Video Album'", the list in which Billboard editor Da'Shan Smith commented on ten best outfits Beyoncé wore in the music videos, on April 3, 2017, and stated: [...] "The project has delivered audiences some of the singer's most iconic looks. In every frame she appears in, Beyoncé oozes a radiant confidence, wearing stunning outfits and costumes to match. Here is the project's ten best looks – from House of Deréon signatures to impromptu costume designs and haute couture get ups." [...] The same day, Vibe published a list in which Smith ranked all thirteen music videos from the worst to the best; he stated: [...] "B'Day Video Anthology Album must be heralded as an important pop culture artifact. As expressed before, it's the birther of Beyoncé's passion for providing fans visual sequences they need to tell an album’s story. Imagine a B'Day without its Anthology—although the go-go and funk infused tracks already made an impression upon audio listens only, the visuals made the record pop to life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Loin Like a Hunting Flame" [...] {{received}} mostly negative {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five, finding Mann's writing to lack tension and imagination. Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode [...] "has good moments, and is at least efficient and watchable", but believed that it [...] "doesn't really deliver <b>anything</b> <b>special,</b> doesn't try to be anything other than average". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "Loin Like a Hunting Flame" [...] 4 out of 5, describing it as being [...] "handled in a subtle, somber manner". Gibron felt that [...] "the events unfold in this episode evenly and eerily", and it serves {{as an example of}} [...] "what could have been done had the show's focus, both literally and metaphysically, remained on crime". Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode an F, calling it [...] "quite possibly one of the worst episodes of television I've ever seen". VanDerWerff felt that the episode's wariness of the 1990s rave subculture was particularly dated. He also felt that [...] "Loin Like a Hunting Flame" [...] served as a prominent example of Millennium [...] "social conservatism", noting that it seems [...] "fairly closed-off from other points-of-view" [...] than that of the character Frank Black.|$|E

BBC's John Hand noticed Ahmadzaï's [...] "quirky" [...] influence in the production of the track; he also called it a club and dancey song. Michael Paoletta from Billboard called it [...] "vibrant and uplifting in tone" [...] calling it a trippy/trance disco romp. Alex Pappademas from Spin noted the difference of Madonna's endeavors with Ray of Light and its introspective mood and the fun-filled, joyous nature of songs like [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] in Music.The Village Voices Ben Dellio complimented the alliteration and the elastic bassline of the song, saying {{that it would have been}} a better album opener than the title song. Ben Greenbank from Sputnikmusic gave a mixed review, saying that although [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] and [...] "Runaway Lover" [...] from Music were decent songs, they did not have <b>anything</b> <b>special</b> about them to make the reviewer feel that they would be dancefloor staples, or were listenable a second time round. In 2011, MSN Music Canada listed the song at number three on their countdown of [...] "10 famous lyrics that make absolutely no sense".

While the shooting of Daniel at the end was stunning, I expected something much more {{from the rest of}} the episode than learning the identity of Daniel's parents." [...] A reviewer for TVoholic.com thought the episode was good, though not as good as [...] "The Constant", and he thought [...] "it came with lots of answers and references to past episodes from this season and the ones before it, making it all the more exciting." [...] The reviewer would, however, have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] changed his mind about changing the past or how he thought this could work. There must have been something that made Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain." [...] Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind said that as an internal character piece, [...] "The Variable" [...] was not [...] "so much a great ending for Daniel. We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was." ...|$|E

2500|$|When RCA {{had asked}} if there was <b>anything</b> <b>special</b> he wanted as a signing premium, Nilsson asked for his own office at RCA, being used to working out of one. In the weeks after the Apple press conference, Nilsson's office phone began ringing constantly, with offers and {{requests}} for interviews and inquiries about his performing schedule. Nilsson usually answered the calls himself, surprising the callers, and answered questions candidly. (He recalled years later the flow of a typical conversation: [...] "When did you play last?" [...] "I didn't." [...] "Where have you played before?" [...] "I haven't." [...] "When will you be playing next?" [...] "I don't.") Nilsson acquired a manager, who steered him into a handful of TV guest appearances, and a brief run of stage performances in Europe set up by RCA. He disliked the experiences he had, though, and decided to stick to the recording studio. He later admitted this was a huge mistake on his part.|$|E
