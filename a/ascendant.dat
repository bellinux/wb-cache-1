President Yusuf requested that the African Union deploy military forces in Somalia. However, as the AU lacked the resources to do so, Yusuf brought in his own militia from Puntland. Along with the U.S. funding the ARPCT coalition, this alarmed many in south-central Somalia, and recruits flocked to the <b>ascendant</b> Islamic Courts Union (ICU).|$|E

The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly <b>ascendant</b> Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers.

5|$|Meanwhile, Brazil, now <b>ascendant</b> under Emperor Dom PedroII, {{provided}} {{support to}} the Uruguayan government that still held out in Montevideo, {{as well as to}} the ambitious Justo José de Urquiza, a caudillo in Entre Ríos who rebelled against Rosas. Once one of Rosas' most trusted lieutenants, Urquiza now claimed to fight for a constitutional government, although his ambition to become head of state was barely disguised. In retaliation, Rosas declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the Platine War. The army under Oribe in Uruguay surrendered to Urquiza in October. With arms and financial aid given by Brazil, Urquiza then marched through Argentine territory heading to Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Most critics gave Ultima Underworld II {{positive}} {{reviews and}} lauded its graphics, design and nonlinearity. Complaints focused on its high system requirements and unrefined pacing. It {{has been placed}} on numerous hall of fame lists since its release. In reaction to the game's difficult development, Looking Glass altered its design approach: they streamlined ideas from the Ultima Underworld series to create System Shock. The team pitched a sequel to Ultima Underworld II multiple times, but Origin Systems rejected the idea. Arkane Studios' Arx Fatalis (2002) is a spiritual successor to the franchise originally pitched as a sequel. OtherSide Entertainment's upcoming Underworld <b>Ascendant</b> will be the first officially licensed entry in the series in over 23 years.|$|E

5|$|Gervase of Canterbury wrote {{at the end}} of {{the twelfth}} century that Ceolnoth was Dean of the see of Canterbury {{previous}} to being elected to the archiepiscopal see of Canterbury, but this story has no confirmation in contemporary records. There is no sign of him being associated with either Canterbury or Kent, the region where Canterbury is located, prior to his elevation as archbishop. Given the length of his archiepiscopate, he was probably a young man when he was elected to Canterbury. Ceolnoth was consecrated archbishop on 27 July 833. Upon becoming archbishop, Ceolnoth had to deal with two problems– first the Viking attacks on his archbishopric and the surrounding lands in Kent and second the newly <b>ascendant</b> kings of Wessex who had just gained control of Kent. Previously, the Mercian kings had ruled Kent.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Race is {{commonly}} described in epidemiological surveys based on phenotypic characteristics. Training of interviewers to identify race is time-consuming and self identification of race might {{be difficult to}} interpret. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the agreement between race definition based on the number of <b>ascendants</b> with black skin colour, with the self-assessment and observer's assessment of the skin colour. Methods In a cross-sectional study of 50 women aged 14 years or older, from an outpatient clinic of an University affiliated hospital, race was assessed through observation and the self-assignment of the colour of skin and by the number of black <b>ascendants</b> including parents and grandparents. Reliability was measured through Kappa coefficient. Results Agreement beyond chance between self-assigned and observed skin colour was excellent for white (0. 75 95 % CI 0. 72 – 0. 78) and black women (0. 89 95 % CI 0. 71 – 0. 79), but only good for participants with mixed colour (0. 61 95 % CI 0. 58 – 0. 64), resulting in a global kappa of 0. 75 (95 % CI 0. 71 – 0. 79). However, only a good agreement for mixed women was obtained. The presence of 3 or more black <b>ascendants</b> was highly associated with observed and self-assessed black skin colour. Most women self-assigned or observed as white had no black <b>ascendants.</b> Conclusions The assessment of race based on the race of <b>ascendants</b> showed reasonable agreement with the ascertainment done by trained interviewers and with the self-report of race. This method may be considered for evaluation of race in epidemiological surveys, since it is less time-consuming than the evaluation by interviewers. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{here the}} probabilistic {{analysis of the}} number of descendants and the number of <b>ascendants</b> of a given internal node in a random search tree. The performance of several important algorithms on search trees is closely related to these quantities. For instance, the cost of a successful search is proportional to the number of <b>ascendants</b> of the sought element. On the other hand, the probabilistic behavior {{of the number of}} descendants is relevant for the analysis of paged data structures and for the analysis of the performance of quicksort, when recursive calls are not made on small subfiles. We also consider the number of <b>ascendants</b> and descendants of a random node in a random search tree, i. e., the grand averages of the quantities mentioned above. We address these questions for standard binary search trees and for locally balanced search trees. These search trees were introduced by Poblete and Munro and are binary search trees such that each subtree of size 3 is balanced; in oth [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The {{arrival of}} French troops helped stiffen {{resistance}} to the English, who abandoned Haddington in September 1549 and, {{after the fall of}} Protector Somerset in England, withdrew from Scotland completely. From 1554, Marie of Guise formally took over the regency, maintaining a difficult position, partly by giving limited toleration to Protestant dissent and attempting to diffuse resentment over the continued presence of French troops. When the Protestant Elizabeth I came to the throne of England in 1558, the English party and the Protestants found their positions aligned and asked for English military support to expel the French. The arrival of English troops, and particularly the English fleet, in 1560, led to the besieging of the French forces in Leith, which fell in July. By this point Mary of Guise had died and French and English troops both withdrew under the Treaty of Edinburgh, leaving the young queen in France, but pro-English and Protestant parties in the <b>ascendant.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} {{descendants}} of a node in a {{binary search tree}} (BST) {{is the size of}} the subtree having this node as a root; the number of <b>ascendants</b> is the number of nodes on the path connecting this node with the root.

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 12thcentury, {{important}} socio-political changes {{took place in}} the Deccan, south of the Krishna river. During this period, the Hoysalas, native Kannadigas from the Malnad region (hill country in modern Karnataka) were on the <b>ascendant</b> as a political power. They are known to have existed as chieftains from the mid-10thcentury when they distinguished themselves as subordinates of the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani. In 1116, Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas of Tanjore and annexed Gangavadi (parts of modern southern Karnataka), thus bringing the region back under native rule. In the following decades, with the waning of the Chalukya power, the Hoysalas proclaimed independence and grew {{into one of the most}} powerful ruling families of southern India. Consequently, literature in Kannada, the local language, flourished in the Hoysala empire. This literature can be broadly subdivided as follows: works dominated by the themes of Jain writings, contrasting works by Veerashaiva writers not belonging to the vachana poetic tradition, rebuttals to Shaiva writings from Jain writers, early brahminical works (Vaishnava), works from the birth of the Bhakti (devotional) movement in the Kannada-speaking region, writings on secular topics, and the first writings in native metres (ragale, sangatya and shatpadi).|$|E

40|$|This article {{emphasizes}} {{the impacts of}} international migration on ageing processes and norms within transnational families, and, specifically, analyses {{the roles of the}} zero generation, defined as the parents of first-generation migrants (Nedelcu 2009), both as non-migrant counterparts to their children abroad and as ageing migrants themselves. Transnational caregiving research has demonstrated that for many migrants and their families care arrangements must be negotiated across national borders, yet the agency of transnational older adults has been largely neglected. Based on qualitative fieldwork conducted from 2011 to 2013 in Liège, Belgium and Oujda, Morocco, the present article examines the circulation of care between Moroccan adult migrants and their ageing <b>ascendants.</b> This article exposes the duality of migrants’ <b>ascendants</b> as care givers and recipients, asserting firstly, that receiving care is not synonymous with passivity, and that, secondly, migrants’ <b>ascendants</b> are also the initiators of transnational practices.
