5|$|The {{exterior}} of the temple is richly decorated. The frieze depicts a continuous line of acanthus. Furthermore, there are ornaments on the capital, <b>architrave,</b> and soffit. The stones in the front cornice have projecting sculptures of lion heads. A fragment of the <b>architrave</b> bearing a lion head was removed by Captain J Buchan Telfer {{in the late nineteenth}} century and bequeathed by him to the British Museum in 1907.|$|E
5|$|The roof is tiled and hipped, {{with five}} hips in all. The seven window {{openings}} {{built into the}} roof at second-floor level are original, but fitted with modern windows. On the first floor there are nine tall, narrow windows with wide frames, stone sills and deep arches of rubbed brick. In the late 18th century, eight windows were altered, {{two of which are}} on the left-hand-side of the door. The door itself is placed centrally with a coved, moulded <b>architrave</b> above and 45-degree corbels decorated with acanthus supporting a cornice with round brackets and a carved keystone. The door is glazed and a Doric porch of modern brick covers the doorcase.|$|E
5|$|During the Renaissance, architects {{aimed to}} use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an {{integrated}} system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These {{can either be}} structural, supporting an arcade or <b>architrave,</b> or purely decorative, set against a wall {{in the form of}} pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti {{was one of the first}} to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.|$|E

50|$|Ryholt and Baker {{believe that}} both <b>architraves</b> did not {{originate}} from the Delta region but from Memphis. The <b>architraves</b> {{could have come}} to their find spots {{after the fall of}} the 13th Dynasty, when the Hyksos moved a large number of monuments from Memphis to Avaris and other cities of the Nile Delta such as Bubastis and Tanis. Alternatively, the <b>architraves</b> may have stayed in Avaris until the reign of Ramses II, when this king built his capital at Pi-Ramesses using material from Avaris. Pi-Ramesses was subsequently dismantled during the 21st Dynasty and its monuments scattered in the Delta region.|$|R

5|$|September 3rd – I {{went and}} saw the whole south part of the City burning from Cheapeside to the Thames, and... was now taking hold of St. Paule's Church, to which the {{scaffolds}} contributed exceedingly.September 7th – I went this morning on foote from White-hall as far as London Bridge, thro' the late Fleete-streete, Ludgate Hill, by St. Paules... At my returne I was infinitely concern'd to find that goodly Church St. Paules now a sad ruine, and that beautiful portico... now rent in pieces, flakes of vast stone split asunder, and nothing now remaining intire but the inscription in the <b>architrave,</b> shewing by whom it was built, which had not one letter of it defac'd. It was astonishing to see what immense stones the heate had in a manner calcin'd, {{so that all the}} ornaments, columns, freezes, capitals, and projectures of massie Portland-stone flew off, even to the very roofe, where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six akers by measure) was totally mealted; the ruines of the vaulted roofe falling broke into St. Faith's, which being fill'd with the magazines of bookes belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were all consum'd, burning for a weeke following. It is also observable that the lead over the altar at the East end was untouch'd, and among the divers monuments, the body of one Bishop remain'd intire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable Church, one of the most antient pieces of early piety in the Christian world.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is reached by three limestone steps. The <b>architrave</b> {{of the entrance}} loggia is topped by a fruit-and-swag draped escutcheon. Smooth, variegated marble double-columns, topped by composite capitals, stand above the <b>architrave.</b> The entrance originally featured French doors, but were replaced by black enameled doors decorative by bas-relief wreaths.|$|E
25|$|The capitals {{support the}} entablature. In the Doric order, the entablature always {{consists}} of two parts, the <b>architrave</b> and the Doric frieze (or triglyph frieze). The Ionic order of Athens and the Cyclades also used a frieze above an <b>architrave,</b> whereas the frieze remained unknown in the Ionic architecture of Asia Minor until the 4th century BC. There, the <b>architrave</b> was directly followed by the dentil. The frieze was originally {{placed in front of}} the roof beams, which were externally visible only in the earlier temples of Asia Minor. The Doric frieze was structured by triglyphs. These were placed above the axis of each column, and above the centre of each intercolumniation. The spaces between the triglyphs contained metopes, sometimes painted or decorated with relief sculpture. In the Ionic or Corinthian orders, the frieze possesses no triglyphs and is simply left flat, sometimes decorated with paintings or reliefs. With the introduction of stone architecture, the protection of the porticos and the support of the roof construction was moved upwards {{to the level of the}} geison, depriving the frieze of its structural function and turning it into an entirely decorative feature. Frequently, the cella is also decorated with <b>architrave</b> and frieze, especially at the front of the pronaos.|$|E

25|$|The frieze on the <b>architrave</b> {{on top of}} {{the columns}} is carved in a simpler, more naive style than the podium friezes. It again portrays scenes of combat, but also a boar hunt, figures bearing offerings, and {{preparations}} for a banquet.|$|E
25|$|Greek temples {{were often}} {{enhanced}} with figural decorations. especially the frieze areas offered space for reliefs and relief slabs; the pedimental triangles often contained scenes of free-standing sculpture. In Archaic times, even the <b>architrave</b> could be relief-decorated on Ionic temples, {{as demonstrated by}} the earlier temple of Apollo at Didyma. Here, the <b>architrave</b> corners bore gorgons, surrounded by lions and perhaps other animals. On the other hand, the Ionic temples of Asia Minor did not possess a separate frieze to allow space for relief decoration. The most common area for relief decoration remained the frieze, either as a typical Doric triglyph frieze, with sculpted metopes, or as a continuous frieze on Cycladic and later on Eastern Ionic temples.|$|E

25|$|The templon {{began to}} change forms to the medieval templon with the {{attachment}} of icons and painted scenes to the <b>architrave.</b> Some of the best preserved of these images are from the Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt. The late 12th-century templon beam shows twelve canonical feast scenes, with the Deesis (Christ enthroned, flanked by Mary and St. John the Baptist) located in the middle between the Transfiguration and the Raising of Lazarus, linking the scene of Lazarus with the Holy Week images according to liturgical practice. Several epistyles of this form have been excavated throughout the empire, none earlier than the 12th century, indicating a change from busts on the <b>architrave</b> to scenic decoration. This new scenic style {{is representative of the}} increasing liturgification in Byzantine representational art after iconoclasm.|$|E

25|$|Only {{three basic}} colors were used: white, blue and red, {{occasionally}} also black. The crepidoma, columns and <b>architrave</b> were mostly white. Only details, like the horizontally cut grooves {{at the bottom}} of Doric capitals (anuli), or decorative elements of Doric architraves (e.g. taenia and guttae) might be painted in different colours. The frieze was clearly structured by use of colours. In a Doric triglyph frieze, blue triglyphs alternated with red metopes, the latter often serving as a background for individually painted sculptures. Reliefs, ornaments and pedimental sculptures were executed with a wider variety of colours and nuances. Recessed or otherwise shaded elements, like mutules or triglyph slits could be painted black. Paint was mostly applied to parts that were not load-bearing, whereas structural parts like columns or the horizontal elements of <b>architrave</b> and geison were left unpainted (if made of high quality limestone or marble) or covered with a white stucco.|$|E
25|$|In {{between the}} columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On {{them had been}} carved the monograms of Justinian and Theodora (6th century), even though Theodora {{had been dead for}} several years, as well as a many-armed cross in the center. On the center of the <b>architrave</b> was a repoussé {{medallion}} of Christ. On either side of Him were medallions of angels, the Prophets, the Apostles, and finally the Virgin Mary. The carvings on the <b>architrave</b> were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia’s is that of the church to St. John of Ephesus, rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix. There was an inscription to St. John the Theologian over a side door, since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. St. John the Baptist was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{elements}} in the design {{have been seen as}} abstractions of classical design elements, such as the coffers and the <b>architrave</b> above the concrete columns.

25|$|All {{openings}} {{other than}} the main entrance and the second and fourth bays at ground level are articulated with full-height, wooden, double doors with louvre panels. The central entrance houses decorative, wrought-iron railings and its flanking windows begin at a height of approximately four feet. At the upper level bays, baluster rails create balconettes. Planar surrounds frame the window openings, extending above to incorporate separate <b>architrave</b> moldings.|$|E
