40|$|Heterogeneous {{photocatalysis}} using TiO 2 is a non-selective {{technique used}} for the degradation of organic molecules. Controlling the morphology of TiO 2 has recently been {{considered one of the}} important approaches for controlling the selectivity of TiO 2. In this work, TiO 2 nanotubes and nanosheets were synthesized from spherical TiO 2 nanopar‐ ticles using the hydrothermal method. The starting and prepared samples were characterized by XRD, TEM and FESEM. The selectivity of the three morphologies towards the photocatalytic degradation of three food dyes (colours yellow sunset, <b>red</b> <b>allura</b> and <b>red</b> carmoisine) was tested. Importantly, changes in morphology led to each dye being adsorbed preferentially by one of the three morphologies and decomposing more rapidly, where the optimum rate of degradation for sunset yellow, <b>red</b> <b>allura</b> and <b>red</b> carmoisine was achieved by TiO 2 nanosheets, spherical TiO 2 and TiO 2 nanotubes, respectively...|$|R

50|$|Ingredients in {{squashes}} and cordials {{have evolved}} over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as citric acid or in very old-fashioned cordials lemon juice, or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a preservative especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh {{for quite a long}} time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5-10 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as <b>Allura</b> <b>Red</b> AC and Sunset Yellow FCF are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings.|$|E

We hypothesize that <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> will impede the development of painted lady butterflies, when mixed with their food. This experiment compares the effects of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> to that of pesticides on the declining bee populations of the world, as painted lady butterflies are also important pollinators. The experiment consisted of 40 caterpillars divided into four groups of ten, three groups of caterpillars received a dose of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> mixed into their food culture (High dose (Hi), Mid dose (Mid), Low dose (Lo)) and one group received culture only (Control (Con)). The time it took the caterpillars to develop in their chrysalises and to emerge was recorded to see if it took longer for the butterflies who were given dye to emerge. The higher the ratio of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> dye to food culture, the longer it took the caterpillars to emerge. Additionally, there was a higher mortality rate among the butterflies who received more dye, as well as higher rates of deformities. In the Con group, all butterflies emerged within 3 days of each other. In Lo group, 2 caterpillars died before chrysalis, 1 never emerged, and 2 died in emersion. In Mid group, 3 caterpillars died before chrysalis, 1 never emerged, and 1 died in emersion. In the Hi group, 1 caterpillar died and 3 never emerged.

40|$|In this work, {{competitive}} adsorption of four food dyes (Sunset Yellow, <b>Allura</b> <b>Red,</b> tartrazine, and Brilliant Black) by heated pine wood is studied using multivariate calibration. Partial {{least squares}} PLS 1 and principal component regression PCR are effectively applied for simultaneous determination of food dyes with high accuracy (96. 2 – 103. 6 %) and low relative prediction error (2. 3 – 6. 9 %). Using multivariate calibration, the dyes are detected down to 0. 11, 0. 15, 0. 24, and 0. 29 mg L− 1. The removal of dyes increased at acidic solution and H-bonding {{is the main}} controlling mechanism. The maximum removal capacities (according to Langmuir model) are 3. 4, 2. 5, 4. 8, and 7. 1 mg g− 1 for tartrazine, Brilliant Black, <b>Allura</b> <b>Red,</b> and Sunset Yellow, respectively, at pH 2. 0 and 25 °C.

The findings from this study have been interpreted in conjunction with all the available relevant data from genotoxicity testing, metabolism and carcinogenicity, and in consideration of possible species differences between mouse and rat. These new data have been considered {{in the context of the}} overall relevant data available not only for <b>Allura</b> <b>Red</b> AC but also for a number of other structurally related sulphonated mono azo dyes authorised as food additives, namely: Amaranth, Ponceau 4 R, Sunset Yellow FCF, Tartrazine and Azorubine/Carmoisine.

The read-across exercise has highlighted a shared pattern of effects for this class of substances that would warrant further investigation The Panel therefore recommended a repetition of the in vivo comet assay in mice, to be performed in compliance with the most recent and internationally validated experimental protocol, using whole cells and examining a wide range of tissues.

The adsorption capacity of the activated carbon for <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> was relatively high. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity for E 129 dye was 72. 85 mg/g.
