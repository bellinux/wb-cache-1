In this work, TiO 2 nanotubes and nanosheets were synthesized from spherical TiO 2 nanopar‚Äê ticles using the hydrothermal method.

The selectivity of the three morphologies towards the photocatalytic degradation of three food dyes (colours yellow sunset, <b>red</b> <b>allura</b> and <b>red</b> carmoisine) was tested.

50|$|Ingredients in {{squashes}} and cordials {{have evolved}} over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as citric acid or in very old-fashioned cordials lemon juice, or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a preservative especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh {{for quite a long}} time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5-10 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as <b>Allura</b> <b>Red</b> AC and Sunset Yellow FCF are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings.|$|E

We hypothesize that <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> will impede the development of painted lady butterflies, when mixed with their food. This experiment compares the effects of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> to that of pesticides on the declining bee populations of the world, as painted lady butterflies are also important pollinators. The experiment consisted of 40 caterpillars divided into four groups of ten, three groups of caterpillars received a dose of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> mixed into their food culture (High dose (Hi), Mid dose (Mid), Low dose (Lo)) and one group received culture only (Control (Con)). The time it took the caterpillars to develop in their chrysalises and to emerge was recorded to see if it took longer for the butterflies who were given dye to emerge. The higher the ratio of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> dye to food culture, the longer it took the caterpillars to emerge. Additionally, there was a higher mortality rate among the butterflies who received more dye, as well as higher rates of deformities. In the Con group, all butterflies emerged within 3 days of each other. In Lo group, 2 caterpillars died before chrysalis, 1 never emerged, and 2 died in emersion. In Mid group, 3 caterpillars died before chrysalis, 1 never emerged, and 1 died in emersion. In the Hi group, 1 caterpillar died and 3 never emerged.
