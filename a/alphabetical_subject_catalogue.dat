40|$|The {{view that}} María Moliner wrote the Dictionary without any {{knowledge}} of lexicography is widespread. The aim of this essay is {{to demonstrate that the}} exercise of her profession as a librarian and, more concretely, the management of the <b>alphabetical</b> <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue,</b> granted her ample lexicographical experience. The management of an <b>alphabetical</b> <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> requires the creation and management by the librarian of a true lexicon, aimed at establishing an informative dialogue with the user of the catalogue. No doubt, this practice proved decisive, not only for the process of creation of the Dictionary, but also for the designing of the model itself...|$|E

In addition, the regulations issued so far by the <b>subject</b> <b>cataloguing</b> group of the Central Editorial Board of the Austrian Library Network are presented. The authors also discuss the shortcomings of the Bibos library automation system concerning <b>subject</b> <b>cataloguing,</b> e. g. the all but impossible integration of the subject authority file (SWD). In the third part, the features for subject searching are outlined that the Bibos system offers for library users and library staff.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{effectiveness}} of library <b>subject</b> <b>catalogues</b> as tools of research. We know that they are indispensable from a theoretical point of view, and from general observation of their use and the results of a few studies we can conclude that they are generally compatible with the library use habits of readers. Some of the general conclusions which have been drawn from studies of the <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> are: that there is no significant difference between the amount of author <b>catalogue</b> use and <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> use; that the non- specialist ordinarily will make more use of the <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> than the specialist; and that most of the use of the <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> is for materials in English and of fairly recent date. If the second of these generalizations is true, namely that <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> use is primarily by non- specialists, a discussion of the classified catalogue as a research tool may be a somewhat sterile exercise. On the other hand, we can remind ourselves that the importance of research isn't determined by popular vote, so even a minority use should justify its consideration. In any case, classification and classified catalogues have a high degree of relevancy. This was my reason for agreeing to discuss the subject of the role of the classified catalogue in research. In evaluating what I have to say about classification, one general caveat must be observed. My remarks on classification will relate exclusively to its use in the classified catalogue. While some points might have relevance to the classification of books for shelving, others might have differing relevance or no relevance whatever. No effort will be made here to indicate when there is or is not a common ground in problems of shelf classification and the classified catalogue. A second caveat is that the limitations of my experience withpublished or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

40|$|Subject Cataloging {{is one of}} the {{processes}} of subject approach to information, beside indexing and subject analysis. In this sense, this research is a part of a broader project which analyses ISKO as an academic space that promotes a dialogical dimension among those theoretical questions. In this sense, it aims to analyze the presence of <b>subject</b> <b>cataloguing</b> in the discussions of knowledge organization as well as how the authors of such subject dialogue each other. Considering the questions, the full collection of ISKO and ISKO-Spain conference proceedings were analyzed in order to verify how present were <b>subject</b> <b>cataloguing</b> matters in those collections. It was possible to identify a group of 36 articles (27 from International ISKO and 9 from ISKO – Spain) whose references were bibliometrically analyzed in terms of documentary forms, average life, language and citation analysis. The results showed that the major ISKO and ISKO-Spain literature on <b>subject</b> <b>cataloguing</b> is based on journal articles, mostly published in English, presenting a relatively young average life (14 years for ISKO and 10 for ISKO-Spain). Considerando o importante papel desempenhado pela Catalogação de Assunto no universo teórico-metodológico do tratamento temático da informação, buscou-se analisar a construção de seu referencial teórico na ISKO. Para tanto, partiu-se de um estudo históricoconceitual para se chegar à análise das 36 comunicações (27 na ISKO e 9 na ISKO – Espanha) referentes a esse tema. A esse corpus procedeu-se uma análise bibliométrica relativa às fontes documentais utilizadas (forma, língua e vida média) e aos autores citados (redes de citação por meio do software PAJEK). Os resultados da análise revelaram uma presença ainda tímida dessa temática no universo analisado, destacando-se a predominância de fontes documentais baseadas em artigos de periódicos, publicados em inglês, com vida média jovem (14 anos para ISKO e 11 para ISKO-Espanha) ...|$|R
