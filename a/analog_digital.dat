2500|$|Digital {{speakers}} {{have been}} the subject of experiments performed by Bell Labs as far back as the 1920s. The design is simple; each bit controls a driver, which is either fully 'on' or 'off'. Problems with this design have led manufacturers to abandon it as impractical for the present. First, for a reasonable number of bits (required for adequate sound reproduction quality), the physical size of a speaker system becomes very large. Secondly, due to inherent <b>analog</b> <b>digital</b> conversion problems, the effect of aliasing is unavoidable, so that the audio output is [...] "reflected" [...] at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the sampling frequency, causing an unacceptably high level of ultrasonics to accompany the desired output. No workable scheme has been found to adequately deal with this.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{subtitle}} {{deals with}} currency crimes. Largely {{because of the}} effectiveness of the BSA, money launders had been avoiding traditional financial institutions to launder money and were using cash-based businesses to avoid them. A new effort was made to stop the laundering of money through bulk currency movements, mainly focusing on the confiscation of criminal proceeds and the increase in penalties for money laundering. Congress found that a criminal offense of merely evading the reporting of money transfers was insufficient and decided {{that it would be better}} if the smuggling of the bulk currency itself was the offense. Therefore, the BSA was amended to make it a criminal offense to evade currency reporting by concealing more than US$10,000 on any person or through any luggage, merchandise or other container that moves into or out of the U.S. The penalty for such an offense is up to 5 years imprisonment and the forfeiture of any property up to the amount that was being smuggled. It also made the civil and criminal penalty violations of currency reporting cases be the forfeiture of all a defendant's property that was involved in the offense, and any property traceable to the defendant. The Act prohibits and penalizes those who run unlicensed money transmitting businesses. In 2005, this provision of the USA PATRIOT Act was used to prosecute Yehuda Abraham for helping to arrange money transfers for British arms dealer Hermant Lakhani, who was arrested in August 2003 after being caught in a government sting. Lakhani had tried to sell a missile to an FBI agent posing as a Somali militant. The definition of counterfeiting was expanded to encompass <b>analog,</b> <b>digital</b> or electronic image reproductions, and it was made an offense to own such a reproduction device. Penalties were increased to 20 years imprisonment. Money laundering [...] "unlawful activities" [...] was expanded to include the provision of material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organizations. The Act specifies that anyone who commits or conspires to undertake a fraudulent activity outside the jurisdiction of the United States, and which would be an offense in the U.S., will be prosecuted under , which deals with fraud and related activity in connection with access devices.|$|E

A popular approach to describing circuits for simulation purposes is to use a hardware description language such as VHDL. Similar efforts have also been carried out in the analog domain that has led to tools such as SPICE. However, with the growing trend of hardware designs that contain both <b>analog</b> and <b>digital</b> components, design environments that seamlessly integrate <b>analog</b> and <b>digital</b> circuitry are needed. Simulation of such circuits is however, exacerbated by the higher resource (CPU and memory) demands that arise when <b>analog</b> and <b>digital</b> models are integrated in a mixed-mode (<b>analog</b> and <b>digital)</b> simulation.

40|$|Pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> {{converters}} {{are widely}} used in telecommunication systems and instrumentation systems, where wide bandwidth analog input signals need to be converted into medium to high resolution digital signals. A pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converter is sensitive to distortion introduced by its residue amplifiers, because such distortion leaks into the digital output signal, thus affecting the converter resolution. To reduce distortion, high performance operational amplifiers are usually required {{in the first few}} pipeline stages, but this causes the power consumption, the area occupation and therefore the cost of the converter to increase. An alternative approach is to design low performance operational amplifiers to reduce area and power, and compensate for the distortion they introduce by calibrating the signal in the digital domain. This dissertation presents a new digital background calibration technique called Harmonic Distortion Correction, which allows the estimation and correction of the distortion introduced by residue amplifiers in pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converters. Implemented in a prototype pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converter together with another digital calibration technique known in literature as DAC Noise Cancellation, Harmonic Distortion Correction has been proven to facilitate low-voltage operation and to enable reductions in power consumption relative to comparable conventional state-of-the-art pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converters. Chapter 1 provides a mathematical model for the analysis of the distortion introduced by residue amplifiers in pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converters, outlines the theory behind the Harmonic Distortion Correction algorithm, and presents the behavioral model of an example pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converter implementing such technique. Chapter 2 presents a pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converter integrated circuit prototype implementing Harmonic Distortion Correction and DAC Noise Cancellation, describes the system level and circuit level design issues and solutions, and provides the prototype measurement results...|$|R
