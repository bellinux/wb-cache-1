Many {{of his peers}} from WCW—now working for WWE—such as William Regal, Bill DeMott, and Scott Armstrong, did defend Gilbertti, stating that he fully embraced the gimmick and was successfully <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> over with fans.|$|E
25|$|Rubin {{started to}} shop the {{screenplay}} around to around 50 different producers. While many studios expressed interest, {{they told him}} they wouldn't be able to film it, though Rubin was able to secure additional work through these meetings. After his own agent left the industry, Rubin hired a spec agent to help sell the script more. The script got to the hands of Richard Lovett in the Creative Artists Agency, who was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> to Harold Ramis around 1991, leading to Ramis offering to produce the film.|$|E
50|$|To be {{effective}} and safe, a volley should be either (1) a drop volley that barely passes the net so the opposing player {{will not be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> or (2) a very sharply angled shot so that again the opponent will not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> or (3) a hard shot that bounces very near both the opponent's baseline and the sideline and {{that serves as a}} set-up shot in anticipation of a weak return by the opponent. Any other volley will permit the opponent <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the ball in plenty of time to make an aggressive return shot, either a lob or a passing shot.|$|R

25|$|As {{it turned}} out, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was unwilling to}} fund two giant 10 GeV accelerators, but was willing to fund two smaller ones of 2.5 GeV and 6 GeV. At a meeting at which Brookhaven was {{represented}} by Morse, Livingston and Leland John Haworth, the Brookhaven team accepted the smaller one, hoping {{that they would be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> finished first and thereby have an advantage in building the 10 GeV machine. The machine, known as the Cosmotron, was approved by the AEC in April 1948, and reached its full power of 3.3 GeV in 1953.|$|E
25|$|In the men's free skating, Brian Joubert slashed {{his hand}} on his skate blade and left drops of blood all over the ice; he {{completed}} the program but later required medical attention. Also during the free skating, a screw in Daisuke Takahashi's skate came loose on his first jump. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> repaired and resumed his program within the three minutes allowed. Oda ruined his chances of a medal by doing an extra triple jump, resulting in a loss of 13 points. Florent Amodio used music with lyrics, which is not allowed in competitive skating with the exception of ice dancing. He was not given the normally required one-point penalty because not enough judges voted for it.|$|E
25|$|Lutyens {{campaigned for}} its fixing, {{but was not}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> to be changed. Lutyens {{wanted to make a}} long {{inclined}} grade all the way to Viceroy's House with retaining walls on either side. While this would give a view of the house from further back, it would also cut through the square between the secretariat buildings. The committee with Lutyens and Baker established in January 1914 said the grade was to be no steeper than 1 in 25, though it eventually was changed to 1 in 22, a steeper gradient which made it more difficult to see the Viceroy's palace. While Lutyens knew about the gradient, and the possibility that the Viceroy's palace would be obscured by the road, it is thought that Lutyens did not fully realize how little {{the front of the house}} would be visible. In 1916 the Imperial Delhi committee dismissed Lutyens's proposal to alter the gradient. Lutyens thought Baker was more concerned with making money and pleasing the government, rather than making a good architectural design.|$|E

Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly awarded the song a B+ rating, stating that: [...] "Remember when {{the thought of}} Jennifer Lopez releasing good music was as likely as a sequel to Angel Eyes? Well, our bad. The American Idol judge shot up the charts with the cheesetastic Ibiza chant On the Floor. Now she unites with Gaga pal RedOne for this appropriately named piece of pop pleasure: Once the club banger hits your ears, good or bad, you won't be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out of your head." [...] Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, gave a positive review of the song, stating that between [...] "On the Floor" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] Lopez is [...] "really made a glittery return to her extreme club/"Waiting for Tonight" [...] roots". She continued by stating: [...] "Sure, ' Mind' may be shallower than the kiddie pool, {{but this one is}} up from the first second... and never goes down". Monica Herrera from Billboard stated that on [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] RedOne and Lady Gaga bring the [...] "hit potential", while Lopez [...] "brings the heat". She continued by stating that the song is an [...] "irresistible '80s euphoria and release".|$|E

2500|$|April 1777 was a busy {{month for}} Camilla. On 6 April she {{captured}} the brig Willing Maid, bound from St. Thomas, Danish West Indies, to Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina, with a cargo of sugar, rum, and salt. However, the brig sprang a leak and sank. On 11 April 1777, Camilla was patrolling with 44-gun frigate [...] {{near the mouth}} of the Delaware River, just north of the Cape Henlopen lighthouse, when they came upon the American merchantman Morris. Gunfire from the two British vessels drove Morris ashore, where she suddenly blew up with such force that it shattered the windows on the British vessels. [...] Reports indicate that Morris was carrying 35 tons of gunpowder and that the captain and six crewmen still on the vessel were laying a train of gunpowder to blow her up, when things went wrong. It is not clear whether the powder train burnt too quickly or a shot from Camilla or Roebuck set it off. What is clear is that the vessel disintegrated and all aboard her died in the explosion. Much of her cargo of arms was, however, salvageable, and Americans onshore were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{opening track}} and lead single, [...] "Mr. Know It All," [...] {{features}} a steady four-four stomp, synthetic strings and drum-machine loops, with Clarkson's vocals being deemed as [...] "raw". It {{talks about a}} deceptive, arrogant man, with Rolling Stone remarking that [...] "Clarkson sasses a controlling man with double-entendres that up her R appeal." [...] The second track, [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)", {{was described as a}} [...] "chilly" [...] electropop and [...] "glitter-disco" [...] song, about encouraging personal reinvention. Clarkson herself compared it to her 2004 hit single [...] "Since U Been Gone". The third, [...] "Dark Side", is a mid-tempo track about a longing to be loved and accepted unconditionally, while [...] "Honestly" [...] longs for the truth, even when it's hard. Clarkson wrote [...] "You Love Me" [...] following an incident that she thought would break her, which she described as the most hurt she has ever been in her life, and while writing about it she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out of her system.
