TV Squad's Annie Wu wrote: [...] "With the three hosts {{appearing}} on each other's shows all on one night, it was special appearances galore.

[...] Even so, the three comedians [...] "shared a certain comedic sensibility", and admitted that they had a good time while helping each other out.

500|$|As {{the record}} neared {{completion}} by August 2003, the band performed {{for a short}} time for the armed forces in the Middle East and premiered more new songs at their Reading and Leeds sets. The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good time in my life. I was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the themes}} of This Addiction were heavily {{influenced}} by the band members' personal lives.

2500|$|The men of {{the convoy}} then began {{launching}} boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the Shinyō Maru were also opened up on the Allied personnel. Marine Corps Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; [...] "Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out my chin. Nevertheless, I was able to work myself back up on deck, and I was eyeing that bridge when I came out that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found out that we {{were out in the}} ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth." [...] Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by firing squad as punishment for trying to escape. One of those men was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again. The Japanese dropped 45 depth charges and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt.

The historical concept of the [...] "airborne guns" [...] is to some degree outdated, their role being filled by mortars, wire-guided missiles, and/or light anti-tank weapons.

A wide range of American aircraft designs also went to the Soviet Union's VVS air arm through Lend-Lease, primarily fighters like the P-39 and P-63 used for aerial combat, along with attack and medium bombers like the A-20 and the B-25 being among the more prominent types, both bombers being well suited to the type of lower-altitude strike missions the Soviets had as a top priority.|$|R
