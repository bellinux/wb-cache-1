5|$|Robert {{held the}} office of Dean of York from at least 1147, but may have {{occupied}} the office as early as 1142. He may have been still alive as late as 1157, as it is possible he was the <b>addressee</b> of {{a letter from the}} papacy in January 1157. His last secure attestation as dean is in October 1154. Although Keats-Rohan states in Domesday Descendants that Robert was also Archdeacon of York, he is not so listed in the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae under any of the archdeaconries.|$|E
5|$|Typologically, Erromintxela {{displays}} the same features as the Basque dialects it derives its grammatical structures from. Its case marking follows the ergative–absolutive pattern where {{the subject of}} an intransitive verb is in the absolutive case (which is unmarked), the same case being used for the direct object of a transitive verb. The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the ergative case. Similarly, auxiliary verbs agree with the subject and any direct object and indirect object present and verb forms are marked for allocutive (i.e. a marker is used to indicate the gender of the <b>addressee).</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{establish}} a semantic characterisation of vocatives, while leaving aside pragmatic and sociolinguistic considerations as far as possible. I will defend the 'IPA-hypothesis' of the meaning of vocatives, that is, the hypothesis that vocatives have three basic functions: to identify the <b>addressee(s),</b> to predicate something on the <b>addressee(s),</b> and to activate the <b>addressee(s).</b> It will be argued that the traditional call vs. address dichotomy is insufficient...|$|R

[...] (with a man's or woman's name).|$|R
5|$|Baldwin {{became a}} monk in about 1170, and then abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Forde. He {{was well known}} as a canonist, and often acted as a judge-delegate for the papacy, hearing cases that had reached the Roman Curia and been remanded to local experts for decision. In 1166, Baldwin was the <b>addressee</b> of a work by John of Salisbury, Expectiatione longa, {{which was one of}} the tracts written during the Becket controversy. It was {{probably}} at this time that Baldwin wrote De sacramento altaris. In 1175 he served with his old bishop, Bartholomew, as joint papal judge in a dispute between Malmesbury Abbey and Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury. In 1178 he was recommended to Pope Alexander as a possible candidate for a cardinalship, but this never occurred.|$|E

Possessive pronouns mark for person, number, and inclusivity, {{but not for}} gender or for non-human noun class.|$|E

After discussing 1 Peter as letter, external sources were used to construct the economic–historic context of the <b>addressees</b> of 1 Peter. This construction was then refined utilising the letter itself, by identifying, categorising and interpreting the economically relevant portions of 1 Peter. Finally, the economic–historic context of the <b>addressees</b> of 1 Peter was concluded and the method summarised. [URL]...|$|R

The most given entities are chosen as antecedents of pronouns...|$|R
