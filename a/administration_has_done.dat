25|$|There are {{large-scale}} {{shortages of}} facilities across Philippine public schools - these include classrooms, teachers, desks and chairs, textbooks, and audio-video materials. According to 2003 Department of Education Undersecretary Juan Miguel Luz, reportedly over 17 million students {{are enrolled in}} Philippine public schools, and at an annual population growth rate of 2.3 per cent, about 1.7 million babies are born every year which means {{that in a few}} years time, more individuals will assert ownership over their share of the (limited) educational provisions. To sum it up, there are too many students and too little resources. Albeit the claims the government makes on increasing the allocated budget for education, there is a prevalent difficulty the public school system faces with regard to shortages. Furthermore, state universities and colleges gradually raise tuition so as to have a means of purchasing facilities, thus making tertiary education difficult to access or more often than not, inaccessible to the poor. However, it is worth taking note of what the Aquino <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> in its five years of governance with regard to classroom-building - the number of classrooms built from 2005 to {{the first half of the}} year 2010 has tripled. Additionally, the number of classrooms that were put up from the year 2010 to February 2015 was recorded to be at 86,478, significantly exceeding the 17,305 classrooms that were built from 2005 to 2010 and adequate enough to counterbalance the 66,800 classroom deficit in the year 2010.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} on New Labour’s educational achievements. It focuses on those aspects of policy that Labour itself highlighted in its manifestos, such as the raising of educational standards. A major issue, particularly {{on the issue of}} standards, is the methodological weaknesses of the statistics used. No firm conclusion can be drawn on whether standards rose or not: they probably merely kept pace with those in other countries. However Labour clearly put more resources into education than the previous Conservative <b>administrations</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> There is also evidence of increased participation in post-compulsory (16 - 18) education, and Labour policies probably contributed towards this. There is also evidence of narrowing inequalities in achievement at the end of compulsory schooling. Conversely the introduction of fees for HE do not appear to have made inequalities worse. On balance then education represents a modest success for New Labour although the biggest story is really the over-claiming from both sides about their respective successes and failures and the poor quality and lack of commensurability over time of the statistical data...|$|R
