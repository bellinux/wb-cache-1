It combines an object-oriented type system, syntax-directed translation schemes and a target-language interface.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{present the}} <b>Abstract-Type</b> <b>and</b> <b>Scheme-Definition</b> <b>Language</b> (ASDL), a new {{formalism}} and environment kernel. The main {{goal of this}} object-oriented kernel is to reconcile integration and extensibility. ASDL adopts the ideas underlying language-based editor generators but overcomes their extensibility deficiencies. ASDL combines an object-oriented type system with syntax-directed translation schemes and a target-language interface. Its power lies in utilizing inheritance for structure-driven computations. The authors discuss object types, translation rules, and semantic information in ASDL...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} shows that {{different}} neural activity during mental imagery and abstract mentation can be assigned to well-defined steps of the brain's information-processing. During randomized visual presentation of single, imagery-type <b>and</b> <b>abstract-type</b> words, 27 channel event-related potential (ERP) field maps were obtained from 25 subjects (sequence-divided into a first and second group for statistics). The brain field map series showed a sequence of typical map configurations that were quasi-stable for brief time periods (microstates). The microstates were concatenated by rapid map changes. As different map configurations must result from different spatial patterns of neural activity, each microstate represents different active neural networks. Accordingly, microstates are assumed to correspond to discrete steps of information-processing. Comparing microstate topographies (using centroids) between imagery- <b>and</b> <b>abstract-type</b> words, significantly different microstates were found in both subject groups at 286 – 354 ms where imagery-type words were more right-lateralized than <b>abstract-type</b> words, <b>and</b> at 550 – 606 ms and 606 – 666 ms where anterior-posterior differences occurred. We conclude that language-processing consists of several, well-defined steps and that the brain-states incorporating those steps are altered by the stimuli's capacities to generate mental imagery or abstract mentation in a state-dependent manner...|$|R
