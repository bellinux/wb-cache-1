5|$|Beauchamp rode to Frankfort on business, {{reaching}} it on November 6. Unable to find lodging at {{the local}} inns, he rented {{a room in the}} private residence of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of his clothes near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return. He observed Sharp re-enter the house about midnight.|$|E

5|$|The dining room, on {{the other}} hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. The room size was increased by {{the construction of a}} bay window, parquet floor was installed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in the room was the fireplace mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{entrance to}} the north-west of the station, St Andrew's Gate, was officially opened on 16 December 1957 to mark the link between Uxbridge and the Royal Air Force. A memorial to the personnel of No. 11 Group, made of Cornish granite, {{was placed in the}} ground above the Operations Room in 1957. No. 11 Group moved to RAF Martlesham Heath on 14 April 1958 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was soon sealed in its original condition. The memorial was unveiled by Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding on 23 April 1958 in a ceremony attended by Group Captain Douglas Bader and Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, among others, and marked by a flypast of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. Control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to Technical Training Command that year, at which time the entire site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from RAF Spitalgate on 10 November 1958, and the station was subsequently merged with No. 22 Group RAF.|$|E

This open building with large windows was originally used as a restroom and later, during the Tulip era (1718–1730), as a lodge for guests. It is situated next to the Tulip Garden.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, First Lady Grace Coolidge {{undertook}} a refurbishment of the White House. Coolidge appointed {{a group of}} wealthy patrons of the arts, {{many of whom were}} knowledgeable in Colonial and Early American furniture and art, to locate historic furnishings and raise money for the renovation. A split emerged in the committee between those who wished to implement a Colonial Revival style room and those who wished to preserve the 1902 Beaux-Arts decor. The dispute became public, and President Calvin Coolidge ordered the renovation stopped. Work resumed with a different committee in 1926, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> redecorated in Colonial Revival and Federal furniture.|$|E
25|$|The Breakfast Room: A private small low-ceilinged room on {{the rustic}} floor of the south front. In the 18th century this was the house's only bathroom; more of an indoor {{swimming}} pool, the sunken plunge pool was heated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> decorated in the Pompeian style complete with Corinthian columns. Converted by the Russian Countess of Pembroke to a breakfast room circa 1815, it is today wallpapered in a Chinese design, the paper being an exact copy of that used in the original 1815 decoration of the room. The 18th century furniture of a simulated-bamboo, Gothic style gives this private dining room a distinct oriental atmosphere.|$|E

The furniture and objects are luxurious <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is richly panelled and decorated. The chaplain holds a ledger and at his feet is a large famille-rose punch bowl, the punch bowl being an invitation to the viewer to join the levity at the table. He is separated from Graham across the table by a salt-cellar, possibly symbolising their social difference. His presence at the captain's table for this informal occasion nevertheless indicates that he is a privileged member of Graham's entourage.|$|E
25|$|Escape {{the room}} games are a further {{specialization}} of point-and-click adventure games; these games are typically short and {{confined to a}} small space to explore, with almost no interaction with non-player characters. Most games of this type require the player {{to figure out how}} to escape a room using the limited resources within it and through the solving of logic puzzles. Other variants include games that require the player to manipulate a complex object to achieve a certain end in the fashion of a puzzle box. These games are often delivered in Adobe Flash format and are also popular on mobile devices. Examples of the subgenre include the Submachine-series, MOTAS (Mystery of Time and Space) <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Room.</b>|$|E
25|$|The keep {{is divided}} {{internally}} {{by a wall}} running west to east. South of this wall {{on the ground floor}} is the hall, measuring 6m by 12m. The hall was accessed from the entrance lobby to the west, and was lit by three large windows. A fireplace stood in the internal wall, and a minstrel's gallery overlooks from the west wall. The hall ceiling was a stone vault, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> fills the whole height of the keep. North of the internal wall was the kitchen, and a private room. Above these, within the height of the keep, were two additional rooms accessed from below. Another four rooms were located in the attic. The roof was a double gable, the central valley supported by the internal wall.|$|E

25|$|To reduce {{noise from}} the street, Wright {{eliminated}} street level windows in the temple. Instead, natural light comes from stained glass windows in the roof and clerestories along the upper walls. Because {{the members of the}} parish {{would not be able to}} look outside, Unity Temple's stained glass was designed with green, yellow, and brown tones in order to evoke the colors of nature. The main floor of the temple is accessed via a lower floor (which has seating space), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> also has two balconies for the seating of the congregation. These varying seating levels allowed the architect to design a building to fit the size of the congregation, but efficiently: no one person in the congregation is more than 40 feet from the pulpit. Wright also designed the building with very good acoustics.|$|E
25|$|When in 1684 Louis XIV {{moved into}} the {{adjacent}} room to the south (the chambre du roi), this central room behind {{the facade of the}} avant-corps was designated as the salon du roi or the salon où le roi s’habille ("the room in which the king dresses"). For 17 years, it served as venue for the ceremonies that surrounded the life of the king, such as the lever and the coucher. When the chambre de Louis XIV was established in 1701, the archways to the Hall of Mirrors were sealed off, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> became the ideological as well as physical focal point of the palace. The king died in this room on 1September 1715. Later, Louis XV and Louis XVI would continue to use it for the lever and the coucher. On 6 October 1789, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and the Dauphin appeared on the balcony before the mob that forced the royal family to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The general type of the bolyar houses {{between the}} 13th and 14th centuries is {{difficult}} to determine {{because of the lack of}} enough architecture data. To the north of the Royal Palace in Tsarevets were excavated the foundations of a bolyar house from the beginning of the 13th century. Its general plan was Г-shaped and consisted of residential and еconomic part. High stone walls closed the yard from the other sides. The residential edifice had two floors. The first floor was built of stone and separated into three identical rooms, the middle of which looked towards the yard; there was the door. The marble bases of the two columns which supported the second floor and parts of the staircase have been preserved. The second floor was with bow-windows <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> in the middle was probably open-air. The economic section had one floor and was segmented into several parts and had veranda looking to the yard. In the south-western edge are visible the foundations of a small family church with one nave. The bolyar house in Melnik has a similar plan and is also dated from the 14th century.|$|E
