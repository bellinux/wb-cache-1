On March 29, 1971, Ford recalled 220,000 Pintos, all Pintos manufactured prior to March 19, 1971, to <b>address</b> <b>a</b> possible problem with fuel vapors in the engine air filter igniting by a backfire through the carburetor.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, the Australian Commonwealth {{and state}} governments {{launched}} a joint Commonwealth Housing Scheme to <b>address</b> <b>a</b> national shortage of accommodation.

40|$|The {{present study}} compares {{prosodic}} features of child-directed speech (CDS) and foreigner-directed speech (FDS), to exam-ine whether FDS is a derivative of CDS as suggested in socio-linguistic studies. Twelve female speakers completed a simple referential communication task <b>addressed</b> to <b>an</b> imaginary adult, an imaginary foreigner, and an imaginary child. The results showed that, {{compared to the}} adult-directed baseline (ADS), participants increased pitch range and f 0 maxi-ma when <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> child, but not when <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> for-eigner. Furthermore, participants lowered their speech rate when addressing interlocutors with limited linguistic capacity, but did so differentially: Participants tended to lengthen pauses when <b>addressing</b> <b>an</b> imaginary foreigner, and tended to lengthen segments when <b>addressing</b> <b>an</b> imaginary child. These {{findings suggest that the}} prosodic features of CDS and FDS are different, and that speakers have acquired knowl-edge about how to fine-tune their prosodic adjustments to the specific needs of different interlocutors. 1...|$|R

5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form {{that would not have}} been used to <b>address</b> <b>a</b> person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E
5|$|At 5:17pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi {{was with}} his grandnieces {{in the garden of}} the former Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to <b>address</b> <b>a</b> prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse fired three bullets from a Beretta 9mm pistol into his chest at point-blank range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot. In other accounts, such as one {{prepared}} by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Coexist {{features}} a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little dynamism, and experimentation with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse {{elements such as}} simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Smith's production incorporates both programmed beats and live percussion instruments. Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy. The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, <b>address</b> <b>a</b> failing relationship and changes in a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to <b>address</b> <b>a</b> legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Griffin {{was invited}} to <b>address</b> <b>a</b> meeting at the University of Bath by {{politics}} student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. The invitation was viewed by some as {{an attempt by the}} party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the RAAF airmen operating {{as part of the}} RAF in the UK, hundreds of Royal Australian Navy (RAN) personnel were serving with the Royal Navy (RN) {{at the time of the}} Battle of Normandy. No Australian warships took part in the operation, however. Most of the Australian officers serving with the RN were members of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RANVR). Four RAN sub-lieutenants who had been sent to the UK to undergo training were also assigned to RN landing craft units to help <b>address</b> <b>a</b> shortage of officers capable of coordinating operations by these vessels.|$|E

5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to <b>address</b> <b>a</b> lacuna between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine was the world's first {{publicly}} funded college of osteopathic medicine. It has a long-standing tradition of retaining its alumni in Michigan to practice – {{more than two-thirds}} of the college's graduates remain to practice in Michigan. In 2008, the Michigan State University Board of Trustees approved a resolution endorsing the expansion of the College of Osteopathic Medicine to two sites in southeast Michigan, a move board members and college officials say will not only improve medical education in the state, but also <b>address</b> <b>a</b> projected physician shortage.|$|E
5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To <b>address</b> <b>a</b> weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits {{to the size of}} a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the cable strain relief mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.|$|E
