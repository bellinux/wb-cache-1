It was a heartiness, and a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sad want of such blessings at home. She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions on business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts; from finding her keys, and <b>assorting</b> her trinkets, to trying to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, well amused as she generally was, in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her moments of imagining.|$|E
40|$|Viruses of {{influenza}} A subtype H 7 {{can be highly}} pathogenic and periodically infect humans. For example, {{there have been numerous}} outbreaks of H 7 in the Americas and Europe since 1996. More recently, a reassortant H 7 N 9 has emerged among humans and birds during 2013 – 2014 in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. This H 7 N 9 genome consists of genetic segments that <b>assort</b> with H 7 and H 9 viruses previously circulating in chickens and wild birds in China and ducks in Korea. Epidemic risk modellers have used agricultural, climatic and demographic data to predict that the virus will spread to northern Vietnam via poultry. To shed light on the traffic of H 7 viruses in general, we examine genetic segments {{of influenza}} that have assorted with many strains of H 7 viruses dating back to 1902. We focus on use cases from the United States, Italy and China. We apply a novel metric, betweenness, an associated phylogenetic visualization technique, transmission networks, and compare these with another technique, route mapping. In contrast to traditional views, our results illustrate that segments that <b>assort</b> with H 7 viruses are spread frequently between the Americas and Eurasia. In summary, genetic segments that historically <b>assort</b> with H 7 influenza viruses have been spread from China to: Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mongolia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the UK, the US, and Vietnam...|$|R

60|$|On the 4th of January I left Amboyna for Ternate; but {{two years}} later, in October 1859, I again visited it after my {{residence}} in Menado, and stayed {{a month in the}} town in a small house which I hired for the sake of <b>assorting</b> and packing up a large and varied collection which I had brought with me from North Celebes, Ternate, and Gilolo. I was obliged to do this because the mail steamer would have come the following month by way of Amboyna to Ternate, and I should have been delayed two months before I could have reached the former place. I then paid my first visit to Ceram, and on returning to prepare for my second more complete exploration of that island, I stayed (much against my will) two months at Paso, on the isthmus which connects the two portions of the island of Amboyna. This village is situated on {{the eastern side of the}} isthmus, on sandy ground, with a very pleasant view over the sea to the island of Harúka. On the Amboyna side of the isthmus there is a small river which has been continued by a shallow canal to within thirty yards of high-water mark on the other side. Across this small space, which is sandy and but slightly elevated, all small boats and praus can be easily dragged, and all the smaller traffic from Ceram and the islands of Saparúa and Harúka, passes through Paso. The canal is not continued quite through, merely because every spring-tide would throw up just such a sand-bank as now exists.|$|E
60|$|There {{would seem}} little need for {{proceeding}} further in this history. Imagination will readily supply the meager recital of poor Bartleby's interment. But ere parting with the reader, let me say, {{that if this}} little narrative has sufficiently interested him, to awaken curiosity as to who Bartleby was, and what manner of life he led prior to the present narrator's making his acquaintance, I can only reply, that in such curiosity I fully share, but am wholly unable to gratify it. Yet here I hardly know whether I should divulge one little item of rumor, which came to my ear {{a few months after}} the scrivener's decease. Upon what basis it rested, I could never ascertain; and hence, how true it is I cannot now tell. But inasmuch as this vague report has not been without certain strange suggestive interest to me, however sad, it may prove the same with some others; and so I will briefly mention it. The report was this: that Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead Letter Office at Washington, from which he had been suddenly removed by a change in the administration. When I think over this rumor, I cannot adequately express the emotions which seize me. Dead letters! does it not sound like dead men? Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone to a pallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to heighten it than that of continually handling these dead letters, and <b>assorting</b> them for the flames? For by the cart-load they are annually burned. Sometimes from out the folded paper the pale clerk takes a ring:--the finger it was meant for, perhaps, moulders in the grave; a bank-note sent in swiftest charity:--he whom it would relieve, nor eats nor hungers any more; pardon for those who died despairing; hope for those who died unhoping; good tidings for those who died stifled by unrelieved calamities. On errands of life, these letters speed to death.|$|E

I don't mind the trouble, though my head swims with it. I do not mind meeting accounts, which unpaid remind you of your distress, or paid serve to show you you have been throwing away money you would be glad to have back again. I do not mind the strange contradictory mode of papers hiding themselves that you wish to see, and others thrusting themselves into your hand to confuse and bewilder you.
