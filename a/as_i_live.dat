500|$|Jab Tak Hai Jaan (English: As Long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Live,</b> {{literally}} [...] "as long, or as far, {{as there}} is life") is a 2012 Indian romantic drama film directed by Yash Chopra and written and produced by Aditya Chopra under their production banner, Yash Raj Films. The movie is the first collaboration between Khan and Kaif, and the second between Khan and Sharma (they previously featured in the 2008 film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi). Yash Chopra returned to directing eight years after Veer-Zaara. This was to be his final film {{before his death in}} October 2012, at age 80. The background score and soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics from Gulzar. The Film is loosely inspired on The end of the Affair by Graham Greene.|$|E

60|$|Oh, my childhood! I had feelings: passive <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived,</b> little <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spoke, cold <b>as</b> <b>I</b> looked, when I {{thought of}} past days, I could feel. About the present, {{it was better}} to be stoical; about the future--such a future as mine--to be dead. And in {{catalepsy}} and a dead trance, I studiously held the quick of my nature.|$|R
60|$|That {{experience}} has been of priceless value and benefit to me; for I resolved then, that <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>I</b> would never again rob a blind beggar-woman in a church; and I have always kept my word.

2500|$|In the Hebrew Bible itself, the commandment is {{directed}} against {{abuse of the}} name of God, not against any use; there are numerous examples in the Hebrew Bible and a few in the New Testament where God's name is called upon in oaths to tell the truth or to support the truth of the statement being sworn to, and the books of Daniel and Revelation include instances where an angel sent by God invokes the name of God to support the truth of apocalyptic revelations. [...] God himself is presented as swearing by his own name ("As surely <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> …") to guarantee the certainty of various events foretold through the prophets.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, {{there were}} no {{mitigating}} factors in Shadrake's favour. The Court of Appeal stated that Shadrake had not shown any remorse, but had continued to stand by the statements he made. Following the High Court's ruling on liability but before it had sentenced him, Shadrake had also given an interview to the UK newspaper The Guardian, in which he described his book as [...] "devastatingly accurate" [...] and declared that [...] "his story is never going away. I'll keep it on the boil for as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live.</b> They're going to regret they ever started this." [...] Furthermore, Shadrake had expressed an intention to produce a second edition of the book.|$|E
2500|$|After giving birth, while resting {{near the}} trunk of a palm tree Jesus spoke to Mary from the cradle instructing her to shake the tree and obtain its fruits. After showing Jesus as a newborn to her family Jesus again spoke [...] "Lo, I am God's servant; God has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet. Blessed he has made me, {{wherever}} I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, so long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> and likewise to cherish my mother" [...] in order to dispel rumours of conception. This birth narrative draws strong parallels to the apocryphal tradition of Jesus' birth within the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and Arabic Infancy Gospel.|$|E

2500|$|The notion was {{initially}} ill-received due to {{concerns for the}} boys' safety. [...] A mother has been quoted saying, [...] "Camp! My children {{have always had a}} roof over their heads, and as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live,</b> always will!". They did have a roof over their heads because William Smith proceeded with the idea and 1st Glasgow Company held its inaugural one-week camp beginning on Friday, 16 July 1886, at Auchinlochan Hall, Tighnabruaich in a hall. In later years they took to canvas camping on a site at Portavadie in the Kyles of Bute. The First Glasgow continued to attend summer camp at the same location until the summer of 1974 when Portavadie was selected as the location of a proposed yard for the construction of oil production platforms. However the new camp is located only 100 yards away at Stilliag farm. This camp site is now used by many companies of the BB every summer for their camping trip.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to the House of Commons (17 December), he slipped into the Chamber largely {{unacknowledged}} by his own party. One Conservative MP rose to wave his Order Paper, only to have to sit down in embarrassment whilst Labour MPs laughed. On 18 December he addressed the 1922 committee (Conservative backbenchers), declaring “as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live,</b> I shall never apologise for what we did”, but was unable to answer a question about the validity of the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 (which he had in fact reaffirmed in April 1955, two days before becoming Prime Minister). In his final statement to the House of Commons as Prime Minister (20 December 1956) he performed well in a difficult debate, but told MPs that [...] "there was not foreknowledge that Israel would attack Egypt". Victor Rothwell writes that the knowledge of his having misled the House of Commons on this way must have hung over him thereafter, as was the concern that the US Administration might demand that Britain pay reparations to Egypt. Papers released in January 1987 showed the entire Cabinet had been informed of the plan on 23 October 1956.|$|E
