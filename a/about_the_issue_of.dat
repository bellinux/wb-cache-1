5|$|Many former {{adherents of}} the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and {{employment}} {{difficult to find}} because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, {{there were only two}} alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After the failure of the rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E
5|$|Throughout World War I the Australian forces {{deployed}} overseas {{were all}} volunteers, however, {{on the home}} front there was considerable debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> conscription. Conscription had been a contentious issue ever since Federation and when the AIF was initially raised in 1914 it had been decided that it would be an all-volunteer force due to the provisions of the Defence Act that precluded sending conscripts overseas. Nevertheless, as the war progressed, casualties amongst the deployed forces began to reach alarming rates and as the flow of reinforcements and recruits for the AIF began to drop in 1916, the issue of conscription rose once more.|$|E

25|$|Some, despite {{repeated}} denials {{of a conflict}} of interest, saw this comparison as assimilation pure and simple.and as such have seen fit to denounce it. The journalist Benoît Rayski accused some intellectuals, including Stéphane Courtois, Alain Besançon, Ernst Nolte, and Jean-François Revel of wanting to confound the West <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Nazism to promote their own anticommunism.|$|E
25|$|There is {{disagreement}} among American physicians as {{to whether}} the non-maleficence principle excludes the practice of euthanasia. Euthanasia is currently legal in the states of Washington DC, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Around the world there are different organizations that campaign to change legislation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> physician assisted death, or PAD. Examples of such organizations are the Hemlock Society of the United States and the Dignity in Dying campaign in the United Kingdom. These groups believe that doctors should be given the right to end a patient’s life only if the patient is conscious enough to decide for themselves, is knowledgeable about the possibility of alternative care, and has willingly asked to end their life or requested access to the means to do so.|$|E

25|$|Other {{important}} {{issues related to}} the treatment of hookworm are reinfection and drug resistance. It has been shown that reinfection after treatment can be extremely high. Some studies even show that 80% of pretreatment hookworm infection rates can be seen in treated communities within 30–36 months. While reinfection may occur, it is still recommended that regular treatments be conducted as it will minimize the occurrence of chronic outcomes. There are also increasing concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> drug resistance. Drug resistance has appeared in front-line anthelmintics used for livestock nematodes. Generally human nematodes are less likely to develop resistance due to longer reproducing times, less frequent treatment, and more targeted treatment. Nonetheless, the global community must be careful to maintain the effectiveness of current anthelmintic as no new anthelmintic drugs are in the late-stage development.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that {{the root of the}} current ecological crisis is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, {{there is no point in}} going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E
500|$|The first {{performances}} of She Has a Name in the United States were produced by FreeFall Stage {{in a rented}} space at Victory Life Church in Folsom, California in 2014 {{under the direction of}} Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time. She and her sister had become passionate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> human trafficking {{as a result of their}} involvement with the organization Run for Courage, and the two sisters considered writing a play about human trafficking in the United States. Because they were both college students, they did not find the time to write a play, so in 2013, their mother, Deedee Eldridge, began looking for a human-trafficking-related play that had already been written and she discovered She Has a Name. It was the only play she was able to find on the subject of human trafficking. Emma Eldridge later said of She Has a Name, [...] "I've never read something and been so compelled to do it." [...] The family decided to stage the play, and Deedee Eldridge served as producer and executive director. To have the rights to produce the play, FreeFall Stage made a special arrangement with the Playwrights Guild of Canada.|$|E

500|$|Olinda's {{position}} was precarious. [...] "He lacked {{the character and}} skills to impose his authority, while the attempts he did make to take control were seen as presumptuous, a usurpation of a position belonging to the emperor alone." [...] The [...] "generation of politicians {{who had come to}} power in the 1830s, following upon the abdication of Pedro I, had learned from bitter experience the difficulties and dangers of government. By 1840 they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival." [...] The Liberals took the dispute over lowering the age of majority directly to the populace, inciting them to place pressure on the politicians. The Brazilian people supported lowering the age of majority and a popular song was heard in the streets: [...] "We want Pedro the Second,/ Although he is not of age;/ The nation excuses the law,/ and long live the majority!" [...] As emperor, Pedro II [...] "was the living symbol of the unity of the fatherland [...] This position gave him, in the eyes of public opinion, a higher authority than that of any regent." [...] The Conservatives weren’t opposed to the Liberal plan, and both (including the regent himself, who would inevitably lose his office) wished to end the regency. Olinda asked Pedro II what he thought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> majority, and he simply answered, [...] "I have not thought about that," [...] and continued, [...] "I have already heard about it, but I have not given it any attention." ...|$|E

[...] Finally, all factions in the South complained of unfair representation in the national legislature. The south was industrializing faster and was more prosperous than the north, leading to resentment of northern arrogance and political domination.|$|E
