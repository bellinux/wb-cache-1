40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{properties}} imparted to extruded asphalt curb mixes by five different additives. The AC {{used in these}} mixes was also tested with various amounts of the additives. All of the additives stiffened the AC as indicated by a reduction of penetration and increased viscosity. Only the <b>powdered</b> <b>asphalts,</b> gilsonite and Witcurb improved the Marshall stability and the indirect tensil strength enough to justify their use in curb mixes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} based on {{majority}} indoor tests of recycled asphalt mixture performance. To analyze the elements which could affect different blended rates of the old material and the different mixing processes of recycled asphalt mixture by using orthogonal experiment method. The results show that, different mixing processes have significantly influenced the performance of rutting resistance on the high temperature, resistance to water damage of the recycled asphalt mixture. However blending rate of the old material has influenced more on low-temperature crack resistance of the recycled asphalt mixture. Old material blended rate is 30 % and first mixing of old materials and recycling agent in a hot-melt state, by adding new complementary stone, followed by a new supplementary <b>asphalt</b> mineral <b>powder</b> mixing process to produce recycled asphalt mixture for an ideal performance...|$|R

To make use of its major product, powdered magnesium, PMC also developed and supplied an incendiary bomb mixture of magnesium <b>powder,</b> <b>asphalt,</b> gasoline and others components (known as goop, with similar characteristics to napalm); 17,000 short tons of goop-filled bombs were used in World War II (approximately eight {{percent of the total}} tonnage of incendiaries that were dropped during that conflict). Permanente ranked 42nd among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Introduced {{the current}} {{situation}} {{at home and abroad}} pipeline anticorrosion technology, commonly used in the melting epoxy powder, adhesive tape, anticorrosion, multilayer structure coal tar epoxy, polyurethane extruded polyethylene anticorrosion technology. High performance synthetic resin, filler, pigment, anticorrosion material will have greater development, along with the application of pipeline anticorrosion technology in construction, chemical, oil and other industries, the pipeline anticorrosion technology will have larger development space. At present, our country has gradually formed a set of suitable for pipeline corrosion protection system (coal tar enamel, oil, <b>asphalt,</b> epoxy <b>powder,</b> three-layer composite structure of polyolefin anticorrosive coating). Although anticorrosive coating to achieve the standardization, some technology has reached the foreign advanced standards, but compared with foreign, anticorrosive coating applied in design, material quality and repairing technology, etc, there is a certain gap. General Situation of Anticorrosion Technology {{both at home and abroad}} 1. 1 Overview of domestic pipeline anticorrosion technology In twentieth Century 90 time later period, fusion bonded epoxy powder (FBE) and the three layer of polyethylene (PE) of two kinds of coating becomes the mainstream gradually, and the ne...|$|R

Then the modified powders were characterization by oil absorption value, IR, SEM etc. Hydrated calcium silicate powders modified before and after {{were added to the}} asphalt and the three major indexes of asphalt were tested. The results show that the oil absorption activities of calcium silicate powder decrease obviously, the oil absorption value decreased 80 %. IR spectra show that the hydrated calcium silicate powder adsorbed on the surface modifier, the modified powder morphology was changed. With the increase of powder content, the penetration increases, the ductility decreases. The softening point of asphalt mixed with unmodified powder increases with the increase of powder mixed with modified <b>powder</b> <b>asphalt</b> softening point of 4 % to reach the maximum, and then began to decrease...|$|R
40|$|Method of {{pavement}} {{recycling is}} an alternative technology in pavement construction and maintenance of roads that allow the use of wastes produced by the old pavement. Therefore, researchers tried using the method of recycling by using old materials and reprocessed by adding a fluxing materials and ingredients added {{in the form of}} powder rubber tires. This research aims to restore the value {{of the power of the}} old pavement. The beginning stage of this study seek additional level of asphalt most optimal mix of recycling based on the value of maximum stability, obtained the addition of optimum bitumen content is 1 %. Then, the addition of tire rubber powder ranging from 10 %; 20 %; 30 %; 40 % and 50 % by replacing most of the <b>asphalt</b> with rubber <b>powder</b> tire to the addition of the most optimum bitumen content. The highest stability values that are in a mixture of 10 % levels of tire rubber powder to the optimum bitumen content is 4657. 3 kg, while the value of flow at a level of 10 % of tire rubber powder that is 3. 32 mm. The increasing levels of tire rubber powder in the mix, then the Marshall Quotient value decreases, the value of the highest Quotient marshall is on the addition of tire rubber powder content of 10 % of additions optimum bitumen content is 1402. 8 kg / mm. Highest Density Values are at the addition of tire rubber powder content of 10 % of additions optimum bitumen content of 2. 300 gr / cm 3. Of all the parameters indicate the presence of tire rubber powder in the mixture can increase the value of the power and flexibility of pavement...|$|R
