25|$|Jindal oversaw one of {{the largest}} {{evacuations}} in U.S. history (nearly two million people) in late August 2008 prior to the Louisiana landfall of Hurricane Davis. He issued mandatory evacuation orders for the state's coastal areas and activated 3,000 National Guardsman to aid in the exodus. He also ordered the state to purchase generators to provide needed power to hospitals <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> without power. Government officials vacated hospitals <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and put the poor, the ill, and the elderly on buses and trains out of town. The evacuation was credited as one reason that Gustav resulted in only 16 deaths in the U.S. The state's successful response to Hurricane Gustav was {{in stark contrast to the}} failed hurricane response system for Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{patterns}} of potentially inappropriate drug therapy prescribing in community-dwelling older adults <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> residents in Ontario, Canada. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using administrative databases. SETTING: Ontario community <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> facilities. PARTICIPANTS: All 1, 275, 619 older adults aged 66 and older in Ontario (1, 216, 900 community-dwelling <b>and</b> 58, 719 <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> residents) who were dispensed {{at least one}} prescription from the comprehensive provincial drug plan in 2001. In Ontario, the provision of clinical pharmacy services is mandated in the <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> setting. No comparable program exists for older adults in the community setting. MEASUREMENTS: Potentially inappropriate drug prescribing was compared between community-dwelling <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> residents in two categories: those to always avoid and therapies considered rarely appropriate to prescribe.

25|$|Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease {{is caused}} by a {{waterborne}} bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} 2003 {{emergency}} revision budget, Medicaid funding, which {{was responsible for}} more than one-fourth of all state spending and which had been growing rapidly, was targeted for cuts in the 2004 budget.

The 2004 budget also incorporated further cuts in funding for higher education. Public colleges and universities responded to funding cuts during Romney's tenure by raising mandatory fees 63percent. Most other areas of state government were budgeted to receive approximately 5percent less funding on average.|$|E

25|$|The International Council Of Nursing (ICN), {{the largest}} {{international}} health professional {{organization in the}} world, recognizes the shortage of nurses as a growing crisis in the world. This shortage impacts the healthcare of everyone worldwide. One of the many reasons is that nurses who pursue to become nurses do so very late in their lives. This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals. However, because of administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> {{is expected to grow}} rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs, group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers. Nursing specialties will be in great demand. There are, in addition, many part-time employment possibilities.|$|E
500|$|The {{costs of}} PD to society are high, but precise {{calculations}} are difficult due to methodological issues {{in research and}} differences between countries. [...] The annual cost in the UK {{is estimated to be}} between 449 million and 3.3 billion pounds, while the cost per patient per year in the U.S. is probably around $10,000 and the total burden around 23 billion dollars. The largest share of direct cost comes from inpatient care <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> while the share coming from medication is substantially lower. Indirect costs are high, due to reduced productivity and the burden on caregivers. In addition to economic costs, PD reduces quality of life of those with the disease and their caregivers.|$|E
500|$|In the 1940s, {{radio was}} the {{electronic}} medium for family entertainment and information. In the 1950s, it was television {{that was the}} new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world. By the 1970s, games could be played electronically, then hand-held devices provided mobile entertainment, and by {{the last decade of}} the 20th century, via networked play. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The [...] "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" [...] together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films. One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid obsolescence of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded. One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a Wii console, [...] "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953". Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called [...] "digital revolution" [...] has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up. Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing [...] "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available." [...] Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as [...] "professional engagers" [...] shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.|$|E
