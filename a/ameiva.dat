5|$|The 11 snake species {{occurring}} in Puerto Rico are generally considered non-venomous, although research {{has concluded that}} at least one species, the Puerto Rican racer (Alsophis portoricensis), secretes venom. These species belong to 3 families and 4 genera: Typhlopidae (Typhlops genus), Boidae (Epicrates) and Colubridae (Alsophis and Arrhyton). The largest snake in Puerto Rico is the endemic Puerto Rican boa (Epicrates inornatus) with a maximum length of 12ft (3.7m). The diet of snakes in Puerto Rico consists of reptiles (<b>Ameiva,</b> Anolis, geckos), coquís and other frogs, and, to a lesser extent, mice, birds and bats (exclusively by the Puerto Rican Boa).|$|E
25|$|There are 20 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} and amphibians and, {{with the exception of}} Bufo marinus (Spanish: Sapo común), all are endemic. Reptiles include the Lagarto verde (Anolis cuvieri), lagartijo pigmeo (Anolis occultus), and boa de Puerto Rico (Epicrates inornatus), which is in danger of extinction; amphibians include the siguana (<b>Ameiva</b> exsul) and the culebra ciega (Amphisbaena caeca). Amphibians include coquí común (Eleutherodactylus coqui) and the coquí de la montaña (Eleutherodactylus portoricensis), a species denominated as vulnerable under Puerto Rico Law 6766. The Small Asian mongoose (Vernacular Spanish: Mangosta pequeña asiática; Taxonomy: Herpestes javanicus), has also been spotted inhabiting this forest.|$|E
500|$|... "Ekbletomys hypenemus" [...] {{is known}} from {{material}} from two small limestone caves at Two Foot Bay {{at the eastern}} side of the island of Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda and from a site named Mill Reef in the far east of Antigua, also in Antigua and Barbuda, which has not been described in detail. In both Barbuda caves, the [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] material was found in red to yellow unconsolidated sediments on the cave floor which were partially overlain by a darker sediment that yielded the introduced Rattus, indicating deposition after the first European contact around 1500. These sediments are probably ancient owl pellets deposited by a burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) and they also yielded the frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei; the lizards Thecadactylus rapicauda, <b>Ameiva</b> griswoldi, and Anolis leachii; the birds Puffinus lherminieri, Zenaida aurita, Columbina passerina, Tiaris bicolor, and an unidentified fringillid; and the bats Mormoops blainvillei, Brachyphylla cavernarum, Natalus stramineus, Tadarida brasiliensis, and Molossus molossus. The deposits that included [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] are probably very late Quaternary, but pre-Columbian, and the Antigua material ranges in age from about 2500 BCE to post-Columbian.|$|E

5000|$|Populations of Anguilla Bank <b>ameivas</b> on Saint Barthélemy differ {{considerably}} in appearance between islands. [...] On the main island, its ground color is green-brown with green-blue sides, {{and it is}} heavily spotted with green to cream-colored spots. On Île Fourchue, it is uniformly reddish-brown with little marking on its dorsal side, and spots or bars on its sides.|$|R
5000|$|The genus Dracaena (romanized {{form of the}} Ancient Greek δράκαινα - drakaina, [...] "female dragon"), {{also called}} caiman lizards or water tegu, is in the teiid family, along with tegus and <b>ameivas.</b> Caiman lizards are found in South America in Ecuador, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Brazil. These lizards {{spend a lot of}} time in the water and they inhabit marshes, streams and flooded forests. Caiman lizards often bask on {{branches}} overhanging the water.|$|R
2500|$|The herpetofauna of Hans Lollik has {{not been}} well studied, but species {{composition}} should closely resemble that of St. Thomas. [...] Several species of lizards, common on nearby islands, have never been documented on Hans Lollik. [...] During a 1990s survey, sight records of three previously unrecorded reptiles were established: [...] two lizards (<b>Ameiva</b> exul and Anolis pulchellus) and a snake (Liophis portoricensis). [...] Another lizard, Anolis stratulus, was collected for the first time. [...] Lizards previously documented include: [...] Anolis critatellus and Sphaerodactylus macrolepis.|$|E
2500|$|Desecheo, {{which has}} no known bodies of surface water, reaches a maximum {{elevation}} of 715 ft (218 m) and has an annual precipitation, on average, of 40.15in (1020mm). The lack of surface water limits its flora to thorny shrubs, small trees, weeds and various cacti, including the endangered higo chumbo [...] (Harrisia portoricensis). Fauna includes various species of seabirds, three endemic species of lizard (<b>Ameiva</b> desechensis, Anolis desechensis and Sphaerodactylus levinsi), introduced goats and rats, and a population of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) introduced from Cayo Santiago in 1967 {{as part of a}} study on adaptation. Before the introduction of rhesus monkeys the island was the largest nesting colony of the brown booby, however, no species presently nests on the island.|$|E
