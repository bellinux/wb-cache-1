The theoretical frameworks of Oberg’s (1960) Culture Shock Model and Berry and his colleagues’ (1987) and Berry’s (2006) Acculturation Stress Model were used to guide this study. Data {{for this study were}} collected through a demographic background survey, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions with Indonesian graduate students. The demographic data were analyzed descriptively. The interviews and focus groups data were analyzed using within-case and cross-case displays and analyses (Miles and Huberman 1994). Five salient themes and sub-themes that emerged were: academic shock, <b>adjustment,</b> <b>crisis,</b> resolution, and what helps/does not help? Implications and strategies for professionals and scholars who work with international students in practice, education, and policy are discussed. In addition, strategies to promote Indonesian graduate students’ academic and social success in graduate programs are included. Suggestions for future research are also discussed. </p...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{unification}} forced {{an unprecedented}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>crisis</b> on the East German economy. The revolutionary {{shock of the}} transformation of the economic order was reinforced by a real appreciation shock exceeding 50 %, due to the immediate introduction of the Deutschmark. This paper examines in detail the real and monetary consequences of unification. It is shown that the currency conversion created (by means of an excessive money endowment) a potential for price level rise of between 3. 7 % and 6. 6 % for 1991. With industrial production down by 50 % and effective unemployment exceeding 20 %, large-scale public transfers from West to East Germany are unavoidable. The 1991 transfers are estimated to reach 73 % (6 %) of East (West) German GNP. Most of this will finance consumption. The paper also estimates the capital gap. With about 70 % of the East German capital stock obsolete, the maximum gap is DM 1. 8 trillion. The actual gap and the resulting adjustment load on the global saving-investment balance are likely to be much smaller. A major conclusion is that speeding up the process of enterprise privatization is the most pressing issue. While it is important to eliminate the potential for inflation by redressing money growth, rapid privatization of the thousands of state enterprises is the key to reshaping East Germany from the supply side. By promoting the reallocation of East German capital and labour, a more rapid privatization will lead to large efficiency gains and will reduce the time taken for the East German region to catch up.

40|$|The authors {{identify}} {{as the primary}} cause of the East Asian crisis a fundamental reassessment of the profitability of investments in the region. They identify a number of secondary shocks as well, including interest risk premia, monetary expansion, and declines in output brought about by failures of the financial market. Unlike the Latin American crisis of the 1980 s, the East Asian crisis did not reflect commodity price shocks, large changes in world interest rates, fiscal imbalances, or inflationary shocks. It involved large-scale borrowing abroad, but by the private sector rather than the government - andfor the normally well-regarded purpose of funding capital investment. It seems unlikely that terms of trade shocks or changes in exchange rates due to pegging to the dollar could, alone, have caused an <b>adjustment</b> <b>crisis</b> of this magnitude - although they could have helped trigger the crisis. More important, expectations of future growth in returns to the corporate sector began to fall. Declines in asset valuations caused major shifts in investment portfolios, and the consequences of asset market shocks were compounded by secondary shocks associated with the abrupt shift to floating rates, concerns about the credibility of government policies, weaknesses in financial sectors, and inadequacies in the mechanisms for corporate restructuring and liquidation. The authors use of forward-looking modeling framework to capture some of the major interactions between asset markets, output, and trade in the countries worst hit by the crisis. They find that the model is able to capture the main features of the crisis.

We take the primary cause of the crisis to be a fundamental reassessment of the profitability of investment in the region, and add secondary shocks resulting from the financial implications of responses to the initial shock.

40|$|From November 1990 Infratest Sozialforschung (Infratest social research) {{carried out}} on {{commission}} for the Federal Employment Services (Bundesanstalt für Arbeit) eight labour market surveys in the 'new' Bundesländer (i. e. the federal states of the former GDR) and East Berlin. The first of these surveys {{was carried out in}} November 1990 (also including details on the labour situation of November 1989), the last was in November 1994. The Arbeitsmarkt-Monitor is structured as a representative longitudinal study and facilitates a closer examination of certain labour market risks in eastern Germany for the period of the first five years after the reunification. At this point it mainly concerns aspects immediately connected with labour force participation (loss of employment, prospects of reintegration into the labour market, non-adequate employment, long-term unemployment, displacement from the 'official' labour market). The risk of dismissal (which is less selective with regard to person-related characteristics) in the eastern German transformation process depended heavily upon the sectoral (as well as the regional) emphasis in the economic restructuring process. In the case of reintegration, the labour market risk factors known in the west are showing through increasingly. It is obvious that it is the women who have come off worst in the <b>adjustment</b> <b>crisis</b> in the east, although even this is to be seen in a more subtly differentiated way and not exclusively. Above all older women (but also older men), single mothers, lowly qualified women and men, female skilled workers, women in industrial or technical occupations are affected. The better employment prospects of more highly qualified employed persons were in part 'bought' by the acceptance of non-adequate work, with the consequence of an increased pressure on lowly qualified persons. Older members of the labour force were affected in a particular way by the 'turbulence' of the reunification period. The age cohorts who were able {{to make use of the}} early retirement regulations were mainly withdrawn from the labour market prematurely (in a way which was regarded ambivalently by those concerned but was financially safeguarded). In view of extremely slight reintegration prospects, succeeding age cohorts, who were not prominently affected by the employment problem at the beginning of the transformation process, are growing increasingly into long-term unemployment in cases of a loss of employment.

40|$|Incomplete: {{please do}} not circulate) This paper compares the {{experience}} of growth performance and macroeconomic adjustment between East Asia and Latin America over the period from 1970 to 2000. We find that the difference in growth performance between two regions are largely attributed to the differences in fundamental growth factors such as investment rate, human resources, fertility, institutional quality, macroeconomic stability {{and the degree of}} trade openness. We also discuss the role of quality of education and differences in inequality between the two regions. Balance-of-payments crisis shocks have also contributed significantly to the differences of growth performance across regions. The <b>adjustment</b> from balance-of-payments <b>crises</b> shows that the growth rates tend to be lowered only temporarily following a crisis and then rebound to the pre-crisis levels, thereby existing the typical v-type pattern of <b>adjustment</b> from <b>crises</b> has been in both East Asia and Latin American crisis episodes. However, often a balance-of-payments crisis is associated with a large decline of growth rates and developed into another crisis in the future.

Several authors have offered empirical evidence that having a large tradable sector reduces the contraction necessary to adjust to a given cut-off in funding. This would help explain lower vulnerability to crises in Asia than in Latin America. Such studies may, however, be subject to the problem that trade is endogenous. We use the gravity instrument for trade openness, which is constructed from geographical determinants of bilateral trade. We find that openness indeed makes countries less vulnerable, both to severe sudden stops and currency crashes, and that the relationship is even stronger when correcting for the endogeneity of trade. ...|$|R

Organizations can learn from prior crises and thereby be better prepared for future ones. This helps organizations to broaden their knowledge base, which, in turn, is a main antecedent of the anticipation dimension. For successful adaptation, both cognition and behavior are necessary. On the one hand, organizations must be able to reflect on the critical situation and incorporate the gained insight into the existing knowledge base. On the other hand, they must be able to act on this knowledge and produce change (Edmondson 2002).
