40|$|Each {{year more}} people die from work-related {{diseases}} than are killed in industrial accidents. Therefore {{it is essential}} to evaluate occupational health aspect during the process design. Early evaluation of safety, health, and environmental (SHE) performance is advantageous, since the opportunities to make the process inherently benign are greater and the cost therefore lower. The methods for occupational health assessments need to be tailored to speci?c design stages, since the data availability is changing as the design proceeds. In this paper, an index-based method called the Occupational Health Index (OHI) is presented for the basic engineering stage. The OHI is the ?nal of the three methods in series proposed for health assessment in development and design stages. The OHI is based on the information available in piping and instrumentation diagrams (PIDs) and the plot plan. Four health aspects are considered; chronic inhalation risks to noncarcinogens and carcinogens, <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>risk,</b> and dermal/eye risk. The index is demonstrated on separation system of a toluene hydrodealkylation process. The assessment results allow the level of occupational health risks to be evaluated, the sources of exposures be detected, and corrective actions taken in a focused way...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the significance of}} meteorology and postspray volatilization of methamidophos (an organophosphorus insecticide) in assessing potential inhalation risk to children in an agricultural community. We combined fluxes from sources and dispersion modeling {{with a range of}} possible local meteorology to create output to study the variability in potential community exposure as a result of changing temperature, wind speeds and wind directions. This work is based on an aerial spray drift study where air sampling measurements of methamidophos were made before, during and after a spray event were used to examine <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>risk</b> for children living in an Eastern Washington State community in close proximity (between 15 and 200 [*]m) to sprayed potato fields. We compared the measured average air concentrations of methamidophos in the community to a “no observed adverse effect level” for subchronic inhalation to characterize acute and subchronic inhalation risks. The baseline estimates of inhalation exposure were below Environment Protection Agency 2 ̆ 7 s (EPA) level of concern based on a target margin of exposure of 300. As meteorological conditions during and after spraying influence the amount of material moving into areas where children reside we used historical meteorological data to drive model simulations that predicted likely air residue concentrations under different wind and temperature conditions. We also added variability to the decay constant and initial emission fluxes to create a 2 -D simulation of estimated air concentrations in the community near the fields. This work provides a methodological framework for the assessment of air concentrations of pesticides from agricultural sprays in the absence of extended measurements, although including variability from meteorological conditions. The deterministic as well as the probabilistic risk analyses in this study indicated that postspray volatilization in the specific spray situation analyzed (methamidophos applied on potato fields in Eastern Washington) did not pose acute or subchronic risks as defined by the EPA. However, this study did not consider any pathway of exposure other than inhalation (e. g. diet, dermal, etc.) and the risk assessment should be evaluated in that context...|$|E
40|$|Sustainability {{is now a}} {{necessity}} to process industry. Therefore the safety, health, and environmental (SHE) evaluations are required in process design and operation. Various methods for assessing safety and environmental friendliness have been presented in literature. However, occupational health evaluations have received much less attention even though each year more people die from work-related diseases than are killed in industrial accidents. Inherent occupational health assessment is an approach to reduce hazards by choosing healthier chemicals and process concepts. I. e. inherent occupational health relies on the healthier and safer properties of chemical substances, process conditions, operations, and work procedures in a process. This thesis presents new systematic approaches for evaluating inherent occupational health of chemical processes in process development and design. In the R&D stage, the Inherent Occupational Health Index (IOHI) is proposed based on healthier and safer reaction chemistries, properties of compounds present, and process conditions such as pressure, volatility, exposure limits, and temperature etc. In the preliminary design stage, chronic health risk is calculated due to exposure to fugitive airborne emissions based on flow sheet data and precalculated process modules' emission, estimated process plot areas, and wind velocities. Health Quotient Index (HQI) {{is used as a}} health indicator to compare the estimated chemical concentrations to their exposure limits. In the basic engineering stage, the Occupational Health Index (OHI) utilizes detailed fugitive emission calculations based on piping and instrumentation diagrams. The method evaluates quantitatively chronic inhalation risks to noncarcinogens and carcinogens, <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>risk,</b> and qualitatively dermal/eye risk. For fugitive exposure estimation new methods were developed. Three approaches for estimating chemical concentration due to fugitive emissions are proposed based on simple PFD, detailed PFD, and PID, which were tested on the actual Borealis Polymers plant in Porvoo. A more realistic approach was developed for estimating health risks of fugitive occupational exposure by using statistical meteorological data. Finally the integration of the inherent occupational assessment methods with the existing computer aided design tools was studied. Also the correlation between index-based SHE assessment techniques was analyzed to find out, if any interdependency exists between SHE characteristics at the inherent level...|$|E
50|$|Burning white {{phosphorus}} produces a hot, dense, white smoke consisting mostly of phosphorus pentoxide. Exposure to heavy smoke concentrations {{of any kind}} {{for an extended period}} (particularly if near the source of emission) has the potential to cause illness or death. White phosphorus smoke irritates the eyes, mucous membranes of the nose, and respiratory tract in moderate concentrations, while higher concentrations can produce severe burns. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has set an <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> Minimum <b>Risk</b> Level (MRL) for {{white phosphorus}} smoke of 0.02 mg/m3, the same as fuel-oil fumes. By contrast, the chemical weapon mustard gas is 30 times more potent: 0.0007 mg/m3. However, the agency states that the 1935 study used to determine the MRL was insufficient to accurately assess the health risk to humans. No studies have investigated the lethal effects of inhalation of WP by humans, however a former US soldier has stated that breathing in smoke close to a shell caused the throat and lungs to blister until the victim suffocated, with the phosphorus continuing to burn them from the inside.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith the {{increasing}} use of amine solvents for carbon capture, there is a critical need to characterize the potential health effects of these materials and their degradation products formed within the capture system or downwind of release. This study evaluated the <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> health <b>risk</b> of exposure to degraded mixtures of monoethanolamine (MEA), methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), and piperazine (PIP). Degradation was achieved in a heated (150 C) and pressurized (approximately 15 psi) stainless steel vessel by adding NO 2 and purified air over approximately 75 days. Laboratory mice were exposed to the degraded mixture (as well as the neat amines in separate experiments) 6 hrs/day for 7 consecutive days in a whole-body inhalation chamber. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was carried out 18 to 24 hours post-exposure and inflammatory cells were counted in lavage fluid. Cytokine expression and oxidative stress were measured in lung tissue. We found that exposure to degraded MEA resulted in significant increases in total cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, and the strongest cytokine response compared to control mice and compared to MEA-exposed mice. Neither MDEA nor PIP, or their degradant mixtures, caused increased inflammatory cells in BAL fluid. The degraded MEA atmosphere also caused a statistically significant decrease in oxidative stress in mouse lung. The degraded MDEA atmosphere caused the strongest cytokine response of the amines tested, producing statistically significant increases in cytokine growth-related oncogene (GRO-KC), monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 (MCP- 1), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) expression compared to the control and to MDEA alone. The degraded PIP atmosphere showed a statistically significant increase in GMCSF expression. This investigation represents a hazard evaluation and not a dose-response assessment; however, the results suggest that our approach can be used successfully to screen potential solvents for carbon capture for acute human health impacts...|$|R

The test consists of the exposure of isolated, ventilated and perfused rat lungs, to aerosolised formulations of waterproofing agents (mass median aerodynamic diameter = 1 mu m), and on-line monitoring of respiratory parameters and gross pathology analysis. A pilot evaluation of the isolated perfused rat lung model for use in a screening test was carried out by blind testing 12 surface-active substances.

Substances that triggered harmful effects, such as impaired lung compliance and atelectasis of the isolated perfused lung, were also found to cause changes in respiratory parameters, some of which would be severe enough to lead to death in in vivo tests with rats.

Therefore, pre-testing in the isolated perfused rat lung allows the identification of surface-active substances with the potential for causing <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity...|$|R

A September 2016 workshop, “Alternative Approaches for <b>Acute</b> <b>Inhalation</b> Toxicity Testing to Address Global Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Data Requirements”, explored current testing requirements and ongoing efforts to achieve global regulatory acceptance for non-animal testing approaches. The importance of using integrated approaches that combine existing data with in vitro and/or computational approaches to generate new data was discussed.

40|$|New {{surface-active}} {{agents in}} waterproofing sprays are often tested for <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity in vivo {{on the basis}} of OECD Test Guideline 403. A screening test using the isolated perfused rat lung (IPRL) is proposed {{in order to reduce the}} number of <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> tests and to refine these. The test comprises exposure of IPRLs to aerosolised formulations of the water proofing agents and on-line monitoring of respiratory parameters. Substances revealing harmful effects on the IPRL, such as impaired lung compliance and atelectasis formation, did also show changes in respiratory parameters up to mortality in in vivo tests with rats. Thus, pre-testing in the IPRL allows the identification of surface-active substances causing <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity. To assess the potential lung toxicity of seven formulations, each tested in two male and two female IPRLs, we evaluated changes in the respiratory parameters tidal volume, compliance, and resistance, edema and atelectasis formation, taking into account the inhaled doses. These IPRL results were compared with available in vivo results and a good or excellent correlation in six out of seven cases was revealed. In conclusion, the use of the IPRL is well suited for screening substances showing <b>acute</b> "physical" <b>inhalation</b> toxicity. Therefore, for future assessment of surface active substances, it is suggested to use this test prior to in vivo inhalation tests. Formulations with no acute harmful effects on the IPRL need to be further investigated in vivo for complete risk assessment. However, substances showing strong reactions in the IPRL will most likely cause lung damage in vivo. This is why testing in live animals is not recommended in order to avoid possible pain, suffering or distress...|$|R

The basic ALI procedure has been successfully prevalidated as a short-exposure test (1 hour exposures) for chemical gases. However, although a good predictability for highly toxic gaseous compounds or non-toxic inert gases could be demonstrated, {{it was not clear}} until now, if highly hydrophobic or low-toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can also be assessed by cell based methods in vitro under these conditions with regard to a relevant estimate of their <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity characteristics in vivo. Therefore, a four compound test substance matrix was set up from the data base of the European chemicals agency (ECHA) including VOCs differing in hydrophobicity and <b>acute</b> in vivo <b>inhalation</b> toxicity.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] <b>Acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> of {{clinical}} doses of salbutamol in normal volunteers increases {{resting metabolic rate}} by up to 20 % above control values. This {{study was designed to}} see if chronic treatment with salbutamol causes a sustained increase in metabolic rate and whether it modifies the acute thermogenic response to the drug. METHODS [...] The effects of chronic inhaled salbutamol on resting oxygen consumption (VO 2) and carbon dioxide output (VCO 2) were studied in seven normal subjects (age 20 - 47 years, weight 52 - 105 kg, five men). An open canopy method of indirect calorimetry was used to measure VO 2, VCO 2, and respiratory quotient (RQ). Subjects inhaled two puffs of salbutamol or placebo four times a day in a double blind manner. Measurements of resting VO 2 and VCO 2 after 10 days of salbutamol were compared with the values after 10 days of placebo and with those taken {{at the start of the}} study. At the end of each treatment period subjects inhaled eight puffs (800 micrograms) of salbutamol and the acute effects on VO 2, VCO 2 and RQ were monitored for one hour. RESULTS [...] Resting VO 2, VCO 2, and RQ were not significantly different at the end of the salbutamol and placebo periods but the acute response to eight puffs of salbutamol was abolished by regular inhalation. The mean VO 2 integrated over one hour after 800 micrograms salbutamol given acutely was different (241. 3 and 210. 7 ml/kg/h in the placebo and salbutamol groups respectively). Differences were not significant between placebo and salbutamol groups for changes in VCO 2, heart rate, blood pressure, and RQ after <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation.</b> CONCLUSION [...] Regular treatment with inhaled salbutamol (800 micrograms/day) does not cause a sustained increase in resting metabolic rate but prevents the increase in VO 2 that occurs after <b>acute</b> <b>inhalations</b> in normal subjects...|$|R

Taking note of previously published proposals for estimating <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity hazards for chemicals, and the paucity of measured experimental data, an extrapolation method has been developed by the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) to partly fulfil this need. This method {{should be seen as}} a pragmatic approach to the challenge of missing measured experimental test data, with the added benefit of reducing tests in experimental animals.

Statistical analysis demonstrates that, when females are more sensitive, the new procedure is likely to give the same classification as the original FCP, whereas, if males are more sensitive, the new procedure is much less likely to lead to incorrect classification into a less toxic category. If there is no difference in the LC 50 for females and males, the new procedure is slightly more likely to classify into a more stringent class than the original FCP.

This paper presents an analysis of data from the assessment of <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity for 56 substances. Statistically significant differences between the LC 50 for males and females were found for 16 substances, with greater than 10 -fold differences in the LC 50 for two substances. The paper also reports a statistical evaluation of the three test methods in the presence of unanticipated gender differences. With TG 403, a gender difference leads to a slightly greater chance of under-classification. This is also the case for the ATC method, but more pronounced than for TG 403, with misclassification of nearly all substances from Globally Harmonised System (GHS) class 3 into class 4. As the FCP uses females only, if females are more sensitive, the classification is unchanged. If males are more sensitive, the procedure may lead to under-classification. Additional research on modification of the FCP is thus proposed...|$|R
