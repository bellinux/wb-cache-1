5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Canadian Gaming Association {{commissioned}} <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> {{the legality}} of DFS in Canada from former Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario general counsel Don Bourgeois. He determined that DFS would likely be classified as a game of chance under Canadian law, going on to say {{in an interview that}} under the Criminal Code of Canada, games that mix chance- and skill-based elements are considered games of chance. However, Canadian authorities have not yet targeted DFS services; historically, the government has only targeted illegal gambling operations that have a presence within the country. While the service Sport Select offers legal sports wagering games through Canada's lotteries, it is subject to a legal prohibition on wagering on individual sporting events.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of his administration, Harrison dealt with the issue of Hawaiian annexation. Following a coup d'état against Queen Liliuokalani, the new {{government}} of Hawaii led by Sanford Dole petitioned for annexation by the United States. Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at Pearl Harbor but had not previously expressed <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> annexing the islands. The United States consul in Hawaii John L. Stevens recognized the new government on February 1, 1893 and forwarded their proposals to Washington. With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day with Harrison's recommendation. The Senate failed to act, and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office.|$|E

25|$|Commenters on {{the ethnic}} or {{national}} origins of shanties, {{writing in the}} 19th century when shanties were still in wide use, generally supposed the genre to originate in America and recognized parallels to African-American singing—as opposed to earlier English traditions from Britain. An early article to offer <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> the origin of shanties (though not calling them by that name), appearing in Oberlin College's student paper in 1858, drew a comparison between Africans' singing and sailor work songs.|$|E
25|$|The {{branches}} {{are often}} artistically depicted as semicircular, but Rashi, (according to some contemporary readings) and Maimonides (according {{to his son}} Avraham), held that they were straight; all other Jewish authorities, both classical (e.g. Philo and Josephus) and medieval (e.g. Ibn Ezra) who express <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> the subject state that the arms were round.

25|$|It is {{not only}} the Knesset, however, which has been {{repeatedly}} obliged to directly or indirectly address these issues. Over the years, many of Israel's interior ministers have examined the issue of the Law of Return and wavered as to how to apply it. The judiciary has also been called upon to express <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> matters relating to the Law. This burning and recurrent question in the country's political dialogue not only reveals but also exacerbates differences of opinion between Israelis.|$|E

Many cast and crewmembers, fans and celebrities, such as Patrick Stewart, offer <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> the popular British sci-fi comedy series. In one skit, a couple of Daleks being interviewed disapprove of the series. They dismiss it as human propaganda, along with Earth television in general. However, one of them then begins to compliment Red Dwarf on its jokes. The other one takes notice of its associate having a sense of humour and, naturally, exterminates it on the spot.|$|E

25|$|Some {{state court}} systems have promulgated court-ordered arbitration; family law (particularly child custody) {{is the most}} {{prominent}} example. Judicial arbitration is often merely advisory dispute resolution technique, serving {{as the first step}} toward resolution, but not binding either side and allowing for trial de novo. Litigation attorneys present their side of the case to an independent teritary lawyer, who issues <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> settlement. Should the parties in question decide to continue to dispute resolution process, there can be some sanctions imposed from the initial arbitration per terms of the contract.|$|E
