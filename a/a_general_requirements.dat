40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline the {{application}} to a tourism information system (TIS) of a requirements specification approach based on Information Systems Actability Theory (ISAT). The main ISAT concepts entering this requirements specification methodology are described, and then {{used for the}} analysis. We introduce the concept of Verstehen (understand) as a further methodological tool for designers, grounding this concept in ISAT. We argue that when designers model an IS through ISAT, they should {{try to understand the}} meanings that users give to their actions in the actual business context. We briefly describe the functionalities of a TIS system, and the social context within which users/tourists act and interact through the IS. Using the ISAT requirements specification methodology augmented by the concept of Vertstehen we outline <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>requirements</b> specification approach for the design of a TIS from a Language/Action Perspective...|$|E

This fact increases the demands on the test systems usedto conduct the testing, the system needs to be reliable.

This thesis presents a case study of how a certain company work with their test systems. The aim of the case study was to find where the largest points of improvements could bemade in a new test system, which was to be implemented during this thesis work. Theimplementation of this new system was done in LabVIEW in conjunction with TestStandand this process is covered in this thesis. The performed case study revealed that the employees at the company found robustnessand usability to be the key factors in a new test system. During and after the implementationof the new system, it was evaluated regarding these two metrics, this process isalso covered in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Appropriate {{reliance}} on system automation is imperative for safe and productive work, especially in safetycritical systems. It is unsafe {{to rely on}} automation beyond its designed use; conversely, it can be both unproductive and unsafe to manually perform tasks that are better relegated to automated tools. Operator trust in automated tools mediates reliance, and trust appears to affect how operators use technology. As automated agents become more complex, the question of trust in automation is increasingly important. In order to achieve proper use of automation, we must engender an appropriate degree of trust that is sensitive to changes in operating functions and context. In this paper, we present research concerning trust in automation {{in the domain of}} automated tools for relational databases. Lee and See [1] have provided models of trust in automation. One model developed by Lee and See identifies three key categories of information about the automation that lie along a continuum of attributional abstraction. Purpose-, process-and performance-related information serve, both individually and through inferences between them, to describe automation {{in such a way as}} to engender properly-calibrated trust. Thus, one can look at information from different levels of attributional abstraction as <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>requirements</b> analysis for information key to appropriate trust in automation. The model of information necessary to engender appropriate trust in automation [1] is a general one. Although it describes categories of information, it does not provide insight on how to determine the specific information elements required for a given automated tool. We have applied the Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) to this problem in the domain of relational databases...|$|E
