5|$|Development {{and testing}} {{continued}} until late 1938. Several variants of gun and carriage were proposed until on 15 December {{a combination of}} the T10 gun and T5 carriage was officially adopted as the 37mm Gun M3 and Carriage M4. Although the weapon followed the concept of the PaK 36 and was often referred to as <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> the M3 differed significantly from the German design and used different ammunition.|$|E
5|$|A sexy belly dancer named Princess Kashmir {{arrives at}} the party and invites Homer on stage to dance with her. On {{the way to the}} {{restaurant}} bathroom, Bart wanders into the bachelor party room and eagerly snaps a picture of Homer and Kashmir. Bart brings the picture to school and gives <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to Milhouse, who promptly gets requests from other students for a copy of the picture. It is not long before everyone in Springfield has one and Marge sees a copy of the picture at her aerobics class and is furious. When Homer gets home that day, Marge immediately shoves the picture in his face and demands an explanation. At that point, Bart inadvertently reveals that it was his picture, angering both his parents. After sending Bart to his room, Marge emotionally kicks Homer out of the house. Homer spends the night at Barney's apartment.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E

25|$|All bills must {{go through}} three {{readings}} in Parliament and receive the President's assent to become an Act of Parliament. The first reading is a mere formality, during which a bill is introduced without a debate. The bill is considered has having been read after the MP introducing it has read aloud its long title and laid <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> on the Table of the House, and the Clerk of Parliament has read out its short title. Copies of the bill are then distributed to MPs, and it is published in the Government Gazette for the public's information. The bill is then scheduled for its second reading.|$|E
25|$|Just {{minutes before}} the murder, Sheriff's Deputy Don Welch had driven by and spotted Lunsford {{speaking}} to the men. Moments after the murder, Welch witnessed the suspects speed past him in their vehicle. Welch immediately {{drove back to the}} spot where Lunsford had been and found his dead body. Welch radioed for help, and at around 2:00a.m., Chief Deputy Stanaland, another colleague of Lunsford, found them both. Stanaland noticed the video camera in Lunsford's cruiser. He rewound the video, watched it over and then made <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The three suspects, realizing Welch had spotted them, abandoned their vehicle {{less than a mile from}} the town of Garrison. They then fled on foot, taking the marijuana with them. Their vehicle was found later in the day.|$|E
25|$|While in the Soviet Union, Svetlana {{had written}} a memoir in Russian in 1963. The {{manuscript}} was carried safely {{out of the country}} by Ambassador T. N. Kaul, who returned it to her in New Delhi. Svetlana handed her memoir over to the CIA agent Robert Rayle {{at the time of her}} own defection. Rayle made <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The book was titled Twenty Letters to a Friend (Dvadtsat' pisem k drugu). It was the only thing other than a few items of clothing taken by Svetlana on a secret passenger flight out of India. Nevertheless, as noted by Raymond Pearson (Russia and Eastern Europe), her book turned out to be quite disappointing. It featured Svetlana's naïve attempt to shift the blame for Stalinist crimes onto Beria, and whitewash her own father.|$|E

25|$|Vermeer's {{mother-in-law}} Maria Thins owned Dirck van Baburen's 1622 oil-on-canvas The Procuress (or <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>it),</b> {{which appears}} {{in the background of}} two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, Dresden, Gemäldegalerie). Vermeer's two townscapes have also been attributed to this period: View of Delft (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and A street in Delft (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).|$|E
25|$|Next (or in {{the opinion}} of some, first) in {{importance}} stand the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs Sur les inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes, Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique, both published in the Journal of the École Polytechnique (1809); Sur la libration de la lune, in Connaissance des temps (1821), etc.; and , in Mémoires de l'Académie (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that the result could be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled Sur la théorie des variations des éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites. So highly did he think of Poisson's memoir that he made <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.|$|E

The novelist Thomas Hardy kept <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> on a table for visitors.

500|$|Basic {{object-oriented}} programming functionality was added in PHP 3 and improved in PHP 4.
