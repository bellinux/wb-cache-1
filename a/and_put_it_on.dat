5|$|Across England, {{many public}} houses and inns were renamed after Daniel Lambert, {{particularly}} in Leicester and Stamford. The Daniel Lambert public house at 12 Ludgate Hill, {{near the entrance}} to St Paul's Cathedral in London, was well known, and had a large portrait of Daniel Lambert and Lambert's walking stick on display in the lobby. James Dixon, owner of the Ram Jam Inn in Stamford, bought the suit of clothes Lambert had been wearing when he died <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> display, renaming the inn the Daniel Lambert.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{of the two}} men {{was particularly}} threatening to the emperor, as it took control over Cappadocia and threatened to cut off his rear and leave him stranded between two enemies. Indeed, the conspirators are said to have been in contact with George I for that purpose. Basil first withdrew to the safety of the fortress of Mazdat, and according to John Skylitzes sent an envoy to the rebel leaders aiming to sow distrust between them, while according to Yahya the emperor appointed as the new governor of the Anatolic Theme Theophylact Dalassenos and sent him to suppress the revolt. Whether the envoy accomplished his task is unknown, but on 15 August 1022, Xiphias arranged a meeting with Phokas, where the latter was murdered by one of Xiphias' servants. Armenian sources however report, rather dubiously, that Phokas was killed by the former king of Vaspurakan, Senekerim-Hovhannes, or his son David, or one of their followers. The severed head was sent to Basil, who mounted it on a stake <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> public display at Mazdat.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E

5|$|Cope's {{relations}} with Marsh {{turned into a}} competition for fossils between the two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict's seeds began upon the men's return to the United States in the 1860s. Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven. When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope's fossil finds—a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur, Elasmosaurus, that had four flippers and a long neck—he commented that the fossil's head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull {{at the end of}} the vertebrae of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head of the fossil <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back the copies, but some remained with their buyers (Marsh and Leidy kept theirs). The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next society meeting, not to alienate Cope, but only in response to Cope's brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would never talk to each other amicably again, and by 1873, open hostility had broken out between them.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps : {{the best}} known neo-{{traditional}} South African music, internationally anyway, is the music of Amampondo and the solo work of their leader and founder, Dizu Plaatjies. He and his group took traditional Xhosa music from the hills of Pondoland and the Eastern Cape <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> stage worldwide. The success of the genre was how the exponents combined their music with their stage performances and dance.|$|E

25|$|In 1894, three Germans by {{the names}} of Friedrich Robert, Elard König, and R. Höpner decided to {{stabilize}} the breed <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> exhibition at a dog show. This was done in Munich in 1896, and the year before they founded the first Boxer Club, the Deutscher Boxer Club. The Club went on to publish the first Boxer breed standard in 1904, a detailed document {{that has not been}} changed much to this day.|$|E
25|$|This argument, however, {{differs from}} that of Gibouleau in the same article who claimed, “there was fierce {{opposition}} within the university to giving up the body, and pressure from European museums that wanted to buy the body <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> display.” After more negotiations the university signed an agreement to return Édouard’s remains to his relatives and on September 28, 1989, the body was cremated. The ashes were later brought to Willow Bunch by Gibouleau for burial.|$|E
25|$|Academic {{dress is}} only worn on {{ceremonial}} occasions: the university anniversary or dies natalis, inaugural lectures, {{and the public}} defence of a doctoral thesis.

Male professors remove their beret when sitting down <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> when standing up (e.g. to lecture or to address a doctoral candidate during the thesis defence).

25|$|DeLorean's {{most notable}} {{contribution}} to Pontiac was the Pontiac GTO (Gran Turismo Omologato), a muscle car {{named after the}} Ferrari 250 GTO. It evolved because of the internal GM ban on racing (January 1963) that ended the methodology which Pontiac had used to propel itself into the # 3 sales slot. Pontiac was forced to take its efforts off the track <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the street to maintain its # 3 position. The result was the GTO. The GTO debuted as a Tempest/LeMans option package with a larger, more powerful engine in 1964. This {{marked the beginning of}} Pontiac's renaissance as GM's performance division instead of its previous position as a slightly bigger Chevrolet with no clear brand identity.|$|E

25|$|When the French troops {{left after}} about one week of occupation, they again looted Pforzheim <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire. This time, all houses which {{had survived the}} two {{previous}} fires, were destroyed. In the Au suburb, only three houses survived. The Au bridge was heavily damaged. Only four houses survived in the Broetzingen suburb. The town church of St. Stephen and {{a large part of}} the Dominican monastery complex were also destroyed. The Castle Church (Schlosskirche) of St. Michael was heavily damaged, and the family tombs of the Margraves of Baden in the church were desecrated by the soldiers. The last remaining church bell and the churches' clockworks were stolen as well. The town wall was damaged again, including the town gates. After the week-long presence of 30,000 soldiers in a town of only a few thousand citizens, all food was gone, including the seeds saved for next spring's sowing season. Every tree and grapevine on the valley slopes had been used up as firewood. The French army reached their camp in Philippsburg on 5 October 1692.|$|E
