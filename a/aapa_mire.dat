40|$|In {{this review}} I examine the {{geographical}} {{patterns of the}} Finnish mires {{and the role of}} regional and local factors that lead to their spatial differentiation. Finland can be divided into three roughly latitudinal mire zones (from south to north) : the raised bog zone, the <b>aapa</b> <b>mire</b> zone, and the palsa mire zone. The development of the raised bogs is linked to the dominance of Sphagnum, leading to the growth of a thick peat layer that rises above the level of the mineral soil. The gross morphology of an <b>aapa</b> <b>mire</b> is typically inclined and concave. Here, Sphagnum species are less dominant, probably due to spring floods which keep the mire surface minerotrophic. Both raised bogs and aapa mires have typically regularly-patterned microtopography. Seasonal movements of microtopographical features of the aapa mires reflect the morphological dynamism of the mires. Mires are also important sources of information re-garding past environmental changes. Their growth pattern is affected by envi-ronmental conditions and they respond sensitively to the changes in effective humidity and other climatic variables. Most of the present microtopographi-cal patterns have formed during the last 3, 000 years as a response to gradual cooling of climate. Research on Finnish peat deposits has shown, however, that not all peat-stratigraphical changes are caused by past climate variations. They can also be due to the natural growth dynamics of the mires, such as the long-term development towards drier conditions {{on the surface of the}} raised bogs, the rhythmic growth pattern of the low hummocks, and the local chang-es in water table resulting from growth of hummocks and hollows...|$|E

40|$|Quantifying landscape-scale methane (CH 4) fluxes from boreal and arctic regions, and {{determining}} {{how they are}} controlled, is critical for predicting the magnitude of any CH 4 emission feedback to climate change. Furthermore, there remains uncertainty regarding {{the relative importance of}} small areas of strong methanogenic activity, versus larger areas with net CH 4 uptake, in controlling landscape-level fluxes. We measured CH 4 fluxes from multiple microtopographical subunits (sedge-dominated lawns, interhummocks and hummocks) within an <b>aapa</b> <b>mire</b> in subarctic Finland, as well as in drier ecosystems present in the wider landscape; lichen heath and mountain birch forest. An inter-comparison was carried out between fluxes measured using static chambers, up-scaled using a high resolution landcover map derived from aerial photography, and eddy covariance. Strong agreement was observed between the two methodologies, with emission rates greatest in lawns. CH 4 fluxes from lawns were strongly related to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, but their floating nature meant that water-table depth was not a key factor in controlling CH 4 release. In contrast, chamber measurements identified net CH 4 uptake in birch forest soils. An inter-comparison between the aerial photography and satellite remote sensing demonstrated that quantifying the distribution of the key CH 4 emitting and consuming plant communities was possible from satellite, allowing fluxes to be scaled up to a 100 km 2 area. For the full growing season (May to October), approximately 1. 1 to 1. 4 g CH 4 m− 2 was released across the 100 km 2 area. This was based on up-scaled lawn emissions of 1. 2 to 1. 5 g CH 4 m− 2, versus an up-scaled uptake of 0. 07 to 0. 15 g CH 4 m− 2 by the wider landscape.

40|$|We studied 45 mid-boreal {{wetlands}} in {{a rugged}} land uplift coast {{with a thin}} cover of till. Wetlands ranged from 1 to 53 m a. s. l. and were of highly various sizes. Our aims were to examine, if vegetation types are valid in comparing wetlands, what kind of ecological major pattern the vegetation type composition of wetlands shows and how vegetation types distribute across altitudes. On those ground we discuss the wetland succession of the study area. We used the Finnish mire site types as vegetation types. Mire site types {{could be used for}} an ecological classification and ordination of the wetlands. As was expected, the major gradient consisted of the transition from mire margin (swamp) to expanse. The distribution of the Major Vegetational Wetland Groups (MVWG) responded to a general water-flow pattern in the landscape. Partly different peatland succession sequences occur in areas with small mire basins and in areas with larger mire basins with evolving mire complexes. Sequences of small wetlands and those of mire complexes follow the same trajectory only as far as the major gradient is considered while they differ with regard to the vegetation type composition of locally rare vegetation types and with regard to peatland morphology. Trajectories of mire complexes at catchment divides differ from those at catchment centers where the waters in the landscape tend to gather. Peatland forms of <b>aapa</b> <b>mires</b> experience a change reaching altitudes of 30 – 50 m a. s. l. Small bog complexes at catchment divides reach a stage of an unpatterned Sphagnum fuscum bog in the study area. Mature mixed complexes with aapa-mire parts and patterned sloping-bog parts only occur at altitudes higher than 60 m a. s. l. Peculiarities in the succession of the wetlands of Nyby, which include the presence of separate incomplete successional sequences in the same area, are mainly caused by the peculiar topography with various sub-areas and with an abundance of rock outcrops...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Gradient, {{which is}} largely {{considered}} {{to be related to}} water level in mires, is referred to as a microtopographic mud bottom to carpet to lawn to hummock level gradient or the hummock level to intermediate level (lawn) to flark level gradient. The relationship of this vegetation gradient to various physical water level characteristics was studied. The general classification used in the present summary paper divides the aro vegetation of the inland of Northern Ostrobothnia into two main groups: (a) treeless fen aro vegetation (Juncus supinus, Carex lasiocarpa, Rhynchospora fusca, Molinia caerulea) and (b) heath aro vegetation (Polytrichum commune). The first group (a) was divided into fen aro wetlands with an approximately 10 cm peaty layer at most and into aro fens with a peat layer thicker than 10 cm. The treatment of the water level gradient was divided into three main groups. (1) The mean water level correlated with mire surface levels (microtopographic gradient) within mires with slight water level fluctuations and partly within mires with considerable water level fluctuations. (2) Three habitat groups could be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} range of water level fluctuation i. e. mires with slight water level fluctuations, mires with considerable water level fluctuations and the aro vegetation with extreme water level fluctuations. (3) The timing of water level fluctuations indicated that there are different types of patterns within aro wetlands, the seasonal pattern being mainly a response to yearly snow melt and the several-year-fluctuation pattern being related to the regional groundwater table fluctuation in mineral soils (heath forests). A link was suggested between the stability of the water regime and peat production in local <b>aapa</b> <b>mire</b> – aro wetland environments. From the point of view of peatland plants the direction of variation from a stable to an unstable water regime in <b>aapa</b> <b>mire</b> – aro wetland environments represents a transition towards more and more harsh ecological conditions, partly forming a gradient through natural disturbance. A qualitative functional model was provided for the mire – aro wetland systems of Northern Ostrobothnia. The model supposes differences in the characteristics of peat between two functional complexes within a mire system. Finally, the model for local mire – aro wetland systems was converted to a general from: diplotelmic (acrotelm) mires were divided into two subtypes (diplotelmic water stabilization mires, diplotelmic water fluctuation mires) and the relationship of those subtypes to percolation mires and seasonal wetlands was considered...|$|E
40|$|Patches of {{intermediate}} fen, {{dominated by}} Molinia caerulea, Trichophorum cespitosum and Loeskypnum badium and resembling low <b>aapa</b> <b>mire</b> strings (lawn strings), {{were found on}} a sloping rock outcrop near the summit of Koitelainen Hill, central Finnish Lapland. Using eighteen 56 -cm diameter plots and NMS-ordination we compared the vegetation of the patches to that of (A) corresponding larger fens belonging to a well-known north-Finnish mire site type Loeskypnum badium fen, (B) to that of narrow seepage soaks dominated by Warnstorfia sarmentosa, and (C) {{to that of a}} local heath patch. Ordination of the sample plots suggested a ‘horizontal gradient’ (general wetness) and three ‘vertical gradients’ (1 : stability of the water regime; 2 : poor-rich species; 3 : frost action). Species richness increased along both the horizontal and the vertical gradient, from wet seepage areas to drier Loeskypnum badium fens, to intermediate fen patches and finally to the heterogeneous heath patch. We regard the fen patches of Koitelainen as belonging to an ecologically extreme group, the water-fluctuating lawn-fens. The water-fluctuating lawn-fens are characterised by a thin peat layer with high humification degree, caused by intermittent aeration during drought periods, {{as well as by the}} specific community composition, which is evidently partly structured by the seasonal drought tolerances of individual fen species...|$|E

40|$|A {{long-term}} {{challenge in}} managing the climate effects of land use {{is the development of}} an efficient, comprehensive approach to the identification of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances. The approach would help in establishing robust methods for the cost-effective and climate-friendly targeting of land use options, for example, in peatlands, which are globally important sinks and sources of GHGs. The aims of this study were to create spatial models with the maximum entropy method Maxent so as to 1) identify the environmental variables that control the distribution of GHG sinks and sources in forestry-drained peatlands in Finland and 2) predict the landscapelevel distribution of GHG balances in two regional mire complex zones (the <b>aapa</b> <b>mire</b> and the raised bog zone). Several environmental datasets were used as sources of explanatory variables. Even though the significance of the explanatory variables were different between mire complex zones, the variables describing habitat conditions, such as drainage intensity and site fertility, contributed most to the models. Drainage intensity describes indirectly the moisture conditions and can thereby be used as a proxy for the water table. The results showed that relatively coarse-scale environmental data (25 ha grid cells) combined with spatial modelling have potential in explaining and predicting GHG balances at the landscape level. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that spatial Maxent models have been used to model the distribution of GHG balances...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this study, we {{test whether}} the δ 13 C and δ 15 N in a peat profile are, respectively, {{linked to the}} recent {{dilution}} of atmospheric δ 13 CO 2 caused by increased fossil fuel combustion and changes in atmospheric δ 15 N deposition. We analysed bulk peat and Sphagnum fuscum branch C and N concentrations and bulk peat, S. fuscum branch and Andromeda polifolia leaf δ 13 C and δ 15 N from a 30 -cm hummock-like peat profile from an <b>Aapa</b> <b>mire</b> in northern Finland. Statistically significant correlations {{were found between the}} dilution of atmospheric δ 13 CO 2 and bulk peat δ 13 C, as well as between historically increasing wet N deposition and bulk peat δ 15 N. However, these correlations may be affected by early stage kinetic fractionation during decomposition and possibly other processes. We conclude that bulk peat stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios may reflect the dilution of atmospheric δ 13 CO 2 and the changes in δ 15 N deposition, but probably also reflect the effects of early stage kinetic fractionation during diagenesis. This needs {{to be taken into account}} when interpreting palaeodata. There is a need for further studies of δ 15 N profiles in sufficiently old dated cores from sites with different rates of decomposition: These would facilitate more reliable separation of depositional δ 15 N from patterns caused by other processes...|$|E
