AllMusic additionally credits bands such as Weezer and the Get Up Kids as influences, among others. Pierre quoted Waits that [...] "all <b>anybody</b> <b>ever</b> does is imitate their favorite artist—badly," [...] adding, [...] "we're just regurgitating all the crap we listened to in the late '80s and early '90s, the music that got us into playing music in the first place." ...|$|E

30|$|There was one {{question}} that {{asked me how}} I felt about the way I was communicating with my wife while I was caring for her. And I don’t think <b>anybody’s</b> <b>ever</b> asked me that before. And generally, there is different emotions when you’re caring for things, depending on what physical state she’s in at the moment or what’s been happening prior in the day. Yeah, so I don’t think <b>anybody</b> has <b>ever</b> asked me a question about that before.|$|R
500|$|The passage {{concludes with}} a wry remark from Holly, [...] "I at last managed to get to sleep, a fact for which anybody who reads this narrative, if <b>anybody</b> <b>ever</b> does, may very {{probably}} be thankful". According to Stauffer, [...] "the disarming deflation of the passage {{goes a long way}} toward redeeming it, and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrator's style". Tom Pocock in Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire has also highlighted the [...] "literary framework" [...] that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare, and Classical literature to imbue the story with a [...] "Gothic sensibility". Yet as Stauffer notes, [...] "Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.|$|E
500|$|Citizen Kane {{received}} {{good reviews}} from several critics. New York Daily News critic Kate Cameron called it [...] "one {{of the most}} interesting and technically superior films that has ever come out of a Hollywood studio". New York World-Telegram critic William Boehnel said that the film was [...] "staggering and belongs at once among the greatest screen achievements". Time magazine wrote that [...] "it has found important new techniques in picture-making and story-telling." [...] Life magazine's review said that [...] "few movies have ever come from Hollywood with such powerful narrative, such original technique, such exciting photography." [...] John C. Mosher of The New Yorker called the film's style [...] "like fresh air" [...] and raved [...] "Something new has come to the movie world at last." [...] Anthony Bower of The Nation called it [...] "brilliant" [...] and praised the cinematography and performances by Welles, Comingore and Cotten. John O'Hara's Newsweek review called it the best picture he'd ever seen and said Welles was [...] "the best actor in the history of acting." [...] Welles called O'Hara's review [...] "the greatest review that <b>anybody</b> <b>ever</b> had." ...|$|E
500|$|Zoe Williams {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Daily Telegraph in 2010, after Burbidge became head chef. She found issues {{with some of}} the dishes, such as a mackerel which wasn't properly filleted, and some overcooked samphire. However she thought that the dessert was perfect, stating that [...] "It was enough to make you wonder why <b>anybody</b> <b>ever</b> makes custard without fennel". Fay Maschler visited the new establishment in April 2010 for the Evening Standard, who disagreed with the idea that it was a reopening and said that it instead should be considered to be a new Ramsay restaurant. She was impressed by the majority of the food, especially the desserts, however felt that the service was a little alien. [...] Marina O'Loughlin for the Metro in June 2010, thought that the food was fine and although the restaurant seems to have been entirely designed with gathering Michelin stars, it seemed that everything on the menu had been done somewhere else but better. Time Outs review of the restaurant rated it at four out of five stars, being impressed with the quality of the food and describing the wine selection as [...] "crammed with class".|$|E

500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days when}} I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if <b>anybody</b> <b>ever</b> asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E
