50|$|The trains have closed-circuit {{television}} and passenger alarms for public safety, visual and <b>audible</b> door <b>indicators,</b> LCD screens for travel information and advertising, and line maps with lights that indicate the next stations. SEC Lighting provided the semi-recessed fluorescent saloon lighting for the trains.|$|R

While he had the most money going into Final Jeopardy! round in which every {{contestant}} answered incorrectly, he did not win. As with his Ultimate Tournament of Champions appearance, he was given Braille cards, a computer keyboard, and an <b>audible</b> buzz-in <b>indicator.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Audible</b> Silence <b>indicator</b> {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with the [...] "Alarm" [...] indicator. It indicates that the fire alarm panel is still in an alarm condition, but that notification appliances have been silenced. While the alarm is silenced, other functions in an alarm condition continue to operate, such as emergency service for elevators, stairway pressurization, and ventilation functions. A new alarm initiation while the alarm is silenced will take the panel out of Audible Silence and reactivate the notification appliances.|$|R
2500|$|The glottal stop [...] is the {{realisation}} of {{all four}} possible final consonants: ပ် /p/ တ် /t/ စ် /s/ က် /k/ and the retroflex ဋ် /ʈ/ found in loan words. It {{has the effect of}} shortening the vowel and precluding it from bearing tone. This itself {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "checked" [...] or [...] "entering" [...] tone, following Chinese nomenclature. It can be realised as a geminate of a following stop, although this is purely allophonic and optional as the difference between the sequence /VʔtV/ and /VtːV/ is only in the catch, and thus barely <b>audible.</b> The primary <b>indicator</b> of this final is the impact on the vowel.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 118) In {{this project}} a low cost microprocessor based home control system is presented. The {{system is designed}} around an 8085 microprocessor. The system consists of an automatic telephone dialing system, a seven day real time clock, three general purpose input/output port system and a delay timer. The automatic dialing section allows dialing of up to 25 prestored phone numbers, calculation of the duration and overall charge of the phone call. Dial tone and busy telephone line indication and an automatic redial mode are featured. Three programmable output ports can be activated independently in a 24 hours interval, the active state being programmable up to 99 minutes. Visual and audible indication of the ports state is implemented. A twelve hours delay timer is implemented with <b>audible</b> time out <b>indicator.</b> A seven days real time clock with power failure indication is also implemented...|$|R
40|$|NIOSH has {{developed}} an active proximity warning system called HASARD (Hazardous Area Signaling and Ranging Device) for warning workers as they approach known dangerous areas around heavy mining equipment and other dangerous work zones. HASARD is composed of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter generates a 60 -kHz magnetic field using one or more wire loop antennas. Each antenna is adjusted to establish a magnetic field pattern for each hazardous area. The receiver, worn by the worker, is a magnetic field strength meter. The received signal is compared against preset levels which are calibrated to identify levels of danger. The receiver outputs can include visual, <b>audible,</b> and vibratory <b>indicators</b> and {{it can also be}} made to disable machine functions. HASARD was field tested on a Joy 12 continuous miner, a Komatsu 210 M Haulpak, and on a highwall launch vehicle. Slight modifications were made for each application. HASARD provided warnings as designed and proved to be rugged enough to withstand the harshest of production environments...|$|R
