5|$|Some {{signal lights}} use <b>a</b> <b>luminous</b> paint, {{containing}} a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope {{does not cause}} aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 {{was used for the}} purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety reasons.|$|E
5|$|This violent {{collision}} formed {{most of the}} galaxy's (metal-rich) {{galactic halo}} and extended disk. During this epoch, star formation {{would have been very}} high, to the point of becoming <b>a</b> <b>luminous</b> infrared galaxy for roughly 100 million years. Andromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy had a very close passage 2–4 billion years ago. This event produced high levels of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk– even some globular clusters– and disturbed M33's outer disk.|$|E

Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of NGC 1514. This planetary nebula is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is <b>a</b> <b>luminous</b> gas, rather than stars.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside the orbiter crew compartment. Among these was the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out on the flight, but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using biofeedback techniques, to try {{to determine if they}} worked in microgravity. A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of <b>a</b> <b>luminous</b> atmospheric glow which had been reported around the orbiter, and determine how this interacted with firings of the reaction control system.|$|E

5|$|A star is <b>a</b> <b>luminous</b> {{sphere of}} plasma held {{together}} by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are in{{visible to the naked eye}} from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Located in {{the west}} of the {{constellation}} and depicting the peacock's tail are Eta and Xi Pavonis.

Xi Pavonis is a multiple star system visible in small telescopes as a brighter orange star and fainter white companion. Located around 470 light years from Earth, the system has a magnitude of 4.38. AR Pavonis is a faint but well-studied eclipsing binary composed of a red giant and smaller hotter star some 18000 light years from Earth.

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with <b>a</b> <b>luminous</b> mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E
5|$|With ample {{current density}} and ionization, this forms <b>a</b> <b>luminous</b> {{electric}} arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the electrodes. Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, {{which is to say}} that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with <b>a</b> <b>luminous</b> or {{reflective}} overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E
