5|$|A Floorless Coaster {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller coaster {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders sit with no floor underneath them allowing their feet to swing freely just above the track. Development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996 with Medusa (now known as Bizarro) at Six Flags Great Adventure opening on April 2, 1999, making it the world's first Floorless Coaster. Floorless Coasters also tend to have 3 to 7 inversions incorporated in the layout of the coaster. Recently, Bolliger & Mabillard have used floorless trains on their Dive Coasters, such as Griffon and SheiKra. Though they contain floorless trains, the coasters <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> considered Floorless Coasters as B classifies them as another model. Also, Maurer Söhne have designed their own version of the Floorless Coaster, a variant of their X-Car called X-Car Floorless, but currently do not have any installations.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users are not aware they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, {{and even though the}} newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> aware because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E

5|$|While the subspecific {{status of}} the Asiatic lion (P. l. persica) is {{generally}} accepted, the systematic relationships among African lions <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> completely resolved. Mitochondrial variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies; therefore, all sub-Saharan lions have sometimes been considered a single subspecies. However, a recent study revealed that lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, West-Central African lions are {{more closely related to}} North African and Asian lions than to Southern or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa, and a subsequent recolonisation of these parts from Asia.|$|E
