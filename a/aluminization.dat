They used the vibrating mirror technique developed by Dr. Öpik and Dr. Boothroyd to measure the velocity of meteors, and they recorded meteor tracks from two locations to compute the altitude of meteors by their parallax. The second observing site for parallax measurement was originally near Bellmont, AZ, but was later moved to Padre Canyon, AZ. In 1933 Dr. Boothroyd returned to test the new vacuum deposition technique of mirror coating that had recently been developed at Cornell University. Thus the telescope at the Schultz Peak Station was briefly the world's largest telescope coated by the new, superior <b>aluminization</b> technique. Vacuum <b>aluminization</b> remains the preferred method of coating telescope mirrors for all but a few very specific applications.

40|$|Ferritic {{stainless}} steels and other alloys are {{of great interest}} to SOFC developers for applications such as interconnects, cell frames, and balance of plant components. While these alloys offer significant advantages (e. g., low material and manufacturing cost, high thermal conductivity, and high temperature oxidation resistance), there are challenges which can hinder their utilization in SOFC systems; these challenges include Cr volatility and reactivity with glass seals. To overcome these challenges, protective coatings and surface treatments for the alloys are under development. In particular, <b>aluminization</b> of alloy surfaces offers the potential for mitigating both evaporation of Cr from the alloy surface and reaction of alloy constituents with glass seals. Commercial <b>aluminization</b> processes are available to SOFC developers, but they tend to be costly due to their use of exotic raw materials and/or processing conditions.

40|$|Natural <b>aluminization</b> of {{swelling}} clay minerals is ubiquitous in acidic soils {{leading to the}} formation of hydroxy-interlayered (HI) minerals. This process has drawn special attention over the last 4 – 5 decades owing to the negative impact on soil fertility of the induced reduction of cation exchange capacity. Combination of chemical analyses and of X-ray diffraction profile modeling on a series of experimentally self-aluminized samples aimed at an improved description of HI minerals and more especially of their interlayer crystal chemistry. Both exchangeable alkali cations and hydroxy (Al, Fe) cations coexist within HI vermiculite interlayers. The latter form discontinuous gibbsite-like interlayer sheets with ~ 15 % completeness, despite layer-to-layer distances similar to that of chlorite. From charge compensation considerations, the isolated hydroxy (Al, Fe) cation clusters bear ~ 1. 5 positive charges per cation. Analysis of X-ray diffraction data indicates that <b>aluminization</b> of initially swelling interlayers is a layer-by-layer process leading to mixed layers composed of randomly interstratified swelling and aluminized layers, all aluminized layers likely hosting a similar number of hydroxy (Al, Fe) cations along the <b>aluminization</b> process. This model contradicts the widely accepted description of HI minerals as a solid solution between expandable 2 : 1 clay and aluminous chlorite end-members. As a consequence, the proportion of HI layers in the mixed layer is a robust estimate of <b>aluminization</b> progress and both the amount of extractible (Al, Fe) and the extent of CEC decrease are positively correlated to this essential parameter.

30|$|In conclusion, an {{aluminizing}} nucleation {{process has}} been demonstrated to improve the spontaneous growth of AlN NWs by PA-MBE. The AlN NWs are grown from the nuclei formed by the <b>aluminization</b> process; therefore, their morphologies can be controlled by the <b>aluminization</b> parameters.

SEM and TEM measurements reveal that there are island-like films growing between the AlN NWs. Contrary to the N-polar nature of AlN NWs, the films are proved to be Al-polar which can explain the absence of newly formed NWs.
