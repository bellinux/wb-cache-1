25|$|During this era, the Portuguese popularised {{the term}} Nair, {{referring}} {{to all of}} the locals who fought along with them as Nayari or Nayar, irrespective of strata or caste. The name Nayar existed prior to this merely as a title dispensed by kings to some families who had excelled in military matters. Those families, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> involved in the military, were known as Lokar. Other than this limited use of the Nayar title and the general use of Lokar to describe an occupational group, there is no certainty as to what the various castes which are now categorised as Nairs were called prior to the arrival of the Portuguese.|$|E

500|$|It is {{stated in}} the Indian texts that the legendary Kurukshetra War leads {{to the death of}} all the hundred sons of Gandhari. On the night before Duryodhana's death, Krishna visits Gandhari to offer his condolences. Feeling that Krishna {{deliberately}} did not {{put an end to the}} war, in a fit of rage and sorrow Gandhari places a curse on Krishna that he, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> from his Yadu dynasty, will perish. According to the Mahabharata, a fight breaks out at a festival among the Yadavas, who end up killing each other. Mistaking the sleeping Krishna for a deer, a hunter named Jara shoots an arrow that fatally injures him. Krishna forgives Jara and dies. The pilgrimage (tirtha) site of Bhalka in Gujarat marks the location where Krishna is believed to have died. It is also known as Dehotsarga, states Diana L. Eck, a term that literally means the place where Krishna [...] "gave up his body". The Bhagavata Purana in Book 11, chapter 31 states that after his death, Krishna returned to his transcendent abode directly because of his yogic concentration. Waiting gods such as Brahma and Indra were unable to trace the path Krishna took to leave his human incarnation and return to his abode.|$|E

Travis doesn’t have much of a personality, willing to go <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else’s</b> plans rather than take any direction of his own, and many of his actions are entirely reactionary. He has a habit of “going off” whenever he witnesses someone’s death. He is also oblivious at times, often revealing important information and stating the obvious. Early in the disaster, Travis discovers a goliath bird eater tarantula, whom he adopts and names “Mary.” Though afraid at first, he soon grows emotionally attached to it, almost to the point he believes she’s talking to him {{towards the end of the}} novel.|$|R

50|$|During {{their time}} together, Hans learns of Anna's longing of having someone special in her life, {{with her sister}} {{apparently}} developing a dislike of being around her by suddenly shutting Anna out one day when they were kids, to which Hans openly relates to, only furthering Anna's connection with him. And with this, Hans promises to never shut Anna out, unlike Elsa, much to the princess' absolute joy. By {{the end of their}} tour, Hans works up the courage to propose, with Anna agreeing in a heartbeat. The two head back to the royal throne room, where the party is being held, to ask for Elsa's blessing.

SG-1 return to the planet where Malikai lets slip he too remembers what's happening, but O'Neill finds himself back at breakfast before the altar's activation can be stopped. With the help of O'Neill's and Teal'c's explanations, Carter devises a plan to break the time loop by preventing an incoming wormhole, which fails. Meanwhile, Daniel attempts to translate the altar's writing loop after loop, but his memory is reset each time <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else's,</b> and he cannot possibly translate it all within just a few hours. [...] Ultimately, O'Neill and Teal'c realize the only solution is to learn and remember the alien language themselves. After many loops of teaching, Daniel makes an offhand remark about events that occur during each loop having no consequences once the loop is over, which inspires O'Neill and Teal'c to indulge in wildly outrageous behavior {{as a means of}} dealing with the boredom and frustration of being caught in repeating time. The pair play golf through the active Stargate (much to General Hammond's irritation in at least one loop), Teal'c takes action against the painful starts of his loops by slamming the door back {{in the face of the}} airman who accidentally hit him with it in the beginning of each loop, O'Neill tries pottery-making (clearly improving with each progressive loop), bicycles through the base, and just before the end of one loop, resigns from the Air Force whilst wearing an outrageous sweatshirt for the sole purpose of grabbing Carter and kissing her in the seconds before the loop resets.|$|R

5000|$|In {{spite of}} the {{optimism}} created by the surrender of Russia early in 1918, {{there could be no}} question that the military situation on the Western Front had become more precarious for the Germans after the United States entered the war in April 1917. In the wake of the United States declaration of war, the SPD in the Reichstag joined the [...] "Interfactional Committee" [...] with the Centre Party and the Progressive People's Party. In summer 1917, these three parties passed a peace resolution providing for a peace through rapprochement without annexations and payments, as opposed to a peace through victory and annexations, as the political right was demanding. <b>Along</b> <b>with</b> almost <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in the country, the committee still believed in victory. The Imperial German Supreme Army Command did not like this resolution, and in the negotiations from December 1917 to March 1918 with Russia, it imposed a harsh peace by victory.|$|R
5000|$|While at Harvard, Downey {{wrote for}} the Harvard Lampoon, {{at a time when}} (as Steve O'Donnell said in 1987) [...] "the {{proliferation}} of cable and the proliferation of comedy led the sensibilities of the Lampoon become a little closer to the sensibilities of the mass media." [...] Downey, a member of that first generation of Lampoon writers to make a career in television, has been credited with playing a role in the shift. In 1976, 100 Years of Harvard Lampoon Parodies was published in magazine format, edited by Downey and Eric Rayman. In 1976, Downey became a writer for Saturday Night Live. He worked on 27 of the show's first 32 seasons, one of the longest tenures in the show's history. [...] He arrived at Saturday Night Live the same week as Bill Murray with whom he ended up sharing an office overlooking 50th Street, but he mostly began writing at SNL with Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Dan Aykroyd. [...] His first stretch as writer for the show ran from 1976 to 1980, culminating in a brief stint as a featured cast member. By the 1979-1980 season, Lorne Michaels had lost both Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi to feature film careers, causing him to look to writers like Downey, Tom Schiller, Dan Aykroyd's brother Peter, Al Franken, Alan Zweibel, and Tom Davis to fill spots as cast members (<b>along</b> <b>with</b> SNL bandleader Paul Shaffer and newcomer Harry Shearer). When Michaels left the show in 1980, so did Downey, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> practically <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
40|$|A more {{efficient}} use of the Earth’s resources to preserve the environment for future generations {{was the focus of}} a forum held on climate change at Notre Dame’s Fremantle Campus in October. Dr Lucy Morris, Chief Executive Officer of Baptistcare; Jim Smith, Project Manager Western Australia of Catholic Earthcare Australia and Dr Michael O’Leary, Lecturer in Geography at The University of Notre Dame Australia, were guest speakers at Notre Dame’s Conversations on Tap event titled: Morality of Climate Change [...] . who cares? This was the final in a series of events held by Notre Dame which looked at a range of issues associated with the debate on climate change. It follows the Lang Hancock Annual Lecture delivered by Lord Christopher Monckton and a presentation on the impacts of carbon pricing by John Connor, CEO of The Climate Institute. On this occasion, speakers considered the moral implications associated with the impact of climate change. They discussed who was responsible for the Earth’s environment and its preservation for future generations. A proponent of a more “respectful” use of the Earth’s resources to support future generations, Mr Smith says climate change can be better understood when people realise the impact their carbon footprints have on the global communities around them. Dr Morris spoke on the globalised concept that the ‘world was for sale’ which she argued created cultures of exclusion bound by greed, dispossession and scarcity. She argued that globalisation transformed all beings and resources into commodities and robbed people of their rightful share of ecological, cultural, economic and political space. “Poverty is the great leveller of humanity, and while people are seen as worthless and disposable we will not see the relationship between humanity and its total integration in the health of the planet,” Dr Morris said during her presentation. “Our language and our behaviour expresses our deepest, unconscious beliefs, which is, that everyone and everything is disposable so only the wealthy will survive and the climate will be a victim <b>along</b> <b>with</b> everything and <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> The morality of such a stance is unacceptable. ” Notre Dame Campus Minister, Tom Gannon, thanked the guest speakers and audience members for their participation in the final Conversations on Tap event for 2011. Notre Dame’s Campus Ministry in Fremantle is calling for suggestions to be considered for the 2012 Conversations on Tap series.
