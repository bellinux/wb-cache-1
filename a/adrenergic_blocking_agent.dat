40|$|The {{ability of}} members of the Dibenamine series of <b>adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> (13 -haloalkylamines) to inhibit or “reverse ” {{vasopressor}} responses to a variety of sympathomimetic agents has been repeatedly demonstrated.

Because the pressor response to epinephrine is readily reversed whereas that to norepinephrine is usually only partially inhibited (Barger and Dale, 1910; Greer et al., 1937; Melville, 1937; de Vleeschhouwer, 1948; West, 1949; Euler, 1951), the <b>adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> have been em-ployed in tests to distinguish between epinephrine and norepinephrine.

After intravenous administration of ranitidine. 3 mg/kg both resistances rose again and neither resistance then differed significantly from baseline levels.

To {{determine}} whether the intact isolated ciliary epithelial bilayer retains the alpha- 2 and beta adrenergic receptor activation and interaction described for whole ciliary processes and whether this pure epithelial bilayer displays bioelectrical parameters sensitive to alterations in cyclic adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) production induced by adrenergic compounds.
