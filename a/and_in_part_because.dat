5|$|The mansion where LaLaurie lived is a {{landmark}} in the French Quarter, {{in part because}} of its history <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> there were relatively few homes of such massive size in the Quarter.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are at {{increased}} risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of voiding dysfunction. It is {{the most common cause of}} infection in this population, as well as the most common cause of hospitalization. Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E
5|$|When John was nine, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} Hopkins Academy; the next year, the father took him out again, {{in part because the}} boy was in {{constant}} trouble <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the father had lost his fortune in the Panic of 1819.|$|E
50|$|In his photography, Guenther often works <b>in</b> black <b>and</b> white, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> {{of what he}} {{identifies}} as its documentary aspect, which helps to free his images from the clutter of unintended cultural references.|$|R
50|$|Ades attracts many {{visitors}} from Israel <b>and</b> abroad, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of its unique liturgical style. Ades has two daily morning services (including Shabbat and holidays), and a combined afternoon and evening service that begins just before sundown.|$|R
25|$|The Soviet figures only include imports after September 1939 <b>and</b> differ, <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> <b>because</b> {{they include}} {{products}} {{that were in}} transit during Operation Barbarossa were not yet counted in the German figures, which count only {{the first six months}} of 1941.|$|R
5|$|The Kaluza–Klein {{theory and}} {{subsequent}} attempts by Einstein to develop unified field theory were never completely successful. In part {{this was because}} Kaluza–Klein theory predicted a particle {{that has never been}} shown to exist, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> it was unable to correctly predict the ratio of an electron's mass to its charge. In addition, these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics, which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism, as well as new nuclear forces that were being discovered throughout the middle part of the century. Thus it would take almost fifty years for the idea of new dimensions to be taken seriously again.|$|E
5|$|The first {{service from}} Oslo to Stockholm ran on 16 June 2002. Initially {{there were only}} three daily {{services}}, but later that year, two more daily services were introduced. At the same time, travel time was reduced by 20 minutes, as the trains stopped at only three intermediate stations. Linx operated with different prices on the same route, depending on if the ticket was bought in Norway or Sweden. The company stated that this was in part because of a strong Norwegian krone, in part because Norwegians were willing to pay more, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the sales system in Sweden was more automated.|$|E
5|$|A major {{planning}} {{issue was}} {{the need for a}} minicomputer at the station. NDRE argued that it was fully capable of delivering such a system, but NTNF instead wanted to minimize risk by buying the PDP-8 from Digital Equipment Corporation in the United States. However, NDRE was awarded the contract, in part because of NTNF's obligation to support Norwegian technology <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> NDRE agreed to purchase a suitable foreign computer if they could not successfully manufacture one themselves. A new minicomputer, SAM-2, was built at NDRE and completed in April 1967. It was the first computer built in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. SAM-2 was so successful that the developers established Norsk Data to commercialize the technology.|$|E
50|$|Afghanistan is more {{regional}} than central <b>in</b> orientation <b>and</b> culture, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of {{the lack}} of transportation throughout the country to connect major points of interest. However, a road system connecting the three major cities was built with Soviet aid.|$|R
50|$|The {{time the}} Sandinistas left power in 1990, church/state {{relations}} were considerably smoother {{than they had}} been in the early 1980s <b>and</b> mid-1980s, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the Contra war, which intensified conflict over religion, was winding down. Some of the radicalized Roman Catholics who had supported the Sandinistas in the years since the 1970s remained loyal to them, but their influence outside the Sandinista movement and a few religious think tanks was limited. The number of active CEBs plunged in the early 1980s <b>and</b> never recovered, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the bishops had systematically restricted the church based activities of pro- Sandinista clergy.|$|R
5|$|Revival was {{nominated}} for three Harvey Awards in 2013: Best New Series, Best Writer, and Best Artist. Jenny Frison, who {{has been called the}} underappreciated star of the series, {{was nominated}} for Best Cover Artist <b>in</b> 2013 <b>and</b> 2015 <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of her work on Revival.|$|R
5|$|By 1944, {{by which}} time Norway was {{occupied}} by Germany {{as part of the}} Second World War, overhead wire had been installed on the Flåm Line. The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed, except for the transformers, which were at Per Kure. This was during the height of resistance sabotage, and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production chain and would be set to assemble aircraft engines. Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944, the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged. Reconstruction of them took considerable time, {{in part because of the}} general lack of materials, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944. In 1945, all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished.|$|E
5|$|By 1993, Romney {{had begun}} {{thinking}} about entering politics, partly based upon Ann's urging and partly {{to follow in}} his father's footsteps. He decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, who was seeking re-election for the sixth time. Political pundits viewed Kennedy as vulnerable that year– {{in part because of}} the unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> this was Kennedy's first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, in which the senator's reputation for character had suffered. Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994. In addition to his leave from Bain Capital, Romney also stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Exton {{submitted}} {{his report}} to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton {{that the report}} and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between {{the company and the}} fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, Madeleine (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} {{occasions}} when a President was incapacitated. For example, following Woodrow Wilson's stroke no one officially assumed the Presidential powers <b>and</b> duties, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the First Lady, Edith Wilson, {{together with the}} White House Physician, Cary T. Grayson, covered up President Wilson's condition.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the Cold War, Norway {{enforced}} {{a policy}} to disallow allied aircraft to operate further north than Bardufoss and Andøya, {{in an effort to}} minimize tension with the Soviet Union. Specifically, allied aircraft were not permitted to operate east of the 24th meridian east, which was just west of Banak, thus hindering use of the airfield. This was motivated in part to not unnecessarily provoke the Soviet Union, with which Norway shared a land border, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> increased allied military presence could decrease the popular support for NATO membership. The restrictions were strengthened following the 1960 U-2 incident, in which a US spy aircraft en route to Bodø was shot down over Soviet territory. During the mid-1960s, NATO unsuccessfully attempted to convince Norwegian authorities to move the allied operational border from the 24th to the 27th meridian east.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, the Philadelphia Inquirer {{reported}} that Scarfo Jr. had been demoted within the Lucchese crime family {{in part because}} of ongoing media coverage of his activities <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> he intended to start a mob war to regain control of the Philadelphia outfit.|$|E
25|$|For the 1989 model year, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of a {{government}} decree that required the company to cut the retail price and tax reduction, the Mexican Beetle was relaunched as the Volkswagen Sedan. This new model lost its wheel caps, the body vents it had sported since 1978, and the fittings were of lower quality.|$|E
50|$|Marx {{distinguished}} sharply between value <b>and</b> price, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of {{the sharp}} distinction he draws between {{the production of}} surplus-value and the realisation of profit income (see also value-form). Output may be produced containing surplus-value (valorisation), but selling that output (realisation) {{is not at all}} an automatic process.|$|R
5000|$|Jimmy 'Jimbo' Wales was {{an early}} {{contributor}} <b>and</b> collaborator, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> {{a number of the}} people involved with UMNEWS's SUPERGUY list were also involved with the same server's POLITICS list. Wales was one of the regulars of that list, and there was considerable cross-pollination between the two.|$|R
25|$|The Pharmacy Building has {{received}} international coverage <b>and</b> awards, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of its design team, including world-famous Sir Norman Foster and Claude Engle, {{as well as}} its high-profile sponsor Leslie Dan. It was also featured on the cover of, as well as profiled in, the book Detail In Process.|$|R
25|$|Forus {{had several}} factors which contributed to {{difficult}} aviation conditions and accidents. The runways were not well-leveled, {{in part because}} of poor workmanship <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of soft soil. The area had poor lift and was often covered in fog, and the area experienced difficult wind conditions and air pockets. Hard landings and runway overruns were commonplace.|$|E
25|$|It {{originated}} in the United Kingdom, stemming from the more common activity of caving. Its origins in the United States are more closely associated to scuba diving. Compared to caving and scuba diving, there are relatively few practitioners of cave diving. This {{is due in part}} to the specialized equipment and skill sets required, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of the high potential risks due to the specific environment.|$|E
25|$|Lawler {{has stated}} several {{theories}} {{as to why}} he was allowed to leave. His first involves the ascent of Carter's career alongside the downfall of Chyna's. In his contention, Chyna was jealous of his wife's push inside the company, in part due to the Right to Censor storyline, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of his wife's offer to pose for Playboy magazine. Until that time, Chyna had been the second major wrestling star from the World Wrestling Federation to have done a piece in Playboy (after Sable); during Chyna's debut on the adult magazine, she had suddenly broken her friendship with Carter.|$|E
50|$|In 1923, the Manor Park Citizens Association {{passed a}} {{resolution}} requesting {{the building of a}} new school in the neighborhood, calling Brightwood Elementary School disgraceful <b>and</b> unsanitary <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> some boys had no other place to eat lunch than the lavatory. Three years later, Whittier School opened for children living in Manor Park.|$|R
50|$|Tyne was {{selected}} {{to go on the}} 1907-08 professional rugby tour of Great Britain <b>and</b> Australia, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> his size meant he could play most positions. He was one of six players from the Petone Rugby Club selected. Tyne played in three test matches while on tour. Tyne scored two tries while on tour.|$|R
50|$|Betawi cuisine is rich, diverse <b>and</b> eclectic, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the Betawi {{people that}} create them were {{composed}} from numbers of regional immigrants that coming from various {{places in the}} archipelago, as well as Chinese, Indian, Arab, and European traders, visitors and immigrants that were attracted to the port-city of Batavia (today modern Jakarta) since centuries ago.|$|R
25|$|The Schengen Agreement {{was signed}} {{independently}} of the European Union, in part owing {{to the lack of}} consensus amongst EU member states over whether or not the EU had the jurisdiction to abolish border controls, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> those ready to implement the idea did not wish to wait for others (at this time there was no enhanced co-operation mechanism). The Agreement provided for harmonisation of visa policies, allowing residents in border areas the freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints, the replacement of passport checks with visual surveillance of vehicles at reduced speed, and vehicle checks that allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> {{he never had}} to sell his work to support himself, Caillebotte's {{reputation}} as a painter was overshadowed by his recognition as {{a supporter of the}} arts. Seventy years after his death, however, art historians began reevaluating his artistic contributions. His striking use of varying perspective is particularly admirable and sets him apart from his peers who may have otherwise surpassed him. His art was largely forgotten until the 1950s, when his descendants began to sell the family collection. In 1964, The Art Institute of Chicago acquired Paris Street; Rainy Day, spurring American interest in him. By the 1970s, his works were being exhibited again and critically reassessed.|$|E
25|$|Though she {{had always}} voted Republican in presidential {{elections}} and taken conservative Republican policy positions, McCaughey suddenly switched her party affiliation to Democrat and soon announced plans {{to run for governor}} against Pataki. McCaughey was the early frontrunner for her new party's nomination process, in part because of her statewide name and face recognition <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of the financial support of her wealthy then-husband. During her campaign for governor, she was criticized for firing a succession of campaign aides and political advisers and possibly changing her core political beliefs in order to appear more electable to New York voters. As her opinion poll numbers sank, her husband took away {{more than half of the}} funds he had pledged to her campaign.|$|E
50|$|In architecture, Alexander's work {{is used by}} {{a number}} of {{different}} contemporary architectural communities of practice, including the New Urbanist movement, to help people to reclaim control over their own built environment. However, Alexander is controversial among some mainstream architects <b>and</b> critics, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> his work is often harshly critical of much of contemporary architectural theory and practice.|$|R
5000|$|This {{definition}} {{does not}} make any difference between discrimination based on ethnicity <b>and</b> race, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> {{the distinction between the}} two remains debatable among anthropologists. Similarly, in British law the phrase racial group means [...] "any group of people who are defined by reference to their race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin".|$|R
50|$|The Dharavi slum {{was founded}} in 1882 during the British colonial era, <b>and</b> grew <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of an {{expulsion}} of factories and residents from the peninsular city centre by the colonial government, and from the migration of poor rural Indians into urban Mumbai (then called Bombay). For this reason, Dharavi is currently a highly multi-religious, multi-ethnic, and diverse settlement.|$|R
