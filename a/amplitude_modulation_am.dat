5|$|<b>Amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>AM)</b> {{was once}} the main voice mode in amateur radio before being {{superseded}} by Single-sideband modulation (SSB). But AM has recently become a nostalgic specialty interest on the shortwave ham bands. Vintage radio operation has drawn {{a wide range of}} amateur radio enthusiasts from rock star Joe Walsh, WB6ACU, to former Federal Communications Commission attorney Riley Hollingsworth, K4ZDH.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{modes of}} {{operation}} include voice communication using <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>AM),</b> and Morse code using continuous wave (CW) radiotelegraphy. Among enthusiasts, there is considerable interest in owning, restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment, much of it more than 40 years old. Some undertake to construct their own gear, known in ham slang as homebrewing, using vintage parts and designs. A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests, events, and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of the hobby.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>AM)</b> SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E

25|$|LeMay was a Heathkit {{customer}} and active amateur radio operator {{and held a}} succession of call signs; K0GRL, K4FRA, and W6EZV. He held these calls respectively while stationed at Offutt AFB, Washington, D.C. and when he retired in California. K0GRL is still the call sign of the Strategic Air Command Memorial Amateur Radio Club. He was famous for being on the air on amateur bands while flying on board SAC bombers. LeMay became aware that the new single sideband (SSB) technology offered a big advantage over <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>AM)</b> for SAC aircraft operating long distances from their bases. In conjunction with Heath engineers and Art Collins (W0CXX) of Collins Radio, he established SSB as the radio standard for SAC bombers in 1957.|$|E
500|$|The {{airborne}} radio receivers—initially simple <b>Amplitude</b> <b>Modulation</b> (<b>AM)</b> sets—were {{tuned to}} {{the frequency of the}} LFR ground transmitters, and the Morse code audio was detected and amplified into speakers, typically in headsets worn by the pilots. The pilots would constantly listen to the audio signal, and attempt to fly the aircraft along the course lines ("flying the beam"), where a uniform tone would be heard. If the signal of a single letter (A or N) became audibly distinct, the aircraft would be turned as needed so that the modulation of the two letters would overlap again, and the Morse code audio would become a steady tone. The [...] "on course" [...] region, where the A and N audibly merged, was approximately 3° wide, which translated into a course width of ±2.6 miles when 100 miles away from the station.|$|E

The other carrier is said to be in-quadrature with the first, and its <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> <b>is</b> designated by Q(t). The 90° phase difference between the original carriers makes them orthogonal, which is key to the subsequent separability of the <b>modulations.</b> Another key <b>is</b> that the <b>modulations</b> <b>are</b> low-frequency/low-bandwidth waveforms compared to [...] which is known as the narrowband assumption.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Amplitude</b> <b>{{modulation}}</b> (<b>AM)</b> is a {{modulation technique}} used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave.

[...] This technique contrasts with frequency modulation, in which the frequency of the carrier signal is varied, and phase modulation, in which its phase is varied.|$|E

2500|$|Radiotelegraphy using Morse code, {{also known}} as [...] "CW" [...] from [...] "continuous wave", is the {{wireless}} extension of landline (wired) telegraphy developed by Samuel Morse and dates to {{the earliest days of}} radio. Although computer-based (digital) modes and methods have largely replaced CW for commercial and military applications, many amateur radio operators still enjoy using the CW mode—particularly on the shortwave bands and for experimental work, such as earth-moon-earth communication, because of its inherent signal-to-noise ratio advantages. Morse, using internationally agreed message encodings such as the Q code, enables communication between amateurs who speak different languages. It is also popular with homebrewers and in particular with [...] "QRP" [...] or very-low-power enthusiasts, as CW-only transmitters are simpler to construct, and the human ear-brain signal processing system can pull weak CW signals out of the noise where voice signals would be totally inaudible.
