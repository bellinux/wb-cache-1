5|$|Despite {{nationwide}} {{news coverage}} in both {{white and black}} newspapers, the incident, and the small abandoned village, slipped into oblivion.

5|$|Having {{succeeded in}} {{reversing}} the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next {{to reverse the}} effects of the McKinley tariff. The Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893. After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin. The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials. The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by <b>an</b> <b>income</b> tax of two percent on income above $4,000 (US$ today).|$|E
5|$|In April 1811 the Portsea Island Company {{constructed}} the first {{piped water supply}} to upper and middle class houses.

HMS Victorys active career ended in 1812, when she was moored in Portsmouth Harbour and used as a depot ship. The town of Gosport contributed £75 a year towards the ship's maintenance. In 1818, John Pounds began teaching working class children in the country's first ragged school. In 1820, the Portsea Improvement Commissioners installed gas street lighting throughout the town, followed by Old Portsmouth three years later.|$|E

5|$|In Switzerland, Constantine I and {{his family}} found {{themselves}} isolated and without <b>an</b> <b>income.</b> The Greek government under Venizelos did not pay pensions to former rulers and prohibited any contact between the exiles and King Alexander.

The Russian Revolution and the National Schism deprived Olga of her immovable property and {{she was forced to}} live a much less lavish lifestyle than in the past. She did, however, enjoy spending more time with her sons and grandchildren, from whom she had been long separated by the war.|$|E

5|$|Tensions between Edward and the barons {{remained}} high, and the earls {{opposed to}} the King kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311. By now Edward had become estranged from his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who held the earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester, Lincoln, Salisbury and Derby, with <b>an</b> <b>income</b> of around £11,000 a year from his lands, almost double that of the next wealthiest baron. Backed by the earls of Arundel, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, Lancaster led a powerful faction in England, {{but he was not}} personally interested in practical administration, nor was he a particularly imaginative or effective politician.|$|E
5|$|The Christians {{were granted}} a {{parliamentary}} annuity of £6000 a year, which the Queen requested in person. In addition, a dower of £30,000 was settled upon, and the Queen gave the couple £100,000, which yielded <b>an</b> <b>income</b> of about £4000 a year. As {{well as that}} of Ranger of Windsor Park, Christian was given the honorary position of High Steward of Windsor, and was made a Royal Commissioner for the Great Exhibition of 1851. However, he was often an absentee figurehead at the meetings, instead passing his time playing with his dog Corrie, feeding his numerous pigeons, and embarking on hunting excursions.|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{attention}} {{is now being}} given in Ireland {{to the development of}} <b>an</b> <b>incomes</b> policy for the community. There is general agreement that such a policy should apply to all incomes?not only to wages and salaries but also to dividends, rents, professional earnings and to earnings from self-employment. In the self-employed category, by far the most important group is that of farmers and their families. At present there are 270, 000 farm family members engaged in agriculture (plus 36, 000 hired workers) and the application of <b>an</b> <b>incomes</b> policy to their incomes is as important as it is to the other income groups...|$|R

Personal income changes considerably over the life-time of the average American, from $28,000 at age 25 to about $42,000 {{at the age of}} 65. Yet, very young and old persons would commonly not be considered to be average Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} Pipe roll from 1130 records <b>an</b> <b>income</b> of £24,500. This {{figure is}} {{dwarfed by the}} amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals £68,850. The income that they record {{in the early years}} of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record <b>an</b> <b>income</b> about £10,000 to £15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to £20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about £30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only £8,000 in the early years, rising to £16,500 by 1225. Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.|$|E
