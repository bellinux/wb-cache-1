40|$|Abstract—A novel {{approach}} for resolution of contentions between asynchronous optical packets, exploiting a self-synchronizing mechanism {{by means of}} dynamic all-optical tunable delay line based on stimulated Brillouin scattering in fibers, is reported. Time delay between contending optical packets is mapped into the output timing of a contention-detecting pulse produced by the tunable delay line. The output pulse from the delay line triggers an integrated all-optical flip-flop that generates a synchronized gating signal driving a semiconductor-based all-optical switch, for low-priority packets deflection. Correct operation of the proposed scheme without bit loss or packet fragmentation is demonstrated, and error-free operation for the switched packets is reported under different cases of relative delay between incoming optical packets. The scheme operates entirely in the photonic domain and exploits integrated optical switches and a passive optical-delay line for minimized node latency. Extension to symmetric operation allowing priority swapping between the input packets is also proposed.

40|$|L (Logarithmic space) versus NL (Non-deterministic {{logarithmic}} space) {{is one of}} {{the great}} open problems in computational complexity theory. In the paper "Bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity", we separated monotone analogues of L and NL using a model called the <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> model. In particular, by considering inputs consisting of just a path and isolated vertices, we proved that any monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> solving directed connectivity on N vertices must have size at least N^Ω((N)) and this bound is tight. If we could show a similar result for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity, then this would prove that L ≠ NL. However, proving lower bounds for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity requires proving stronger lower bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity. To work towards this goal, we investigated a different set of inputs which we believed to be hard for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> to solve and attempted to prove similar lower size bounds. Instead, we found that this set of inputs is actually easy for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity to solve, yet if we restrict ourselves to certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>networks,</b> which are a simple and intuitive subclass of monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity, then these inputs are indeed hard to solve.
