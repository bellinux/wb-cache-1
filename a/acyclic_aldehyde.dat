In most examples ring opening leads to stereoselective formation of rearranged hemiketals as minor products. Under other conditions with 2, 2, 2 -trifIuoro- 1 -(2 -ethoxy- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H- 5 -pyranyl) - 1 -ethanone stereoselective ring opening leads to <b>acyclic</b> <b>aldehydes,</b> as minor products and, by the major pathway, {{to a series of}} diols by addition of further equivalents of the Grignard reagent.

25|$|<b>Acyclic</b> {{aliphatic}} <b>aldehydes</b> {{are named}} as derivatives {{of the longest}} carbon chain containing the aldehyde group. Thus, HCHO is named as a derivative of methane, and CH3CH2CH2CHO is named as a derivative of butane. The name is formed by changing the suffix -e of the parent alkane to -al, so that HCHO is named methanal, and CH3CH2CH2CHO is named butanal.|$|R

40|$|<b>Acyclic</b> a,ß-unsaturated <b>{{aldehyde}}s</b> {{present in}} food raise a concern because the a,ß-unsaturated aldehyde moiety {{is considered a}} structural alert for genotoxicity. However, controversy remains on whether in vivo at realistic dietary exposure DNA adduct formation is significant. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop physiologically based kinetic/dynamic (PBK/D) models to examine dose-dependent detoxification and DNA adduct formation of a group of 18 food-borne <b>acyclic</b> a,ß-unsaturated <b>aldehydes</b> without 2 - or 3 -alkylation, and with no more than one conjugated double bond. Parameters for the PBK/D models were obtained using quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) defined with a training set of six selected aldehydes. Using the QSARs, PBK/D models for the other 12 aldehydes were defined. Results revealed that DNA adduct formation in the liver increases with decreasing bulkiness of the molecule especially due to less efficient detoxification. 2 -Propenal (acrolein) was identified to induce the highest DNA adduct levels. At realistic dietary intake, the predicted DNA adduct levels for all aldehydes were two orders of magnitude lower than endogenous background levels observed in disease free human liver, suggesting that for all 18 aldehydes DNA adduct formation is negligible at the relevant levels of dietary intake. The present study provides a proof of principle for the use of QSAR-based PBK/D modelling to facilitate group evaluations and read-across in risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{methodology}} for {{the synthesis of}} amino sugars and aza-sugars, important inhibitors of glycosidases, is described. This is accomplished via the intermediacy of N-diphenylmethylene-protected a-amino esters. This methodology {{can be divided into}} three major phases. First, the reduction-alkenylation reaction with DIBAL-TRIBAL and oxygenated alkenyllithium nucleophiles provides unsaturated 1, 2 -amino alcohols with excellent threo-selectivity (> 20 : 1). Second, optimization of catalytic osmylation conditions with regards to chemical yield, stereoselectivity, and osmium content is described. A mixture of 1. 2 mol% of osmium tetroxide in the presence of 3 eq. of potassium ferricyanide (K₃Fe(CN) ₆) as an oxidant, 3 eq. of K₂CO₃ and 3 mol% of (DHQ) ₂PHAL chiral ligand represents optimized dihydroxylation conditions. Depending upon the substrate, good to excellent antiselectivities are observed. The separation of diastereomeric mixtures of protected amino tetrols is accomplished by flash chromatography on silica gel. Thus, four contiguous chiral centers are established efficiently in two steps. The third stage involves manipulation of the protecting groups and subsequent cyclization. Deprotection of the silyl protecting group in the presence of acyl groups is complicated by migration. The cyclization is accomplished via the reductive amination of <b>acyclic</b> amino <b>aldehydes</b> with NaBH 3 CN. D-N-methyl-fucosamine is prepared from protected L-serine. Depending on the order of osmylation and cyclization steps, this methodology provides either Lazafucose or L-azagulose from protected L-alanine in 8 steps. Furthermore, 1 -cyano-L-azafucose is prepared via treatment of <b>acyclic</b> amino <b>aldehydes</b> with HCN (Strecker reaction) ...|$|R

40|$|The flavour {{characteristics}} of fresh and processed pennywort juices treated by pasteurization, sterilization and high pressure processing (HPP) were investigated by using solid-phase micro-extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons comprised the major class of volatile components {{present and the}} juices had a characteristic smell due {{to the presence of}} volatile compounds including β-caryophyllene, humulene, E-β-farnesene, α-copaene, alloaromadendrene and β-elemene. All processing operations caused a reduction in the total volatile concentration, but HPP caused more volatile <b>acyclic</b> alcohols, <b>aldehydes</b> and oxygenated monoterpenoids to be retained than pasteurization and sterilization. Ketones were not present in fresh pennywort juice, but 2 -butanone and 3 -nonen- 2 -one were generated in all processed juices, and 2 -nonanone and 2 -hexanone were present in pasteurized and sterilized juices. Other chemical changes including isomerization were also reduced by HPP compared to pasteurization, and sterilization...|$|R
40|$|A highly {{efficient}} three-component synthesis of 2 -amino- 7 -hydroxy- 4 H-chromenes by one-step condensation of aldehydes with malononitrile and resorcinol without catalyst in water under ultrasonic irradiation is described.

The versatility of this method was checked by employing various <b>aldehydes</b> (<b>acyclic,</b> aromatic and heteroaromatic) which showed reasonable yields of chromene derivatives under ultrasound irradiation.

40|$|A generic {{parallel}} combinatorial {{method was}} used in order to attempt to develop new asymmetric processes for the aza-Diels-Alder reaction. Initially, an N-para-methoxyphenyl glyoxylate derived imine and its reactions {{with a variety of}} dienes was examined. Several new adducts were obtained, which included both "normal" "inverse" electron-demand aza-Diels-Alder products, and an acyclic product. These results strongly suggested the intervention of a stepwise addition-cyclisation mode of the reaction of diene with the imine. Later, new W-phosphorus imines were examined as dienophile substrates for aza-Diels-Alder reactions. The results of the reactions between these imines and a variety of dienes showed a reduced level of imine reactivity when compared to the N-para-methoxyphenyl C-carboxylate-derived system. Several new products were obtained and the results indicated a stepwise reaction process was in operation, due to the formation of other di-dehydro-piperidinone or <b>acyclic</b> ketone or <b>aldehyde</b> derivatives, hi this study, the first apparent N-phosphonyl imino-Diels-Alder reaction on such systems has been recorded. Screening reactions with different Lewis acids and chiral ligands produced no asymmetric induction, however, this system proved to be unreliable for monitoring by HPLC due to the presence of both cyclic and acyclic products.

40|$|Genotoxicity of α,β-unsaturated {{aldehydes}} {{shown in}} vitro raises {{a concern for}} the use of the aldehydes as food flavourings, while at low dose exposures the formation of DNA adducts may be prevented by detoxification. Unlike many α,β-unsaturated aldehydes for which in vivo data are absent, cinnamaldehyde was shown to be not genotoxic or carcinogenic in vivo. The present study aimed at comparing dose-dependent DNA adduct formation by cinnamaldehyde and 18 <b>acyclic</b> food-borne α,β-unsaturated <b>aldehydes</b> using physiologically based kinetic/dynamic (PBK/D) modelling. In rats, cinnamaldehyde was predicted to induce higher DNA adducts levels than 6 out of the 18 α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, indicating that these 6 aldehydes may also test negative in vivo. At the highest cinnamaldehyde dose that tested negative in vivo, cinnamaldehyde was predicted to form at least three orders of magnitude higher levels of DNA adducts than the 18 aldehydes at their respective estimated daily intake. These results suggest that for all the 18 α,β-unsaturated aldehydes DNA adduct formation at doses relevant for human dietary exposure may not raise a concern. The present study illustrates a possible use of physiologically based in silico modelling to facilitate a science-based comparison and read-across on the possible risks posed by DNA reactive agents. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2018 This {{thesis is}} {{separated}} into three distinct projects. First, synthetic studies towards the furanosteroid viridin shown in part I. Second, synthetic studies towards the diperene obtusanal shown in part II. Third, the analysis, characterization, and synthesis of coronene derivatives towards their application in organic batteries shown in part III. 	Significant synthetic progress towards viridin {{has been made}} in our laboratory. We showcased the first total synthesis directed application of a proline sulfonamide-catalyzed, asymmetric Yamada-Otani cyclization as a key step to enantioselectively form the A ring of viridin from <b>acyclic</b> achiral <b>aldehyde</b> and enone precursors. In addition, we demonstrate an unprecendented, palladium-mediated oxidative furan formation to install the hallmark furan moiety from a diol and alkene functional groups. 	Significant progress towards obtusanal {{has been made in}} our laboratory culminating in the synthesis of the complete carbon bicyclic scaffold of obtusanal. In addition to using a common synthetic intermediate from the viridin project, we established several key transformations. First, a sequential two-step palladium-catalyzed functionalization of the bromo,chloro aromatic moiety. We successfully functionalized the aromatic moiety in high yield across multiple substrates through a Negishi cross-coupling selectively for the aryl bromide with minimal β-hydride elimination, followed by a palladium-catalyzed oxygenation of the aryl chloride. Second, we show a biomimmetically-inspired intramolecular aldol cyclization to set the complete scaffold of obtusanal as a single diasteromer. The intramolecular aldol reaction appears to be mediated by silica gel on an intermediate bearing a silyl enol ether and aldehyde functionality. 	The dense and functionally diverse structure of the intermediates leading to obtusanal necessitated careful reagent selection and intermediate functional group selection. All told, we examined five separate approaches towards obtusanal, and synthetized an advanced intermediatebranched from the second generation “OMe series” sequence, differing from obtusanal only by differing a C 6 alkene versus aldehyde, and C 12 -OMe verses OAc. 	We report the synthesis of a new carbonylated PAH coronenehexaanhydride {{to be used as a}} cathode material in batteries and conducted NMR analysis of the coronene-based materials within organic batteries. We were able to produce coronenehexaanhydride over two steps from coronene; however, application of the material by the Ji laboratory reported low voltage potential for the material. Despite this setback, coronene was identified as a superior cathode material by the Ji laboratory, and NMR analysis prior and post discharge was conducted by our laboratory, which indicated no covalent changes to coronene...|$|R
40|$|Chapter One {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} peptide 'secondary structure' {{with an emphasis on}} β-strand geometry in macrocycles. This structural design is crucial for targeting different proteases. The significance of the macrocylic β-strand ‘bioactive’ conformation is discussed in detail. In particular the exploitation of the conformationally constrained peptidomimetic macrocylic backbone, which is constrained by a number of synthetic approaches to lock the ‘bioactive’ conformation in place. Chapter Two describes simple and scalable methodology for the preparation of N-Cbz protected amino acids by reaction with Cbz-Cl which uses a mixture of aqueous sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate to maintain the appropriate pH. This method proceeds without the formation of by-products. The method is extended to large scale preparation of an intermediate zofenopril, an ACE inhibitor. Chapter Three describes new peptidic templates constrained into a β-strand geometry by linking acetylene and azide containing P₁ and P₃ residues of a tripeptide by Huisgen cycloaddition. The conformations of the macrocycles are defined by NMR studies and those that best define a β-strand are shown to be potent inhibitors of the protease calpain. The β-strand templates presented and defined here are prepared under optimized conditions and should be suitable for targeting a range of proteases and other applications requiring such geometry. Chapter four describes a new approach to non-covalent peptide-based nanotubular or rodlike structures, whereby the monomeric units are preorganised into a β-strand geometry that templates the formation of an extended and unusual parallel β-sheet rod-like structure. The conformational constraint is introduced by Huisgen cycloaddition to give a triazolebased macrocycle, with the resulting self-assembled structures stabilized by a well-defined series of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Chapter Five the 26 S proteasome has emerged over the past decade as an attractive therapeutic target in the treatment of cancers. Here, we report new tripeptide aldehydes that are highly specific for the chymotrypsin-like catalytic activity of the proteasome. These new CT-L specific proteasome inhibitors demonstrated high potency and specificity for cancer cells, with therapeutic windows superior to those observed for benchmark proteasome inhibitors, MG 132 and Bortezomib. Constraining the peptide backbone into the β-strand geometry was associated with decreased activity in vitro and reduced anticancer activity, suggesting that the proteasome prefers to bind a conformationally flexible ligand. Using these new proteasome inhibitors, we show that the presence of an intact p 53 pathway significantly enhances cytotoxic activity, thus suggesting that this tumor suppressor is a critical downstream mediator of cell death following proteasomal inhibition. Chapter Six peptide derived protease inhibitors represent an important class of compounds with the potential to treat a wide range of serious medical conditions. Herein we describe the synthesis of a series of triazole containing macrocylic protease inhibitors preorganised in a β-strand conformation and evaluate their selectivity and potency against a panel of protease inhibitors. A series of <b>acyclic</b> azido-alkyne-based <b>aldehydes</b> is also evaluated for comparison. The macrocyclic peptidomimetics showed considerable activity towards Calpain II, Cathepsin L and S and the 26 S proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity. Importantly, the first examples of potent and selective inhibitors of Cathepsin S were identified and shown to adopt a well-defined β-strand geometry by NMR, X-ray and molecular docking studies. Chapter Seven describes simple and efficient methodology for the selective acylation and alkylation of biotin at its 3 ′-nitrogen. This methodology is used to prepare of other biotin derivatives.
