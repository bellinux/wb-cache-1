5|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> fodder enemies {{attempt to}} hinder Crash in his journey, much of them {{appearing}} in the previous Crash of the Titans.

5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to escape}} {{under cover of}} {{darkness}} on 14 April, the French squadron was spotted by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> British ships stationed close inshore. These ships raised the alarm and the main British squadron followed in pursuit. The rearmost French ship of the line, Hautpoult, was closely followed by the small brig HMS Recruit, which succeeded in delaying Hautpoult long enough that the main British squadron was able to attack and overwhelm her in a running battle that lasted three days and ended off the coast of Puerto Rico. The British suffered 45 casualties, the French nearly 100. The remainder of the French squadron escaped, with the two surviving ships of the line sailing directly for France, eventually reaching Cherbourg in May.|$|E
5|$|Besides, {{there were}} <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> posterns. The heads and limbs of {{executed}} criminals were regularly displayed above the ports. Of the six ports, the Netherbow {{was the only}} one which took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538, and a drawing of 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round towers. In 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a central clock tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} priests, either as secular clergy, or as previously, {{members of a}} {{religious}} order, is obligated to say the “Holy Office” every day. To this end, cathedrals normally have <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> chapels used for private devotion or for small groups. In England {{there is a strong}} tradition that each chapel should face the east. For this reason the transepts of English cathedrals are longer than those in most other countries, and there is often a second transept, as at Salisbury. This arrangement permits a greater number of eastward-facing chapels. That part of the main interior which is furthest to the east and reserved for the prayers of the clergy is the presbytery.|$|E
5|$|Experience with {{previous}} battlecruiser designs {{led to the}} adoption of a continuous upper deck, which raised the level of the deck aft. This was necessary because the aft decks of earlier designs were usually awash when steaming at high speed, even in calm seas. The ships were also equipped with a bulbous bow to reduce drag on the hull, the first time the feature was used in the German Navy. The ships as designed required a crew of 46 officers and 1,140 enlisted sailors. Service as a squadron flagship would increase that number by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. The vessels carried <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> boats, including two picket boats, one barge, two launches, two cutters, and three yawls.|$|E
