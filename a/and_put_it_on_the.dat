5|$|Cope's {{relations}} with Marsh {{turned into a}} competition for fossils between the two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict's seeds began upon the men's return to the United States in the 1860s. Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven. When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope's fossil finds—a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur, Elasmosaurus, that had four flippers and a long neck—he commented that the fossil's head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull {{at the end of}} the vertebrae of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head of the fossil <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back the copies, but some remained with their buyers (Marsh and Leidy kept theirs). The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next society meeting, not to alienate Cope, but only in response to Cope's brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would never talk to each other amicably again, and by 1873, open hostility had broken out between them.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{is said to}} have disliked {{his younger}} brother, Charles, and to have teased him, {{although}} this derives from only one anecdote: when Charles was nine years of age, Henry snatched the hat off a bishop <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> younger child's head, then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make Charles Archbishop of Canterbury, and then Charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly rickety legs. Charles stamped on the cap and had to be dragged off in tears.|$|E
25|$|DeLorean's {{most notable}} {{contribution}} to Pontiac was the Pontiac GTO (Gran Turismo Omologato), a muscle car {{named after the}} Ferrari 250 GTO. It evolved because of the internal GM ban on racing (January 1963) that ended the methodology which Pontiac had used to propel itself into the # 3 sales slot. Pontiac was forced to take its efforts off the track <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street to maintain its # 3 position. The result was the GTO. The GTO debuted as a Tempest/LeMans option package with a larger, more powerful engine in 1964. This {{marked the beginning of}} Pontiac's renaissance as GM's performance division instead of its previous position as a slightly bigger Chevrolet with no clear brand identity.|$|E

500|$|The band's {{image has}} been the subject of much {{criticism}} and controversy, with critics generally accusing it of being a sales gimmick. The band's members object to these claims; according to them the masks are used to divert attention from themselves <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> music. Several band members have said wearing the masks helps to maintain privacy in their personal lives. During an interview in 2005, percussionist Fehn said the masks were a [...] "blessing" [...] because they meant the members are not recognized in public. In 2012, Slipknot released an app for iOS and Android called [...] "Slipknot: Wear the Mask", which invites fans to construct their own masks, defining the kind of Slipknot fans they are.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, a young disk jockey in Charlotte, North Carolina {{who worked}} the {{overnight}} shift had recently received some older records which he brought to work with him.

Shortly after the record had finished, the radio station's telephones began ringing with people asking about the song and requesting to hear it again. By afternoon, the city's music stores were calling the radio station, hoping to learn where they could order copies of [...] "Heartaches". [...] Both Victor and Decca went into their vaults to find their masters of the record and began pressing them for southern United States sales. As disk jockeys {{in other parts of}} the US began obtaining copies of the record and playing it, the demand for [...] "Heartaches" [...] went from coast to coast. This older recording went to the top of all the main charts in 1947, including sales, juke box play, and airplay.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to running a fiscally sound company with packed houses, its deficit reduced by two-thirds, and exciting productions {{such as the}} city's first Thaïs in 1976, another of George London's major achievements was the renaming of the company, first announced in The Washington Post on 13 May 1977. [...] As described by Phillips-Matz, [...] "at {{this point in the}} company's history, the programming was smart, varied, and exciting" [...] but progress was suddenly brought to a halt by the July 1977 heart attack suffered by George London. [...] He was never able to return to the company, but his legacy was that [...] "by giving it a new name, a fresh image, and a lot of heft, he brought the company into the national and international opera scene <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road to top rank of producing organizations." ...|$|E
