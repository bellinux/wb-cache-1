5|$|The 1905 the Florida Legislature {{passed the}} Buckman Act, which reorganized the Florida college system into <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>for</b> white males (University of the State of Florida), <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>for</b> white females (Florida Female College later changed to Florida State College for Women), and <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>for</b> African Americans (State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students). The Buckman Act was controversial, as {{it changed the}} {{character}} of a historic coeducational state school into <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>for</b> women. An early and major benefactor of the school, James Westcott III (1839–1887), willed substantial monies to the school to support continued operations. In 1911 his estate sued the state educational board contending the estate was not intended to support a single-sex school. The Florida Supreme Court decided the issue in favor of the State of Florida stating the change in character (existing from 1905 to 1947) was within the intent of the Westcott will. By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women's college in the United States and was the first state women's college in the South to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as the first university in Florida so honored. Florida State was the largest of the original two universities in Florida, even during the period as the college for women until 1919.|$|E
