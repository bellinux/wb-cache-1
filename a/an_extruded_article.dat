40|$|Mixture {{formation}} of diesel spray impinged on <b>an</b> <b>extruded</b> surface, {{which was a}} top of cylindrical column, was investigated experimentally. A diesel spray was impinged vertically to the extruded surface. The behaviors of impinged spray were observed using a high-speed drum camera. A spray volume was estimated from the photographs. Effect of cylindrical column diameter on spray behavior was investigated. Adhering fuel was measured by a primitive ""wiping by paper and mass measuring"" method under various conditions. Air-fuel ratio in spray was calculated from spray volume and adhering fuel. As the result, the behavior of diesel spray impinged on <b>an</b> <b>extruded</b> column was strongly influenced by {{the diameter of the}} extruded column.
