5|$|Rice is {{the staple}} diet, while fish is an {{integral}} component of coastal South Indian meals. Coconut and spices are used extensively in South Indian cuisine. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes comprising rice, legumes and lentils. Its distinct <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour</b> is achieved by the blending of flavourings and spices including curry leaves, mustard seeds, coriander, ginger, garlic, chili, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, green cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, coconut and rosewater. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a banana leaf and using clean fingers of the right hand to take the food into the mouth. After the meal, the fingers are washed; the easily degradable banana leaf is discarded or becomes fodder for cattle. Eating on banana leaves is a custom thousands of years old, imparts a unique flavor to the food and is considered healthy. Idli, dosa, uthappam, appam, pongal and paniyaram are popular dishes for breakfast. Rice is served with sambar, rasam and poriyal for lunch. Andhra cuisine is characterised by pickles and spicy curries. Chettinad cuisine is famous for non-vegetarian items and Hyderabadi cuisine is popular for its biryani.|$|E

25|$|In most cases, {{some level}} of smoke from a peat-heated fire is {{introduced}} to the kiln to add phenols, a smoky <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour</b> to the whisky. Some of the more intensely smoky malts have phenol levels between 25 and 50 parts per million (ppm).|$|E
50|$|Kaala masala is a Maharashtrian spice mixture (masala). The Maharashtra {{region has}} quite few {{varieties}} of masala which distinguishes Maharashtrian food from other <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> of India. Stronger <b>and</b> spicier <b>flavours</b> are significant aspects of Maharashtra. This special masala {{makes it easy}} to prepare Maharashtrian items like usal, varan and masala bhat.|$|R
50|$|Gevrey-Chambertin {{wines are}} highly {{colourful}} and potent for being Burgundies, with intense <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> evoking blackcurrant, cherry, musk and liquorice, among others. The potency of Gevrey-Chambertin wines {{makes it a}} suitable accompaniment to stews and strong-flavoured cooking, such as grilled red meat, leg of mutton, beef Bourguignon, rabbit stew, coq au vin, coq au Chambertin, and strong cheeses, including Époisses de Bourgogne.|$|R
40|$|Fermented fish {{products}} {{have an important}} role in stimulating appetite by providing unique <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours.</b> Many kinds of fermented {{fish products}} can be found in various parts of Indonesia. Raw materials include whole fish, comminuted fish and viscera from marine and fresb water fishes. The products are peda, jambal roti, kecap ikan, terasi, ikan tukai, bekasang, bekasam, naniura, picungan, and cincaluk...|$|R
25|$|Chianti Classico are premium Chianti wines {{that tend}} to be medium-bodied with firm tannins and {{medium-high}} to high acidity. Floral, cherry and light nutty notes are characteristic aromas with the wines expressing more notes on the mid-palate and finish than {{at the front of}} the mouth. As with Bordeaux, the different zones of Chianti Classico have unique characteristics that can be exemplified and perceived in some wines from those areas. According to Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, Chianti Classico wines from the Castellina area tend to have a very delicate <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour,</b> Castelnuovo Berardegna wines tend to be the most ripe and richest tasting, wines from Gaiole tend to have been characterised by their structure and firm tannins while wines from the Greve area tend to have very concentrated flavours.|$|E
2500|$|The {{high cost}} of saffron {{is due to the}} {{difficulty}} of manually extracting large numbers of minute stigmas, which are {{the only part of the}} crocus with the desired <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour.</b> An exorbitant number of flowers need to be processed in order to yield marketable amounts of saffron. Obtaining [...] of dry saffron requires the harvesting of some 50,000 flowers, the equivalent of an association football pitch's area of cultivation, or roughly [...] By another estimate some 75,000 flowers are needed to produce one pound of dry saffron. This too depends on the typical stigma size of each saffron cultivar. Another complication arises in the flowers' simultaneous and transient blooming. Since so many crocus flowers are needed to yield even derisory quantities of dry saffron, the harvest can be a frenetic affair entailing about forty hours of intense labour. In Kashmir, the thousands of growers must work continuously in relays over the span of one or two weeks throughout both day and night.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{at least}} the 11th century, and {{probably}} earlier, hops {{have been used in}} beer for their natural preservative qualities {{as well as for the}} pleasant bitterness, flavour, and aroma they impart. Since the method of inoculation and long fermentation time of lambic beers increases the risk of spoilage, lambic brewers use large amounts of hops for their antibacterial properties. Lambic in the early 19th century was a highly hopped beer, using 8–9 g/l of the locally grown Aalst or Poperinge varieties. Modern lambic brewers, however, try to avoid making the beer extremely hop forward and utilise aged, dry hops which have lost much of their bitterness, <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour.</b> Consequently, lambics often have a strong, cheese-like, [...] "old hop" [...] aroma, in contrast to the resiny, herbal, earthy hop bitterness found in other styles. The favourite hop used for lambic in the nineteenth century was a variety called Coigneau which was cultivated in the Aalst-Asse area in Belgium.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Krug {{introduced}} Krug Collection, {{an extension of}} Krug Vintage, consisting of bottles that have been kept in the House’s cellars in Reims for at least ten additional years to allow the development of second-life <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours.</b> The current offering is Krug Collection 1989. It is the first vintage from the trilogy of 1988, 1989 and 1990 to be released as part of Krug Collection, preceding 1988 upon the House’s decision.|$|R
5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|R
500|$|Hops contain several {{characteristics}} that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances {{the sweetness of}} the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the International Bitterness Units scale. Hops contribute floral, citrus, <b>and</b> herbal <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> to beer. Hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in [...] "head retention", the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last. The acidity of hops is a preservative.|$|R

5000|$|Smoked beers use malt {{that has}} been treated by exposing it to smoke from burning or {{smoldering}} wood so that a smoky <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour</b> is present. The best known examples of this style are the Rauchbiers of Bamberg, Germany. Brewers outside Germany have also used smoked malt in porters, Scotch ale and other styles.|$|E
25|$|The first vines {{were planted}} using holes blasted {{out of the}} north facing schist slopes of the region, {{creating}} difficult, highly marginal conditions. The first results coming {{in the mid to}} late 1990s excited the interest of British wine commentators, including Jancis Robinson and Oz Clarke. Not only did the wines have the distinctive acidity and abundant fruit of New Zealand wines, but they demonstrated a great deal of complexity, with <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> not common in New Zealand wine and normally associated with burgundian wine. Producers include Akarua, Felton Rd, Chard Farm and Mt Difficulty.|$|R
5000|$|Eisbock was {{introduced}} to Canada in 1989 by the microbrewery Niagara Falls Brewing Company. The brewers started with a strong dark lager (15.3 degrees Plato/1.061 original gravity, 6% alcohol by volume), then used the traditional German method of freezing and removing ice to concentrate <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> while increasing the alcoholic strength to 8% ABV. Niagara Falls Eisbock was released annually as a seasonal winter beer [...] - [...] each year the label would feature a different historic view of the nearby Niagara Falls in the winter. This continued each year until the company was sold in 1994.|$|R

50|$|Leaves {{and young}} {{seedlings}} can be eaten raw or cooked. They {{can also be}} used in salads and soups after removal of the bitterness. The young leaves can be lightly boiled before being pounded and added to glutinous rice dumplings known as mochi to which they give a pleasant colour, <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour.</b> Mugwort mochi can be found in many North American health food stores.|$|E
25|$|Tempranillo {{wines are}} ruby red in colour, while <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> can include berries, plum, tobacco, vanilla, leather and herb. Often making {{up as much}} as 90% of a blend, Tempranillo is less {{frequently}} bottled as a single varietal. Being low in both acidity and sugar content, it is most commonly blended with Grenache (known as Garnacha in Spain), Carignan (known as Mazuela in Spain), Graciano, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Blending the grape with Carignan makes a brighter and more acidic wine. Tempranillo is the major component of the typical Rioja blends and constitutes 90-100% of Ribera del Duero wines. In Australia, Tempranillo is blended with Grenache and Shiraz, also known as Syrah. In Portugal, where it is known as Tinta Roriz, it is a major grape in the production of some Port wines.|$|R
2500|$|Brandy is {{distilled}} {{from the}} base wine in two phases. In the first, large part of water and solids is removed {{from the base}}, obtaining so-called [...] "low wine", basically a concentrated wine with 28–30% ABV. In the second stage, low wine is distilled into brandy. The liquid exits the pot still in three phases, referred to as the [...] "heads", [...] "heart" [...] and [...] "tails" [...] respectively. The first part, the [...] "head," [...] has an alcohol concentration of about 83% (166 US proof) and an unpleasant odour. The weak portion on the end, [...] "tail", is discarded along with the head, and they are generally mixed with another batch of low wine, thereby entering the distillation cycle again. The middle heart fraction, richest in <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours,</b> is preserved for later maturation.|$|R

50|$|As {{the weather}} in Taiwan is highly variable, tea quality may differ from season to season. Although the island is not {{particularly}} large, it is geographically varied, with high, steep mountains rising abruptly from low-lying coastal plains. The different weather patterns, temperatures, altitudes, and soil ultimately result in differences in appearance, <b>aroma,</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour</b> of the tea grown in Taiwan. In some mountainous areas, teas have been cultivated at ever higher elevations to produce a unique sweet taste that fetches a premium price.|$|E
40|$|Red {{wine from}} the Greek grape {{cultivar}} Aghiorghitiko, was aged in stainless steel {{with and without}} wood chips toasted to different degrees (heavily, medium, lightly) and in a 225 L American standard oak barrel for 32 days. Headspace concentrations of four wood-derived congeners (furfural, guaiacol, cis and trans oak lactones) were determined over this period after which the wines were bottled, stored and subjected to sensory descriptive analyses. Of the 36 attributes for appearance, <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> oral characters, 14 were significant in univariate analyses and differentiated wines in a multivariate (principal component analysis) product space explaining 72 % variance in two factors. Wines from medium toast wood chips scored highest for woody, vegetative <b>and</b> smoky <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> but also for bitter taste and astringent mouthfeel and after 14 days had the highest headspace concentrations of furfural and cis oak lactone. Wood-related notes were ranked from heavily and lightly toasted chips, barrel and steel control...|$|R
2500|$|Mead ( [...] , {{literally}} [...] "drinkable honey") is {{an alcoholic}} beverage {{that has been}} part of Polish culinary tradition for over a thousand years. It is made by alcoholic fermentation of a mixture of honey and water.

30|$|Drought {{during the}} {{reproductive}} stage can reduce spikelet fertility, panicle exsertion and source-sink interactions which all decrease yield (Wassmann et al. 2009). Yield {{can therefore be}} used as a proxy to measure the degree of drought tolerance (Kumar et al. 2008). Several studies have demonstrated the drought tolerance of Apo (Venuprasad et al. 2007; Venuprasad et al. 2009; Venuprasad et al. 2012 and susceptibility of IR 64 {Venuprasad et al. 2007 # 21; Kumar et al. 2008; Guan et al. 2010; Vikram et al. 2011; Ghimire et al. 2012; Palanog et al. 2014). However, in our experiment, the yield of both varieties under drought was reduced, and surprisingly there was no statistical difference between the two varieties (Figure  1 A, Additional file 1 : Table S 1). Furthermore, drought significantly affected the <b>aromas</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> of the grain of IR 64, but it did not have such an effect on the grain of Apo (Figures  2 A and B).|$|R
