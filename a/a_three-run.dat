That personal best lasted barely two months: on September 7 he hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> home run and a grand slam for seven RBIs, all in the first two innings, to defeat the Athletics again. Killebrew led the best offense in the league and rookie manager Billy Martin's Twins won the new American League West division as a result.|$|E
5|$|Damon hit a {{home run}} to right field in the first at-bat of the game on a 2-1 count to give the Red Sox the lead in the first inning for the fourth {{straight}} game; it proved to be the game-winning run.

5|$|Following a rain-delayed start, the Dodgers won Game 1 by a close 3–2 score, with a {{home run}} by John Roseboro {{providing}} the margin of victory. The Dodgers then won the series and the pennant with another close victory in Game 2; they came back from <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> deficit {{to tie the game}} in the ninth and then ultimately defeated the Braves, 6–5, in extra innings. This victory advanced the Dodgers to the 1959 World Series, in which they defeated the Chicago White Sox, four games to two. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker series counted as the 155th and 156th regular-season games for both teams, with all events in the series added to regular-season statistics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Pujols doubled again {{and was able}} to score on an error by Mueller.

Ordóñez was then brought home via a two-run home run by Tigers' first baseman Miguel Cabrera. The Twins responded {{in the bottom of the}} inning, with Matt Tolbert singling to lead off the inning, advancing to second base on a single by Denard Span, and then moving to third on a flyball out. Tigers' starter Rick Porcello attempted a pickoff throw to first which hit the baserunner Span and went past the first baseman Cabrera.

5|$|Tim Wakefield {{made his}} first start of the 2004 postseason for the Red Sox, {{becoming}} the first knuckleball pitcher to make a World Series start since 1948, while Woody Williams, who had won both his previous two starts in the post-season, was the Cardinals' starting pitcher. In {{the bottom of the}} first inning, Williams gave up a lead-off double to Johnny Damon, and then hit Orlando Cabrera in the shoulder with one of his pitches.

5|$|During {{the third}} inning of a 2007 game at Fenway Park, Manny Ramírez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek hit four {{consecutive}} home runs off Yankee pitcher Chase Wright, powering a comeback from <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> deficit and completing a three-game sweep of the Yankees at Fenway Park {{for the first time}} since 1990. By May, after long speculation about what team he would play for after retirement, Roger Clemens chose to return to the Yankees as opposed to the Red Sox (where he started his career) or the Houston Astros (his hometown and last team he played for). Clemens helped the Yankees overcome a 14-game deficit in the standings to roar back to reach the playoffs again, however, this was not enough to win the division. On September 28, Boston won the AL East after a win against the Minnesota Twins and a loss by the Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles. This was the first AL East Championship for the Red Sox since 1995, ending the Yankees' nine-year reign in the division.|$|E
5|$|In Game 4 (the final game) of the NLDS {{against the}} Brewers, Burrell hit {{two home runs}} (<b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> game-winning home run against Jeff Suppan and a solo home run against Guillermo Mota) in a 62 victory that gave the Phillies their first playoff series victory since 1993. Four days later, {{in the first game}} of the NL Championship Series, he hit a game-winning solo home run in a 32 victory over the Dodgers. After going hitless in his first 14 at-bats in the World Series, Burrell doubled against J. P. Howell of the Tampa Bay Rays on October 29 in Game 5 (the final game of the series). Burrell was then {{replaced}} by pinch-runner Eric Bruntlett, who scored the game's winning run in the 43 victory as the Phillies won their first World Series since 1980. After the series, Burrell was chosen to lead the Phillies' World Series parade.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2012, Ross {{finalized}} {{a one-year}} contract with the Boston Red Sox. He was supposed to provide depth off the bench, but injuries, particularly to Carl Crawford, led to him holding a starting role for the entire season. He started almost every day for Boston in all three outfield positions, but mainly right field. On April 14, Ross hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform, a two-run shot off the Tampa Bay Rays's Dane De La Rosa in a 13–5 Red Sox victory. The next day, Ross hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> homer {{in the bottom of}} the second inning off Matt Moore in a 6–4 victory over the Rays. On May 18, 2012, Ross suffered a fractured foot after fouling a ball off his foot. He was placed on the disabled list and expected to miss from six to eight weeks.|$|E
500|$|With <b>a</b> pinch-hit <b>three-run</b> {{home run}} in the fifth inning, Greg Dobbs tied a Phillies' {{franchise}} record with his twentieth pinch-hit of the season, tying Doc Miller.

5|$|The Los Angeles Dodgers {{were the}} National League's No. 1 seed {{by virtue of}} the best record {{entering}} the playoffs; thus, the Phillies traveled to Chavez Ravine for the opener of the playoffs' second round, the fifth postseason meeting between the two clubs. James Loney opened the scoring for the Dodgers with a solo home run {{in the bottom of the}} second inning, but the Phillies answered back with a five-run fifth inning, chasing starter Clayton Kershaw. Manny Ramírez' two-run home run in the bottom of the inning made the score 5–4, but Raúl Ibañez followed with <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> home run in the top of the eighth. Lidge, appearing in his third consecutive postseason game, notched his third consecutive save. Martínez started the second game for the Phillies, throwing 7 scoreless innings on 87 pitches.

Jonathan Broxton saved the second game for the Dodgers, as Los Angeles won, 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{replaced}} Melky Cabrera {{on their}} postseason roster with Ramiro Peña {{due to his}} injury in Game4, while Brett Gardner took Cabrera's place in center field. A. J.

The Yankees scored first in the first inning, with Johnny Damon reaching base with a single and then scoring on a two-out double by Alex Rodriguez. The Phillies responded {{in the bottom of}} the inning with a single by Jimmy Rollins, Shane Victorino reaching after being hit by a pitch, and finally <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> home run by Chase Utley to take the lead. The Phillies added to their lead in the third inning with Utley and Ryan Howard drawing walks followed by RBI singles by Jayson Werth and Raúl Ibañez. With no outs in the inning, Burnett was relieved by David Robertson, who allowed another run to score on a Carlos Ruiz ground out.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{went on to}} face India in the semi-final. Chasing {{a target}} of 120, Poulton came in to join captain Blackwell—who had {{promoted}} herself up the order—at 2/75, with 45 runs needed from 56 balls. Poulton hit 30 from 26 balls to seal an Australian victory with seven wickets and seven balls to spare. She brought up the winning runs with a lofted drive that bounced once before going for four runs. In the final against New Zealand, Australia started poorly after electing to bat. Nitschke fell in the third over to bring Poulton in at 1/10, before Villani and Blackwell fell quickly to leave Australia at 3/20 in the sixth over. This {{was followed by a}} consolidating partnership of 30 between Poulton and Cameron, but they were unable to lift the run rate substantially; their stand took 45 balls. Poulton was caught trying to loft a ball over cover, and two balls later, Cameron was bowled, leaving Australia at 5/51 in the 13th over. Only Poulton managed a solitary boundary. A later burst took Australia to 8/106 from their 20 overs and Poulton ended with the highest score of 20 from 28 balls. The Australians then restricted New Zealand to 6/103 to complete <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> win. Poulton was Australian's highest run-scorer for the tournament and the third among all players.|$|E
50|$|On September 6, 2015, McCann hit his career-high 25th {{home run}} of the season, <b>a</b> game-tying <b>three-run</b> shot off of Chris Archer of the Tampa Bay Rays.

5|$|Following their four-game {{sweep of}} Milwaukee in the {{beginning}} of September, the Phillies recorded their first playoff win since their 1993 World Series appearance on October 1, defeating the Brewers in Game 1. Cole Hamels was the victor, earning his first career playoff win. Hamels allowed no runs and two hits over his eight innings of work. Chase Utley batted in two runs, while Ryan Howard walked three times in the game. In Game 2, Shane Victorino's grand slam was all the run support starter Brett Myers needed, as he pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs. The Phillies' second consecutive victory was also supported by a pair of doubles from Victorino and from Jayson Werth. In a reversal of fortune, the Brewers scored two runs in the first inning of Game 3, and it proved to be enough to win the game. Brewers starter Dave Bush and closer Salomón Torres were able to hold off the Phillies despite a rally {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, keeping the Brewers alive for Game 4. However, the Phillies defeated the Brewers in Game 4 at Miller Park to win the series, 31. Jimmy Rollins, Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell all hit solo home runs, and Burrell contributed <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> homer as well. Joe Blanton struck out seven Brewers, holding the team to one run on five hits through six innings.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia, Rentería {{reclaimed}} {{a starting}} role {{when he started}} four games (the Giants benched third baseman Pablo Sandoval and shifted Uribe to third base). He only had one hit in the series, but he scored the winning run in the Giants' 3–0 victory in Game 3, and he retained the starting job in the World Series. In Game 2 of the series, against the Texas Rangers, he broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning when he homered off C. J. Wilson to give the Giants a 1–0 lead. He later added a two-run single {{in the eighth inning}} as the Giants won 9–0. Before Game 5, with the Giants leading the series 3–1, Rentería joked with teammate Andrés Torres {{that he was going to}} hit a home run. In the seventh inning, with runners at second and third, two outs, and no score, Rentería hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> home run off Rangers' pitcher Cliff Lee that won the series for the Giants. The feat made him only the fourth player to have two series-winning hits in history, along with Yogi Berra, Joe DiMaggio, and Lou Gehrig. For his contributions, he was named the 2010 World Series Most Valuable Player, making him the first player from Colombia to achieve this feat. The Giants declined his option on November 5, but Rentería did announce that he planned to play in 2011. The Giants did offer him a one-year, one million dollar contract as a utility player, but Rentería declined.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} inning, Taylor Douthit hit an infield single to shortstop Koenig, and Billy Southworth {{followed}} with a single to left field, advancing Douthit to second base.

Gehrig, Lazzeri and Dugan all grounded out {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning. In the top of the eighth, Bottomley hit a single into right field. Yankees manager Miller Huggins came out of the dugout and took Shocker out of the game, calling in Bob Shawkey from the bullpen to replace him. Shawkey struck out the first two batters he faced, and Bottomley was tagged out after attempting to steal second base. The Yankees could not produce any runs in their half of the inning.|$|E
50|$|While Mueller {{was being}} carried {{off the field}} to be {{replaced}} by pinch runner Clint Hartung, Dodger manager Chuck Dressen, acting on the instructions of Dodger bullpen coach Clyde Sukeforth, called on relief pitcher Ralph Branca, whose second pitch was hit by Thomson over the head of Andy Pafko into the Polo Grounds' lower left field stands for <b>a</b> game-winning, <b>three-run</b> homer.|$|R
