40|$|<b>Asset</b> <b>managers</b> in {{emerging}} market economies 1 The turbulence {{in emerging}} market economies (EMEs) in mid- 2013 has reminded policymakers and investors {{of the importance}} of actions by large <b>asset</b> <b>managers</b> for relatively small and illiquid EME asset markets. The presence of <b>asset</b> <b>managers</b> in EMEs has grown considerably, and the concentrated use of benchmarks and the directional co-movement of investor flows can generate correlated investment patterns that may create one-sided markets and exacerbate price fluctuations. Indeed, we provide evidence showing that, during the past two years, investor flows to <b>asset</b> <b>managers</b> and EME <b>asset</b> prices have reinforced each other’s movements. JEL classification: G 11, G 15, G 23. In recent years, <b>asset</b> <b>managers</b> have become important players in emerging market economy (EME) asset markets. This shift has coincided with a prolonged period of very low interest rates in advanced economies, which has led investors to look for higher-yielding (but riskier or less liquid) assets in the hope of greater returns. This has resulted in a sharp rise in bond issuance by EME entities, especially EME corporations...|$|R

BIS shares traded on stock markets, which made the bank an unusual organization: an international organization (in the technical sense of public international law), yet allowed for private shareholders. Many central banks had similarly started as such private institutions; for example, the Bank of England was privately owned until 1946. In more recent years the BIS has bought back its once publicly traded shares. It is now wholly owned by BIS members (central banks) but still operates in the private market as a counterparty, <b>asset</b> <b>manager</b> and lender for central banks and international financial institutions.

5000|$|Moreover, a {{conflict}} of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients, combined with a global glut in investment capital, led to bad investments by <b>asset</b> <b>managers</b> in over-priced credit <b>assets.</b> Professional investment <b>managers</b> generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management. There is, therefore, an incentive for <b>asset</b> <b>managers</b> to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, <b>asset</b> <b>managers</b> were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many <b>asset</b> <b>managers</b> continued to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, so they could maintain their assets under management. They supported this choice with a [...] "plausible deniability" [...] of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early [...] "vintages" [...] of subprime loans was so low.|$|R

2500|$|In asset {{management}} and securities industries, soft dollars are the benefits provided to an <b>asset</b> <b>manager</b> by a broker-dealer {{as a result}} of commissions generated from financial transaction executed by the broker-dealer for client accounts or funds managed by the <b>asset</b> <b>manager.</b> In a soft dollar arrangement, the investment manager directs commissions generated by a client's or fund's transactions to a broker-dealer or other trading venue. Soft dollars, in contrast to hard dollars (actual cash) which have to be reported, are incorporated into brokerage fees and paid expenses, which may not be reported separately (partly due to the difficulty in their valuation. Most investment managers follow the limitations detailed in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. [...] In particular, if soft dollar arrangements are entered into with respect to registered investment companies and pension plans (ERISA and public plans), compliance with Section 28(e) is generally required. [...] However, hedge funds, which are generally not registered, may not be subject to the limitations of Section 28(e) and, thus, in some cases, the fund's commissions may be used for the adviser's benefit. In situations where fund commissions are used outside of the Section 28(e) safe harbor, full and comprehensive disclosure must be provided to fund investors.|$|E
