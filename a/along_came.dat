It was eventually released in early 1994, directed by Stiller and featuring him as a co-star. The film was produced by Danny DeVito, who would later direct Stiller's 2003 film Duplex and produce his 2004 film <b>Along</b> <b>Came</b> Polly. Reality Bites debuted as the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend and received mixed reviews.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Stiller {{appeared}} in six different films, {{all of which}} were comedies, and include some of his highest-grossing films: Starsky & Hutch, Envy, , [...] (in which he had an uncredited cameo), <b>Along</b> <b>Came</b> Polly and Meet the Fockers. While the critical flop Envy only grossed $14.5million, the most successful film of these was Meet the Fockers, which grossed over $516.6million worldwide. As well as these, he also made extended guest appearances on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Arrested Development in the same year. In 2005, Stiller {{appeared in}} Madagascar, which was his first experience as a voice actor in an animated film.

500|$|He {{appeared}} in numerous other {{films in the}} late 1990s, including Heat (1995), Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), Celebrity (1998) and worked opposite Gwyneth Paltrow, as Walter Plane, in the 1998 adaptation of Great Expectations. He played photographer Victor [...] "Animal" [...] Palotti in Godzilla (1998). Godzilla was one of Azaria's first starring roles in a blockbuster film. Its five-month shoot was the longest of his career to date, but he considered it {{a good chance to}} boost his profile. He noted, [...] "I'm so used to melding into every character I play. Even people in the business think the guy who did Birdcage, Quiz Show and Great Expectations are three different actors—which in a way makes me proud, but in another way is very frustrating. It's the curse and blessing of the character actor". The shoot's physical challenges, and the film's critical failure, led Azaria to later describe it as [...] "tough to make, and very disappointing when it came out. It was one you definitely chalk up and say, 'That was part of paying your dues, better luck next time'." [...] In 1999, he starred in the drama Mystery, Alaska as Charles Danner, and the comedy superhero film Mystery Men, as the faux-British silverware throwing expert The Blue Raja. Other film roles included Hector Gorgonzolas in America's Sweethearts (2001), Claude in <b>Along</b> <b>Came</b> Polly (2004), and the young Patches O'Houlihan in [...] (2004), the latter two with Ben Stiller.

500|$|Hoffman's second 2003 {{appearance}} {{was a small}} role in Anthony Minghella's successful Civil War epic Cold Mountain. He played an immoral preacher, a complex character that Hoffman described as a [...] "mass of contradictions". The same year, from April to August, he appeared with Vanessa Redgrave in a Broadway revival of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. Director Robert Falls later commented on the dedication and experience that Hoffman brought to his role of alcoholic Jamie Tyrone: [...] "Every night he ripped it up to an extent that he couldn't leave [...] Phil carried it with him." [...] Hoffman received his second Tony Award nomination, this time for Best Featured Actor in a Play. In 2004, he appeared as the crude, has-been actor friend of Ben Stiller's character in the box-office hit <b>Along</b> <b>Came</b> Polly.

In 1921, however, the duo received their greatest acclaim with the musical Shuffle Along, the first piece to bring African American jazz and humor to Broadway.

500|$|The first Venom title, , was {{published}} in January 1993 and written by Venom co-creator David Michelinie. The story began the character's transition from unambiguous villain to anti-hero and introduced the symbiote offspring (Scream, Phage, Riot, Lasher and Agony), who would recur in Marvel comics until the 2011 Carnage, U.S.A. limited series. Seventeen other series were printed between August 1993 and January 1998, including 1994's [...] (which continued the story of Venom's offspring and spawned the 1995 [...] "Planet of the Symbiotes" [...] cross-series story arc), 1996's <b>Along</b> <b>Came</b> a Spider (which introduced symbiote anti-hero Hybrid) and 1997's Venom: On Trial (which saw Eddie Brock tried for his crimes as Venom). Larry Hama wrote the most individual series (eight in total), including the 1997 final installment (Venom: The Finale, which saw the symbiote apparently killed). According to editor Tom Brevoort, the series was cancelled because [...] "The return on the book had declined {{to the point where}} any immediate financial reward was overshadowed by [...] discomfort with the character starring in his own title." [...] The limited-series run consisted of 60 issues.|$|E
500|$|In 1944, Cooper {{appeared}} in Cecil B. DeMille's wartime adventure film The Story of Dr. Wassell with Laraine Day—his third movie with the director. In the film, Cooper plays American doctor and missionary Corydon M. Wassell, who leads {{a group of}} wounded sailors through the jungles of Java to safety. Despite receiving poor reviews, Dr. Wassell {{was one of the}} top-grossing films of the year. With his Goldwyn and Paramount contracts now concluded, Cooper decided to remain independent and formed his own production company, International Pictures, with Leo Spitz, William Goetz, and Nunnally Johnson. The fledgling studio's first offering was Sam Wood's romantic comedy Casanova Brown with Teresa Wright, about a man who learns his soon-to-be ex-wife is pregnant with his child, just as he is about to marry another woman. The film received poor reviews, with the New York Daily News calling it [...] "delightful nonsense", and Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticizing Cooper's [...] "somewhat obvious and ridiculous clowning". The film was barely profitable. In 1945, Cooper starred in and produced Stuart Heisler's Western comedy <b>Along</b> <b>Came</b> Jones with Loretta Young for International. In this lighthearted parody of his past heroic image, Cooper plays comically inept cowboy Melody Jones who is mistaken for a ruthless killer. Audiences embraced Cooper's character, and the film was one of the top box-office pictures of the year—a testament to Cooper's still vital audience appeal. It was also International's biggest financial success during its brief history before being sold off to Universal Studios in 1946.|$|E
