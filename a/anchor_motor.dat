The advance sheets of the federal courts are beginning to read like Labor Arbitration Reports. The kinds of disputes that in the past were resolved by private arbitration are beginning to appear at an increasing rate on the dockets of the federal courts: Did the company have just cause when it discharged the grievants for allegedly falsifying their expense accounts? Did the company violate the agreement with the union when it assigned the grievants to night work? Was the employer justified in discharging the grievant for allegedly striking her superior? Did the grievant place the meat on the loading dock, intending it to be picked up by accomplices, and did that constitute grounds for discharge? Was the company justified in discharging the grievant for possessing a bandsaw stolen from the company? Was the grievant, who signed a confession admitting his theft, discharged for cause? Should the company have given credit to the grievant for seniority earned while working in South America? Was the grievant, a truck driver who admittedly sought pay for time not worked, guilty of theft of company time, and thus properly discharged? Was the grievant discharged for cause after he struck a bridge with his truck? Was the grievant 2 ̆ 7 s alleged intoxication sufficient cause for his discharge? Did past practice justify paying the grievant a lower rate of pay for piloting a smaller boat? Is alcoholism an illness, entitling the grievant to sick leave under the contract? Was the grievant, who had only one good eye, properly laid off when his job was changed to require him to drive? Was the grievant 2 ̆ 7 s job classification proper? Did the company assign the correct seniority date to the grievant? Was the grievant 2 ̆ 7 s explanation of why he allowed an unauthorized female passenger on a charter bus believable, or was he discharged for cause?

40|$|Cardiac myocytes are {{characterized}} by distinct structural and functional entities involved in the generation and transmission of the action potential and the excitation-contraction coupling process. Key to their function is the specific organization of ion channels and transporters to and within distinct membrane domains, which supports the anisotropic propagation of the depolarization wave. This review addresses the current knowledge on the molecular actors regulating the distinct trafficking and targeting mechanisms of ion channels in the highly polarized cardiac myocyte. In addition to ubiquitous mechanisms shared by other excitable cells, cardiac myocytes show unique specialization, illustrated by the molecular organization of myocyte-myocyte contacts, e. g., the intercalated disc and the gap junction. Many factors contribute to the specialization of the cardiac sarcolemma and the functional expression of cardiac ion channels, including various <b>anchoring</b> proteins, <b>motors,</b> small GTPases, membrane lipids, and cholesterol. The discovery of genetic defects {{in some of these}} actors, leading to complex cardiac disorders, emphasizes the importance of trafficking and targeting of ion channels to cardiac function.

Microstructures with a 3 -D anchored cantilever {{as well as}} free-floating components are fabricated in a single step at a single site {{without the use of}} a sacrificial layer. By controlling the location of high oxygen concentration area through PDMS substrate patterning, we can create partially bound and free-floating movement-restricted structures.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} flagellar motor is {{a molecular}} machine that couples proton or sodium influx to force generation for driving {{rotation of the}} helical flagellar filament. In this study, we cloned a gene (motY) encoding {{a component of the}} sodium-driven polar flagellar motor in Vibrio alginolyticus. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the gene encodes a 293 -amino-acid polypeptide with a single putative transmembrane segment that is very similar (94. 5 % identity) to the recently described MotY of V. parahaemolyticus. Their C-terminal domains were similar to the C-terminal domains of many peptidoglycan-interacting proteins, e. g., Escherichia coli MotB and OmpA, suggesting that MotY may interact with peptidoglycan for <b>anchoring</b> the <b>motor.</b> By using the lac promoter-repressor system, motY expression was controlled in V. alginolyticus cells. Swimming ability increased with increasing concentrations of the inducer isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and the swimming fraction increased after induction. These results are consistent with the notion that MotY is a component of the force-generating unit. V. alginolyticus motY complemented the motY mutation of V. parahaemolyticus. However, motY appeared to lack a region corresponding to the proposed motY promoter of V. parahaemolyticus. Instead, sequences similar to the sigma 54 consensus were found in the upstream regions of both species. We propose that they are transcribed from the sigma 54 -specific promoters...|$|R

40|$|SummaryA male {{pronucleus}} migrates {{toward the}} center of an egg to reach the female pronucleus for zygote formation. This migration depends on microtubules growing from two centrosomes associated with the male pronucleus. Two mechanisms were previously proposed for this migration: a “pushing mechanism,” which uses the pushing force resulting from microtubule polymerization, and a “pulling mechanism,” which uses the length-dependent pulling force generated by minus-end-directed <b>motors</b> <b>anchored</b> throughout the cytoplasm. We combined two computer-assisted analyses to examine the relative contribution of these mechanisms to male pronuclear migration. Computer simulation revealed an intrinsic difference in migration behavior of the male pronucleus between the pushing and pulling mechanisms. In vivo measurements using image processing showed that the actual migration behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans confirms the pulling mechanism. A male pronucleus having a single centrosome migrated toward the single aster. We propose that the pulling mechanism is the primary mechanism for male pronuclear migration...|$|R

Previous related studies have used molecular motors actively pulling on the membrane to extract a nanotube.

We find that a drag force of approximately ≈ 7 pN is sufficient for tubule extraction for vesicles ranging from 1 - 2 um in radius. By our method, {{we find that the}} force generated by a single molecular motor is sufficient for membrane tubule extraction from a spherical lipid vesicle...|$|R
40|$|Many {{members of}} the phylum of Apicomplexa have adopted an obligate {{intracellular}} life style and critically depend on active invasion and egress from the infected cells to complete their lytic cycle. Toxoplasma gondii belongs to the coccidian subgroup of the Apicomplexa, and as such, the invasive tachyzoite contains an organelle termed the conoid at its extreme apex. This motile organelle consists of a unique polymer of tubulin fibres and protrudes in both gliding and invading parasites. The class XIV myosin A, which is conserved across the Apicomplexa phylum, is known to critically contribute to motility, invasion and egress from infected cells. The MyoA-glideosome is anchored to the inner membrane complex (IMC) and is assumed to translocate {{the components of the}} circular junction secreted by the micronemes and rhoptries, {{to the rear of the}} parasite. Here we comprehensively characterise the class XIV myosin H (MyoH) and its associated light chains. We show that the 3 alpha-tubulin suppressor domains, located in MyoH tail, are necessary to <b>anchor</b> this <b>motor</b> to the conoid. Despite the presence of an intact MyoA-glideosome, conditional disruption of TgMyoH severely compromises parasite motility, invasion and egress from infected cells. We demonstrate that MyoH is necessary for the translocation of the circular junction from the tip of the parasite, where secretory organelles exocytosis occurs, to the apical position where the IMC starts. This study attributes for the first time a direct function of the conoid in motility and invasion, and establishes the indispensable role of MyoH in initiating the first step of motility along this unique organelle, which is subsequently relayed by MyoA to enact effective gliding and invasion...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} motor {{proteins}} attached to cellular cargos {{is widely believed}} to influence intracellular transport processes and {{may play a role}} in transport regulation. However, to date, investigating the biophysics of multiple-motor dynamics has been challenging since the number of motors responsible for cargo motion is not easily characterized. This work examines the transport properties of structurally-defined motor complexes containing two kinesin- 1 motors, from both an experimental and theoretical perspective. Motor complexes were synthesized using DNA as a molecular scaffold and engineered DNA-conjugated protein polymers as linkers to couple motors to scaffolds. After <b>anchoring</b> the <b>motor</b> complexes to a bead their dynamic properties were measured using an automated optical trapping instrument that could be used to perform both static (increasing load) and force-feedback (constant load) optical trapping experiments. Data from these experiments is compared to predictions from a microscopic transition rate model of multiple kinesin dynamics. Together, these studies uncovered that multiple kinesins typically cannot cooperate since the microtubule-bound configuration of a motor complex often prevents both kinesins from sharing cargo loads. Furthermore, multiple-motor behaviors are influenced by the fact that motor complexes display hysteretic force-velocity behaviors when applied loads change rapidly in time. Overall, such behaviors suggest the number of kinesins on a cargo will not be a key determinant of intracellular transport processes, and in turn, will not contribute appreciably to mechanisms that regulate cargo motion. However, this work also provides evidence that processive microtubule motors that are less efficient than kinesin (e. g., dynein) will cooperate productively, produce greater responses to motor number, and may therefore act as a regulator of cargo transport...|$|R

40|$|Novel periplasmic and cytoplasmic {{structural}} modules of {{the bases}} of bacterial flagella have been observed in situ and isolated using new biochemical protocols. Flagellar rotation may depend upon interactions of these modules with the intramembrane particle rings, a ubiquitous feature of flagellar bases necessary for torque generation. The outer membrane-associated basal disk of the Wolinella succinogenes polar flagellum has architecture well suited for interaction with the ring particles. However, antibody against the main W. succinogenes basal disk protein did not cross-react with flagella-enriched fractions from Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus firmus; nor have such structures been observed in these species thus far.

40|$|Background: Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of {{disability}} in the United States. Physical therapists treating patients post acute stroke use measurement tools specifically designed to measure gait and balance ability. People with sub-acute stroke typically have rapid and large changes in gait and balance ability while undergoing inpatient physical therapy. There is a lack of information about how much change in gait speed is needed in hospitalized people with sub-acute stroke to be considered an important amount. There is no information regarding the validity, and reliability of the Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) to measure balance ability in people with stroke or how much change is needed to be important to people in the sub acute phases of stroke. Objective: The purpose of this study was to 1) estimate minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for comfortable gait speed in persons who have experienced stroke and are undergoing inpatient physical therapy using 3 different anchors of change; 2) estimate minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for Tinetti POMA in persons who have experienced stroke and are undergoing inpatient physical therapy using 3 different anchors of change; 3) determine the test retest reliability and minimal detectable change (MDC) for the Tinetti POMA; and 4) explore the construct validity of the Tinetti POMA for use in people with stroke undergoing inpatient physical therapy. Study Design: This study was a prospective, longitudinal study, which followed a cohort of patients who were undergoing inpatient physical therapy post acute stroke. Methods: Participants were recruited if they had a first documented stroke and were receiving physical therapy during inpatient rehabilitation. Participants were excluded from the study if they had a history of a previous stroke, were medically unstable, were non-English speaking or were unable to walk without assistance prior to the current stroke event. Comfortable gait speed measured by a 5 -meter walk test, Tinetti POMA scores and motor Functional Independence Measure (FIMTM) scores were collected at admission to and discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. To determine test re-test reliability, two trials of comfortable gait speed were administered during the same treatment session and two trials of Tinetti POMA were performed one day apart. Global Rating of Change (GROC) scores were collected at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. A score of 6 (¡°a great deal better, an important amount¡±) on a Global Rating of Change scale and achievement of ¡Ý 17 point change on the motor FIM was used to dichotomize participants into those who had important change in walking and balance ability and those who did not. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to estimate important change values for gait speed using the three anchors. Effect Size (ES) index was used to determine the responsiveness of gait speed and the Tinetti POMA, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC 2, 1) was used to determine test re-test reliability and MDC values for gait speed and Tinetti POMA and Spearman¡¯s Rho (rs) was used to explore the construct validity of the Tinetti POMA. Results: The participants in this study were 43 people with average age of 76 ¡À 11 years who had experienced first documented stroke, began inpatient physical therapy at a mean of 8 ¡À 5 days post stroke and were discharged from the hospital at an average of 38 ¡À 11 days post stroke. The mean length of stay for all participants was 23 ¡À 11 days. MCID of comfortable gait speed was estimated to be 0. 24 m/s (AUC= 0. 644, sn/sp= 66 %/ 64 %, LR+= 1. 83, LR- 0. 54) <b>anchored</b> to <b>motor</b> FIM change scores. Test re-test reliability of gait speed was ICC 2, 1 = 0. 931 at admission and ICC 2, 1 = 0. 987 at discharge. MDC of comfortable gait speed was 0. 12 m/s at admission and 0. 08 m/s at discharge. MCID of the Tinetti POMA was 7 points (AUC= 0. 743, sn/sp= 79 %/ 64 %, LR+= 2. 18, LR-= 0. 32) <b>anchored</b> to <b>motor</b> FIM change. Test re-test reliability of the Tinetti POMA was ICC 2, 1 0. 859 and MDC was 5 points. Tinetti POMA scores were moderately correlated to motor FIM and gait speed scores at admission (rs= 0. 74 and 0. 67) and discharge (rs= 0. 60 and 0. 76) to gait speed and motor FIM scores. Conclusions: People with stroke who experience a 7 point change on the Tinetti POMA during inpatient rehabilitation are likely to experience an important change in functional mobility. The Tinetti POMA demonstrates validity and reliability to measure balance ability people with stroke. More research is needed to estimate meaningful change people with sub-acute stroke using larger cohorts with similar characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Conserved {{bacteriophage}} ATP-based DNA translocation motors {{consist of}} a multimeric packaging terminase docked onto a unique procapsid vertex containing a portal ring. DNA is translocated into the empty procapsid through the portal ring channel to high density. In vivo the T 4 phage packaging motor deals with Y- or X-structures in the replicative concatemer substrate by employing a portal-bound Holliday junction resolvase that trims and releases these DNA roadblocks to packaging. Here using dye-labeled packaging anchored 3. 7 -kb Y-DNAs or linear DNAs, we demonstrate FRET between the dye-labeled substrates and GFP portal-containing procapsids and between GFP portal and single dye-labeled terminases. We show using FRET-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy that purified T 4 gp 49 endonuclease VII resolvase can release DNA compression in vitro in prohead portal packaging <b>motor</b> <b>anchored</b> and arrested Y-DNA substrates. In addition, using active terminases labeled at the N- and C-terminal ends with a single dye molecule, we show by FRET distance of the N-terminal GFP-labeled portal protein containing prohead at 6. 9 nm from the N terminus and at 5. 7 nm from the C terminus of the terminase. Packaging with a C-terminal fluorescent terminase on a GFP portal prohead, FRET shows a reduction in distance to the GFP portal of 0. 6 nm in the arrested Y-DNA as compared with linear DNA; the reduction is reversed by resolvase treatment.

These small ships traversed the Pacific Ocean {{under their own}} power, en route to their duty station in the Solomon Islands. Along the way, five of the PGMs {{dropped out of the}} lead convoy for various reasons. PGM-3 was the last ship to drop out. For further details of PGM-3’s voyage before reaching Espiritu Santo, see USS PGM-7. USS PGM-3 arrived at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, on 14 March 1944, in the company of PGM’s 5, 7 and 8. The previous day the port engine started smoking and was immediately shut down. Upon arrival at Espiritu Santo, the engine was hoisted aboard the repair ship USS Mindanao (ARG-3) and was installed back in the PGM-3 on 4 April. PGM’s 5, 7 and 8 departed Espiritu Santo on 15 March, leaving PGM-3 behind and waiting for the other delayed PGM’s of Division One. The overhauled port engine failed again on 6 April during speed trials. By 1 May, the port engine was in working order again and on 6 May the PGM-3 departed Espiritu Santo en route to Guadalcanal, sailing as part of Task Unit 35.1.8 under the unit command of Commander Wait on board the troopship Mormachawk. Arriving at Lunga Point, Guadalcanal, on 9 May, the PGM-3 continued on to Purvis Bay, Florida Islands (known today as Nggela Islands). PGM-3 was stationed at various locations in the Florida Islands until 23 May. The ship’s log indicates that PGM’s 2, 4 and 6 were moored alongside at various times during this period.

40|$|We {{define a}} {{theoretical}} framework for the experimental study of neuromechanical control in animals, based on mathematical concepts from dynamical systems theory. This approach allows experiments, results and theoretical models to be shared among biologists, engineers and mathematicians, and is applicable {{to the study of}} control in any system, biological, artificial or simulated, provided the system exhibits stable rhythmic solutions. The basis of this framework is the notion that rhythmic systems are best expressed as periodic functions of their phase. Using phase as a predictor, an extrapolated prediction of future animal motions can be compared with the motions that occur when a perturbation is applied. Phase also serves as a succinct summary of the kinematic state, allowing the difference between the expected state as summarized by phase and the phase found in the perturbed animal [...] a “residual phase”. In the first chapter we introduce the key concepts and describe how the residual phase may be used to identify the neuromechanical control architecture of an animal. In the following two chapters we use residual phase to analyze running arthropods subjected to perturbations. In the final chapter, we extend the kinematic phase based models to the construction of a linearized approximation of animal dynamics based on Floquet theory. The Floquet model allows us to directly test the “Templates and <b>Anchors</b> Hypothesis” of <b>motor</b> control and to characterize a “template” [...] a low dimensional model of the dynamics of the animal. In chapter 2, our residual phase results from running cockroaches over a hurdle show that kinematic phase was reset, while running frequency was closely maintained to within ± 5 %. Kinematic phase changes were distributed bi-modally with modes one step (half a cycle) apart, which corresponds to a left-right reflection of the kinematic state of the body. The results decrease the plausibility of feedforward control and support the use of neural feedback for this task. Based on the results, we propose a controller that expresses the timing of the two leg tripods of the animals as two coupled phase oscillators, which in turn, may also be coupled to a master clock. In chapter 3, we analyze cockroaches which ran onto a movable cart that translated laterally. The specific impulse imposed on animals was 50 ± 4 cm/s (mean,SD), nearly twice their forward speed 25 ± 6 cm/s. Animals corrected for these perturbations by decreasing stride frequency, thereby demonstrating neural feedback. Trials fell into two classes, one class slowing down after a step (50 ms), the other after nearly three steps (130 ms). Classes were predicted by the kinematic phase of the animal at onset of perturbation. We hypothesize that the differences in response time is a consequence of the mechanical posture of the animal during perturbation, as expressed by the phase, and the coupling of neural and mechanical control. In chapter 4 we attempted to use kinematic phase methods to reconstruct the linearized (Floquet) structure of running cockroaches when viewed as nonlinear oscillators. The development of this approach required several innovations in applied mathematics and statistics. We analyzed foot and body positions of 34 animals running on a treadmill. Results showed that cockroaches running at preferred speed possess a six dimensional template with each dimension recovering by less than 50 % in a stride (P< 0. 05, 11 animals, 24 trials, 532 strides) ...|$|R
