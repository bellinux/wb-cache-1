5|$|Braithwaite {{was taken}} to Enfield Police Station and interviewed by Det Sgt Dermot McDermott and Detective Constable Colin Biggar. He was held {{for three days and}} was at first denied access to a lawyer, on the {{instruction}} of Det Ch Supt Melvin. He was interviewed eight times over the first two days, and with a lawyer present four times on the third. During the first 30 hours of his detention he had nothing to eat, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> court – as did several other suspects – that the heat in the cells was oppressive, making it difficult to breathe.|$|E
5|$|By the {{day after}} the regular session ended, Dayton had vetoed all of the budget bills passed by the legislature, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> a {{statement}} that he anticipated a shutdown would occur. Dayton did not call a special session of the legislature to further address the budget during May or June, claiming that the lack of agreement between him and Zellers and Koch would make it unproductive to do so. He remained in contact with legislative leaders, sticking by the $35.8 billion budget he proposed late in the session, with minor changes. As the end of June approached, Koch urged the governor to call a session to pass a temporary 'lights-on' bill while a final deal was reached, but he refused to answer this proposal on the grounds that extending the budget's deadline would not serve the goal of reaching a final agreement. Since the budget impasse had not ended by the end of June 30, the shutdown began at midnight of June 30–July 1, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Raised in {{a family}} {{concerned}} with social issues, in 2003 Gyllenhaal participated in an advertising campaign by the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization his entire family strongly supports. Environmentally conscious, he recycles regularly, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> {{an interview that he}} spends $400 a year to have trees planted in a Mozambique forest, partly to promote the Future Forests program. After filming The Day After Tomorrow, he flew to the Arctic to promote awareness of climate change. Gyllenhaal is the Honorary Chair of the New Eyes for the Needy Advisory Board, and has signed on to help the TV fundraiser Stand Up to Cancer. Gyllenhaal is {{on the board of directors}} for the Anti-Recidivism Coalition and volunteered in California juvenile detention centers with Scott Budnick.|$|E

25|$|Harun Khan, the {{secretary}} general of the Muslim Council of Britain, also condemned the attack. More than 130 imams condemned the attackers, refused them Islamic burials, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> a statement that the terrorists did not represent Islam.|$|E

25|$|The company {{traveled}} to Italy for filming where Tate's fluent Italian proved useful in {{communicating with the}} local crew members. A perfectionist, Polanski had little patience with the inexperienced Tate, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> an interview that one scene had required 70 takes before he was satisfied. In addition to directing, Polanski also played {{one of the main}} characters, a guileless young man who is intrigued by Tate's character and begins a romance with her.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{the piece}} contend that {{linguistic}} factors were never claimed by the assassins. According to them, Lépine had a grudge against women and feminists; Fabrikant against rival scholars; and Gill, a bullied child, targeted students <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> his notorious internet blog that Quebec was a “good place to live in.” These critics maintain that it is incorrect to consider Lépine as not having been part of Francophone, Québécois society given that, while {{he may have been}} estranged from his Algerian-born father, he was raised mainly by his French-speaking, Québécoise mother, whose name he had adopted (he was born Gamil Gharbi). Moreover, they note that both Fabrikant and Gill targeted anglophones, not francophones.|$|E

25|$|Local D.C. {{businessmen}} {{asked the}} General Services Administration (GSA) {{to tear down}} the building and sell the land so a private parking garage could be built on the centrally located site. Legislation for this purpose was introduced in Congress in the waning days of the 82nd United States Congress in 1952, but did not pass. The legislation encountered resistance from a few members of Congress, architects, and the influential Committee of 100 on the Federal City (a private business group dedicated to promoting the D.C. economy). GSA reversed course, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> June 1956 it no longer wanted to demolish the building. However, the agency said it would continue to use it for federal office space (which was in short supply) until the Civil Service Commission vacated the structure. On March 21, 1958, Congress unanimously passed legislation authorizing the transfer of the building to the Smithsonian for a national art museum. President Dwight Eisenhower signed the legislation a few days later.|$|E
