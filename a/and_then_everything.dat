25|$|Tàijíquán's martial aspect {{relies on}} {{sensitivity}} to the opponent's movements and centre of gravity dictating appropriate responses. Effectively affecting the opponent's centre of gravity immediately upon contact, is trained as {{the primary goal of}} the martial t‘ai-chi ch‘üan student. The sensitivity needed to capture the centre is acquired over thousands of hours of first yin (slow, repetitive, meditative, low-impact) and then later adding yang (realistic, active, fast, high-impact) martial training through taolu (forms), tuishou (pushing hands), and sanshou (sparring). Tàijíquán trains in three basic ranges: close, medium and long, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> in between. Pushes and open-hand strikes are more common than punches, and kicks are usually to the legs and lower torso, never higher than the hip, depending on style. The fingers, fists, palms, sides of the hands, wrists, forearms, elbows, shoulders, back, hips, knees, and feet are commonly used to strike, with strikes to the eyes, throat, heart, groin, and other acupressure points trained by advanced students. Chin na, which are joint traps, locks, and breaks are also used. Most tàijíquán teachers expect their students to thoroughly learn defensive or neutralizing skills first, and a student will have to demonstrate proficiency with them before offensive skills will be extensively trained.|$|E
500|$|Computer-generated imagery {{was used}} in much of [...] "Days Gone Bye", {{particularly}} when Rick encounters a legless walker. [...] "The woman was wearing basically blue stockings <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> was cleaned out. There is an alarming amount of CGI in the pilot episode and in the whole show, and you would never know it," [...] articulated Robert Kirkman. Kirkman felt that Stargate Studios, which was chosen by producers to edit the pilot episode, did a splendid job. He stated: [...] "There's a shot where Rick is riding off on the horse and his hat actually blew off, and they really liked that shot, and so they had Stargate go in and digitally put the hat back on his head." ...|$|E
500|$|Another spoof was of {{a musical}} {{detailing}} the life of Bessie Bunter, entitled Bessie! The musical starts as an Andrew Lloyd Webber parody with the setting of a girl's private school but they've [...] included {{issues such as the}} Spanish Civil War and the McCarthy era. On being asked about Bessie's fatness, the producer (Sir Dave) replies [...] "it is a sort of mental fatness". The lead actress, Carla, belts out in rehearsals one of the songs, [...] "One Day", despite insisting she has [...] "pneumonia". She says to prepare for the role she starts with the bra <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> falls into place. Later, Bessie! is rewritten completely and the previous cast are sacked: it is, after all, a musical about [...] "a big fat girl". Meanwhile, Carla is crying and being comforted by her colleagues, but further upset by Sir Dave telling her to [...] "get the **** out of here will you Carla, we don't really want snot all over the plush love" [...] In this rewritten part of Bessie, she is played by Victoria Wood who sings an impossibly glamorous and upbeat number. However, she complains at the end that [...] "you're {{going to have to change}} this floor".|$|E
50|$|In 1869, Harriet {{gave birth}} to an illegitimate daughter, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> confessed <b>everything</b> to Sir Charles, who was enraged. His {{offended}} servants had compiled diaries of the affairs.|$|R
5000|$|.....<b>and</b> <b>then</b> they remixed <b>everything</b> (2013, Birds Robe, CD/Digital Remix album for sleepmakeswaves ...and so we {{destroyed}} everything) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{relation}} [...] "being isomorphic" [...] satisfies all the axioms of an equivalence relation. If f is an isomorphism {{between two}} groups G <b>and</b> H, <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> {{that is true}} about G that is only related to the group structure can be translated via f into a true ditto statement about H, and vice versa.|$|R
500|$|According to the {{publications}} Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture and Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights, {{it was the}} controversial lesbian outing of the main character (played by Ellen DeGeneres) in the sitcom Ellen in 1997 that {{paved the way for}} Patty's coming-out in this episode, as well as for many other gay characters on other television shows. In his book Queers in American Popular Culture, Jim Elledge noted that unlike many episodes of The Simpsons that go through a situation <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> returns to normal during the ending, this one does not. He commented that the staff of the show could have made Patty heterosexual again {{at the end of the}} episode and leave it how it was before by having her marry Leslie. Instead, they ended it in a way that could potentially be experienced as distasteful to the heteronormative audience by having Patty exclaim [...] "Hell no! I like girls!" [...] to Leslie's marriage proposal. The author also noted that it is possible the Simpsons staff chose Patty to come out as gay instead of a male character because lesbians were [...] "traditionally considered more acceptable" [...] on television. She did, however, not [...] "adhere to the eroticized male lesbian fantasy or fit into the loveable, asexual guise of the comedy lesbian" [...] that had previously been seen on shows such as Ellen. Instead, Patty is [...] "rude, crude, and not ashamed of declaring her sexual preferences", and this could make her unpalatable to some viewers according to Elledge.|$|E
2500|$|A host {{of local}} campesinos went on record to journalists from The Guardian about this {{phenomenon}} as well. Melanio Moscoso, of La Higuera stated [...] "we pray to him, {{we are so}} proud he had died here, in La Higuera, fighting for us. We feel him so close", while Freddy Vallejos, of Vallegrande, proclaimed [...] "we have a faith, a confidence in Che. When I go to bed and when I wake up, I first pray to God and then I pray to Che – <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>everything</b> is all right. Che's presence here is a positive force. I feel it in my skin, I have faith that always, at all times, he has an eye on us." [...] Remi Calzadilla, a resident of Pucara, claimed that praying to Che had helped him regain the ability to walk, adding that [...] "now every time I speak to Che I {{feel a strong force}} inside of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whenever {{shooting}} {{was taking place}} there was pressure on everyone involved, but the cast had a positive experience. Norton said that normally in movie production half the people can [...] "check out" [...] due to repetitive aspects, but during the shooting of Birdman [...] "everybody's on, the whole thing, and you're all on pins and needles because you're all relying on forty other people not to drop the ball." [...] Because of this, Stone said the director {{was able to get}} the best out of the cast, saying [...] " [...] creates this sort of fury in you, and then you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didn't even know you had". Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere [...] "felt emblematic of how it feels onstageat least my long-time memories from long ago". Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as [...] "wonderful", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived and then [...] "the magic happens with you, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> leaves you, and everything's silent". Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved. Norton said [...] "I've never, ever been on a set where every day ended with an enormous, authentic sort of cheer at having made it. You're waiting for the scream from [...] and everybody was genuinely excited." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Cheyne, very slowly, [...] "there {{was just}} one faint hope that now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> brightened <b>everything</b> for me. I thought you might change. Perhaps I was foolish--but that hope would have {{meant so much to}} me. I could not let it go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did I {{never tell}} you? The new {{king of the}} Cannibal Islands, just like your European ones, ran away, and would neither govern himself nor let any one else govern; so one morning his ministers, getting impatient, ate him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> asked my advice. I {{recommended}} them to put his mother on the throne, who, being old and tough, would run less danger; <b>and</b> since <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> has gone on smoothly as anywhere else.' ...|$|R
50|$|Those {{that grew}} up in Bergen after World War II could hardly avoid hearing the fairy tale about Lea, a fellow citizen, who became the richest ship owner in the world, married an Indian princess, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> lost <b>everything</b> <b>and</b> settled with his princess in some distant corner of SSognefjord.|$|R

60|$|So Serge {{sat at his}} books. It got {{later and}} the house grew still. The noise of the {{students}} below ceased <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> was quiet.|$|E
60|$|Romola put the letters, {{along with}} the crucifix, within the bosom of her mantle, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> felt that <b>everything</b> was done. She was ready now to depart.|$|R
50|$|Brian Chase {{would play}} lots of {{different}} drumbeats and we'd record it, chop it up <b>and</b> <b>then</b> make a groove loop out of it. Nick Zinner would then just jam to it, and we'd {{come up with an}} interesting rhythm part. Karen O would listen to that {{and come up with a}} vocal melody <b>and</b> <b>then</b> suddenly <b>everything</b> would fall into place.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{will let}} him go {{when they find out}} the truth, I suppose. But those fellows blunder so, I would never trust them. He will get some sharp lawyer to look into it; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> perhaps <b>everything</b> will come out. I shall go and see him to-morrow. But there is nothing further to be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any time," [...] {{continued}} Herr Heinrich, [...] "some one may say, 'Let us do this thing,' or 'Let us do that thing,' <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> is disarranged.|$|E
60|$|Then, asserting {{itself as}} real at once {{over all the}} sounds her mind had imagined, came a stir in the thicket, then a {{vigorous}} movement. There was a snap. The reeds crashed heavily, once, twice, thrice, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> was still save a measured swishing. She heard a low tremulous growl, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> was still again. The stillness lengthened--would it never end? She held her breath; she bit her lips to stop screaming. Then something scuttled through the undergrowth. Her scream was involuntary. She did not hear the answering yell from the mound.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} how it came about exactly, but {{gradually}} we appeared to melt down and run together, conversationally speaking, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> went along as comfortably as clockwork.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the evil}} effects of the {{perpetual}} jesting that prevailed at York Fort was, that [...] "soft" [...] (in other words, straightforward, unsuspecting) youths had to undergo a long process of learning-by-experience: first, believing <b>everything,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> doubting <b>everything,</b> ere they arrived at that degree of sophistication which enabled them to distinguish between truth and falsehood.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom doesn't seem to know. Alton, he thinks, must be beaten, but he {{told him}} he meant holding on until the last dollar had gone. After all, I can't help feeling sorry for him. It must {{be hard to get}} oneself {{crippled}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> lose <b>everything,</b> while Tom declares there was nothing in that other affair about the girl." ...|$|R
25|$|Unlike the few Apple {{viruses that}} had come before, such as the Elk Cloner virus, that were {{essentially}} annoying but did no damage, the Festering Hate series of viruses was extremely destructive, spreading to all system files it could find on the host computer (hard drive, floppy and system memory) <b>and</b> <b>then</b> destroying <b>everything</b> when it could no longer find any uninfected files.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Dryfoos {{might change}} his mind in the night, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> would be lost. They must go to him instantly, {{and tell him that}} they accepted; they must {{telegraph}} him.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he heard}} {{the voice of a}} woman, the rustle of unseen garments. [...] "It is Ostrog!" [...] he heard her say. A little bell rang fitfully, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> was still again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Edna, [...] "the same as ever. But it {{cannot be}} for long. As {{soon as the}} captain has made his arrangements, we shall hear from him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> will be told." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as the}} {{carriage}} stopped a cloth was thrown over her head. She was lifted out and carried into the palace, through long passages <b>and</b> up stairs; <b>then</b> those who carried her set her on her feet and retired. Other hands took her and led her forward till the cloth was taken off her head, and she found herself surrounded, by women, who regarded her with glances of mixed curiosity <b>and</b> hostility. <b>Then</b> <b>everything</b> seemed to swim round, and she fainted.|$|R
50|$|In Irish mythology, Tethra of the Fomorians ruled Mag Mell after {{dying in}} the Second Battle of Mag Tuiredh. After the battle, his sword, Orna, was taken by Ogma <b>and</b> it <b>then</b> recounted <b>everything</b> it had done.|$|R
50|$|Mighty Man {{joins the}} {{super-powered}} team of bounty hunters called Freak Force {{but did not}} reveal her identity to them, or the Dragon, for some time. The actual identity of Mighty Man was a subject of much talk in the letter column. Her full origin appeared in Freak Force #6. There, she defeats a powerful opponent in her human form <b>and</b> <b>then</b> explains <b>everything</b> to Superpatriot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oo-oo!" [...] groaned Bert {{at every}} slash, and shrank closer {{into the bushes}} and became very still. Presently came a sound of shots from the town, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> was quiet, everything, even the hospital.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>everything</b> broke loose. Somebody got {{me by the}} collar, {{somebody}} else hit {{me on the head}} with a parasol, and {{somebody else}} kicked me in the ribs. Everybody talked and shouted at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take in sail," [...] {{said the}} skipper shortly; {{and leaving the}} helm a bit, ran to assist him. Five minutes later the Swallow was {{alongside}} of the wharf, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>everything</b> made fast and snug, the two men turned and faced each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} at this moment," [...] I replied. [...] "But {{what does it matter}} where or how, for the present, she lives? She'll marry infallibly, marry early, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>then</b> will change." ...|$|R
2500|$|Reuben Wu {{said about}} the process of making a new Ladytron album: [...] "We start writing individually. We've never really lived in the same city before. We've always been {{geographically}} apart. [...] It's always been first as individuals, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> reviewing <b>everything</b> together, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> working on each other's songs. That's how we've always worked. And it goes well with how we make music. We do get together down the line and in the studio when we start fleshing out the tracks".|$|R
50|$|The Green Lama stories {{display a}} {{sympathetic}} and relatively knowledgeable portrayal of Buddhism, {{both in the}} text of the stories and in numerous footnotes. From Crossen's own comments, in his foreword to Robert Weinberg's 1976 reprint of the first Green Lama story, it is clear that this was not proselytism on his part, but simply because he wanted to create a Tibetan Buddhist character <b>and</b> <b>then</b> read <b>everything</b> he could find on the subject.|$|R
