5|$|Black {{honeyeaters}} feed on nectar, {{and have}} a long curved bill to reach the base of tubular flowers {{such as those of}} the emu bush. They also take insects on the wing, and regularly eat charcoal left behind at campfires. The male engages in <b>a</b> <b>soaring</b> song flight in the mating season, but contributes little to nest building and incubation. Both sexes feed and care for the young. While the population appears to be decreasing, the black honeyeater is sufficiently numerous and widespread to be considered least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{development}} of both, {{residential and commercial}} rooftop solar as well as utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies. In the early 2000s, the adoption of feed-in tariffs—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—lead to {{a high level of}} investment security and to <b>a</b> <b>soaring</b> number of PV deployments in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Director of the United States Mint Samuel Moore {{resigned}} his post, and Robert M. Patterson {{assumed the}} position. Shortly after, Patterson began {{an attempt to}} redesign the nation's coinage. After Mint Chief Engraver William Kneass suffered a stroke later that year, Christian Gobrecht was hired as an engraver. On August 1, Patterson {{wrote a letter to}} Philadelphia artist Thomas Sully laying out his plans for the dollar coin. He also asked Titian Peale to create a design for the coin. Sully created an obverse design depicting a seated representation of Liberty and Peale a reverse depicting <b>a</b> <b>soaring</b> bald eagle, which were converted into coin designs by Gobrecht. After the designs were created and trials struck, production of the working dies began in September 1836.|$|E
50|$|To support {{interaction}} with vision systems and non-symbolic reasoning, Soar has its Spatial Visual System (SVS). SVS internally represents {{the world as}} a scene graph, a collection of objects and component subobjects each with spatial properties such as shape, location, pose, relative position, and scale. <b>A</b> <b>Soar</b> agent using SVS can create filters to automatically extract features and relations from its scene graph, which are then added to working memory. In addition, <b>a</b> <b>Soar</b> agent can add structures to SVS and use it for mental imagery. For example, an agent can create a hypothetical object in SVS at a given location and query to see if it collides with any perceived objects.|$|R

Early plans called for upgrading and increasing the number of cells so that sustained electric flight could be made, using only solar energy and not battery power, but these plans were never completed.|$|E

25|$|A player may {{not make}} a move if the {{resulting}} position {{is one that has}} previously occurred in the game with the same player to move. This is called repetition (千日手 sennichite).

Such a pass move leaves the position unchanged, but it does not violate the repetition rule, as it will now be the turn of the other player to move.

However, evidence from historical chu shogi mating problems suggests that this prohibition does not apply to a player who is in check.|$|E
25|$|In {{principle}} {{a player}} {{may not make}} a move if the resulting position {{is one that has}} previously occurred in the game with the same player to move.
