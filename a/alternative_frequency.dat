5000|$|The {{previous}} sections treated dispersion as an [...] "assistant" [...] to selection, and {{it became}} apparent that the two work well together. In quantitative genetics, selection is usually examined in this [...] "biometrical" [...] fashion, but the changes in the means (as monitored by ΔG) reflect the changes in allele and genotype frequencies beneath this surface. Referral to the section on [...] "Genetic drift" [...] brings to mind that it also effects changes in allele and genotype frequencies, and associated means; and that this is the companion aspect to the dispersion considered here ("the other side of the same coin"). However, these two forces of frequency change are seldom in concert, and may often act contrary to each other. One (selection) is [...] "directional" [...] being driven by selection pressure acting on the phenotype: the other (genetic drift) is driven by [...] "chance" [...] at fertilization (binomial probabilities of gamete samples). If the two tend towards the same allele frequency, their [...] "coincidence" [...] is the probability of obtaining that frequencies sample in the genetic drift: the likelihood of their being [...] "in conflict", however, is the sum of probabilities of all the <b>alternative</b> <b>frequency</b> samples. In extreme cases, a single syngamy sampling can undo what selection has achieved, and the probabilities of it happening are available. It is important to keep this in mind. However, genetic drift resulting in sample frequencies {{similar to those of the}} selection target does not lead to so drastic an outcome—instead slowing progress towards selection goals.|$|E

40|$|Objective – To {{investigate}} the exposure-response relationships between <b>alternative</b> <b>frequency</b> weightings of hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) and neck and upper limb musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in {{a cohort of}} HTV workers. Methods – In a 3 -year longitudinal study, the occurrence of neck and upper limb MSDs were investigated in 249 HTV workers and 138 control men. In the HTV workers, MSDs were related to measures of daily vibration exposure {{expressed in terms of}} 8 -hour energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration magnitude [A(8) ]. To calculate A(8), the acceleration magnitudes of vibration were weighted by means of four <b>alternative</b> <b>frequency</b> weightings of HTV. The associations between MSDs, individual characteristics, physical work load other than vibration and psychological strain were also investigated. Results – The occurrence of upper limb MSDs was greater in the HTV workers than in the controls. After adjustment for potential confounders, the occurrence of elbow/forearm and wrist/hand MSDs increased with the increase of vibration exposure. A measure of model selection did not reveal any substantial difference in the performance of the <b>alternative</b> <b>frequency</b> weightings of HTV for the prediction of neck and upper limb MSDs. In the study population, age, hard physical work load and poor psychological well-being were associated with both neck and upper limb MSDs.

40|$|In this dissertation, the {{classical}} problems of testing goodness-of-fit of uniformity and parametric families are reconsidered. A new omnibus test for these problems is proposed and investigated. The new test statistics are {{a combination of}} Bayesian and score test ideas. More precisely, singletons that contain only one more parameter than the null describing departures from the null model are introduced. A Laplace approximation to the posterior probability of the null hypothesis is used, leading to test statistics that are weighted sums of exponentiated squared Fourier coefficients. The weights depend on prior probabilities and the Fourier coefficients are estimated based on score tests. Exponentiation of Fourier components leads to tests that can be exceptionally powerful against high <b>frequency</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Comprehensive simulations show that the new tests have good power against high <b>frequency</b> <b>alternatives</b> and perform comparably to some other well-known omnibus tests at low <b>frequency</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Asymptotic distributions of the proposed test are derived under null and alternative hypotheses.

[...] - Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from buccal swabs taken from 300 unrelated individuals. Extracted DNA was first quantified using RT-PCR, and then amplified at the HV- 1 region of the mtDNA with adequate primers. Resulting amplicons were sequenced by Sanger sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer. Relying on the data thus acquired, primers specific for the chosen hotspots were designed, and samples were typed using SBE method for each SNP in single reactions. After that, designed primers were mixed in multiplex reaction mixes, and samples were typed with those. Created mixed samples from two different DNAs were tested with both singleplex and multiplex reactions. [...] - Results: SNP hotspots and their <b>alternative</b> allele <b>frequencies</b> were determined. Taking these in consideration 33 mtDNA types were observed, with Upper Confidence Interval values and Likelihood Ratios calculated for each type.

This paper compares eight frequency weightings {{that might be}} used to supplement or replace Wh. The comparison is based on a data from two databases, one containing over 7200 measured hand-arm vibration (HAV) spectra {{from a wide range of}} industrial machines the other recording exposure history and injury for workers referred to the Health and Safety Laboratory. Acceleration spectra from the machinery database are analysed to give weighted values for the <b>alternative</b> <b>frequency</b> weightings. These weighted values are compared and then used to estimate a set of alternative lifetime vibration dose values for subjects in the referral database. Statistical comparison of these lifetime dose values against assessments of hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) and sensorineural HAVS prevalence suggests that values based the two weightings Wh and Wh 50 lp (the Wh weighing low-pass filtered at 50 Hz) provide the strongest indicators for developing these injuries. For vascular HAVS there was no clear evidence to advocate any individual frequency weighting. For all injury categories the strongest relationships were for the first power of acceleration magnitude...|$|E

To explore the potential of a commercial mobile satellite system (MSS) beyond the horizon of the first generation, using technologies of the 1990 's and to assist MSAT-X in directing its efforts, a conceptual design has been performed for a second-generation system to be launched around the mid- 1990 's. The design goal is to maximize the number of satellite channels and/or minimize the overall life-cycle cost, subject to the constraint of utilizing a commercial satellite bus with minimum modifications. To provide an optimal design, a series of trade-offs are performed, including antenna sizing, feed configurations, and interference analysis. Interference is a serious problem for MSAT and often an overlapping feed design is required to reduce interbeam interference.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the exposure-response relationship for the vascular component of the hand-arm vibration syndrome, called vibration-induced white finger (VWF). Over the past two decades, several epidemiological studies have shown a poor agreement between the risk for VWF observed in various occupational groups and that predicted by models included in annexes to International Standard ISO 5349 (ISO 5349 : 1986, ISO 5349 - 1 : 2001). Either overestimation or underestimation of the occurrence of VWF have been reported by investigators. It has been argued that the current ISO frequency-weighting curve for hand-transmitted vibration, which assumes that vibration-induced adverse health effects are inversely related to the frequency of vibration between 16 and 1250 Hz, may be unsuitable for the assessment of VWF. To investigate this issue, a prospective cohort study was carried out to explore the performance of four <b>alternative</b> <b>frequency</b> weightings for hand-transmitted vibration to predict the incidence of VWF in groups of forestry and stone workers. The findings of this study suggested that measures of vibration exposure which give relatively more weight to intermediate and high frequency vibration produced better predictions of the incidence of VWF than that obtained with the frequency weighting currently recommended in International Standard ISO 5349 - 1 : 2001...|$|E
