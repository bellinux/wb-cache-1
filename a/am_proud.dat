5|$|According to {{the view}} that is {{widespread}} among the Russian music public, I am associated with the party that is antagonistic to the one living Russian composer I love and value above all others—Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.... In a word, despite our different musical identities, it would seem we are following a single path; and I, for my part, <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> to have such a fellow traveler.... Lyadov and Glazunov are also numbered among my opponents, yet I sincerely love and value their talent.|$|E

25|$|I am {{honestly}} {{against the}} social intermingling of Negroes and Whites but I hold nothing personal against the Negroes as a race. They {{should be proud}} of their God-given heritage just as I <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> of mine. I believe Negroes should have the right , and in Mississippi too—when their main purpose is not to put me out of office and when they won't try to besmirch the reputation of my state.|$|E

50|$|Writing in 1986, Stürmer {{complained that}} recent opinion polls showed 80% of Americans <b>were</b> <b>proud</b> of being American, that 50% of the British <b>were</b> <b>proud</b> of being British, and 20% of West Germans <b>were</b> <b>proud</b> of being German, and argued until {{national}} pride could be restored, West Germany could not play an effective {{part in the}} Cold War.|$|R

And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian {{community}} as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May 1901, Ament {{addressing}} {{guests at}} the third annual Asiatic Society of America dinner in New York, again defended himself and his fellow missionaries:The missionaries in China, of whom I <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> to be one, represent a class of American citizens whose work in the Orient have been purposefully misrepresented....The missionaries' words have been twisted, wring interpretations made. The persistency of work like this can only justify {{the feeling that the}} root of this un-American warfare is due, not so much to what is seen or known of the deeds of missionaries, but the opposition to Christianity itself. The purpose was fixed before China was reached at all, and this murderous spirit stops not at injustice to individuals.|$|E
25|$|I <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> of what I did {{and would}} do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E

25|$|The {{county board}} called an {{emergency}} {{meeting to discuss}} {{the recommendations of the}} arbitration and especially the recommendation from Mulvey that Holland should resign. By 16 February, uncertainty had emerged over the status of the strike. While the county board and Holland met to discuss the issues, an expected vote by the county board to remove Holland was never called. Holland meanwhile issued a statement that didn't indicate if he had stepped down and stated that he was neutral saying: I am my own man and I <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> to be a Cork football man. Holland said the claim that six people had refused the job before him was false and there was no threat of strike when he took the job. However, a statement in support of the strike had been issued by the Gaelic Players Association on 13 November 2007, a week before Holland took the job.|$|E
25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E

500|$|In {{accordance}} with his mother's wishes, the infant Spiro was baptized an Episcopalian, rather than into the Greek Orthodox Church of his father. Nevertheless, Agnew senior was the dominant figure within the family, {{and a strong}} influence on his son. When in 1969 Baltimore's Greek community endowed a scholarship in Theodore Agnew's name, Spiro Agnew, by then vice president, told the gathering: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> to say that I {{grew up in the}} light of my father.

RB Leipzig ended the tournament in third place with five points, whereas Benfica finished bottom of the table on two points. Hasenhüttl was delighted with his team's performance, telling reporters: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> of how our young players performed. The constant regaining of possession was key to the win." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success. Lords later commented: [...] "The problem with that album {{was that it was}} ahead of its time. Electronica was just starting to happen. Moby was just starting to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. I think if it had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. I <b>am</b> <b>proud</b> of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E
