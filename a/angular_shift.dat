50|$|If the {{stator winding}} is {{connected}} to the primary phase, the total voltage seen from the neutral (N) will be the sum of the voltages at both windings rotor and stator. Translating this to electric phasors, both phasors are connected. However, there is an <b>angular</b> <b>shifting</b> of α between them. Since α can be freely chosen between π, both phasors can be added or subtracted, so all the values in between are attainable. The primary and secondary are not isolated. Also, the ratio of the magnitudes of voltages between rotor and stator is constant; the resultant voltage varies owing to the <b>angular</b> <b>shifting</b> of the series winding induced voltage.|$|R

But the Earth’s motion through that inertial frame will move the telescope a small amount during the time it takes the light to pass through the telescope, causing an apparent <b>angular</b> <b>shift</b> in the star's position. Since this effect is due to the Earth’s motion through the inertial frame, the effect will have a yearly periodicity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{longitudinal}} and transverse <b>angular</b> <b>shifts</b> in the refraction of a paraxial beam {{are calculated}} {{by using the}} plane-wave decomposition of the amplitude of the electric field distribution of the incident beam. The transmission coefficients are expanded into powers of the spatial frequencies. In this paper these spatial frequencies need to be within the paraxial approach around the main direction of propagation of the beam. The beam {{is characterized by the}} moments of the square of the modulus of the angular spectrum of the electric field. To compute them, it is necessary to calculate how the spatial frequencies of the beam change along the refraction. The state of polarization of the beam is also included in the analysis. Numerical results are obtained to show the dependence of the <b>angular</b> <b>shifts</b> on the polarization’s state and the symmetry of the beam...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePatterns {{formed by}} {{centimeter}} scale bubbles {{on the free}} surface of a viscous liquid are investigated in a cylindrical container. These bubbles emerge periodically at the surface and {{interact with each other}} in the central zone. Their radial emission, due to interaction and radial surface flow, leads to the formation of a variety of patterns. Different star-like and spiral patterns appear spontaneously by increasing the bubble emergence frequency. It is found that these patterns are due to a constant <b>angular</b> <b>shift</b> in the bubble emission direction. Measurements of this <b>angular</b> <b>shift</b> show a supercritical bifurcation accompanied by a transition from a pattern of two opposed straight arms to spiral patterns. By applying the tools and concepts from the study of leaf arrangement in botany (phyllotaxis), the recognized patterns and the mechanism of the pattern formation are discussed. Close similarities to the leaf arrangement are found in the behavior of the <b>angular</b> <b>shift</b> and the patterns.

40|$|Tool {{actions are}} {{characterized}} by a transformation between movements and their resulting consequences in the environment. This transformation {{has to be taken}} into account when tool actions are planned and executed. We investigated how <b>angular</b> <b>shift</b> transformations between circling movements and their visual feedback affect the coordination of this feedback with visual events in the environment. We used a task that required participants to coordinate the visual feedback of a circular hand movement (presented on the right side of a screen) with a circling stimulus (presented on the left side of a screen). Four stimulus-visual feedback relations were instructed: same or different rotations of stimulus and visual feedback, either in same or different y-directions. Visual speed was varied in 3 levels (0. 8 Hz, 1 Hz, and 1. 2 Hz). The movement-visual feedback relation was manipulated using 8 angular shifts: (- 180 °, - 135 °, - 90 °, - 45 °, 0 °, 45 °, 90 °, and 135 °). Participants were not able to perform the different rotation/different y-direction pattern, but instead fell into the different rotation/same y-direction pattern. The different rotation/same y-direction pattern and the same rotation/same y-direction pattern were performed equally well, performance was worse in the same rotation/different y-direction pattern. Best performance was observed with angular shifts 0 ° and - 45 ° and performance declined with larger angular shifts. Further, performance was better with negative angular shifts than with positive angular shifts. Participants did not fully take the <b>angular</b> <b>shift</b> transformation into account: when the angular shifts were negative the visual feedback was more in advance, and when angular shifts were positive the visual feedback was less in advance of the stimulus than in 0 ° <b>angular</b> <b>shift.</b> In conclusion, the presence and the magnitude of <b>angular</b> <b>shift</b> transformations affect performance. Internal models do not fully take the shift transformation into account...|$|E
