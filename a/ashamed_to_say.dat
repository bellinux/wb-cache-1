Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am <b>ashamed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
500|$|Austen {{was feeling}} unwell by early 1816, but ignored the warning signs. By {{the middle of}} that year, her decline was unmistakable, and she began a slow, {{irregular}} deterioration. The majority of biographers rely on Dr. Vincent Cope's 1964 retrospective diagnosis and list her cause of death as Addison's disease, although her final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkin's lymphoma. When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his wife, effectively disinheriting his relatives, she suffered a relapse, writing, [...] "I am <b>ashamed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the shock of my Uncle's Will brought on a relapse... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves".|$|E
500|$|Beatrice {{left home}} when Mills {{was nine years}} old, which left her, her older brother Shane, and her younger sister, Fiona, {{in the care of}} their father. Mills said that her father once threw her brother against a window for making a mess on the carpet with crayons. The window broke and her brother had to be taken to hospital, where their father {{explained}} that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: [...] "Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so we turned to shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties. I'm not <b>ashamed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that we were forced to steal because when you are a young child, you'd rather do that than face a beating from your father". (Their father disputed his daughters' allegations that he was violent towards them, later releasing home movies of family holidays in Wales, showing Mills playing happily.) ...|$|E

The human drama, the play of a woman's great valor and an artist's truth, her own, far superseded, and even eclipsed, to my eye, the performance of my own play." [...] The director remarked that her performance exceeded Jessica Tandy and Vivien Leigh's in the role. However, the initial reviews had decided the production's fate, and the producer pulled the plug after 15 performances.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} season, the series saw a {{generally}} positive reception. New York Post critic Linda Stasi praised the series, particularly the acting of Cranston and Paul, stating [...] "Cranston and Paul are so good, it's astounding. I'd say {{the two have}} created great chemistry, but I'm <b>ashamed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> such a cheap thing." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today also praised Cranston and Paul, exclaiming [...] "There is humor in the show, mostly in Walt's efforts to impose scholarly logic on the business and on his idiot apprentice, a role Paul plays very well. But even their scenes lean toward the suspenseful, as the duo learns that killing someone, even in self-defense, is ugly, messy work." ...|$|E

[...] Also, Kraybill and others observed that genuine Amish people wouldn't appear on camera, as their faith forbids it. Such criticisms include: [...] "To call these shows documentaries is a fraudulent lie," [...] and [...] "show is just sort of {{an example of the}} foolishness and stupidity and lies—misrepresentations I should say—that are promoted the Amish in television...These production crews should be <b>ashamed</b> of trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that represents Amish life." ...|$|R

2500|$|The poem's {{popularity}} came, in part, {{from the}} ambiguity over its race-related message. The narrator {{implies that the}} cheating of the Chinese man was no worse {{than that of the}} white man, but the irony was too subtle for general readers. The message matched one Harte had written elsewhere in exposing white people's hypocrisy. As he wrote later, the Chinese [...] "did as the Caucasian did in all respects, and, being more patient and frugal, did it a little better". Harte repeatedly opposed anti-Asian discrimination since as early as 1863, both privately and publicly. In 1866, for example, he wrote a letter defending the [...] "peaceable citizens" [...] of San Francisco's Chinatown who were [...] "patient under abuse, and that patience, I am <b>ashamed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> they have to exercise continually in California". After the discovery of a murdered woman in Chinatown, whose cause of death was uncertain, Harte wrote, [...] "as her head was caved in it is thought by some physicians that she died of galloping Christianity of the malignant California type".|$|E

2500|$|The UK music press warmly {{received}} the album, Nick Kent in the NME confessing [...] "I'd be <b>ashamed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I didn't love it" [...] describing the music as one chord short of [...] "the strongest high energy cosmic hubcap {{this side of}} the Metal Zone". Andrew Means of Melody Maker commented that [...] "It's not melody and it's not harmony, and it's not really rhythm... it is ambiguity. It is the spaced out slipstream, the rushing, gurgling torrent of weightless sound that first turns the circle of mental pictures, associations and impressions picked out from space, time and earth... The listener is as much a traveller as the musician." [...] Sounds Martin Hayman meanwhile described the music as [...] "the bass and drums batter on with unflagging pace, synthesisers swirl and whistle around the thunderous block riffs whose endless repetition generates that numbed hypnosis, tuneless and menacing voices incant largely incomprehensible lyrics. This is not to knock Hawkwind: the sound they are getting is thicker, fuller, more convincing than ever before. [...] Its total effect is pretty devastating, but the means by which the effect is achieved is no revolution in sound." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evanescence {{performed}} [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] at the Webster Hall in New York City in September 2003. During the performance, Lee wore an Alice in Wonderland dress {{covered with}} scrawled words, including the words Dirty, Useless, Psycho and Slut. She explained her reasons for wearing the dress. On her previous visit to New York City, Lee had met a DJ {{from the radio}} station K-Rock, who had made what she called horrible comments about the pleasure he had derived from the picture of her face {{on the cover of}} Fallen. She had felt too <b>ashamed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything, so she decided to respond through the dress, which represented something innocent that had been tainted. The band performed [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] during their concert at The Great Saltair on October 25, 2006. Lee wore red and black, with a skirt. She was called a magnet of the night by the Deseret News reviewer Larry D. Curtis. Other performances of the song were in Magna, Utah in October 2006, and the Air Canada Centre in January 2007. The band also played the song at a secret gig in New York City on November 4, 2009. During their concert at War Memorial Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee on August 17, 2011, Evanescence performed [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] to promote their third album, Evanescence. They also performed the song during the 2011 Rock in Rio festival on October 2, 2011. While reviewing a concert by the band, Caroline Sullivan wrote [...] "Slowly raising her arms during Bring Me to Life's thunderous, strobe-lit fade-out, she's missing only a chariot." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 25, 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an American-born Israeli {{member of}} Kach, {{who in his}} youth was a JDL activist, opened fire on Muslims {{kneeling}} in prayer at the revered Cave of the Patriarchs mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron, killing 29 worshippers and injuring 125 before {{he ran out of}} ammunition and was himself killed. The attack set off riots and protests throughout the West Bank and 19 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli Defense Forces within 48 hours of the massacre. On its website, the JDL described the massacre as a [...] "preventative measure against yet another Arab attack on Jews" [...] and noted that they [...] "do not consider his assault to qualify under the label of terrorism". Furthermore, they noted that [...] "we teach that violence is never a good solution but is unfortunately sometimes necessary as a last resort when innocent lives are threatened; we therefore view Dr. Goldstein as a martyr in Judaism's protracted struggle against Arab terrorism. And we are not <b>ashamed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Goldstein was a charter member of the Jewish Defense League." [...] In a similar attack nearly twelve years earlier, on April 11, 1982, an American-born JDL member and immigrant to Israel, Allan H. Goodman, opened fire with his military-issue rifle at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the sacred Temple Mount in Jerusalem, killing one Palestinian Arab and injuring four others. The 1982 shooting sparked an Arab riot in which another Palestinian was shot dead by the police. In 1983, Goodman was sentenced by an Israeli court to life in prison (which usually means 25 years in Israel); he was released after serving 15 1/2 years on the condition of returning to the United States.|$|E
