As Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew), Ben, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), Owen, Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) address the injuries, Meredith realizes she is unable to speak. They soon {{discover}} that she's lost her hearing {{as a result of the}} beating she endured. The episode then draws into silence <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> from Meredith's perspective, who is unable to hear, or speak. Her jaw is wired shut and she relies on her other senses to interpret the situation.|$|E

25|$|In the {{introductory}} section, it was claimed that M-Theory allows to learn invariant representations. This is because templates and their transformed versions {{can be learned}} from visual experience - by exposing the system to sequences of transformations of objects. It is plausible that similar visual experiences occur in early period of human life, for instance when infants twiddle toys in their hands. Because templates may be totally unrelated to images that the system later will try to classify, memories of these visual experiences may serve as a basis for recognizing many different kinds of objects in later life. However, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> later, for some kinds of transformations, specific templates are needed.|$|E

A dog docked before 28 March 2007 in Wales and 6 April 2007 in England may {{continue}} to be shown at all shows in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland throughout its life. A dog docked on, or after, the above dates, regardless of where it was docked, may not be shown at shows in England and Wales where the public is charged a fee for admission. Where a working dog has been docked in England and Wales under the respective regulations, however, it may be shown where the public is charged a fee, so long <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> “only to demonstrate its working ability”. It will thus be necessary to show working dogs {{in such a way}} as to demonstrate their working ability and not conformity to a standard. A dog legally docked in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, or abroad may be shown at any show in Scotland or Northern Ireland.|$|E

6000|$|Two {{remarkable}} {{features in}} American humour, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> {{in the great}} body of comic writers who are represented by Mark Twain and the [...] "Genial Showman," [...] are its rusticity and its puritanism. The fun is the fun of rough villagers, who use quaint, straightforward words, and have developed, or carried over in the Mayflower, a slang of their own. They do not want anything too refined; {{they are not in}} the least like the farm- lad to whose shirt a serpent clung as he was dressing after bathing. Many people have read how he fled into the farm-yard, where the maidens were busy; how he did not dare to stop, and sought escape, not from woman's help--he was too modest--but in running so fast that, obedient to the laws of centrifugal motion, the snake waved out behind him like a flag. The village wits are not so shy. The young ladies, like Betsy Ward, say, [...] "If you mean getting hitched, I'm on." [...] The public is not above the most practical jokes, and {{a good deal of the}} amusement is derived from the extreme dryness, the countrified slowness of the narrative. The humorists are Puritans at bottom, as well as rustics. They have an amazing familiarity with certain religious ideas and certain Biblical terms. There is a kind of audacity in their use of the Scriptures, which reminds one of the freedom of mediaeval mystery-plays. Probably this boldness began, not in scepticism or in irreverence, but in honest familiar faith. It certainly seems very odd to us in England, and probably expressions often get a laugh which would pass unnoticed in America. An astounding coolness and freedom of manners probably go for something in the effect produced by American humour. There is nothing of the social flunkeyism in it which too often marks our own satirists. Artemus Ward's reports of his own conversations with the mighty of the earth were made highly ludicrous by the homely want of self-consciousness, displayed by the owner of the Kangaroo, that [...] "amoosin' little cuss," [...] and of the [...] "two moral B'ars." [...] But it is vain to attempt to analyze the fun of Artemus Ward. Why did he make some people laugh till they cried, while others were all untouched? His secret probably was almost entirely one of manner, a trick of almost idiotic naivete, like that of Lord Dundreary, covering real shrewdness. He had his rustic chaff, his Puritan profanity; his manner was the essence of his mirth. It was one of the ultimate constituents of the ludicrous, beyond which it is useless to inquire.|$|E
