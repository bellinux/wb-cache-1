40|$|The {{number of}} people with food hypersensitivity, namely food {{intolerance}} and food allergies, grows every year. Food intolerance is classified into following types: enzymopathy; leaky gut syndrome; psychogenic food intolerance; detoxification insufficiency and true food intolerance. Food allergens mainly are glycoproteins, haptens or polypeptides. Most cases of food allergy are IgE-mediated allergic reactions. Recent discoveries in medicine, detailing and classification of food hypersensitivity require further researches to develop modern techniques and product recipes with specified properties for consumers with food hypersensitivity. Existing technologies are based on the elimination and or reduction of the content of the <b>allergenic</b> <b>substance</b> in food.

40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} {{is the most}} frequent occupational disease in industrialized countries. It is caused by CD 8 (+) T cell-mediated contact hypersensitivity (CHS) reactions triggered {{at the site of}} contact by a variety of chemicals, also known as weak haptens, present in fragrances, dyes, metals, preservatives, and drugs. Despite the myriad of potentially <b>allergenic</b> <b>substances</b> that can penetrate the skin, sensitization is relatively rare and immune tolerance to the substance is often induced by as yet poorly understood mechanisms. Here we show, using the innocuous chemical 2, 4 -dinitrothiocyanobenzene (DNTB), that cutaneous immune tolerance in mice critically depends on epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), which capture DNTB and migrate to lymph nodes for direct presentation to CD 8 (+) T cells. Depletion and adoptive transfer experiments revealed that LCs conferred protection from development of CHS by a mechanism involving both anergy and deletion of allergen-specific CD 8 (+) T cells and activation of a population of T cells identified as ICOS(+) CD 4 (+) Foxp 3 (+) Tregs. Our findings highlight the critical role of LCs in tolerance induction in mice to the prototype innocuous hapten DNTB and suggest that strategies targeting LCs might be valuable for prevention of cutaneous allergy...|$|R

To characterize better the <b>allergenic</b> <b>substances</b> within shrimp, extracts from heated shrimp were systematically examined with solid-phase radioimmunoassay and sera from patients clinically sensitive to shrimp. Two heat-stable protein allergens, designated as Sa-I and Sa-II, were identified from boiled shrimp (Penaeus indicus) extracts. Sa-I was isolated by ultrafiltration, Sephadex G- 25, and diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel chromatography, whereas Sa-II, the major allergen, was purified by successive chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel, Bio-Gel P- 200, and Sepharose 4 B columns. Sa-I, which was homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), elicited a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE corresponding to a molecular weight of 8. 2 kd. Sa-II was also found to be homogeneous by PAGE, crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and immunoblotting. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE, it elicited a single band with a molecular weight of 34 kd. Sa-II was found to contain 301 amino acid residues and was particularly rich in glutamate/glutamine and aspartate/asparagine. Solid-phase radioimmunoassay-inhibition studies revealed that Sa-I and Sa-II share 54 % of the allergenic epitopes, suggesting that Sa-I may be a fragment of Sa-II.

The main ingredients in Reduning injection were analyzed before and after ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltrate Reduning injection, unfiltered Reduning injection, egg albumin, Tween- 80, and nine effective components in Reduning injection were utilized to sensitize guinea pigs. The serum 5 -hydroxytryptamine level was used to assess the sensitization effect of Reduning injection. We found a significant decrease in Tween- 80 content comparing to other components in the injection after ultrafiltration. Unfiltered Reduning injection, Tween- 80, chlorogenic acid, and cryptochlorogenin acid caused remarkable anaphylactoid reaction on guinea pigs while ultrafiltration Reduning resulted in a significantly lower degree of sensitization. Our results suggest that ultrafiltration could significantly reduce the sensitization of Reduning injection, which is likely due to the decrease of Tween- 80.

50|$|Three main factors play an {{essential}} {{role in the development of}} chronic hand eczema: excessive contact with water and irritants (cumulative-toxic stress), contact with allergens, and atopic diathesis, which has a genetic component. Individual hand eczema types are identified and named according to the main catalysts involved, i.e. cumulative-toxic, contact-allergenic, or atopic hand eczema. Activities that are stressful for the skin or involve repeated, excessive contact with water or skin-irritating substances at work or home can cause damage to the skin's protective abilities and increase the chances of inflammation. This also applies to prolonged wearing of protective rubber gloves and similar materials, since sweating occurs within these gloves. Disturbance of the skin's protective barrier also facilitates penetration by <b>allergenic</b> <b>substances</b> and promotes the development of contact dermatitis. Contact allergies play a very important role in the development of hand eczema. If the hand is subjected to repeated contact with a substance that leads to an allergy, the skin reacts with signs of inflammation. Numerous people affected by hand eczema also experience skin inflammation on their feet. Often, a contact allergy to an ingredient in shoe leather treatment may be the catalyst. Contact allergies in certain types of employment are especially problematic, particularly if the work involves the handling of allergenic materials, e.g. masonry work or hairdressing.|$|R

Hairdressers are exposed to the allergens found in oxidative hair dyes during the process of applying dyes to the hair, when cutting freshly dyed hair, or as a consequence of prior contamination of the working environment. pphenylenediamine, toluene- 2, 5 -diamine and its sulphate {{are the most}} common ingredients in oxidative hair dyes that cause allergic contact dermatitis in hairdressers. Cross-reactivity of p-phenylenediamine with para-amino benzoic acid, sulphonamides, sulphonylurea, dapsone, azo dyes, benzocaine, procaine, and black henna temporary tattoos is possible. Allergic contact dermatitis is classified as delayed-type hypersensitivity, according to Coombs and Gell. Skin changes typically appear on the hands after previous sensitization to causative allergens. Combined with the patient’s overall medical and work history and clinical picture, epicutaneous testing is the basic diagnostic procedure for confirming the diagnosis and identifying the causative allergens. The simplest and most effective measure for preventing the occurrence of allergic contact dermatitis in hairdressers is prevention. Preventive measures should be applied as early as in the beginning stage of vocational guidance for this profession. It is important to include health education in the process of professional training and to implement general technical safety measures, in order to reduce sensitization to allergens in hairdressing.

In the present study, we analysed NB-derived <b>allergenic</b> <b>substances</b> and {{the variability of}} IgE antibody production {{in response to these}} allergens in outbred Sprague-Dawley rats. Two kinds of crude allergens were used: the excretory-secretory products (ES) of adult NB, and an extract of homogenized adult worms (AW). ELISA showed that IgE antibody titres to ES were more than five times higher than the titres to AW. In the homologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction using serum from infected rats, as little as 50 micrograms of ES had a maximal PCA activity, while even 1 mg of AW still gave a slightly lower PCA titre. Thus, it appeared that ES contained more allergen than AW at the same amount of total proteins. By immunoblot analysis, at least six components were recognized by IgE antibodies from infected animals, and these components were exactly the same in both ES and AW. The results indicated that the allergenic components in ES and AW were the same molecules, and that only those molecules which could be excreted or secreted from living worms were allergenic. Among the array of allergens, 130, 000 and 70, 000 molecular weight (mw) molecules were commonly recognized by IgE from all serum samples examined, while other components of the allergens were recognized variably by IgE antibodies from individual animals. These findings suggested that individual animals varied considerably in their IgE antibody production to the different constituents of the nematode allergens...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{authentication}} is a {{major concern}} not only for the prevention of commercial fraud, but also for the assessment of safety risks deriving from the undeclared introduction of potentially dangerous toxic or <b>allergenic</b> <b>substances</b> or environmentally damaging fish where endangered species are involved. Moreover, food authentication might affect the diet of certain groups of consumers, such as followers of religious practices. Considering the authentication of fish products {{is one of the key}} issues in food safety, quality and sustainability, the aim of this work was to investigate the prevalence of mislabelling in sole (Solea solea), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and hake (Merluccius merluccius) fillets from markets and supermarkets located in Apulia (Southern Italy) using DNA barcoding. The results of the molecular investigations reveal that 42 / 98 (42. 8 %) fillet samples were not correctly labelled. In particular, 12 / 27 (44. 4 %) fillets of sole (Solea solea) were identified as belonging to Solea senegalensis. In addition, 13 / 28 (46. 4 %) plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) samples were identified as Pangasius hypophtalmus. All Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) samples were correctly labelled. Post-sequencing data analysis revealed that 17 / 30 (56. 6 %) hake fillets (Merluccius merluccius) were not correctly labelled, of which 8 / 30 samples identified as Merluccius hubbsi, 5 / 30 samples as Merluccius products and 4 / 30 as Merluccius capensis. The study reveals a high occurrence of species mislabelling in the prepared fish fillet products, further evidence of the need for increased traceability and assessment of the authenticity of food products...|$|R
40|$|Various biosynthesised {{compounds}} from ornamental {{plants can}} {{be harmful to}} man, throughout a plant’s entire life cycle or only during certain moments, present {{in all of its}} organs or restricted only to some. Interdisciplinary research regarding plant toxins and allergens are being conducted worldwide, aiming to prevent the production of diseases. The research aimed to phytochemically classify vegetal compounds with toxic and allergenic characteristics found in ornamental plants, to identify the main pathogenic pathways through which these compounds act and to come up with recommendations regarding valoriϐication of these plants. The study focuses on ornamental plants in both spontaneous and cultivated ϐlora, in protected or unprotected spaces, commonly met in Romania. The current review includes vegetal allergens in the toxic vegetal substances group, from the perspective of modern deϐinitions of toxicity. Based on phytochemical criteria, a classiϐication of toxic vegetal compounds (including allergens) was achieved. Common native toxic ornamentals from our habitat are tabulated. Some non-native species were included {{on the basis of their}} high presence as house plants. Correlated to the commercial practices in Romania, the risks for ambient health were identiϐied, both at the work place, at home and in the public space. Ornamentals can be dangerous to man’s health. The majority of toxic and <b>allergenic</b> <b>substances</b> (excluding pollens) are secondary metabolism compounds. Given these risk factors to health, it is necessary to impose health and safety regulations at work, to inform the general population regarding potential negative effects and to commercialize plants with labels which should contain warnings about the risk of diseases or the aggravation of existing ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterium}} B. subtilis {{is one of}} {{the most}} promi­sing probiotics studied in recent decades. Mechanisms of its probiotic action are associated with the synthesis of antimicrobial agents, increasing of non-specific and specific immunity, stimulation of growth of normal microflora of the intestine and the releasing of digestive enzymes. B. subtilis releases ribosomally synthesized peptides, non-ribosomally synthesized peptides and non-peptide substances with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity covering Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, viruses and fungi. Resistance to these antimicrobial agents is rare. Enhancement of non-specific immunity is associated with macrophage activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from them, increasing of barrier function of the intestinal mucosa, releasing of vitamins and amino acids (including essential ones). Enhancement of specific immunity manifests by activation of T- and B-lymphocytes and the release from the latter of immunoglobulins — IgG and IgA. B. subtilis stimulates the growth of normal intestinal flora, in particular, bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Furthermore, probiotic increases the diversity of intestinal microflora. Probiotic secretes all major digestive enzymes to the intestinal lumen: amylases, lipases, proteases, pectinases and cellulases. In addition to digestion, these enzymes destroy antinutritional factors and <b>allergenic</b> <b>substances</b> contained in the food. These mechanisms of action make reasonable the use of B. subtilis in the combination therapy to treat intestinal infections; prevention of respiratory infections during the cold season; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea; for the correction of food digestion and movement impairments of various origin (errors in the diet, changes in the diet, diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, disorders of the autonomic nervous system, etc.). B. subtilis does not usually cause side effects. This probiotic is characterized by a high efficacy and safety ratio...|$|R
