5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion and empathy for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers. She also has <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig. She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, perhaps {{because of her}} mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} also {{time and again}} shown to have <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> clubs in {{financial}} disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers. Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its license for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli. More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club. Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a 2 Million Euro loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid. On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.|$|E

Wolfenden said David [...] "has <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> Amy" [...] and flirted with her. Over time he began to see her as his [...] "little sister." [...] When David's girlfriend, Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) accuses Amy of stealing from the shop, David proves her innocence by exposing Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson) as the thief. Wolfenden added that David has given out the wrong signals and acted naive during the story arc. Wolfenden explained that Amy misreads the signs because [...] "she never had that sort of affection {{when she was growing}} up." [...] Amy kisses David which shocks him, though Wolfenden felt it should not surprise him. Amy lies to her best friend Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins), claiming she has slept with him and runs away from home.|$|E

500|$|Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh {{admitted}} that his government {{was responsible for}} failure in preventing the attacks by MNS on north Indian candidates at Railways examination centres and ordered a probe into the incident, which will also enquire into why the job advertisements where not given in Marathi newspapers. [...] "What has happened is not good. Such incidents take place because of loopholes in the law. One can't hold only the Home Ministry responsible for it, it is (entire) government's responsibility. Such incidents are affecting {{the image of the}} state and I have instructed the DGP to take stern action," [...] Deshmukh said. However, NCP leader Narayan Rane, wrote a piece in 23 October 2008, issue of 'Prahar', in a city newspaper he owns, pleading that Marathis should get their legitimate share in the central government sector. The Times of India noted, the essay indicates that Rane continues to have <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> MNS chief Raj Thackeray– the two were close friends when Rane was in the Sena. Stating that the Marathis were getting a raw deal in central government jobs such as income tax and the railways, Rane said it was perplexing that of 54,000, only 54 Marathis were summoned for the railway recruitment exams. The railways must give Marathis their legitimate share in employment, Rane said.|$|E
500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> Victor and tries to convince Margaret {{that he has been}} unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{character}} is distinct through the series {{as having a}} very strong religious feeling. Together with Blackthorn, Adept {{was one of the}} favorite characters of series creator Gillis: [...] "I had <b>a</b> real <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> Adept, since she was the first fundamentalist Christian character to be portrayed positively for as long as I can remember". Gillis himself defines himself as “about as non-fundamentalist-Christian as you can get". Commenting further on the character, Gillis has mentioned that [...] "she really was wonderful, if not easy to write. And I think her death came off beautifully".|$|R

The Guardian gave Gray Matters three out of five stars, writing that [...] "what makes this even more compelling is the supporting art-historical input from its numerous interviewees (I developed <b>a</b> particular <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> the dulcet-voiced Dr Jennifer Goff of the National Museum of Ireland), who collectively explicate Gray’s eclectic style, a playful, practical minimalism that evolved substantially over the years".|$|R
50|$|Eventually, however, she and Hareton form an {{unlikely}} romance: after long having shrugged off his attempts at winning her affection, {{she begins to}} aid him in his education. Heathcliff sees the love between the two blossom and, probably because he has <b>a</b> grudging <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> Hareton, no longer takes pleasure in degrading them. Heathcliff begins to see Hareton as an adopted son, sharing a similar life of the poor stable boy robbed of his inheritance and love. He no longer stands between Hareton and Catherine, seeing it as now a pointless endeavour and essentially as revenge against himself, and the two are finally allowed to openly love each other.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{a really}} {{interesting}} experience {{for me as a}} musician. I learned a lot. It was quite a liberating experience in a funny way. I was going through a divorce, and I ripped my hair out, basically shaved it. I felt like I had rid myself of all shackles ... On the other side of it, you're stuffed in a cage and tied down to all your old ideas, all your old opinions, all your old creative output, and that can be a prison sometimes. So for me, Beautifulgarbage was really liberating. I have <b>a</b> real <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> record- I think we all do in the band, actually. —Shirley Manson ...|$|R

Benson became a popular character and in 1979 left the Tates' employ to work for Jessica's cousin, Governor Gene Gatling, on the spin-off series, Benson, wherein his last name, DuBois, was revealed.

2500|$|Hastings has <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> auburn-haired women. Back in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Hastings was charmed with auburn-haired Cynthia Murdoch and {{proposed}} to her. This {{would become a}} running gag in the series, with Poirot often teasing Hastings. Whenever Hastings suggests the innocence of a young, beautiful, female murder suspect, Poirot slyly asks [...] "Does she have auburn hair?" [...] This pronounced weakness for pretty women with auburn hair gets Hastings and Poirot into trouble more than once: in The Big Four, while posing as secretary for millionaire Abe Ryland, Hastings trusts false information from a woman with auburn hair, while in the short story Double Sin, Hastings believes auburn-haired Mary Durant.|$|E

She enjoys the company of Tsuzuku and acts as a mother figure to both Owaru and Amaru. In return, all the Ryudos are very protective of her.

He has even been called a [...] "liability" [...] and a [...] "burden," [...] his relationship with Usagi being described as a child-mother relationship rather than that of a principality couple. Usagi is said to show him amae, or [...] "indulgent love." [...] When compared to male leads of male-targeted series, Mamoru, although unafraid of girls, seems uncomfortable with them.

[...] She continued, [...] "He hasn't quite evolved that much! Since he supports gay marriage, he should be proud of his background as a homosexual/bisexual. He is against everything else Christians stand for, he might as well be for infidelity."
