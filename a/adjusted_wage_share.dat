The most pronounced development is the escalation of management salaries caused {{by the rise of}} stock options. On theoretical grounds, this trend was fostered by advances in the economic discipline of agency theory. In practice, changes in tax laws contributed to promoting the change. Empirical evidence shows that income concentration has increased at the top. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate about income shares by introducing a new <b>adjusted</b> <b>wage</b> <b>share.</b> Arguing that top incomes are closer to profits than to wages, top incomes are removed from the calculation of the indicator.

Recently, {{there has been a}} renewed interest in the determinants of functional income distribution.

This study, firstly, tries to replicate these studies to investigate the robustness of their findings. Secondly, the estimated wage share equation is extended to allow for distributional effects of financial globalization and for different effects of union density according to social security system. We find that the estimations on which the conclusions of IMF and EC are based suffer from serious econometric problems and that their findings are not robust. In particular, the effect of technological change is often not statistically significant. Globalization (in production), however, has a robust effect. Results from the extended model suggest economically important (and mostly statistically significant) effects of financial globalization and of union density of non-Ghent countries.

The conducted research showed that the levels of the weighted <b>wage</b> <b>share,</b> corresponding to the employment structure, were: the lowest – in agriculture, the highest – in the service sector. Furthermore, the shift of the aggregate <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> was mostly affected by the decline in the primary and secondary sectors, which was generally based on the decrease of employed people.

The importance of structural changes in explaining the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> increase over time is studied.

40|$|The <b>share</b> of <b>wages</b> in {{organised}} Indian industry declined considerably between 1973 and 1997. The {{end to end}} drop was 19 per cent, and the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> {{fell from}} 51. 7 per cent to 32. 8 per cent. In proportionate terms, the decline in <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> was between 30 - 40 per cent. The period of analysis divides into two phases. In {{the first phase of}} fifteen years (1973 - 87), <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> declined by 5 ½ percentage points, while the fall accelerated after 1987, and the decline from 1987 - 97 was by 13 ½ percentage points. If it is possible to identify the period 1987 - 97 with the period of liberalisation, it may be inferred that 70 per cent of the decline in the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> was during the period of liberalisation. The period of liberalisation has witnessed an acceleration in the decline of the <b>wage</b> <b>share.</b> Faster growth of low-wage-share industries was responsible for a substantial part of the decline the share of labour. More than 1 / 3 of the total decrease in the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> (1973 - 97) was due to the faster growth of low wage-share industries. Growing importance of low wage-share industries was the sole reason for the decline in <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> between 1973 - 87. After 1987, the relative growth of low wage-share industries contributed only 9 per cent of the fall in the aggregate <b>wage</b> <b>share.</b> In the period as a whole, the decline in <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> at the individual industry level contributed at least half (9 ½ percentage points) of the total decline in the aggregate <b>wage</b> <b>share.</b> In the first period, 1973 - 87, the industry level <b>wage</b> <b>shares</b> actually rose. However, in the second period, the industry level shares have been falling rapidly. They fell by 12. 3 percentage points against the total decline of 13. 5 percentage points in the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> in this period. Thus, the decline in industry level <b>wage</b> <b>shares</b> contributed more than 90 per cent of the total decline in <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> in the second period (1987 - 97). If this period may be called the period of liberalisation, it may said that <b>wage</b> <b>shares</b> fell drastically at individual industry levels during liberalisation. For the period as a whole, the decline in industry level <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> was entirely due to the rise in material/wage (m/w) ratio. Constant composition mark-up remained the same end to end between 1973 - 97. This study also examines the reasons for the consistent rise in m/w ratio and finds it to be due to technical change. Almost the entire increase in the m/w ratio was due to the rise in the material used per employee. This index rose from 100 to 380 over the period. Most of the increased material used found its way into greater output. Thus, O/L (index) rose from 100 to 346 over the time period. A small fraction of the rise in the material intensity per employee went into a rise in the material output ratio, whose index rose from 100 to 110. Thus, the study reveals a drastic decline in the aggregate <b>share</b> of <b>wages</b> between 1973 - 97. This decrease came about {{as a result of a}} faster growth of low <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> industries over the period, as well as a rise in the material intensity per employee in the production process. Thus changes in output mix and technical change were responsible for the 19 percentage point drop in the <b>share</b> of <b>wages.</b> Mark-ups played no role in the decline in the period as a whole. markups, material-wage ratio, technical change, output mix, <b>wage</b> <b>share,</b> distribution of income, Indian industry...|$|R

We compile a comprehensive sector-level dataset of eight OECD countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the UK, the US) for the period of 1970 to 2011, which allows us to trace the developments in the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> across high and low skilled sectors and within manufacturing and service industries. Our findings provide new insights with regard to the drivers of falling <b>wage</b> <b>share.</b> By conducting country specific estimations, we analyse how institutional differences in industrial relations, as well as social security and welfare regimes affect the <b>wage</b> <b>share.</b> Our findings lend strong support to the political economy approach to functional income distribution. Technological change had an impact, especially in Italy, the US and for the total country sample, but the effects are not robust with respect to the use of different specifications and the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> in most countries in our sample appears to be driven by variables reflecting the bargaining power of labour such as union density, adjusted bargaining coverage and government spending. The relevance of these variables differs considerably across countries, lending support to our approach of country specific estimations. We find that globalisation had a strong impact on the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> in all countries. The effect of globalisation on the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> was least strong in Denmark.
