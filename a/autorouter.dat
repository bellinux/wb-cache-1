5000|$|NeuroCAD (hence, the NeuroRoute <b>autorouter</b> and its algorithms) ...|$|E
50|$|KiCad has a {{built-in}} <b>autorouter</b> for basic, single connections. Alternatively, the open source (but discontinued) Java-based FreeRouting {{can be used to}} externally autoroute boards.|$|E
50|$|The program {{allows for}} up to 16 copper layers, both metric and English units, and export of designs in RS-274X Gerber format. Boards can be {{partially}} or fully autorouted with the FreeRouting <b>autorouter</b> by using the FpcROUTE Specctra DSN file translator.|$|E
50|$|Some people {{hope that}} further {{improvements}} in autoplacers and <b>autorouters</b> will eventually produce good layouts without any human manual intervention. Further automation {{leads to the}} idea of a silicon compiler.|$|R
50|$|Differential pairs: define {{differential}} pair and its rules; automatic or manual defining of paired pads; paired routing {{and editing}} of differential pair; single-track differential pair routing and editing; phase tune tool (place custom / regular size meanders); real-time control of phase and length tolerance; differential pair manager; support of differential pairs for external <b>autorouters,</b> recognition of paired traces.|$|R
50|$|DipTrace is EDA/CAD {{software}} for creating schematic diagrams and printed circuit boards. The developers provide multi-lingual interface and tutorials (currently available in English and 21 other languages). DipTrace has 4 modules: Schematic Capture Editor, PCB Layout Editor with built-in shape-based <b>autorouter</b> and 3D Preview & Export, Component Editor, and Pattern Editor.|$|E
50|$|The Proteus Design Suite is a Windows {{application}} for schematic capture, simulation, and PCB layout design. It {{can be purchased}} in many configurations, {{depending on the size}} of designs being produced and the requirements for microcontroller simulation. All PCB Design products include an <b>autorouter</b> and basic mixed mode SPICE simulation capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Being web-based {{and running}} in a browser, there is {{essentially}} nothing to be routinely downloaded or installed to the local machine. The online nature of the tool also means that updating is automatic. Bug fixes and new features, such as {{the addition of a}} PCB <b>Autorouter</b> in September 2015 are therefore completely transparent, requiring no input from the user.|$|E
5000|$|Pulsonix is a Windows {{application}} for schematic capture and [...] layout design. It {{is produced in}} three variants, from 1000 pins up to an unlimited component pins version suited to larger designs. All three have <b>autorouter</b> capability. Within a dual monitor setup, schematic and layout design processes can each be assigned to a single screen, with changes synchronized as needed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{predecessor}} of TARGET 3001! was [...] "RULE", a DOS-based {{program for}} PCB layout (1989). After hobbyists used this, there were {{calls for a}} schematic tool and <b>autorouter.</b> In response, TARGET 2.1 (for DOS) was released in 1992. The move to Windows was difficult: early versions of [...] "TARGET V3 for Windows" [...] were prone to crash. The package became stable and more accepted among hobby, educational and professional users.|$|E
50|$|PCBs or ASICs can be {{designed}} manually or using an autoplacer and <b>autorouter.</b> A Specctra interface to external autorouters is available. The design can be automatically checked for spacing violations and many other design rules. If the PCB is ready designed it can be directly displayed and rotated in a live 3D view. The 3D data can be exported in STEP format to produce preview 3D dummies of the PCB on 3D printers. Circuit design on 3D bodies (Molded Interconnect Device, MID) is possible.|$|E
50|$|TopoR (Topological Router) is an EDA program {{developed}} and maintained by Eremex company, based in Russia. It {{is dedicated to}} laying out {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB). It currently lacks schematic capture and library editing (which have to be done using third-party software), but features a powerful <b>autorouter</b> and a set of tools intended {{to reduce the amount of}} effort needed for manual routing of a PCB. The most recognizable feature of TopoR is absence of preferred routing directions, which results in unusual looking PCBs.|$|E
50|$|Engineering {{tool for}} board design with smart manual routing, {{differential}} pairs, shape-based <b>autorouter,</b> advanced verification, and wide import/export capabilities. Design requirements {{are defined by}} net classes, class-to-class rules, and detailed settings by object types for each class or layer. When routing with real-time DRC, the program reports errors on the fly before actually making them. DRC also checks length and phase tolerances for differential pairs. The board can be previewed in 3D and exported to STEP format for mechanical CAD modeling. Design Rule Check with in-depth detailing and Net Connectivity verification procedures are available.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 1985 by John Durbetaki, Ken and Keith Seymour as “OrCAD Systems Corporation” in Hillsboro, Oregon, {{the company}} became a {{supplier}} of desktop electronic design automation (EDA) software. In 1984 Durbetaki began designing an expansion chassis for the IBM PC. Durbetaki, {{who had left}} Intel Corp. after five years as an engineer and project manager, decided, along with brothers Keith and Ken Seymour, {{to start his own}} company to develop add-on instrumentation for the PC." [...] Durbetaki began creating his own schematic capture tool for his use in the PC expansion chassis project; but eventually shelved the hardware project entirely in favor of developing low-cost, PC-based CAD software. The company's first product was SDT (Schematic Design Tools), which shipped first in late 1985. In 1986, OrCAD hired Peter LoCascio to develop sales and co-founder Ken Seymour left the company. The flagship SDT product was soon followed with a digital simulator, VST (Verification and Simulation Tools) and printed circuit board (PCB) layout tools. Over time, OrCAD's product line broadened to include Windows-based software products to assist electronics designers in developing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), including complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs). Durbetaki, then CEO and head of R&D, left the company in the 1990s. He was succeeded as CEO by Michael Bosworth. In June 1995, OrCAD acquired Massteck Ltd., a small company that offered a printed circuit board layout tool and a sophisticated <b>autorouter,</b> and Intelligent Systems Japan, KK, OrCAD's distributor in Japan. In 1996, OrCAD made a public offering. In late 1997 and early 1998, OrCAD and MicroSim Corporation merged, a business combination that ultimately proved to be disappointing (MicroSim, was a supplier of PC-based analog and mixed-signal simulation software for designing printed circuit board systems). In 1999, the company and its products were acquired by one of its former competitors, Cadence Design Systems.|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} email {{handling system}} (<b>AutoRouter)</b> was introduced {{at a national}} counselling service in Australia. In 2003, counsellors responded {{to a total of}} 7421 email messages. Over nine days in early May 2004 the administrator responsible for the management of the manual email counselling service recorded the time spent on managing email messages. The <b>AutoRouter</b> was then introduced. Since the implementation of the <b>AutoRouter</b> the administrator 2 ̆ 7 s management role has become redundant, an average of 12 h 5 min per week of staff time has been saved. There have been further savings in supervisor time. Counsellors were taking an average of 6. 2 days to respond to email messages (n= 4307), with an average delay of 1. 2 days from the time counsellors wrote the email to when the email was sent. Thus the response was sent on average 7. 4 days after receipt of the original client email message. A significant decrease in response time has been noted since implementation of the <b>AutoRouter,</b> with client responses now taking an average of 5. 4 days, a decrease of 2. 0 days. Automatic message handling appears to be a promising method of managing the administration of a steadily increasing email counselling service...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer-aided}} {{tool for}} the design of switching power supplies integrating layout editor, <b>autorouter,</b> component library builder, and EMI simulator is presented. The software takes on a modular approach and develops the printed circuit board (PCB) layout with emphasis on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). The prediction of interference level is achieved by SPICE simulation with suitable model assignments of EMI sources, components, and PCB tracks. An off-line forward converter is built and measured to verify the simulated result. Finally, a performance index is introduced to act as an indicator for the EMC performance of a given PCB layout.
