The absorption system has multiple velocity components, tracing gas that is largely outflowing from the QSO at velocities of a few 100 km s^- 1. There is an unprecedented range in ionization, with detections of HI, NIII, NIV, NV, OIV, OIV*, OV, OVI, NeVIII, MgX, SV and ArVIII. We estimate the total hydrogen number density from the column density ratio N(OIV*) /N(OIV) to be (n_H/cm^ 3) ∼ 3.

Widely differing <b>absorption</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths,</b> combined with covering fractions less than unity across all ions pose a challenge to models involving simple cloud geometries. These issues may be mitigated by the presence of non-equilibrium effects, together with the possibility of multiple gas temperatures.

Their inferred distance, outflow velocities and gas densities are broadly consistent with scenarios involving gas entrainment or condensations in winds driven by either supernovae, or the supermassive black hole accretion disc. In the case of the latter, the present data most likely does not trace the bulk of the outflow by mass, which could instead manifest itself as an accompanying warm absorber, detectable in X-rays.

The UV–visible differential optical absorption spectroscopy technique is one that is heavily used for tropospheric measurements. To assess the advantages and drawbacks of using a Fourier transform spectrometer, we built a differential optical absorption spectroscopy optical setup based on a Bruker IFS 120 M spectrometer. The characteristics and the capabilities of this setup have been studied and compared with those of the more conventional grating-based instruments. Two of the main advantages of the Fourier transform spectrometer are (1) the existence of a reproducible and precise wave-number scale, which greatly simplifies the algorithms used to analyze the atmospheric spectra, and (2) the possibility of recording large spectral regions at relatively high resolution, enabling the simultaneous detection of numerous chemical species with better discriminating properties. The main drawback, on the other hand, {{is due to the fact}} that a Fourier transform spectrometer is a scanning device for which the scanning time is small compared with the total measurement time. It does not have the signal integration capabilities of the CCD or photodiode array-based grating spectrographs.

In the limit of weak absorption the transmitted optical intensity decreases exponentially with <b>absorption</b> <b>path</b> <b>length,</b> in accordance with Beer's law, where the exponential decay constant, k, is the absorption coefficient at {{the frequency of the}} incident beam. The ability to accurately measure the ratio of I to Io typically limits the measurement to minimum losses of 0. 01...|$|E

A Bruker IFS 125 HR Fourier transform spectrometer was {{used with a}} White-type multipass absorption cell with 46. 4 m <b>absorption</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> to measure four ambient temperature air-broadened absorption spectra at total pressures ranging from 100 to 1000 mbar. A multispectrum fitting technique was used to retrieve parameters up to |m|= 40 (m=-J″ and m=J″+ 1 for the P and R branch, respectively) utilizing the partially correlated quadratic speed-dependent hard collision model including Rosenkranz line mixing. Speed dependence of the broadening parameter as well as line mixing could be observed in the spectra. The broadening parameters are compared to HITRAN 2012, where deviations can be ascribed {{to the influence of}} neglecting speed dependence effects in spectra analyses when using the Voigt line profile. The line mixing coefficients show a smooth dependence on m...|$|E

The cell is fabricated entirely from copper and the 15 cm {{radius of curvature}} copper mirrors have gold coated reflective surfaces. The cell was tested at temperatures between 296 and 30 K with a folded <b>absorption</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> of 5. 37 m utilizing a lead salt tunable diode laser. Short term temperature stability (1 h) of the Herriott cell is better than 0. 005 K under normal operating conditions with a temperature uniformity better than 0. 01 K (not measurable). The cell was tested by performing collisional cooling experiments on 13 C 16 O 2 in helium at temperatures between 70 and 20 K and by performing more traditional pressure broadening and shift measurements on molecular infrared absorption lines at temperatures between 300 and about 80 K on 13 C 16 O 2 methane...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} of solar radiation by water dimer molecules in the Earth's atmosphere can potentially {{act as a}} positive feedback effect for climate change. There seems little doubt {{from the results of}} previous laboratory and theoretical studies that significant concentrations of the water dimer should be present in the atmosphere, yet attempts to detect water dimer absorption signatures in atmospheric field studies have so far yielded inconclusive results. Here we report spectral measurements in the near-infrared in the expected region of the third overtone of the water dimer hydrogen-bonded OHb stretching vibration around 750 nm. The results were obtained using broadband cavity ringdown spectroscopy (BBCRDS), a methodology that allows absorption measurements to be made under controlled laboratory conditions but over <b>absorption</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> representative of atmospheric conditions. In order to account correctly and completely for overlapping {{absorption of}} monomer molecules in the same spectral region, we have also constructed a new list of spectral data (UCL 08) for the water monomer in the 750 – 20 000 cm− 1 (13 &mu;m– 500 nm) range. Our results show that the additional lines included in the UCL 08 spectral database provide a substantially improved representation of the measured water monomer absorption in the 750 nm region, particularly at wavelengths dominated by weak monomer absorption features. No absorption features which could not be attributed to the water monomer were detected in the BBCRDS experiments up to water mixing ratios more than an order of magnitude greater than those in the ambient atmosphere. The absence of detectable water dimer features leads us to conclude that, in the absence of significant errors in calculated dimer oscillator strengths or monomer/dimer equilibrium constants, the widths of water dimer features present around 750 nm must be substantially greater (~ 100 cm− 1 HWHM) than those reported at longer wavelengths...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a broadband cavity ringdown spectrometer and its deployment during the 2002 North Atlantic Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (NAMBLEX) to measure ambient concentrations of NO 3, N 2 O 5, I 2 and OIO at the Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station, Co. Galway, Ireland. The effective <b>absorption</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> accessible with the spectrometer generally exceeded 10 km, enabling sensitive localised ``point" measurements of atmospheric absorbers {{to be made}} adjacent to the other instruments monitoring chemically related species at the same site. For the majority of observations, the spectrometer was used in an open path configuration thereby avoiding surface losses of reactive species. A subset of observations targeted the N 2 O 5 molecule by detecting the additional NO 3 formed by the thermal dissociation of N 2 O 5. In all cases the concentrations of the atmospheric absorbers were retrieved by fitting the differential structure in the broadband cavity ringdown spectra using a methodology adapted from long <b>path</b> differential optical <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy. The uncertainty of the retrieval depends crucially on the correct treatment and fitting of the absorption bands due to water vapour, a topic that is discussed {{in the context of}} analysing broadband cavity ringdown spectra. The quality of the measurements and the retrieval method are illustrated with representative spectra acquired during NAMBLEX in spectral regions around 660 nm (NO 3 and N 2 O 5) and 570 nm (I 2 and OIO). Typical detection limits were 1 pptv for NO 3 in an integration time of 100 s, 4 pptv for OIO and 20 pptv for I 2 in an integration time of 10 min. Additionally, the concentrations of atmospheric water vapour and the aerosol optical extinction were retrieved in both spectral regions. A companion paper in this issue presents the time series of the measurements and discusses their significance for understanding the variability of short lived nitrogen and iodine compounds in the marine boundary layer...|$|R
