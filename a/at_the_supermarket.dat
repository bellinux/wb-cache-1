5|$|Bluto and D-Day {{steal the}} answers to an {{upcoming}} test from the trash, not realizing that the Omegas have planted a fake set of answers for them to find. The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a girl he met <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket.</b> They make out, but do not have sex because she passes out drunk. Pinto takes her home in a shopping cart and later discovers {{that she is the}} mayor's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Eladio escapes as he {{is being}} deported, killing a truck driver in the process. A {{clinical}} exam on the driver shows his death {{was caused by a}} rapid growth of Trichophyton — the Athlete's foot fungus. Scully brings samples of the fatal fungi to a mycologist who discovers that their abnormally rapid growth was caused by an unidentifiable enzyme. This revelation leads Scully to suspect Eladio of being an unwitting carrier of the enzyme, necessitating his immediate capture. Eladio, seeking to return to Mexico, meets with his cousin Gabrielle to ask for money. He works with a construction foreman for the day to make the money. Soledad comes after him, seeking to kill him, but finds the foreman dead. Eladio escapes in the foreman's truck and heads to the grocery store where Gabrielle works, spreading the fungal growth. The agents later confront Soledad <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket,</b> discovering another dead victim of the fungus.|$|E

50|$|Nisha first {{appeared}} in 1988, working alongside Sammy Rogers at a local supermarket after school - a job she had taken without the knowledge of her strict family, who believed she was using the time to study <b>at</b> <b>the</b> library. Their friendship grew when a strike <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket's</b> wholesalers meant they had no work, and so they both returned to Sammy's house to listen to music.|$|R

50|$|Bikes for {{the whole}} family are readily {{available}} for rent across the country and most large towns have bike shops with all the necessary equipment and repair services. All cities possess multiple bike stands, mainly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarkets</b> and other commonly used shops. Bikes should also come with a lock so as to keep the bike from being stolen. A national scheme, Cycleswap, supports small businesses privately renting bicycles out for short-term use.|$|R

25|$|Most service {{stations}} allow the customer to pump the fuel before paying; {{this is particularly}} {{the case in the}} smaller towns and cities in New Zealand. In recent years some {{service stations}} have required customers to purchase their fuel first. It is quite common for customers to hand the cash to the attendant on the forecourt if they are paying for a set amount of fuel and have no change. Some supermarkets have their own forecourts which are unmanned and payment is pay at the pump only. Customers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket</b> will receive a discount voucher which offers discounted fuel at their forecourt. The amount of discount varies depending on the amount spent on groceries <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket,</b> but normally starts at 4 cents a liter.|$|E
25|$|The retail {{environment}} {{not only}} affects quality perceptions, {{but can also}} impact on the way that customers navigate {{their way through the}} retail space during the retail service encounter. Layout, directional signage, the placement of furniture, shelves and display space along with the store's ambient conditions all affect patron's passage through the retail service system. Layout refers to how equipment, shelves and other furnishings are placed and the relationship between them. In a retail setting, accessibility is an important aspect of layout. For example, the grid layout used by supermarkets with long aisles and gondolas at the end displaying premium merchandise or promotional items, minimises the time customers spend in the environment and makes productive use of available space. The gondola, so favoured by supermarkets, {{is an example of a}} retail design feature known as a merchandise outpost and which refers to special displays, typically at or near the end of an aisle, whose purpose is to stimulate impulse purchasing or to complement other products in the vicinity. For example, the meat cabinet <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket</b> might use a merchandise outpost to suggest a range of marinades or spice rubs to complement particular cuts of meat. As a generalisation, merchandise outposts are updated regularly so that they maintain a sense of novelty.|$|E
50|$|Seabrook {{has its own}} MARC {{commuter}} rail station (Seabrook Station). Seabrook residents are served by {{a large number of}} small businesses, including restaurants, fast foot eateries, banks, lawyer services, laundry services, veterinary services, car repair, and numerous other businesses which are located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Seabrook Station. Seabrook shoppers also tend to shop <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarkets</b> and stores <b>at</b> Glenn Dale, slightly to the east on Route 564, or drive east approximately 15 mi to Bowie, with its large shopping complexes such as the Bowie Town Center.|$|R

50|$|A {{horizontal}} {{marketing system}} is a distribution channel arrangement whereby two or more organizations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same level join together for marketing purposes to capitalize on a new opportunity. For example: a bank and a supermarket agree to have the bank’s ATMs located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket’s</b> locations; two manufacturers combining to achieve economies of scale otherwise not possible with each acting alone {{to meet the needs}} and demands of a very large retailer; or two wholesalers joining together to serve a particular region at a certain time of year.|$|R
500|$|Six months later, Rachel {{returns to}} Manchester, and moves into Karen and David's spare room. After Pete spots her <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket,</b> Adam prepares {{for what he}} thinks will be her {{homecoming}} with his child. Instead, Rachel reveals {{that she had the}} pregnancy terminated, unable to cope with not knowing whether the father was Adam or Kris. The abortion story was devised to avoid having all three couples in the series having children. Bullen and the executive producers Andy Harries and Christine Langan all agreed that having Rachel suffer a miscarriage would be a [...] "cop out" [...] but they split on whether she should terminate the pregnancy; Harries worried about the effect it would have on the character within the narrative, and what the audience would think of her, while Langan convinced him that it would be braver and more realistic for the character to go through with it.|$|E
500|$|Miller later {{noted that}} unlike other episode scenes {{such as in}} [...] "Grey Matters", Walter's {{breakdown}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket</b> [...] "came largely out of nowhere. It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If you look at it that way, his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's something else entirely when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Mexico City police {{department}} {{noticed that the}} Matamoros killings were similar to murders carried out in Mexico City between 1987 and 1989. After consulting local witchcraft practitioners and sorcerers, the police heard that Constanzo was probably hiding in Cuauhtémoc, one of the city's boroughs. Another contact told the police {{that there was an}} address of interest in the [...] neighborhood, next to Cuauhtémoc. The {{police department}} sent 16 officers to search the area. At a supermarket, they interrogated a shoemaker who claimed to have seen a woman who matched Aldrete's description. The police then spotted a man <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket</b> who was attempting to buy large amounts of groceries with U.S. dollars. They followed the man and saw that he was living at an apartment on Río Sena. By the end of the week, the police concluded that the man was De León and that he was buying groceries for Constanzo. On May 6, 1989, the police surrounded the building and waited for traffic to subside before raiding the premises. However, a black vehicle {{pulled up in front of}} the apartment complex and the police walked over to investigate. Constanzo noticed the police from the window of his apartment and opened fire at the officers who were at ground level. Constanzo threw golden coins and paper money from the window, and burned some of his money on a stove. Constanzo eventually ran out of ammunition and began to lose his patience. After about 45 minutes, and worried of his imminent capture, Constanzo ordered De León to kill him and Quintana Rodríguez.|$|E
