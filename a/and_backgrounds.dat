5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E
5|$|Players {{select one}} of several {{characters}} from the DC Universe to engage in combat, aiming to knock out their opponent. The game {{is set in a}} 2.5D environment; while character models <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are rendered in three-dimensional graphics, the characters are restricted to fight within a two-dimensional space. Injustice builds upon several aspects from NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Mortal Kombat, including its controls, game mechanics, narrative-driven campaign, and online functionality.|$|E
5|$|At Production I.G, Hiroyuki Kitakubo {{directed}} the animation scenes, wrote the screenplay {{and did the}} storyboards; Toshihiro Kawamoto was animation supervisor and a character designer. The scenes are noticeably different {{when compared to the}} film namesake directed by Mamoru Oshii, because the game is colored using a full digital technique. The scenes are a combination of cel animation <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds</b> that were rendered in three dimensions to ensure smooth transitions for the camera movement. Adobe Photoshop was used to add the finishing details to the scenes.|$|E

5|$|Design {{management}} {{is not a}} standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that leads to guaranteed success. Design management processes are carried out by humans with different responsibilities <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> who work in different industries and enterprises with different sizes and traditions, whilst having different target groups and markets to serve. Design {{management is}} multifaceted, {{and so are the}} different applications of and views on design management. The function of design management in an organisation depends on its tasks, authority, and practice.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} was still marred by {{technical}} difficulties, so Bob Fitch completely redesigned the Warcraft II engine within two months to ensure {{that many of the}} features desired by the designers, such as the abilities for units to burrow and cloak, could be implemented. Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered sprites <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> constructed using 3D Studio Max. An isometric in-game view was also adopted, in contrast to Warcraft IIs 3/4s birdseye perspective. In addition, the game utilized high quality music, composed by Blizzard's resident composers, and professional voice actors were hired.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{background}} images and photography used for the characters' sprites in the original games and associated media are taken from royalty-free sources or fan submissions, though in some cases pictures of birds <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds</b> used are Hato's own artwork or photography—the character San Oko is depicted by and based on her real life pet bird Okosan, {{and several of the}} sprites featured in Hatoful Boyfriend were derived from pictures she had taken of birds kept at the Kobe Animal Kingdom or the Torimi Café, also located in Kobe. All of the music tracks and sound effects used in Hatoful are also similarly taken from royalty-free sources.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland {{and a lot of}} new designs <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds</b> had to be created for the wilderness scenes. The backgrounds were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the forest ranger was based on then-Vice President Al Gore. In the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at Yosemite National Park. However, the producers asked him to make the voice older and crazier.|$|E
5|$|The game {{used the}} Infinity Engine, a game engine {{initially}} developed by BioWare for Baldur's Gate. However, Planescape: Torment was being developed using the Infinity Engine before Baldur's Gate had been released, leaving the engine's acceptance {{in the market}} still unknown. Black Isle made modifications to the engine to suit the game. For example, playable characters were able to run, and both the character sprites <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds</b> were larger and more detailed. The greater size and detail was achieved by bringing the perspective closer to the ground. Magic was also {{an important part of}} the game's design, and a team of four designers worked solely on the visuals and mechanics of spells.|$|E
5|$|The story, set {{eighteen}} years after Destiny, follows Kyle Dunamis, {{the son of}} the previous game's protagonists Stahn Aileron and Rutee Katrea. Shortly after meeting a mysterious girl named Reala while trying to save Rutee's orphanage from bankruptcy, Kyle is drawn into conflict with Barbatos, a cruel warrior responsible for killing Stahn, and the machinations of Elraine, a religious leader seeking to bring peace to mankind. The gameplay uses two-dimensional character sprites <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> and the battle system is a revamped version of the series' trademark Linear Motion Battle System.|$|E

5|$|The various titles {{have been}} {{developed}} by Atlus, Multimedia Intelligence Transfer and Bbmf Corporation, and feature music by Hidehito Aoki and Misaki Okibe. Aoki made use of ambient music, while also incorporating other elements into the compositions, including funk and synthesized piano. Soundtrack albums {{for the first two}} games were published by Pony Canyon, and a Majin Tensei manga was published by Enix. The series' gameplay, visuals and music have all been well received by critics, with particular praise to the demon fusion, the large character art <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds</b> for the battle scenes, and the use of ambient music. An exception was Ronde, which was heavily criticized, particularly for its visuals.|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren was a {{prolific}} artist and produced thousands of original paintings {{in a number}} of diverse styles. This wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics. Some of his typical works are classical still lifes in convincing 17th century manner, Impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches, jocular drawings where the subject is drawn with rather odd features, Surrealistic paintings with combined fore- <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Van Meegeren's portraits, however, are probably his finest works.|$|E
5|$|Despite the game's {{expanded}} memory resources, reviewers {{felt that the}} game's visuals were only marginally—if at all—better than for contemporary games, such as the previous year's Banjo-Kazooie. In fact, IGN felt that Donkey Kong 64 was not as pretty as Banjo-Kazooie, especially in its water <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. IGN hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered the game's dynamic lighting overused. N64 Magazine said that the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable. GameSpot also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.|$|E

5|$|Dual Destinies {{features}} animated cutscenes {{produced by}} the animation studio Bones, which were directed by Seto at Capcom and Kenji Nagasaki at Bones. The scripts for these were drafted by Yamazaki, and included characters' lines {{as well as the}} general events <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds</b> for each scene. After the scripts were written, they were sent to Nagasaki, who drew storyboards for the scenes. When boarding the sequences, he added suggestions for details and nuances; for instance, in the script for one scene, Athena was going to trip and fall over, while Nagasaki suggested and boarded her tumbling down stairs, and added a guard character for her to interact with {{at the end of the}} scene to emphasize how painful the fall had been. After finalizing the scene, the team at Bones worked on the background art; while the courtrooms and defendant lobbies are shown in-game, the courthouse's stairway and main hall had not been shown before, and had to be designed specifically for the cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango mixed static pre-rendered {{background}} {{images with}} 3D characters and objects. Part {{of this decision}} was based on how the calaca figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered; Manny's character alone comprised 250 polygons. The development team found that by utilizing three-dimensional models to pre-render the backgrounds, they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by re-rendering the background, {{instead of having to}} have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Manny's head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally, full motion video cutscenes were incorporated to advance the plot, using the same in-game style for the characters <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds</b> to make them nearly indistinguishable from the actual game.|$|E
5|$|Harmáček began {{creating}} his new cuts in 2010. At the time, he {{was working}} as an English teacher in Plzeň, Czech Republic, and had no professional experience with film editing. Instead, he taught himself as the project progressed, beginning with Photoshop skills that he had developed in college. To remove the post-1977 changes, Harmáček was required {{to go through the}} film frame-by-frame, correcting colors and rotoscoping. Undoing some shots took only an hour, while others took hundreds. Lightsabers were color-corrected, shots of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were cropped, Boba Fett's voice was changed, and CGI characters <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds</b> were removed. Most of the source material used for Harmy's Despecialized Edition was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray release, while other sequences were upscaled from GOUT. To create the cuts, source material was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray releases, HDTV broadcasts of the 2004 DVDs, GOUT, digital broadcasts of the 1997 Special Edition, the 1993 LaserDiscs, digital transfers of a Spanish 35mm Kodak LPP and 70mm film cels, a 16mm print, and still images of the original matte paintings. Harmáček edited these sources together using programs such as Avisynth and Adobe After Effects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} the effective stress-energy tensors for the foreground <b>and</b> <b>background</b> sectors in ghost-free bimetric gravity. By considering the symmetries of the theory, {{we show that}} the foreground <b>and</b> <b>background</b> null energy conditions (NECs) are strongly anti-correlated. In particular, the NECs can only be simultaneously ful-filled when they saturate, corresponding to foreground <b>and</b> <b>background</b> cosmological constants. In all other situations, either the foreground or the background is subject to a NEC-violating contribution to the total stress-energy...|$|R
50|$|The line data is {{gathered}} from the arbitrarily defined signal <b>and</b> <b>background</b> regions <b>and</b> input into an array (refer to image to the right). To calculate the average signal <b>and</b> <b>background</b> values, a second order polynomial is fitted to the array of line data and subtracted from the original array line data. This is done to remove any trends. Finding the mean of this data yields the average signal <b>and</b> <b>background</b> values. The net signal is calculated from the difference of the average signal <b>and</b> <b>background</b> values. The RMS or root mean square noise is defined from the background region. Finally, SNR is determined as {{the ratio of the}} net signal to the RMS noise.|$|R
5|$|The {{thirteen}} episode series premiered in Japan on MBS on April 4, 2013 and {{was subsequently}} licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America, Hanabee Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand and by MVM Entertainment in the United Kingdom for English home video releases. A manga adaptation was serialized in Monthly GFantasy between December 2012 and October 2014. A light novel prequel was also published by Kodansha Box. In addition, two supplementary books and three Drama CDs {{along with a}} host of other merchandise were released. Critics praised the series for its dark animation styles <b>and</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> However the majority of reviewers had mixed feelings towards the cast of characters since they felt that while the characters were either not appealing or developed enough, their deaths were impactful to the viewer.|$|E
