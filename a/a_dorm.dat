5|$|Animal House {{inspired}} Co-Ed Fever, another sitcom {{but without}} {{the involvement of the}} film's producers or cast. Set in <b>a</b> <b>dorm</b> of the formerly all-female Baxter College, the pilot of Co-Ed Fever was aired by CBS on February 4, 1979, but the network canceled the series before airing any more episodes. NBC also had its Animal House-inspired sitcom, Brothers and Sisters, in which three members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC's Delta House, Brothers and Sisters lasted only three months.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, February 7, Murray's father Fred {{arrived in}} Amherst. He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went {{to dinner with}} a friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota Corolla, she returned to campus to attend <b>a</b> <b>dorm</b> party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a guardrail on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. The responding officer wrote an accident report but there is no documentation of sobriety field tests being conducted. She was driven to her father's motel and stayed in his room the rest of the morning. At 4:49 am, there was a cell phone call placed to Murray's boyfriend from Fred's phone. The participants and content of the phone call are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{is home to}} two {{pioneers in}} {{undergraduate}} campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, {{claims to be the}} oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in <b>a</b> <b>dorm</b> room. The station has its studios {{on the second floor of}} Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest Student television station and home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} an airport at Svea arose during the mid 1990s. Store Norske, which had until then been mining coal in Longyearbyen, {{was in the process}} of moving the bulk of its mining {{operations}} to Svea. A road between the two towns was out of the question of environmental reasons. The company proposed that Svea would be built as <b>a</b> <b>dorm</b> town, were workers would commute for the week. They would have their permanent homes and families in Longyearbyen. On 10 April 1994, Store Norske's board stated that they could not support the two main alternatives, construction of an all-new permanent dwelling town in Svea, and commuting from the mainland. Store Norske cited their commitment to keep Longyearbyen a vibrant community.|$|E

Soen even started a small group at the university for people to sit zazen together, a tradition that lives on at the university to this day. Soen's final thesis was on the famous haiku poet, Matsuo Bashō.|$|E
25|$|Rutgers University {{offers a}} variety of housing options. On the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus, {{students}} are given the option of on-campus housing in both traditional dorms or apartments. Freshman students, however, are allowed only <b>a</b> <b>dorm,</b> while upperclassmen have a wider array of on-campus housing choices, like apartments, but must apply for on-campus housing through the Rutgers online lottery process. Despite some overcrowding, most students seeking on-campus housing will be accommodated with a space. Currently Rutgers University is undergoing a series of constructions to expand residence life. Many Rutgers students opt to rent apartments or houses off-campus within the city of New Brunswick. Similar setups {{are to be found in}} Rutgers–Newark and Rutgers–Camden, however a substantial portion of the students on those campuses commute and/or are enrolled on a part-time basis.|$|E
