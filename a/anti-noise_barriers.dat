40|$|BachelorÂ´s thesis {{focuses on}} the {{possibility}} of using the program AutoCAD Civil 3 D to create a digital terrain model of interest locations. Then subsequently the design of linear hydraulic structures which serve as flood protection, as well as <b>anti-noise</b> <b>barriers,</b> retaining walls or for example various modifications of water...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{modification}} of the rail passenger coach floor design aimed at improvement of sound reduction index. Refurbishing was performed by using a new acoustic material with a filamentary microstructure. The materials proposed in research were compared by simulation calculation of acoustic energy transfer trough porous microstructure of filamentary material, {{and the effect of}} material porosity on sound reduction index and sound absorption coefficient were observed. This proposed filamentary material can be used in the railway bed structure, too. High degree of noise absorbing, resistance to climate conditions, low specific mass, enable to choose a system of low <b>anti-noise</b> <b>barriers</b> having similar properties as standard high anti-noise walls. ...|$|E
