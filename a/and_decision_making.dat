A creature forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs {{are attributed to}} lists that store data about various world objects. Desires are goals the creature wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, the creature selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} the mere-exposure effect <b>and</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making,</b> Zajonc states {{that there has been}} no {{empirical}} proof that cognition precedes any form of decision making. While this is a common assumption, Zajonc argues that the opposite is more likely: decisions are made with little to no cognitive process. He equates deciding upon something with liking it, meaning that more often we cognize reasons to rationalize a decision instead of deciding upon it. Therefore, we make judgments first, and then seek to justify those judgments by rationalization.|$|E

Existing approaches to Learning <b>and</b> Collective <b>Decision</b> <b>Making</b> amongst a group of robots is complex. In this paper, we propose a simple model of learning <b>and</b> collective <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> in honey bees engaged in foraging for suitable nectar-sites. Our simple model takes into consideration discrete numbers of bees and considers affects of noise and randomness. We achieve this by using an algorithm for exact stochastic simulation used in physical chemistry. Using this model, we wish to understand the autonomous learning <b>and</b> collective <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> process that a swarm of robots might employ. ...|$|R
