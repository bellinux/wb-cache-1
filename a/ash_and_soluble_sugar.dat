40|$|Premise of the study: Wild-boar soil {{disturbance}} (i. e., rooting) {{increases the}} abundance of some species of geophytes (i. e., plants with underground renewal buds) in upland meadows. However, the mechanisms {{that could lead to}} such enhanced prevalence remain unexplored. Methods: We analyzed the effects of wild-boar disturbance on the size, nutrient (N, P, K, C, <b>and</b> total <b>ash),</b> <b>and</b> nonstructural carbohydrate (<b>soluble</b> <b>sugars,</b> starch plus fructans, and total nonstructural carbohydrate) content of the storage organs of fi ve taxa of upland geophytes. Results were explored in relation to the nutrient availability (total N, available P, and K) in the soil. Key results: Wild-boar rooting increased the size and the nutrient content of the storage organs of geophytes. Such enhanced storage was further promoted by rooting recurrence and intensity. Although we could not detect a direct impact of rooting on soil nutrient concentrations, plants were clearly N limited and such limitation was ameliorated in areas rooted by wild boar. Furthermore, plant-soil interactions for N were different in rooted areas, where plant N-concentrations responded positively to soil N. Conclusions: Geophytes growing in rooted areas have an increased nutrient value, which may promote the revisit of wild boars to previously rooted areas, with further positive feed-back effects on plant quality. This plant-animal interaction may shape upland geophyte communities. © 2013 Botanical Society of America. The authors thank A. Donellan, T. Bork, and J.

40|$|Summary Late-summer starch {{accumulation}} in fine {{roots of}} poplars (Populus × canadensis Moench.) defoliated by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) lagged behind that in fine roots of undefoliated trees. If starch concentration declines with age, defoliation-induced changes in root system age structure could be {{partly responsible for}} this difference. To test this hypothesis, we measured fine-root starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> concentrations in roots of known age from trees in defoliated and undefoliated plots. There was a significant interaction between the effects of defoliation and root type (white, brown, or dead) on fine root <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> concentration {{because of the high}} concentration of <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> in white roots from trees in undefoliated plots. Both root starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> concentrations were variable among individuals of each age class. The population frequency distributions for starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> concentra-tions were both right-skewed, and fit by exponential functions. These data are most consistent with direct defoliation effects on a labile and dynamic pool of carbohydrates in poplar fine roots, rather than indirect defoliation effects on root system age structure...|$|R

Many studies have been devoted to characterizing the factors that. regulate photoassimilate concentrations in different plant species. Most studies examining photoassimilate concentrations in C{sub 3 } plants have focused on analyzing starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars.</b> However, work presented here demonstrates {{that a number of}} C{sub 3 } plants, including the popular model organism Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

In fact, furnaric acid can accumulate to levels of several mg per g fresh weight in A-abidopsis leaves, often exceeding starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> levels. Furnaric acid is a component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and, like starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars,</b> can be metabolized to yield energy and carbon skeletons for production of other compounds.

This research used a completely randomized design with four treatments: A 0 (without AMF), A 1 (without AMF in drought), A 2 (with AMF), and A 3 (with AMF in drought) in S. seabrana. Parameters observed were the soil moisture content, water potential of shoot, relative water content of leaf (RWC), root length, shoot and root dry weight, proline, <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars,</b> crude protein, gas production, and digestibility of organic matter. The data were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the differences between treatments were analyzed with Duncan Multiple Range test. Results showed that inoculation of AMF could enhance leaf water potential, shoot and root dry weight, crude protein, gas production, digestibility of organic matter, but decreased proline <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> significantly (P< 0. 05).

The goal {{of this study was}} to assess the germination and vigor of soybeans seeds of Benso 1 RR and NA 5909 RG cultivars from desiccated plants or not, by mobilizing reserves. Cultivars from desiccated plants or not, by mobilizing reserves. The plants were desiccated with glufosinate ammonium (GLA) in reproductive stage R 7. 1 or not (TST). The physiological seed quality was assessed by germination tests, accelerated aging and seedling length. For the mobilization of reserves were assessed within 48 hours of soaking: phytate, protein <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> contents. In 48 hours of soaking, seeds from desiccated plants in cultivar NA 5909 RG showed lower mobilization of <b>soluble</b> protein <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar,</b> reflecting low vigor seedlings compared to their controls. For cultivar Benso 1 RR, in 48 hours of soaking, the application of GLA did not affect the mobilization of soluble protein when compared to control and did not differ as to vigor.

40|$|Carbon isotope {{discrimination}} (Δ) {{was analyzed}} in leaf starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars,</b> which represent {{most of the}} recently fixed carbon. Plants of three C 3 species (Populus nigra L. × P. deltoides Marsh., Gossypium hirsutum L. and Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were {{kept in the dark}} for 24 hours to decrease contents of starch and sugar in leaves. Then gas exchange measurements were made with constant conditions for 8 hours, and subsequently starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> were extracted for analysis of carbon isotope composition. The ratio of intercellular, pi, and atmospheric, pa, partial pressures of CO 2, was calculated from gas exchange measurements, integrated over time and weighted by assimilation rate, for comparison with the carbon isotope ratios in <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> starch. Carbon isotope discrimination in <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> correlated strongly (r = 0. 93) with pi/pa in all species, as did Δ in leaf starch (r = 0. 84). Starch was found to contain significantly more 13 C than <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar,</b> <b>and</b> possible explanations are discussed. The strong correlation found between Δ and pi/pa suggests that carbon isotope analysis in leaf starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> may be used for monitoring, indirectly, the average of pi/pa weighted by CO 2 assimilation rate, over a day. Because pi/pa has a negative correlation with transpiration efficiency (mol CO 2 /mol H 2 O) of isolated plants, Δ in starch and sugars may be used to predict differences in this efficiency. This new method may be useful in ecophysiological studies and in selection for improved transpiration efficiency in breeding programs for C 3 species...|$|R

In this paper, we report that physiological levels of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> synergistically stimulate accumulation of vsp mRNAs. Treatment of excised mature soybean (Glycine max Merr. cv Williams) leaves with 0. 2 molar sucrose and 10 micromolar MeJA caused a large accumulation of vsp mRNAs, whereas little accumulation occurred when these compounds were supplied separately. In soybean cell suspension cultures, the synergistic effect of sucrose and MeJA on the accumulation of vspB mRNA was maximal at 58 millimolar sucrose and was observed with fructose or glucose substituted for sucrose. In dark-grown soybean seedlings, {{the highest levels of}} vsp mRNAs occurred in the hypocotyl hook, which also contained high levels of MeJA <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars.</b> Lower levels of vsp mRNAs, MeJA, <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> were found in the cotyledons, roots, and nongrowing regions of the stem. Wounding of mature soybean leaves induced a large accumulation of vsp mRNAs when wounded plants were incubated in the light.

The time courses for the accumulation of vsp mRNAs induced by wounding or sucrose/MeJA treatment were similar.

The {{results indicated that the}} maximum optimum concentrations(MOCs) of ammonia-nitrogen for Hydrilla verticillata, Vallisneria natans, Ceratophyllum demersum and Najas minor were 2, 2, 1 mg&# 183;L - 1 and 0. 5 mg&# 183;L - 1 respectively, while the maximum tolerant concentrations(MTCs) were 6, 6, 4 mg&# 183;L - 1 and 2 mg&# 183;L - 1. The relative growth rate of different submerged macrophytes showed the trend of increasing first followed by decreasing with the elevated ammonia-nitrogen levels. The maximum relative growth rates of Hydrilla verticillata, Vallisneria natans, Ceratophyllum demersum and Najas minor occurred at the MOCs of NH 4 + -N, with the values of 1. 21, 0. 94, 0. 52 and 0. 28, respectively. Chlorophyll contents <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> contents in different submerged macrophytes had an increasing trend at the range of MOCs of NH 4 + -N, while there was no significant changes for POD activities. Meanwhile, chlorophyll contents <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> contents changed not significantly, and POD activities were significantly higher than CK, while aquatic ammonia-nitrogen concentration was between MOC and MTC. When aquatic NH 4 + -N was beyond MOT, chlorophyll conents <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> contents decreased, <b>and</b> POD activities reached the maximum values at 7 ~ 21 d and then decreased since then.

We tracked seasonal changes of non-structural carbohydrates (starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars)</b> in leaves, twigs, stems, and coarse roots of the dominant canopy species bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata Michx.) and northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) in 2005 and 2006. Seasonal variation of storage carbohydrates in both species was related to canopy photosynthesis, reproductive events, and leaf phenology. In 2005, we observed an inverse correlation between spring twig starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> concentrations in Q. rubra...|$|R
40|$|Lupine crops (Lupinus albus and L. mutabilis) often {{experience}} water deficits during grain filling, thereby altering partitioning of assimilates. Water deficit, imposed at {{the beginning}} of seed production (15 days after anthesis, daa), brought about differences in assimilate partitioning and chemical composition within the whole plant. In both species, water stress (ws) was responsible for a significant decrease in plant water status and gas exchange. In spite of little effect on total biomass, leaf area was reduced for approximately half of the control treatment. The main effects of ws on chemical composition of different organs were a decrease in total oil and an increase in total <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> content in leaves; an increase in both oil <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> in stems; <b>and</b> a decrease in total oil <b>and</b> total <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> content in seeds. The data suggest that under ws conditions, imposed at flowering, lupine assimilates are stored in stems and pods and later retranslocated to the developing seeds...|$|R
40|$|Starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> are {{the major}} {{photosynthetic}} products, and their carbon isotope signatures reflect external versus internal limitations of CO 2 fixation. There has been recent renewed interest in the isotope composition of carbohydrates, mainly for use in CO 2 flux partitioning studies at the ecosystem level. The major obstacle {{to the use of}} carbohydrates in such studies has been the lack of an acknowledged method to isolate starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> for isotopic measurements. We here report on the comparison and evaluation of existing methods (acid and enzymatic hydrolysis for starch; ion-exchange purification and compound-specific analysis for sugars). The selectivity and reproducibility of the methods were tested using three approaches: (i) an artificial leaf composed of a mixture of isotopically defined compounds, (ii) a C- 4 leaf spiked with C- 3 starch, and (iii) two natural plant samples (root, leaf). Starch preparation methods based on enzymatic or acid hydrolysis did not yield similar results and exhibited contaminations by non-starch compounds. The specificity of the acidic hydrolysis method was especially low, and we therefore suggest terming these preparations as HCl-hydrolysable carbon, rather than starch. Despite being more specific, enzyme-based methods to isolate starch also need to be further optimized to increase specificity. The analysis of sugars by ion-exchange methods (bulk preparations) was fast but produced more variable isotope compositions than compound-specific methods. Compound-specific approaches did not in all cases correctly reproduce the target values, mainly due to unsatisfactory separation of sugars and background contamination. Our study demonstrates that, despite their wide application, methods for the preparation of starch <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> for the analysis of carbon isotope composition are not (yet) reliable enough to be routinely applied and further research is urgently needed to resolve the identified problems.

Results showed that, as far as chlorophyll content is concerned, there is a negative relation between this parameter and the altitude level of the pasture.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to compare effects of high {{temperature}} and drought and to ascertain their interactions on photosynthesis and productivity of wheat. Len plants were uniformly grown in silt-loam soil [surface horizon of Ivan and Kennebec silt loams (fine-silty, mixed, mesic cumulic Hapudolls) ] until anthesis and then subjected to day/night temperatures of 15 / 10, 25 / 20, or 35 / 30 °C and moisture regimes of no drought (field capacity) and drought (- 2. 0 to - 2. 8 MPa plant water potential) in controlled environments until maturity. High temperature hastened {{the decline in}} photosynthetic rate and viable leaf area during maturation, decreased shoot and grain mass and kernel weight <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> content at maturity and reduced water use efficiency. Drought increased stomatal resistance; decreased photosynthesis, viable leaf area, shoot mass, grain mass and kernel weight <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> content <b>and</b> enhanced water use efficiency. Adverse effects were much more pronounced at high temperature than low temperature. Osmotic adjustment to drought was apparently promoted by low temperature of wheat to high temperature would improve its adaptation to regions with elevated temperature and either ample or deficit moisture...|$|R
40|$|Authentication {{and quality}} control of herbs in herbal markets is an {{important}} challenge for practitioners and food and drug organizations. Rapid and simple pharmacognostic evaluations are beneficial to overcome this problem. On the other hand, there is a mist about the scientific names {{of some of these}} herbs even in scientific literatures. Iklil-ul-Malik or Astragalus hamosus L. (Papilionaceae) is one of these medicinal plants. Pharmacognostic (macroscopic, microscopic and phytochemical) properties of Iklil-ul-Malik pods were investigated. Different <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> extractive values were determined. The HPTLC finger prints of the herbs’ fractions were prepared, using different reagents and mobile phases. The fatty acids, steroids, alkene and terpenoids of the pods were investigated by GC-MS analysis. <b>Soluble</b> fatty acid <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> content were determined by spectroscopic methods. Total <b>ash,</b> acid insoluble <b>and</b> water <b>soluble</b> <b>ash</b> were determined to be 75. 00 ± 11. 83, 8. 33 ± 2. 89 and 40. 00 ± 5. 00 mg/g respectively. The extractive values for n-hexane, dichloromethane and ethanol fractions were 0. 77 %, 0. 16 % and 0. 49 % (w/w). Free amino acid <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> contents were respectively 3. 33 ± 0. 001 and 8. 83 ± 0. 004 (w/w %). Polyphenols, triterpenes, glycosides and glycolipids were detected in different fractions. The principal fatty acids were linoleic acid (48. 64 %), linolenic acids (25. 35 %), lauric acid (8. 12 %) and stearic acid (6. 38 %).

40|$|Carbon-isotope ratios ([delta] 13 Cs) were {{measured}} for various bio-chemical fractions quantitatively extracted from naturally exposed and shaded {{leaves of the}} C 3 -Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) intermediate Clusia minor, sampled at dawn and dusk on days during the wet and dry seasons in Trinidad. As the activity of CAM increased in response to decreased availability of water and higher photon flux density, organic acids <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> were enriched in 13 C by approximately 3. 5 to 4 %[per mille (thousand) sign] compared to plants sampled during the wet season. The induction of CAM {{was accompanied by a}} doubling in size of the reserve carbohydrate pools. Moreover, stoichiometric measurements indicated that degradation of both chloroplastic reserves <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> were necessary to supply phosphoenolpyruvate for the synthesis of organic acids at night. Results also suggest that two pools of <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> exist in leaves of C. minor that perform CAM, one a vacuolar pool enriched in 13 C and the second a transport pool depleted in 13 C. Estimates of carbon-isotope discrimination expressed during CAM, derived from the trafficking among inorganic carbon, organic acids, and carbohydrate pools overnight, ranged from 0. 9 to 3. 1 %[per mille (thousand) sign]. The [delta] 13 C of structural material did not change significantly between wet and dry seasons, indicating that most of the carbon used in growth was derived from C 3 carboxylation...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a newly {{appreciated}} {{participant in}} physiological and biochemical regulation in plants. However, whether H 2 S {{is involved in}} the regulation of plant responses to drought stress remains unclear. Here, the role of H 2 S in the regulation of drought stress response in Spinacia oleracea seedlings is reported. First, drought stress dramatically decreased the relative water content (RWC) of leaves, photosynthesis, and the efficiency of PSII. Moreover, drought caused the accumulation of ROS and increased the MDA content. However, the application of NaHS counteracted the drought-induced changes in these parameters. Second, NaHS application increased the water and osmotic potential of leaves. Additionally, osmoprotectants such as proline and glycinebetaine (GB) content were altered by NaHS application under drought conditions, suggesting that osmoprotectant contributes to H 2 S-induced drought resistance. Third, the levels of <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> polyamines (PAs) were increased differentially by NaHS application in S. oleracea seedlings. Moreover, several genes related to PA <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> biosynthesis, as well as betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (SoBADH), choline monooxygenase (SoCMO), and aquaporin (SoPIP 1; 2), were up-regulated by H 2 S under drought stress. These results suggest that H 2 S contributes to drought tolerance in S. oleracea through its effect on the biosynthesis of PAs <b>and</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>sugars.</b> Additionally, GB <b>and</b> trehalose also play key roles in enhancing S. oleracea drought resistance...|$|R

The experiment was arranged as a factorial in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with four replications in greenhouse of College of Agriculture, Tehran University, Iran. The plants inoculated with mycorrhiza had significantly greater shoot and root biomass than the nonmycorrhizal plants at all salinity levels. AM symbiosis decreased membrane relative permeability and malondialdehyde content in shoots <b>and</b> roots. The <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> content in roots was higher in mycorrhizal than nonmycorrhizal plants, {{but there was no}} significant difference in <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> content in shoots between mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants. The results indicate that the AM fungus is capable of alleviating the damage caused by salt stress on soybean plants by reducing membrane lipid peroxidation and increasing the accumulation of <b>soluble</b> <b>sugar</b> content. Consequently, arbuscular mycorrhiza formation highly enhanced the salinity tolerance of soybean plant, which increased host biomass and promoted plant growth...|$|R
