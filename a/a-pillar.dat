25|$|The {{interior}} of the 2014 Shelby GT has been overhauled {{to keep up with}} the latest trends. Unique touches to the interior include an <b>A-pillar</b> gauge pod with boost, and fuel and oil pressure gauges. This modification is only available on the GT/SC conversion.|$|E
25|$|The St. Tropez {{conversion}} {{was designed}} by Paul Bailey and his company PBB Design, which was established in 1987. The conversion involved removing the roof and rear bodywork. The wheel arches were also widened and new Compomotive wheels {{were part of the}} package. The <b>A-pillar</b> and the chassis were reinforced with steel, and a steel subframe was added in the rear.|$|E
2500|$|Riding {{the same}} {{wheelbase}} as the sedan, the liftback was {{identical to the}} sedan from the <b>A-pillar</b> forward and featured a sloping roof (compromising rear headroom) and a hatchback with a more shallow Kammback tail. The rear license plate hid the fuel filler cap. The Spirit offered a generous cruising range with its [...] "fuel tank capacity of 21 gallons and probable fuel mileage of 25 mpg or more... enabling the car's driver to travel over 500 miles between fill ups".|$|E
50|$|<b>A-pillars</b> aren't {{necessary}} {{as there are}} no side doors, so the windscreen can extend from the front {{to the back of}} the car, giving the driver a field of vision of more than 180 degrees and minimising blind spots. <b>A-pillars</b> are sometimes still added, like with the Sterling Nova, to give the car a more conventional look.|$|R
50|$|Appletons (sometimes Appleton spots) — spotlights, {{mounted in}} the <b>A-pillars,</b> {{similar to those used}} by police cars.|$|R

2500|$|In January 1985 another minor {{facelift}} occurred, with new, {{more comfortable}} seats {{and a new}} front grille. The interior also sported more fabric, an improved manual shifter and a half-leather steering wheel on the CT-G. The side mirrors were now mounted in the corner between the door and <b>A-pillar,</b> {{rather than on the}} door itself. The CT-G received body colored bumpers and mirrors, which was optional on lesser versions. Power output was up to , due to a new carburetor. Top speed according to German Auto Katalog was up by five, to [...] The lineup consisted of the CT-G (sporty Turbo), CS-G (sporty NA), CS-D / CS-QD ("deluxe" [...] versions - with a vinyl rear seat nonetheless) and CS / CS-Q (standard version).|$|E
50|$|An <b>A-pillar</b> that {{is split}} up {{and has a}} small {{triangle}} window (Front Quarter glass) can give a short driver visibility problems.Some cars the windshield is fillet with the roof-line with a big radius.A fillet round <b>A-pillar</b> can give a tall driver visibility problems. Also sometimes the <b>A-pillar</b> can block the driver from seeing motorcyclists.|$|E
50|$|Also {{introduced}} {{with the}} 220S was the W105 219, which from the <b>a-pillar</b> forward {{was essentially a}} single-carburettor 220a, but rearward from the <b>a-pillar</b> it used the shorter body of the W120/W121 180/190 models.|$|E

50|$|Because {{there is}} no roof {{connection}} between the A- and B-pillars, the <b>A-pillars</b> of a convertible automobile have to be stronger and even thicker.|$|R

50|$|A {{triangular}} <b>A-pillars</b> with quarter glass, {{as well as}} the spring-loaded pop-up rollover hoops {{behind the}} rear seats, provide additional strength and protection for the convertible body.|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{study investigated the}} relationship between vision obstructions from body pillars and lane-change crashes. The vision obstructions were quantified by measuring, from the driver’s perspective, the horizontal angular sizes and locations of the driver-side A-, B-, and C-pillars. The sample consisted of 21 vehicle models, including 13 passenger cars, 6 SUVs, 1 minivan, and 1 pickup truck. To control for driver differences, going-straight crashes were used for comparison, with the dependent variable being the ratio of lane-change crashes to going-straight crashes. The analysis used North Carolina crash data. The results of a multiple regression indicate that the relative frequency of lanechange crashes tended to increase with both wider <b>A-pillars</b> and with <b>A-pillars</b> located farther away from straight ahead. This finding supports the hypothesis that visibility obstructions due to <b>A-pillars</b> have safety implications. However, a more comprehensive analysis {{would be needed to}} conclusively exclude other factors as potentially accounting for the obtained finding...|$|R
50|$|It is {{a version}} of CLA 180 with reduced fuel consumption. Cd value was reduced to 0.22 via low <b>A-pillar</b> {{shoulder}} with adapted <b>A-pillar</b> geometry, aerodynamically optimised exterior mirror housings and rear shape, optimised diffuser, optimised underbody and rear axle panelling, radiator shutter, aero wheel trims and serrated wheel spoilers {{on the front and}} rear wheel arches.|$|E
50|$|The 219 {{from the}} <b>a-pillar</b> forward was {{identical}} to the long-nosed 220a, including the single-carburettor 2.2 L 6-cylinder engine. However, from the <b>a-pillar</b> back, it used the shorter body of the W120/W121 180/190 models. This can be identified by the one-piece windows in the rear doors, {{as opposed to the}} 220a and 220S having separate quarter windows.|$|E
50|$|If {{the side}} of the window is curved there is less <b>A-pillar</b> reflection.|$|E
50|$|The Fords {{introduced}} for 1955 {{also featured}} the panoramic windshields found on Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs the previous year.With this panoramic windshield the <b>A-pillars</b> have a vertical angle.this gives the driver more panoramic visibility.|$|R
25|$|The ACV30 {{featured}} several {{elements that}} influenced the eventual new Mini of 2001 {{such as the}} black <b>a-pillars,</b> chunky wheel arch detailing and white roof. The concept was attributed to the BMW designer Adrian van Hooydonk and Frank Stephenson.|$|R
50|$|As {{would be}} expected, the GTV {{has a much}} more rigid chassis, up to 64% stiffer, {{although}} considerable work was done on the Spider to reduce the traditional convertible problem of scuttle shake. Spider also features a reinforced <b>A-pillars.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is best if {{the inside}} of the <b>A-pillar</b> has a non-reflecting dark colored surface.|$|E
50|$|Butterfly doors or {{vertical}} {{doors are}} {{a type of}} door sometimes seen on high-performance cars. They are similar to scissor doors. While scissor doors move straight up via hinge points {{at the bottom of}} the <b>A-pillar,</b> butterfly doors move up and out via hinges along the <b>A-pillar.</b> This makes for easier entry/exit at the expense of requiring more opening space than needed for scissor doors.|$|E
50|$|The {{sides of}} a {{panoramic}} windshield are curved, which {{makes it possible to}} design vertical A-pillars that give the driver maximum forward visibility. However, it is impossible to design an aerodynamic small car with a vertical <b>A-pillar</b> because the more vertical the <b>A-pillar</b> is, the less space the door opening has, and the greater frontal area and coefficient of drag the vehicle will have.|$|E
50|$|The ACV30 {{featured}} several {{elements that}} influenced the eventual new Mini of 2001 {{such as the}} black <b>a-pillars,</b> chunky wheel arch detailing and white roof. The concept was attributed to the BMW designer Adrian van Hooydonk and Frank Stephenson.|$|R
25|$|Police cars, {{emergency}} vehicles, {{and those}} competing in road rallies are sometimes {{equipped with an}} auxiliary lamp, sometimes called an alley light, in a swivel-mounted housing attached to one or both <b>a-pillars,</b> directable by a handle protruding through the pillar into the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Other {{than the}} Purvis Eureka (a {{licensed}} {{copy of the}} Nova) and the Bond Bug, the Nova is the only production car to date to use a front-hinged canopy door. The windscreen has small <b>A-pillars</b> {{so it looks like}} a conventional car when the canopy is closed.|$|R
50|$|The {{designer}} {{cites the}} split <b>A-pillar</b> as a notable element {{contributing to the}} interior's open feel, visibility and sense of transparency.|$|E
50|$|From the <b>A-pillar</b> {{back the}} car's chassis is unique, but trim and engine models {{remain the same}} as on the {{standard}} Qashqai.|$|E
50|$|The {{angle of}} the <b>A-pillar</b> is flatter than the {{windshield}} angle. The cargo capacity of the W169 was increased by 15 percent compared with the W168.|$|E
50|$|Based on the mid-engined, {{rear wheel}} drive MG F, the ACV30 {{featured}} several elements that influenced the eventual new Mini of 2001 such as the black <b>a-pillars,</b> chunky wheel arch detailing and white roof. The concept was attributed to the BMW designer Adrian van Hooydonk and Frank Stephenson.|$|R
5000|$|In 1934 the {{bodywork}} was upgraded. The new {{and much}} vaunted [...] "Panoramique" [...] versions had a three-piece front windscreen. The main screen was still conventionally flat, but the <b>A-pillars</b> were distinguished by narrow curved glass panels. Cars thus equipped carried in their names the suffix [...] "RL-N".|$|R
5000|$|The {{removable}} roof {{consists of two}} carbon fiber panels, weighing 6 kg each, which required the reinforcement of the rear pillar {{to compensate for the}} loss of structural integrity as well as to accommodate the rollover protection and ventilation systems for the engine. The panels are easily removable and are stored in the front luggage compartment. The Aventador Roadster has a unique engine cover design and an attachable wind deflector to improve cabin airflow at high speed as well as a gloss black finish in the <b>A-pillars,</b> windshield header, roof panels, and rear window area. The car has a [...] base price. With a total weight of 1625 kg it's only 50 kg heavier than the coupé (the weight of the roof, plus additional stiffening in the sills and <b>A-pillars).</b>|$|R
