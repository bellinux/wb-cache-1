2500|$|Clinton blamed Arafat {{after the}} failure of the talks, stating, [...] "I regret that in 2000 Arafat missed the {{opportunity}} to bring that nation into being and pray for the day when the dreams of the Palestinian people for a state and a better life will be realized in a just and lasting peace." [...] The failure to come to an agreement was widely attributed to Yasser Arafat, as he walked away from the table without making a concrete counter-offer and because Arafat did little to quell the series of Palestinian riots that began shortly after the summit. Arafat was also accused of scuttling the talks by Nabil Amr, a former minister in the Palestinian Authority. In My Life, Clinton wrote that Arafat once complimented Clinton by telling him, [...] "You are a great man." [...] Clinton responded, [...] "I am not a great man. I am a failure, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>made</b> me one." ...|$|E
2500|$|McFly {{have been}} cited as having {{influenced}} a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>made</b> us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band {{in the world right}} now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because you feel like a veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, so it was really nice to have the chance to talk to them about their experiences. They've been so successful because they've managed to be themselves from the start. There aren't any egos, you know? I think that's really important in a band." ...|$|E
