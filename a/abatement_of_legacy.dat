40|$|In 2010, the world’s {{buildings}} {{accounted for}} approximately 19 % of all greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions stem {{from both the}} construction and operation of buildings. In recent years the carbon efficiency of energy sources and energy efficiency of new buildings has been improved in Sweden. Therefore, embodied emissions accounts for an increasing share {{of the life cycle}} emissions of new buildings. This study aims to asses the cost effectiveness in <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> embodied emissions. This was done by assessing the embodied emissions of a case building and several conventional design measures along with the implication on production cost. It was found that many of the measures enabled cost effective carbon abatement. Embodied emissions could be reduced by 15 % using cost neutral or nearly cost neutral measures. Abatements up to 18 % were found cost effective in relation to <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide emissions in other sectors. Abatements up to 24 % were possible with minor increases in total production cost (0. 22 %) even though some of the individual measures were found expensive in relation to <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide emissions in other sectors. Some measures entailed increased floor area that could potentially lead to economic gain where exterior area is a limiting factor. Acoustic requirements were found to be a limiting factor in <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> embodied emissions...|$|R

The non-CO 2 gases offer many low-cost abatement options and this reduces the need for <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 to stabilise climate change. Multi-gas flexibility may be important if climate policies reflect not only long-term stabilisation, but also {{the rate at which the}} climate changes, as the latter may require large reductions in emissions in the short-term. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{treatment of}} wastewater contaminated by organic pollutants was performed under a continuous mode by using, {{for the first}} time, various micro-electrochemical cells in series. A synthetic solution of acid orange 7 (AO 7), a largely used azoic dye, was chosen as model wastewater. Both the electro-Fenton (EF) method with a cheap compact graphite cathode and electrochemical oxidation (EO) at a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode were used. EO gave higher <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> total organic carbon (TOC), but drastically higher energetic consumptions than EF. It is worth mentioning that very different operating conditions were set for EF and EO to optimize their performances. The utilization of three cells in series, all working with EO, allowed {{an increase in the}} abatement, but gave rise to quite high energetic consumptions. Conversely, in the case of EF, the utilization of three reactors in series gave rise to a slight increase in the <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> the TOC, because of the formation of products that are resistant to EF. The utilization of two reactors in series, devoted respectively to EF and EO, each working at optimized operating conditions, gave very good figures of merit in terms <b>of</b> the <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> TOC and energetic consumption. In particular, high <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> TOC coupled with drastically lower energetic consumptions than that achieved by the sole EO process were obtained. The effects of current density, flow rate, and initial concentration of AO 7 on the process were investigated...|$|R
