40|$|Reynolds-averaging of the Navier-Stokes {{equations}} is {{an approach}} to derive equations <b>of</b> motion for <b>averaged</b> quantities <b>of</b> the flow field. The treatment <b>of</b> <b>averaged</b> quantities in fluid dynamics is justified with the ratio of masses and eigentimes being generally large between a body subject to flow forces and the particles of the fluid itself. A given state of the flow-field exhibits an averaged effect on its surrounding. Contrary, {{the development of a}} turbulent flow-field itself is determined by the interaction of fluid elements of comparable masses and eigentimes. Therewith, the <b>averaging</b> <b>of</b> the equations of motion describing the evolution of the flow-field is not immediately reasoned for. While for linear processes the <b>averaging</b> <b>of</b> physical quantities does directly carry through to the <b>averaging</b> <b>of</b> the underlying equations of motion it is a topic of concern for non-linear processes.
