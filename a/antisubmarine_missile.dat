500|$|In 1954, the Long Range Objectives Group of the United States Navy {{suggested}} {{converting the}} Iowa-class ships to BBGs. In 1958, the Bureau of Ships offered a proposal {{based on this}} idea. This replaced the 5- and 16-inch gun batteries with [...] "two Talos twin missile systems, two RIM-24 Tartar twin missile systems, an RUR-5 ASROC <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>missile</b> launcher, and a Regulus II installation with four missiles", as well as flagship facilities, sonar, helicopters, and fire-control systems for the Talos and Tartar missiles. In addition to these upgrades, [...] of additional fuel oil was also suggested to serve in part as ballast for the battleships and for use in refueling destroyers and cruisers. Due to the estimated cost of the overhaul ($178–$193 million) this proposal was rejected as too expensive; instead, the SCB suggested a design with one Talos, one Tartar, one ASROC and two Regulus launchers and changes to the superstructure, {{at a cost of}} up to $85million. This design was later revised to accommodate the Polaris Fleet Ballistic Missile, which in turn resulted in a study of two schemes by the SCB. In the end, none of these proposed conversions for the battleships were ever authorized. Interest in converting the Iowas into guided-missile battleships began to deteriorate in 1960, because the hulls were considered too old and the conversion costs too high. Nonetheless, additional conversion proposals—including one to install the AN/SPY-1 Aegis Combat System radar on the battleships—were suggested in 1962, 1974 and 1977, but as before, these proposals failed to gain the needed authorization. This was due, in part, to the possibility that sensitive electronics within [...] of any 16-inch gun muzzle may be damaged from overpressure.|$|E

50|$|The navy lacked its own air arm and {{depended}} on the air force for maritime reconnaissance and protection against submarines. The air force's equipment that supported the navy included twelve Gazelle and five Sea King helicopters mounted with antiship and <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>missiles.</b> In mid-1988 the air force also took delivery {{of the first of}} six Grumman E-2c Hawkeye aircraft with search and side-looking radar for maritime surveillance purposes.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of missile-equipped warships, the term missile [...] "magazine" [...] has also been applied to the storage area for guided {{missiles}} on the ship, usually carried below the main decks of the warships. For ships with both forward and aft surface-to-air missile launchers, {{there are at least}} two missile magazines. Sometimes the magazines of guided-missile frigates and guided-missile destroyers have carried or do carry a mixture of various types of missiles: surface-to-air <b>missiles,</b> <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>missiles</b> such as the ASROC missile, and antiship missiles such as the Harpoon missile. See especially the s, owned by several different navies around the world, in which one 40-missile magazine carries a mixture of all three types of missiles: surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and surface-to-underwater.|$|R

For two days, she and eighteen other ships demonstrated air operations, <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare, guided <b>missile</b> operations, and the Navy's latest bombing and strafing techniques. Highlighting the President's visit was the nonstop flight of two F8U Crusaders, spanning the nation in three hours and twenty-eight minutes, from [...] off the West Coast to the flight deck of Saratoga in the Atlantic.|$|R
