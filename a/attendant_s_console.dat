25|$|The SIMD vector {{processor}} (VMX128) was modified for the Xbox {{to include a}} dot-product instruction. The dot-product instruction took far less latency than discrete instructions.

This led to an approximate 50 percent savings in required band-width and memory footprint making the CPU having a theoretical peak performance of 115.2GFLOPS, being capable of 9.6 billion dot products per second. Each core of the CPU was capable of simultaneous multithreading and was clocked at 3.2GHz. However, to reduce CPU die size, complexity, cost, and power demands, the processor used in-order execution in contrast to the Intel Coppermine 128-based Pentium III used in the original Xbox, which used more complex out of order execution. The original chip used a 90nm process, although a newer 65nm process SOI revision was implemented on later models, which was in-turn superseded by a 45nm combined CPU and GPU chip. A 21.6GB/s front side bus, aggregated 10.8GB/s upstream and downstream, connected Xenon with the graphics processor/northbridge. Xenon was equipped with an 8th way set associative 1MB Level 2 cache on-die running at half CPU clock speed. This cache was shared amongst the three CPU cores. Each core had separate L1 caches, each containing a two-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 instruction cache and a four-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 data cache. The write-through data cache did not allocate cache lines on writes. The CPU also contained ROM storing Microsoft private encrypted keys, used to decrypt game data. The heat sink implemented to cool the Xenon CPU was composed of aluminum fins with a copper base, and a heat pipe. Newer revisions, which had a smaller core, do not feature the heat pipe or copper base. The heat sink was cooled by two 70mm fans {{at the rear of the}} console on original-style consoles, while a single fan mounted on the side of the consoles was used in Xbox 360 <b>S</b> <b>consoles.</b> There were several types of fan used in Xbox 360s, which were produced by Nidec, Sunon and Delta Electronics.|$|R

If there is a loss of signal and the crew is unable to communicate with the ground, a CMO would be expected to carry out medical procedures without the aid of a FS. In these situations, performance support tools can be used to reduce errors and time to perform emergency medical tasks. Human factors personnel at Johnson Space Center have recently investigated medical performance support tools for CMOs on-orbit, and FSs on the ground. This area of research involved the feasibility of Just-in-time (JIT) training techniques and concepts for real-time medical procedures. In Phase 1, preliminary feasibility data was gathered for two types of prototype display technologies: a hand-held PDA, and a Head Mounted Display (HMD). The PDA and HMD were compared while performing a simulated medical procedure using ISS flight-like medical equipment. Based on the outcome of Phase 1, including data on user preferences, further testing was completed using the PDA only. Phase 2 explored a wrist-mounted PDA, and compared it to a paper cue card. For each phase, time to complete procedures, errors, and user satisfaction were captured. Information needed by the FS during ISS mission support, especially for an emergency situation (e. g. fire onboard ISS), may be located in many different places around the FS <b>s</b> <b>console.</b> A performance support tool prototype is being developed to address this issue by bringing all of the relevant information together in one place.

The space medical training work is part of the Human Factors in Training Directed Research Project (DRP) of the Space Human Factors Engineering (SHFE) Project under the Space Human Factors and Habitability (SHFH) Element of the Human Research Program (HRP). This is a joint project consisting of human factors team from the Ames Research Center (ARC) with Immanuel Barshi as Principal Investigator and the Johnson Space Center (JSC). Human factors researchers at JSC have recently investigated medical performance support tools for CMOs on-orbit, and FSs on the ground, and researchers at the Ames Research Center performed a literature review on medical errors. Work on medical training has been conducted in collaboration with the Medical Training Group at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) and with Wyle Laboratories that provides medical training to crew members, biomedical engineers (BMEs), and to flight surgeons under the Bioastronautics contract. One area of research building on activities from FY 08, involved the feasibility of just-in-time (JIT) training techniques and concepts for real-time medical procedures.

During this time, copepods 2 ̆ 7 numerical dominance resulted from the same species assemblage, including large Mixodiaptomus laciniatus (W. Lilljeborg 1889) and Cyclops abyssorum (G. O.

40|$|Preface: For the {{purposes}} of this study an institution is defined as a formal framework or organization through which men pool their efforts and resources to accomplish specific purposes. Included in this framework is the pattern of organization and authority, the legal structure and the governmental rules and regulations that must be adhered to during the process of reaching the stated goals. The institutions related to water resources are many and varied and include: political governments (state, county, city, etc.); subdivisions of government created by legislative consent such as irrigation districts, special improvement districts, metropolitan water companies (a department in city government); private organizations created by legislative consent such as domestic water utilities, mutual irrigation companies (a special form of corporation), water users association; and gargantuan organizations stemming from the federal government such as the Bureau of Reclamation, the Soil Conservation Service, and the Corps of Engineers. All of the organizations have built-in restrictions and constraints that influence the type of service rendered and the attitudes and motivation of the people who serve. One glaring conclusion that this research have brought to light is that the type of organization does make a difference. Many of the inefficiencies in water use, wasteful water practices, mismanagement of water enterprises, unjust allocation of water resources, long-term public debt and the high cost of public investment into needed or needless projects, can be attributed to the type of organization with the <b>attendant</b> fence <b>s,</b> barriers, internal motivating functions, and policies engendered and perpetuated by it. It can be argued that the organizations are only as effective as the people within the organization, but this study would indicate that in some respects the opposite is more nearly the truth – that the people are only as effective and as efficient as the organization will let them be. Perhaps the political economists have an answer as to why this happens – that it does happen is the conclusion of this study. It has been said that even at the top levels of major water development agencies, new individuals with previous backgrounds in other industries, within a short time take on the policies and direction of the agency and become its advocate. The Bureau of Reclamation, for example, has changed its policies very little in 70 years – but men have changed their policies to fit the Bureau. Similarly, many have chastised the poor, ignorant farmer for the waste and inefficiency in small mutual irrigation companies. This study would suggest that the inefficiency is in the organization – not the farmer. As a final point, the nature and magnitude of the problem must be mentioned. Recognizing that a problem is of organizational origin is on thing – changing that organization is another problem. Knowing where the problem lies will help to formulate a solution. Efforts to have people change against the established purposes and procedures of an organization have usually failed. Rearranging the organizational structure, however, can so shift emphasis and incentives that the desired ends can be accomplished. Maybe, with a new awareness, changing the organizational structure will not be so difficult...|$|R

40|$|THEME: Internationalism: Worlds at Play This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} into {{the early history of}} computer and video games in New Zealand. It focuses in on the anomalies of the availability and supply of game systems to this small nation, and its burgeoning market of players, particularly in the 1970 s and 80 <b>s.</b> Several early <b>consoles</b> (the Vectrex, Coleco and Intellivision) were not released in New Zealand. At the same time, however, there was a significant local production scene. At last count, six different companies were involved in arcade machine manufacture, and there are at least four different early consoles that were made in New Zealand (Sportronic, Tunix, Fountain, Videosport). Handhelds were both imported from Asia and (part) manufactured locally. On the microcomputing front, an important early site for home gaming and the programming of games, computers like the Sega SC- 3000 (which made it into few markets outside of Japan) were a big success in New Zealand, spawning several magazines and many user’s groups. This illustrated paper will present an overview of this largely unknown history. It draws on in depth archival research, interviews with key industry participants and collectors. It will discuss why the availability of games in this market differed from more mainstream ones, and what some of the factors were that contributed to game technologies finding their markets (or not). These include the small size of the overall market, a lack of distributors, local tax restrictions and import licensing, and the practice of ‘dumping’ excess stock. These factors not only ensured a time lag between when games were released internationally and in New Zealand, they also seem to have created the conditions for a local manufacturing scene. Also significant are the resemblances between local products and internationally recognisable ones: the locally written ‘clones’ of classic games like "Scramble" and "Panic" whose relations to the ‘original’ need to be understood in terms of homage and esteem as well as being functions of what was technically possible. Local programmers drew inspiration from others’ concepts, as distinct from their code.

To a large extent this singular view which privileges Elvis as the rock and roll icon of the 19502 ̆ 7 <b>s,</b> <b>attendant</b> on the rise of youth culture and the developing national mass media, eclipsed not only the wider audience response to the popular Elvis in the 19602 ̆ 7 s and 19702 ̆ 7 s, but also obscured our view of the phenomenon in the decade following Elvis 2 ̆ 7 death.

The social dimension of the attachment is crucial; Elvis is not only perceived as a peer, but is celebrated as such. Elvis is their hero of the American dream: unlike others, he inverts the standard mobility pattern, thus affirming the dignity and worth of those generally ignored or despised in American society. ...|$|R
