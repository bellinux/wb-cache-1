5|$|Bregowine (died August 764) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Little {{is known of}} his origins or his {{activities}} as archbishop, although a number of stories were told about his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066. There are no records of him prior to his becoming archbishop. He possibly owed his elevation to the Kentish monarch. The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about disputes over land, but knowledge {{of his time in}} office is hampered by the destruction of many of the contemporary records. After his death, he was considered a saint and a life <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> written in the 12thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The {{first signs}} of a {{rehabilitation}} were seen during Leonid Brezhnev's rule, when information <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> again allowed {{to be included in}} Soviet encyclopaedias. His connection, support and work in the Anti-Party Group was mentioned in encyclopaedias published in 1973 and 1974, but eventually disappeared altogether by the mid-to-late-1970s. Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko further rehabilitated Molotov; in 1984 Molotov was even allowed to seek membership in the Communist Party. A collection of interviews with Molotov from 1985 was published in 1994 by Felix Chuev as Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics. In June 1986, Molotov was hospitalized in Kuntsevo hospital in Moscow and he died, during the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev, on 8 November 1986. During his long life Molotov suffered seven myocardial infarctions, but lived to 96 years and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow.|$|E

500|$|Jones met Alex Seropian in {{his second}} year at the University of Chicago, {{studying}} computer science. In 1991 Seropian had founded Bungie and published his own game, Operation Desert Storm. Seropian was looking for another game to publish, and they decided to work together to finish Minotaur. While Seropian did design and marketing, Jones finished the programming. [...] shipped in April 1992; while the game sold only around 2,500 copies (it required a then-rare modem for network play), it developed a devoted following. After publishing Minotaur, Jones and Seropian formed a partnership; [...] "What I liked <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> that he never wasted any money", Jones said of his partner.|$|E
500|$|While free on bail, Vicious smashed a {{beer mug}} {{in the face}} of Todd Smith, Patti Smith's brother, and was arrested again on an assault charge. On 9 December 1978 he was sent to Rikers Island jail, where he spent 55 days and {{underwent}} enforced cold-turkey detox. He was released on 1 February 1979; sometime after midnight, following a small party to celebrate his release, Vicious died of a heroin overdose, aged 21. Reflecting on the event, Lydon said, [...] "Poor Sid. The only way he could live up to what he wanted everyone to believe <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> to die. That was tragic, but more for Sid than anyone else. He really bought his public image." ...|$|E

500|$|Harvey {{played his}} first game aged nine as a wicket-keeper in the North Fitzroy Central School team, {{the average age of}} which was 14. In a school final, he once made 112 of the total of 140. Aged twelve, he joined the local Fitzroy club and rose to the first grade team when he was fourteen. By this stage he had {{transferred}} to Collingwood Technical School. On the advice of the Victorian coach, Arthur Liddicut, Harvey stopped wicket-keeping to focus on his batting. Joe Plant another Fitzroy veteran also gave advice on batting. Both Liddicut and Plant identified Harvey's potential as a batsman." [...] What they liked <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> his modesty, his eagerness to pick up every point in the game, and his willingness to listen to the old hands." [...] Briefly playing for Fitzroy Football Club, Harvey gave up the sport and played baseball during winter. After leaving school, Harvey worked as an apprentice fitter and turner for the Melbourne City Council. The apprenticeship was supposed to take three years, but it eventually took six years because Harvey's cricket career caused frequent absences.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the efforts}} {{of his family and}} friends, {{information}} about Siwiec became known to the anti-communist Solidarność opposition in Poland by the 1980s. A brochure <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> published in 1981. After the fall of communism, Siwiec became the subject of the 1991 documentary film Hear My Cry (Usłyszcie mój krzyk), by Polish director Maciej Drygas. The film won several awards including the European Film Awards [...] "Felix" [...] prize for [...] "Best Documentary" [...] that year. Drygas, who is credited with reconstructing and popularizing Siwiec's story, remarked that compared to other similar incidents of that time, such as the self-immolations of Palach or Romas Kalanta, Siwiec death's is unique in how little attention it attracted. Jan Nowak-Jeziorański, the director of the Polish section of Radio Free Europe, expressed a similar sentiment: [...] "This was an unheard of human tragedy... The tragedy lay in that his sacrifice went completely unnoticed." [...] In the same vein, Kavaliauskas interprets Drygas' movie as a critique of contemporary Polish society, saying that witnesses did not want to have this incident spoil their enjoyment of the festival on an otherwise [...] "perfect day".|$|E

2500|$|Finding on {{his return}} to Decca that other {{recording}} producers were capably filling his former role, Culshaw concentrated on the emerging stereophonic recording technology, and stereo opera in particular. A year after his return he was made manager of the company's classical recording division, a position of great influence in the classical music world. The Gramophone obituarist wrote of him in 1980: [...] "To meet John Culshaw for the first time, quiet, charming, sharp-eyed but with no signs of aggressiveness <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> <b>was</b> to marvel that here {{was one of the}} two great dictators of recording art. If Walter Legge in a flash had one registering extrovert forcefulness in the very picture of a dictator, John Culshaw's comparable dominance was something to appreciate over a longer span. … e transformed the whole concept of recording." ...|$|E

2500|$|In her {{review of}} {{the first six months}} of 2010 in British soap operas, Ruth Deller from lowculture.co.uk wrote about Leon, [...] "As someone who didn't watch E20 and {{therefore}} has no idea what backstory, if any, these characters had, Leon is probably the worst of the new gang – no family on the square, no distinctive personality, no plotline beyond impregnating Lucy Beale. The most interesting thing <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> when it looked like Peter Beale had run him over , and even that turned out to be nothing. [...] can't say eon will be missed." [...] A writer for The Northern Echo wondered if Leon, along with Fatboy and Zsa Zsa, brought a new injection of life into the soap or took away screen time from more established characters. In May 2010, Attwater received a nomination in the [...] "Best Soap Newcomer" [...] category at the 14th TVChoice Awards for his portrayal of Leon.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the great}} tragic Shakespearean roles, however, Tree was overshadowed by earlier actors such as Henry Irving. [...] During performance, Tree allowed {{inspiration}} {{to suggest to}} him appropriate stage business, which sometimes lead to inconsistent interpretations in his portrayals of a role. The Manchester Guardian wrote, [...] "The wonderful thing <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> his amazing versatility, {{and there was an}} intellectual virility, an untiring earnestness about the man, which was irresistibly stimulating." [...] Tree's versatility, however, was a two edged sword: he quickly tired of characters after a brief run and sought to add business and details to the part to sustain his interest, which led to further character inconsistencies in long runs. [...] Tree's voice was described as thin, and he was sometimes criticised for struggling to project it in a manner that made his performance seem unnatural. [...] In the last decade of his career, Tree's technique was seen as mannered and old fashioned. [...] His spectacles, too, in comparison with the experimental methods of Poel and other producers, seemed outdated, although Tree responded to his critics by noting that his productions remained profitable and well attended.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the only}} person capable of {{controlling}} Puyi, Johnston had much more influence than his title of English tutor would suggest as the eunuchs began to rely upon Johnston to steer Puyi away from his more capricious moods. When the 14 year-old Puyi had some western-style clothing purchased to wear from a theater company, Johnston flew into a rage, saying that Puyi was wearing cheap clothing unworthy of an emperor, and had Puyi buy expensive clothes from a western-style department store, telling Puyi [...] "If you wear clothes from a second-hand shop, you won't be a gentleman, you'll be..." [...] with Puyi noting {{he was unable to}} finish his sentence. Under Johnston's influence, Puyi started to insist that his eunuchs address him as [...] "Henry" [...] and later his wife Wanrong as [...] "Elizabeth" [...] as Puyi began to speak [...] "Chinglish"-a mixture of Mandarin and English that was to be his preferred model of speech. Puyi recalled about Johnston: [...] "I thought everything <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> first-rate. He made me feel that Westerners were the most intelligent and civilized people in the world and that he was the most learned of Westerners" [...] and that [...] "Johnston had become the major part of my soul". In May 1919, Puyi noticed the protests in Beijing generated by the May 4th movement as thousands of Chinese university students protested against the decision by the great powers at the Paris peace conference to award the former German concessions in Shangdong province together with the former German colony of Qingdao to Japan. For Puyi, the May 4th movement, which he asked Johnston about, was a revelation as it marked {{the first time in his}} life that he noticed that people outside the Forbidden City had concerns that were not about him.|$|E
