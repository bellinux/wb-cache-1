Lung cancer {{is the leading cause of}} death, breast cancer is the second leading cause of death and {{colorectal}} cancer is the third leading cause of death. The 1 E 10 <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>vaccine</b> is a new immunotherapeutic agent, registered for lung cancer by the Center for Molecular Immunology (CIM). You want to evaluate the safety of this vaccine in the treatment of various cancer sites. To determine the safety adverse events occurred in six clinical trials (one stage I lung, 3 phase II in breast, colon and lung, 1 phase II-III and program expanded use, both in lung) were evaluated. 656 patients were studied. Demographic variables, the characteristics of the disease and adverse events were measured. The studies were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics. The most common adverse events were local reactions associated with 1 E 10 <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>vaccine</b> and systemic reactions of mild or moderate intensity that were not related to the administration of the vaccine under study. The 1 E 10 <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>vaccine</b> is safe for the low frequency and intensity of adverse events reported...|$|E

40|$|Cancer {{vaccines}} are {{conceived as}} therapeutic tools, {{in contrast to}} the prophylactic vaccines used to fight against infectious diseases. Among the most potent therapeutic <b>vaccines,</b> <b>anti-idiotype</b> vaccination is directed against the tumor idiotype, the only well-characterized tumor antigen displayed in neoplastic B-cells. <b>Anti-idiotype</b> <b>vaccines</b> have demonstrated clinical benefit against follicular lymphoma and are currently being evaluated in two different phase III clinical trials.

40|$|Abstract Cancer {{vaccines}} {{are currently}} conceived as therapeutic tools, {{in contrast to}} the prophylactic vaccines that have resolved the problem of a number of infectious diseases. Among the former, <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>vaccines</b> for human follicular lymphoma have begun to produce tangible clinical results. Just 10 years ago it was not even known whether patients could be immunized against their own tumor antigens and now as many as two independent Phase III clinical trials based on this finding are underway. The rapidity of this development encourages the hope that active immunotherapy may soon become decisive in oncology. For the time being, many important results have already been achieved: the evidence of vaccine-induced, tumor-specific humoral/cellular responses and the first documented molecular remissions following vaccination...|$|R
40|$|The present {{status of}} {{vaccination}} for controlling viral diseases is reviewed, {{and the needs}} and directions for future investigations are discussed. A survey of viral vaccines now in use has shown that knowledge about the viral agents and about the hosts' responses to infection was essential for their development. The steps needed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a viral vaccine are summarized; the final requirement for a successful vaccine is that it be administered in proper dosage and potency to the target populations. After general remarks on {{the proper use of}} current vaccines there follows an overview of various developments in creating new vaccines, along with the predicted time-frames for their coming into general use. Topics considered include vaccines to be administered locally at the portal of entry, subunit vaccines, viruses attenuated by genetic manipulation, use of viral vectors, vaccines developed by means of recombinant DNA, synthetic peptides, and <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>vaccines,</b> as well as new vaccines being developed by more conventional methods...|$|R

40|$|Neu-glycolyl (NeuGc) {{containing}} gangliosides {{are attractive}} targets for immunotherapy with anti-idiotype mAbs, because these glycolipids are not normal {{components of the}} cytoplasmatic membrane in humans, but their expression has been demonstrated in several human malignant tumors. Racotumomab is an anti-idiotype mAb specific to P 3 mAb, an antibody which reacts to NeuGc-containing gangliosides, sulfatides and other antigens expressed in tumors. Preparations containing racotumomab were able to induce a strong antimetastatic effect in tumor-bearing mice. Different Phase I clinical trials have been conducted in patients with advanced melanoma, breast cancer and lung cancer. The results of these clinical trials demonstrated the low toxicity and the high immunogenicity of this vaccine. The induced antibodies recognized and directly killed tumor cells expressing NeuGcGM 3. A Phase II/III multicenter, controlled, randomized, double blind clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of aluminum hydroxide-precipitated racotumomab vaccine in overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The clinical {{results of this study}} showed a significant clinical benefit in the patients who were treated with the <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>vaccine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Key words Conventional {{treatment}} of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) has apparently reached a plateau of effectiveness {{in improving the}} survival of the patients. For that reason the search for new therapeutic strategies in this type of tumor is justified. 1 E 10 is an antiidiotype murine monoclonal antibody (Ab 2 MAb) specific to P 3 Ab 1 MAb, which reacts with NeuGc-containing gangliosides, sulfatides and with antigens expressed in some tumors, including those from the lung. We report the treatment with aluminum hydroxideprecipitated 1 E 10 MAb of 34 stage IIIb and 37 stage IV NSCLC patients. These patients were treated with the <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>vaccine,</b> after received standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in a compassionate-use basis study. Patients received five bi-weekly injections of 1 mg of 1 E 10 /Alum, other 10 doses at 28 -day intervals and later the patients who maintained a good performance status continued to be immunized at this same time interval. No evidence of unexpected or serious adverse effects was reported. The median survival time of the 56 patients who entered the study with partial response o...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of the limits encountered with current therapies and the increased knowledge of immunology have opened perspectives {{for the use of}} immunomodulators in the management of lung cancer patients. Both humoral and cellular immunity are now evaluated in diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against tumour-associated antigens are now tested with various imaging techniques to improve detection and staging of lung cancer. MoAbs are also used in therapeutic clinical trials as: 1) mediators of immune effector function; 2) carriers of cytotoxic agents; 3) agents to block tumour growth factor; or 4) <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Immune effector cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, T- and B-lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils, are present either within or around tumours and are likely {{to play a role in}} cancer. These cells, either alone or with cytokines, could provide new efficient therapeutic approaches, particularly if immunosuppression is involved in tumour progression. In this context, most recent studies using immune cells and molecular bioengineering, could provide additional antitumoral effects. Finally, the discovery of several tumour rejection antigens has revived the dream of designing tumour vaccines and active specific immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Active {{immunotherapy}} is {{an interesting}} field from the industry’s perspective {{and in the last}} years, regulatory agencies and the medical community have showed renewed expectations and interest in cancer vaccines. The development of new immune therapies offers many challenges, and this is reflected in the small number of phase III trials showing clear benefits. Traditional concepts applied in clinical trials for the development of chemotherapeutic agents may be inadequate for immunotherapies and a new paradigm is emerging. It is possible that organized efforts and funding will accelerate the development of therapeutically effective cancer vaccines. This article reviews the attributes of cancer vaccines which make them attractive from the industry&# 180;s perspective, and focuses especially in the characteristics of Racotumomab, an <b>anti-idiotype</b> antibody <b>vaccine...</b>|$|R
40|$|By using a {{gnotobiotic}} rat {{model system}} {{to study the}} induction of protective immune responses by <b>anti-idiotype</b> (anti-id) <b>vaccines</b> specific for antibodies directed at the cariogenic microorganism Streptococcus mutans, it was shown that administration of such an anti-id vaccine provided partial protection against dental caries after challenge with virulent microorganisms. Protective effects were first demonstrated by direct parenteral administration of the anti-id vaccine into salivary gland regions, as determined by reductions in microbial colonization and caries scores. Subsequently, the anti-id was incorporated into liposomes and administered by gastric intubation. Immunization by this regimen also resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} caries as well as S. mutans colonization of the oral cavity, with concomitant increases in salivary immunoglobulin A anti-S. mutans antibodies. These data provide evidence that anti-id vaccines specifically targeted at the secretory immune system can induce protective immune responses to pathogens of mucosal surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Aberrant {{accumulation}} {{of a specific}} sialic acid {{has been shown to}} exist in many human malignant cell membranes termed as N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (NeuGc). This particular ganglioside do not normally exist in normal human cells, {{due to the lack of}} an enzyme (cytidine monophospho-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid) which is responsible for the synthesis of N—glycolyl neurominic acid. The aberrant expression of NeuGcGM 3 ganglioside in the cell surface of certain human tumors, made this molecule an attractive target for immunotherapy. By using 14 F 7 monoclonal antibody directed to identify NeuGcGM 3 in the tumor tissue, it is possible to select patients for anti-NeuGcGM 3 immunotherapy. Racotumomab is an <b>anti-idiotype</b> <b>vaccine,</b> being a mirror image of NeuGcGm 3 mimics this ganglioside and triggers an immune response. Antibodies reactive to NeuGcGM 3 ganglioside in the vaccinated patient’s sera have cytotoxic anti-tumor properties which can be assessed in L 1210 cell line, expressing this ganglioside. In this study, we monitored 12 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are on racotumomab vaccine maintenance following chemotherapy. Cytotoxic tests with vaccinated patients’ sera were performed using L 1210 cell lines at the 3 rd, 6 th, 9 th, and 12 th months of vaccination and the results were compared with clinical outcomes. Serum antibodies to NeuGcGm 3 ganglioside were also checked before initiation and thereafter with the same intervals. The aim of the study was to investigate the value of antibodies and cytotoxic test as biomarkers for treatment outcome. Our observation confirmed that consistently higher cytotoxicity rates in the cell culture correlated with better progression free survivals of the patients who are on racotumomab maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Racotumomab is a murine <b>anti-idiotype</b> cancer <b>vaccine</b> {{targeting}} NeuGcGM 3 on melanoma, {{breast and}} lung cancer. In order {{to characterize the}} immunogenicity of alum-adsorbed racotumomab in a non-clinical setting, Leghorn chickens were immunized in dose levels ranging from 25 &# 181;g to 1600 &# 181;g. Racotumomab was administered subcutaneously in the birds’ neck with three identical boosters and serum samples were collected before, {{during and after the}} immunization schedule. A strong antibody response was obtained across the evaluated dose range, confirming the immunogenicity of racotumomab even at dose levels as low as 25 &# 181;g. As previously observed when using Freund&# 180;s adjuvant, alum-adsorbed racotumomab induced an idiotype-specific response in all the immunized birds and ganglioside-specific antibodies in 60 - 100 % of the animals. In contrast to the rapid induction anti-idiotype response, detection of ganglioside-specific antibodies in responsive animals may require repeated boosting. Kinetics of anti-NeuGcGM 3 antibody titers showed a slight decline two weeks after each booster, arguing in favor of repeated immunizations in order to maintain antibody titer. Interestingly, the intensity of the anti-NeuGcGM 3 response paralleled that of anti-mucin antibodies and anti-tumor antibodies, suggesting that the in vitro detection of anti-ganglioside antibodies might be a surrogate for an in vivo activity of racotumomab. Taken together, these results suggest that Leghorn chicken immunization might become the means to test the biological activity of racotumomab intended for clinical use...|$|R
