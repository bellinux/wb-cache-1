40|$|In West Africa, {{administration}} of chloroquine chemoprophylaxis during pregnancy is common, but {{little is known}} about its impact on Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy. Therefore, cross-sectional studies in antenatal care clinics (<b>ANCs)</b> <b>and</b> delivery units (DUs) were conducted in Koupéla District, Burkina Faso. Chloroquine chemoprophylaxis was reported by 69 % of 597 pregnant women at <b>ANCs</b> <b>and</b> by 93 % of 853 women in DUs. P. falciparum peripheral parasitemia was identified in 29 % of women at both <b>ANCs</b> <b>and</b> DUs. Placental parasitemia was identified in 22 % of delivering women and was strongly associated with low birth weight (LBW) (risk ratio [RR], 1. 7; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 2 – 2. 4) and prematurity (RR, 2. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 6 – 5. 4). In multivariate analysis, use of chemoprophylaxis was not associated with a reduction in the prevalence of placental parasitemia, LBW, or prematurity. Despite the high reported chloroquine che-moprophylaxis coverage, peripheral and placental malaria rates remain high and are associated with known adverse outcomes during pregnancy, including maternal anemia, prematurity, and LBW. Alternative prevention strategies, such as use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and intermittent preventive treatment with more-effective antimalarials, are needed.

It was in this Freedom Square in Sophiatown that Nelson Mandela made his first public allusion to violence and armed resistance as a legitimate tool for change. This earned him a reprimand from Albert Luthuli who by then replaced Dr A.B. Xuma as president of the ANC. Current remnants of Freedom Square may be found beneath a school playing field alongside the Christ the King Church.|$|E

40|$|In Bihar, India, high {{maternal}} anemia {{prevalence and}} low iron and folic acid supplement (IFA) receipt and consumption have continued over time despite universal IFA distribution and counseling during pregnancy. To examine individual and facility-level determinants of IFA receipt and consumption among pregnant women in rural Bihar, India. Using District Level Household Survey (2007 - 08) data, multilevel modeling {{was conducted to}} examine the determinants of two outcomes: IFA receipt (any IFA receipt vs. none) and IFA consumption (≥ 90 days vs. < 90 days). Individual-level and facility-level factors were included. Factor analysis was utilized to construct antenatal care (<b>ANC)</b> quality <b>and</b> health sub-center (HSC) capacity variables. Overall, 37 % of women received any IFA during their last pregnancy. Of those, 24 % consumed IFA for 90 or more days. Women {{were more likely to}} receive any IFA when they received additional <b>ANC</b> services <b>and</b> counseling, <b>and</b> attended <b>ANC</b> earlier <b>and</b> more frequently. Significant interactions were found between ANC quality factors (odds ratio (OR) : 0. 37, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 25, 0. 56) <b>and</b> between <b>ANC</b> services <b>and</b> <b>ANC</b> timing <b>and</b> frequency (OR: 0. 68, 95 % CI: 0. 56, 0. 82).

IFA supply at the HSC (OR: 1. 37, 95 % CI: 1. 04, 1. 82) was also significantly associated with IFA consumption. Our findings indicate that individual <b>and</b> <b>ANC</b> factors (timing, frequency, and quality) {{play a key role in}} facilitating IFA receipt and consumption.

40|$|Purpose A case of {{leukopenia}} in {{a patient}} receiving colchicine for calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease, or pseudogout, is reported. Summary An 85 -year-old man experienced leukopenia likely due to colchicine. His medical history included chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), pseudogout, osteoarthritis, and hypertension. In February 2011, his white blood cell (WBC) count was 2700 cells/μL, and his absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 2200 cells/μL. Colchicine 0. 6 mg orally daily was initiated in March for the prophylaxis of pseudogout. His WBC count decreased, and his colchicine dosage was reduced to 0. 6 mg every other day. Despite this decreased dosage, his WBC count <b>and</b> <b>ANC</b> were 600 <b>and</b> 100 cells/μL, respectively, in September. In October, the patient received chemotherapy for presumed worsening of his CLL. One month later, his WBC count <b>and</b> <b>ANC</b> were 400 <b>and</b> 200 cells/μL, respectively. Subcutaneous filgrastim was administered, and colchicine was discontinued. At the end of November, he received another cycle of chemotherapy followed by pegfilgrastim. On the day of pegfilgrastim administration, the patient 2 ̆ 7 s WBC count <b>and</b> <b>ANC</b> were 2000 <b>and</b> 1300 cells/μL, respectively.

40|$|Background: Ethiopia {{has high}} {{maternal}} mortality ratio and poor access to maternal health services. Attendance {{of at least}} four antenatal care (<b>ANC)</b> visits <b>and</b> delivery by a skilled birth attendant (SBA) are important in preventing maternal deaths. Understanding the reasons behind the poor use of these services is important in designing strategies to address the problem. This study aimed to determine the coverage of at least four <b>ANC</b> visits <b>and</b> delivery by a SBA and to identify determinants of utilisation of these services in three districts in South West Shoa Zone, Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 500 women aged 15 – 49 years with a delivery in two {{years prior to the}} survey was conducted in Wolisso, Wonchi and Goro districts in February 2013. Data were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to explore determinants of <b>ANC</b> attendance <b>and</b> SBA at delivery.
