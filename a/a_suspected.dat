50|$|The {{police can}} abuse its powers to detain <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> by using threats of {{detention}} to pressure <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> to confess {{that he is}} guilty. In addition, the KUHAP does not ensure that detainees are brought to court promptly. Under the KUHAP, <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> can be detained for up to 60 days without judicial intervention. For example, if the police detains <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> for 20 days under Art24(1), a prosecutor can extend this detention for another 40 days under Art 24(2). Please refer to the appendix {{for more information about}} how long <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> can be detained without judicial intervention.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>suspect</b> {{arrested in}} Israel is {{typically}} interrogated by police. Though police {{are allowed to}} lie to <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> during interrogation, anyone facing police interrogation {{has the right to}} consult a lawyer beforehand, and an interrogating officer must warn <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> that he or she does not have to say anything self-incriminating, and that anything said might be used against them in court.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third day of the trial, Wiens incurred a self-inflicted injury by banging his head against a table. He was diagnosed with haematomas and <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> traumatic brain injury, but was judged fit to stand trial after a hospital-based medical examination. While continuing with noncompliant and destructive behaviour, Wiens was temporarily restrained by nine security officers in court.|$|E

5|$|During his {{recuperation}} Formby contracted gastroenteritis and had <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> {{blood clot}} on his lung, {{after which he}} underwent an operation to clear a fishbone that was stuck in his throat. He had recovered sufficiently by April 1953 to undertake a 17-show tour of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), before a special appearance at the Southport Garrick Theatre.

5000|$|Brett Glasby - From Goleta, California, Glasby was {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> by investigators in Santa Barbara County. He was himself murdered in Mexico in 1982. Glasby's death, {{prior to the}} murder of Janelle Cruz, eliminates him as <b>a</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|R

5|$|For <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> {{first leg}} DVT in a moderate-probability scenario, a high-sensitivity D-dimer is {{suggested}} as a recommended option over ultrasound imaging, with both whole-leg and compression ultrasound possible.

5|$|Kisnorbo's season prematurely ended {{after he}} {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> ruptured acchilles tendon against Millwall in March, ending his hopes {{of playing in}} Leeds's promotion charge, and also his dream of playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

50|$|It is also {{interesting}} to note the difference in tradition between Sweden and other countries {{when it comes to}} the publication of a name and footage or photograph of <b>a</b> <b>suspect.</b> For instance, in the U.S. it is customary for the media to use the real name of <b>a</b> <b>suspect,</b> while in Sweden <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> is usually referred to by their age (i.e. the 33-year old in the present case) until a conviction has been secured.|$|R

5|$|The GDR {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} security measures along its Baltic coastline to hinder escape attempts. Camping and access to boats was severely limited and 27 watchtowers were built along the Baltic coastline. If <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> escape attempt was spotted, high-speed patrol boats would be dispatched to intercept the fugitives. Armed patrols equipped with powerful mobile searchlights monitored the beaches.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{steps for}} {{evaluating}} {{a person with}} <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> subarachnoid hemorrhage are obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination. The diagnosis cannot, however, be made on clinical grounds alone and in general medical imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture is required to confirm or exclude bleeding.|$|E

5|$|There are no {{specific}} blood tests that can diagnose cholangiocarcinoma by themselves.

5|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} test on a blood sample from affected animals will confirm <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> case by identifying the viral DNA, though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case.
