Results: Mechanically ventilated subjects exhibited plasma glycocalyx breakdown signatures (glycosaminoglycan fragments) characteristic of direct versus indirect etiologies of respiratory failure. Conclusion: Circulating glycosaminoglycans provide insight into respiratory failure pathophysiology. Significance: This is the first study to characterize circulating glycosaminoglycans during critical illness, offering insight into the mechanisms underlying respiratory failure. Systemic inflammatory illnesses (such as sepsis) are marked by degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx, a layer of glycos-aminoglycans (including heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic <b>acid)</b> <b>lining</b> the vascular lumen.

Enzymatic mechanisms have great effect on the catabo-lism of seed stored lipids. Temperature and oxygen regulation influence devel-oping sunflower seeds. For simultaneous study of seed and developing seed, half-seed analysis technique was used. The behavior of the fatty acids during the germination in cotyledon of seed showed the increase of linolenic <b>acid</b> in both <b>lines,</b> demonstrating the activity of linoleic acid desaturase (∆ 6 -desatu-rase). But linoleic acid as a substrate for linoleate desaturase increased during all stages of developing only in mutant line that revealed higher activity of oleic acid desaturase (∆ 12 -desaturase) in transforming oleic acid to linoleic <b>acid</b> in this <b>line,</b> and lower activity of this enzyme in low oleic <b>acid</b> <b>line,</b> the reasons probably being the low availability of substrate of this enzyme in low oleic <b>acid</b> <b>line</b> and the complexity of enzymatic mechanisms.

40|$|Scientific and {{practical}} {{interest is the}} application of alloying alloy-modifiers for secondary treatment of high-strength cast iron to stabilize the process of spheroidization graphite and achieving higher physical-mechanical properties of castings. The peculiarity of the high-strength cast irons manufacturing technology is their tendency to supercooling during solidification in the mold. This leads {{to the formation of}} shrinkage defects and structurally free cementite, especially in thin-walled sections of the finished castings. To minimize these effects in foundry practice during production of ductile iron the secondary inoculation is widely used. In this regard, the question of the choice of the additives with effective impact not only on the graphitization process but also on the formation of the metallic base of ductile iron is relevant. The aim of the present work is to study the peculiarities of structure formation in cast iron with nodular graphite when alloying alloy-modifier based on tin with additions of nanoparticles of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes is used for secondary treatment. Melting of iron in laboratory conditions was performed in crucible induction furnace IST- 006 with an <b>acid</b> <b>lining</b> held. Spheroidizing treatment of melt was realized with magnesium containing alloying alloy FeSiMg 7 by means of ladle method. Secondary treatment of high strength cast iron was carried out by addition of alloying alloy-modifier in an amount of 0. 1 % {{to the bottom of the}} pouring ladle. Cast samples for chemical composition analysis, study of microstructure, technological and mechanical properties of the resultant alloy were made. Studies have shown that the secondary treatment of high strength cast iron with developed modifier-alloying alloy results in formation of the perlite metallic base due to the tin impact and nodular graphite with regular shape under the influence of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes. The tendency of high strength cast iron to «white cast iron» formation has been minimized, and the mechanical properties of the alloy produced correspond to HSCI 80. </p...|$|E

Here we have analyzed the effect on rat PAH enzyme kinetics of in vitro mutagenesis of a number of these amino <b>acids</b> <b>lining</b> the PAH active site. Mutation of F 299, Y 324, F 331, and Y 343 caused a significant decrease in enzyme activity but no change in the K-m for substrate or cofactor. me conclude that these aromatic residues are essential for activity but are not significantly involved in binding of the substrate or cofactor. in contrast the PAH mutant, S 349 T, showed an 18 -fold increase in K-m for phenylalanine, showing the first functional evidence that this residue was binding at or near the phenylalanine binding site. This confirms the recently published model for the binding of phenylalanine to the PAH active site that postulated S 349 interacts with the amino group on the main chain of the phenylalanine molecule. This result differs with that found for the equivalent mutation (S 395 T), in the closely related tyrosine hydroxylase, which had no effect on substrate K-m, showing that while the architecture of the two active sites are very similar the amino acids that bind to the respective substrates are different.

30|$|Aforementioned backgrounds, {{the main}} {{aim of the}} current study is thus to {{elucidate}} the effect of tea fermentation on antioxidant properties using IOSC as a model study. The antioxidant properties in this context consisted of antioxidant activities and components which are determined by a rapid reliable spectrophotometric analysis. The characterization of antioxidant activities is estimated based on 1.1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and Superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity assays. This antioxidant activities’ characterization is followed by the measurement of antioxidant components based on total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, flavonols and rosmarinic acid. The main aim results in three target approaches as follow: (a) to select the high rosmarinic <b>acid</b> <b>line</b> of IOSC by elicitation; (b) to characterize the effect of tea fermentation on antioxidant properties of selected IOSC; and (c) to identify the individual phenolic acids of IOSC and their changing in quantity by tea fermentation.|$|R

Tea fermentation decreased the antioxidant activities of IOSC. These decreases were associated with reduced antioxidant compounds of IOSC: total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, flavonols and rosmarinic acids.

The result of correlation analysis indicated that rosmarinic acid was the major contributor to the antioxidant activities in IOSC.

40|$|Anion/cation {{selectivity}} is {{a critical}} property of ion channels and underpins their physiological function. Recently, {{there have been numerous}} mutagenesis studies, which have mapped sites within the ion channel-forming segments of ligand-gated ion channels that are determinants of the ion selectivity. Site-directed mutations to specific amino acids within or flanking the M 2 transmembrane segments of the anion-selective glycine, GABA(A) and GABA(C) receptors and the cation-selective nicotinic acetylcholine and serotonin (type 3) receptors have revealed discrete, equivalent regions within the ion channel that form the principal selectivity filter, leading to plausible molecular mechanisms and mathematical models to describe how ions preferentially permeate these channels. In particular, the dominant factor determining anion/cation selectivity seems to be the sign and exposure of charged amino <b>acids</b> <b>lining</b> the selectivity filter region of the open channel. In addition, the minimum pore diameter, which can be influenced by the presence of a local proline residue, also makes a contribution to such ion selectivity in LGICs with smaller diameters increasing anion/cation selectivity and larger ones decreasing it.
