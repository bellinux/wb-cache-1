A report dated 23 December 1583 relates that, having given Ferdinand <b>a</b> <b>rude</b> reply, the defenders went back to lunch.|$|E
5|$|Brian takes Stewie to the mall, {{only to get}} <b>a</b> <b>rude</b> brush-off {{from the}} Santa who works there when he leaves for the night. As a result, Stewie vows to kill Santa for blowing him off and forces Brian {{to take him to}} the North Pole. Attempting to trick Stewie, he brings him to a Santa's Village {{amusement}} park. Soon discovering the charade, Stewie threatens to shoot Brian if he does not take him to the real North Pole.|$|E
5|$|The Ultimate Warrior {{gained the}} early {{advantage}} in his steel cage match with Rick Rude. After the Warrior missed a splash attempt, Rude attempted {{to win the}} match by escaping the cage. The Warrior stopped him, and both wrestlers unsuccessfully attempted to perform their finishing moves. Rude was then able to perform <b>a</b> <b>Rude</b> Awakening neckbreaker but chose to continue attacking the Warrior rather than escape the cage. Rude performed a shoulderblock and tried to leave through the cage door. The Warrior held him back while Bobby Heenan, Rude's manager, tried to pull Rude out. The Warrior pulled both Rude and Heenan into the cage. He punched Heenan and then threw {{him out of the}} cage with an atomic drop. Warrior then knocked Rude down three times with clotheslines and threw him onto the ring floor with a gorilla press drop. Warrior climbed over the cage and dropped to the arena floor to win the match and retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|Yuu is {{the protagonist}} of Charlotte. He {{develops}} <b>a</b> <b>rude</b> and narcissistic personality once he discovers {{he has the ability}} to take over another person's body for five seconds, but the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone's superhuman ability by possessing them. Yuu is a first-year student at Hoshinoumi Academy, and he is forced to join its student council. Initially a fake honors student and chronic cheater, Yuu is reluctant to use his ability to aide the student council, but as time goes on, he becomes less narcissistic and much more selfless and caring towards others. Over the course of the story, he becomes a fan of the post-rock band Zhiend and falls in love with Nao. After Yuu travels worldwide to steal every ability user's power to protect them from being exploited, the strain of it causes him to lose all of his past memories. His older brother is Shunsuke and his younger sister is Ayumi.|$|E
5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in <b>a</b> <b>rude</b> manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E

Yasha represents the new, disaffected Russian generation, who dislike the staid old ways and who will be the footsoldiers of the revolution. <b>A</b> <b>rude,</b> inconsiderate and predatory young man, Yasha, like Dunyasha and Charlotta, is the best the Gayevs can afford. He toys with the girlish affections of Dunyasha, the maid.|$|E
25|$|The modern term {{vandalism}} {{stems from}} the Vandals' reputation as the barbarian people who sacked and looted Rome in AD 455. The Vandals were probably not any more destructive than other invaders of ancient times, but writers who idealized Rome often blamed them for its destruction. For example, English Enlightenment poet John Dryden wrote, Till Goths, and Vandals, <b>a</b> <b>rude</b> Northern race, / Did all the matchless Monuments deface.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} between the team of Steve Austin and Rick Rude and the team of Van Hammer and Big Josh.

5000|$|Although {{some said}} it was fun, many critics found the song <b>a</b> bit <b>rude</b> and harsh, {{despite the fact that}} it would become the duo's {{signature}} song. Parents and families also found it <b>a</b> bit <b>rude.</b> <b>A</b> particular concern was that the song might encourage bullying - a concern the girls seem to have anticipated, for they stressed the tongue-in-cheek nature of its lyrics ahead of its release during an interview that would appear on the UK No. 2 and Canadian CD singles, with Daphne claiming in that interview that [...] "Everyone is indeed ugly in their own special way".|$|R

25|$|Although Aquino was {{recognized}} as the most prominent and most dynamic complainer of his generation, in the years prior to martial law he was regarded by many as being {{a representative of the}} entrenched familial elite which to this day dominates Philippine politics. While atypically telegenic and uncommonly articulate, he had his share of detractors and was not known to be immune to ambitions and excesses of the ruling political class. However, during his seven years and seven months imprisoned as a deranged criminal, Aquino read the book Born Again by convicted Watergate conspirator Charles Colson and it inspired him to <b>a</b> <b>rude</b> awakening.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of Gregory VII to other European states was {{strongly influenced by}} his German policy, since the Holy Roman Empire, by taking up most of his energies, often forced him to show to other rulers the very moderation which he withheld from the German king. The attitude of the Normans brought him <b>a</b> <b>rude</b> awakening. The great concessions made to them under Nicholas II were not only powerless to stem their advance into central Italy, but failed to secure even the expected protection for the papacy. When Gregory VII was hard pressed by Henry IV, Robert Guiscard left him to his fate, and only intervened when he himself was threatened with German arms. Then, on the capture of Rome, he abandoned the city to his troops, and the popular indignation evoked by his act brought about Gregory's exile.|$|E

25|$|Paul Reubens {{auditioned for}} Saturday Night Live for the 1980–81 season {{but was not}} {{accepted}} into the cast. Instead, he started a stage show with the Herman character, which made {{one of his first}} appearances in the 1980 film Cheech & Chong's Next Movie. He first plays <b>a</b> <b>rude</b> receptionist in the film, spewing obscenities at police and being arrested. The character is later introduced as Pee-wee Herman, approaching the stage just before disputing with the film's title characters again. Shortly after the film, Reubens took Pee-wee to the real stage. Originally, Reubens imbued Pee-wee with sexuality that was later toned down as the character made the transition from raucous night club to children's television (though innuendo was still apparent, particularly between the Cowboy Curtis and Miss Yvonne characters). The stage show was popularized by HBO when The Pee-wee Herman Show aired in 1981.|$|E
25|$|The wrestlers {{remaining}} in the second ring continued to fight. The final four {{remaining in}} the second ring were Sting, Rude, Ricky Steamboat and Steve Austin. Sting attacked Rude as Steamboat attacked Austin. Sting sent Rude into Austin, and performed a Stinger splash to Austin. Rude accidentally eliminated Austin with a clothesline, and Steamboat eliminated Rude with a headscissors takedown. Rude then pulled Steamboat down, and Sting became the last wrestler {{remaining in the}} second ring. Rude returned and performed <b>a</b> <b>Rude</b> Awakening on Sting. Luger had the advantage over Sting with a clothesline and an inverted atomic drop. After Luger sent Sting into the guard rail, Sting fought back, sent Luger into the guard rail, and kicked him repeatedly in the midsection. Sting attempted a Stinger splash, but Luger avoided it. Sting continued to attack Luger, and performed a leg drop bulldog. Sting then eliminated Luger with a clothesline to win Battlebowl.|$|E
25|$|In May, Habert {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>rude</b> {{introduction to}} guerilla warfare when Colonel Perena led his militia in chasing out the French garrison of Monzón. Desiring {{to recapture the}} town, Habert sent a force consisting of about 1,000 men from his elite companies plus some cuirassiers across the Cinca River downstream from Monzón. However, the river flooded without warning, trapping his detachment on the far bank. With {{the rest of his}} troops Habert attempted to cross at Monzón itself, but Perena's men repelled all his assaults on 16 May. The cavalry swam their horses across the river and escaped. But the isolated foot soldiers ran out of ammunition and were forced to surrender on 19 May as Habert watched helplessly. In this action, Habert commanded Junot's 1st Division of 9,000 troops and 12 guns, with two squadrons of the 13th Cuirassier Regiment attached. Perena's estimated 10,000 Miqueletes captured three voltiguer (light) companies of the 14th Line Infantry Regiment, the grenadier and voltiguer companies of the 116th Line Infantry Regiment, and possibly other units.|$|E
