40|$|Neutrinos can {{interact}} {{in the atmosphere}} (downward-going ν) or in the Earth crust (Earth-skimming ν), producing air showers that can be observed with arrays of detectors at the ground. The surface detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory can detect these types of cascades. The distinguishing signature for neutrino events {{is the presence of}} very inclined showers produced close to the ground (i. e., after having traversed a large amount of atmosphere). Up to now, the Pierre Auger Observatory did not find any candidate for a neutrino event. A very low rate of events potentially generated by neutrinos is a significant challenge for a detection technique and requires both sophisticated algorithms and high-resolution hardware. We present a trigger based on a pipeline artificial neural network (ANN) implemented in a large FPGA which after learning can recognize traces corresponding to special types of events. The structure of an ANN algorithm being developed on the MATLAB platform has been implemented into the fast logic of the biggest Cyclone V E FPGA used for the prototype of the Front-End Board for the Auger-Beyond- 2015 effort. Several algorithms were tested, however, the Levenberg-Marquardt one seems to be the most efficient. The network was taught: a) to recognize "old" showers (learning on a basis of real very inclined <b>Auger</b> <b>showers</b> (positive markers) and real standard showers especially triggered by Time over Threshold (negative marker), b) to recognize "young" showers (on the basis of simulated "young" events (positive markers) and standard Auger events as a negative reference). A three-layer neural network being taught by real very inclined <b>Auger</b> <b>showers</b> shows a good efficiency in pattern recognition of 16 -point traces with profiles characteristic of "old" showers.

40|$|We {{show that}} the <b>Auger</b> Air <b>Shower</b> Array has the {{potential}} to detect neutrinos of energies in the $ 10 ^{ 19 }~$eV range through horizontal air showers. Assuming some simple conservative trigger requirements we obtain the acceptance for horizontal air showers as induced by high energy neutrinos by two alternative methods and we then give the expected event rates for a variety of neutrino fluxes as predicted in different models which are used for reference.

40|$|The {{existence}} of extra {{degrees of freedom}} beyond the electroweak scale may allow the formation of black holes in nearly horizontal neutrino air showers. In this paper we examine the average properties of the light descendants of these black holes. Our analysis indicates that black hole decay gives rise to deeply penetrating showers with an electromagnetic component which differs substantially from that in conventional neutrino interactions, allowing a good characterization of the phenomenon against background. Naturally occurring black holes in horizontal neutrino showers could be detected and studied with the <b>Auger</b> air <b>shower</b> array. Since the expected black hole production rate at Auger is $> 1 $ event/year, this cosmic ray observatory could be potentially powerful in probing models with extra dimensions and TeV-scale gravity.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{measurement}} of the cosmic ray energy spectrum obtained using the inclined events detected with the Pierre <b>Auger</b> Observatory. <b>Showers</b> with zenith angles between 60 ◦ and 80 ◦ recorded in the period between 1 January 2004 and 28 February 2007 are analysed. Showers are first reconstructed in arrival direction and then fitted to density maps of the muon numbers obtained from 10 19 eV simulated proton showers for different arrival directions, {{in order to obtain}} the core position and an overall normalisation factor N 19 which is used as an energy estimator. The parameter N 19 is shown to be correlated with the shower energy measured with the fluorescence technique for a sub-sample of good quality hybrid showers. This correlation, measured with hybrid events, is then used to determine the energy of all the showers...|$|R
40|$|The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) is an {{enhancement}} of the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina. Covering about View the 17 km^ 2, AERA is the world-largest antenna array for cosmic-ray observation. It consists {{of more than}} 150 antenna stations detecting the radio signal emitted by air showers, i. e., cascades of secondary particles caused by primary cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere. At the beginning, technical goals had been in focus: first of all, the successful demonstration that a large-scale antenna array consisting of autonomous stations is feasible. Moreover, techniques for calibration of the antennas and time calibration of the array have been developed, as well as special software for the data analysis. Meanwhile physics goals come into focus. At the Pierre <b>Auger</b> Observatory air <b>showers</b> are simultaneously detected by several detector systems, in particular water-Cherenkov detectors at the surface, underground muon detectors, and fluorescence telescopes, which enables cross-calibration of different detection techniques. For the direction and energy of air showers, the precision achieved by AERA is already competitive; {{for the type of}} primary particle, several methods are tested and optimized. By combining AERA with the particle detectors we aim for a better understanding of cosmic rays in the energy range from approximately 0. 3 to 10 EeV, i. e., significantly higher energies than preceding radio arrays.

40|$|International audienceThe Pierre <b>Auger</b> Observatory's (PAO) <b>shower</b> profile {{measurements}} {{can be used}} {{to constrain}} the chemical composition of the ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) spectrum. In particular, the PAO's measurements of the average depth of shower maximum and the fluctuations of the depth of shower maximum indicate that the cosmic ray spectrum is dominated by a fairly narrow distribution (in charge) of heavy or intermediate mass nuclei at the highest measured energies (E ≳ 10 eV), and contains mostly lighter nuclei or protons at lower energies (E ∼ 10 eV). In this article, we study the propagation of UHECR nuclei with the goal of using these measurements, along with those of the shape of the spectrum, to constrain the chemical composition of the particles accelerated by the sources of the UHECRs. We find that with modest intergalactic magnetic fields, 0. 3 nG in strength with 1 Mpc coherent lengths, good fits to the combined PAO data can be found for the case in which the sources accelerate primarily intermediate mass nuclei (such as nitrogen or silicon). Without intergalactic magnetic fields, we do not find any composition scenarios that can accommodate the PAO data. For a spectrum dominated by heavy or intermediate mass nuclei, the Galactic (and intergalactic) magnetic fields are expected to erase any significant angular correlation between the sources and arrival directions of UHECRs...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{extensive}} {{air shower}} simulations it is {{shown that the}} electron distributions {{with respect to the}} two angles, determining electron direction at a given shower age, for a fixed electron energy and lateral distance, are universal. It means that the distributions do not depend on the primary particle energy or mass (thus, neither on the interaction model), shower zenith angle or shower to shower fluctuations, if they are taken at the same shower age. Together with previous work showing the universality of the distributions of the electron energy, of the lateral distance (integrated over angles) and of the angle (integrated over lateral distance) for fixed electron energy this paper completes a full universal description of the electron states at various shower ages. Analytical parametrizations of the full electron states are given. It is also shown that some distributions can be described by a smaller than five numbers of variables, the new ones being products of the old ones raised to some powers. The accuracy of the present parametrization is sufficiently good for applying to showers with the primary energy uncertainty of 14 % (as it is at the Pierre <b>Auger</b> Observatory). The <b>shower</b> fluctuations in the chosen bins of the multidimensional variable space are about 6 %, determining the minimum uncertainty needed for parametrization of the universal distributions. An analytical way of estimation of the effect of the geomagnetic field is given. Thanks to the universality of the electron distributions in any shower a new method of shower reconstruction can be worked out from data of the observatories using the fluorescence technique. The light fluxes (both fluorescence and Cherenkov) for any shower age can be exactly predicted for a shower with any primary energy and shower maximum depth, so that the two quantities can be obtained by best fitting the predictions to the measurementsComment: accepted to Ap...|$|R
