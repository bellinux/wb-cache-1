The present study was initiated to develop analytical {{procedures for}} <b>adjusting</b> <b>estimates</b> of the flexural properties of 2 -inch-thick Douglas-fir dimension lumber that would be applicable to {{all levels of the}} flexural properties. Equations are derived for adjusting modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), moment capacity (RS = MOR × section modulus), and flexural stiffness (EI = MOEX moment of inertia) for changes in moisture content.

40|$|In {{our recent}} {{systematic}} review in Obstetrics and Gynecology International {{of the association}} between FGM/C and obstetric harm we concluded that FGM/C significantly {{increases the risk of}} delivery complications. The findings were based on unadjusted effect estimates from both prospective and retrospective studies. To accommodate requests by critics, we aimed to validate these results through additional analyses based on <b>adjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> from prospective studies. We judged that 7 of the 28 studies included in our original systematic review were prospective. Statistical adjustments for measured confounding factors were made in eight studies, including three prospective studies. The adjusted confounders differed across studies in number and type. Results from meta-analyses based on <b>adjusted</b> <b>estimates,</b> with or without data from retrospective studies, consistently pointed {{in the same direction as}} our earlier findings. There were only small differences in the sizes or the level of statistical significance. Using GRADE, we assessed that our confidence in the effect estimates was very low or low for all outcomes. The <b>adjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> generally show similar obstetric harms from FGM/C as unadjusted estimates do. Thus, the current analyses confirm the findings from our previous systematic review. There are sufficient grounds to conclude that FGM/C, with respect to obstetric circumstances, involves harm...|$|E

40|$|Surveys to {{estimate}} walrus abundance at terrestrial haulout {{sites in the}} Penny Strait-Lancaster Sound (PS-LS) and West Jones Sound (WJS) stocks were conducted in 1977 and 1998 - 2009. The Minimum Counted Population (MCP) was similar in 1977 (565) to recent years (557) for the PS-LS stock. The MCP for the WJS stock was higher in recent surveys (404) than in 1977 (290). Regression analysis of MCP and density (number of walrus divided by number of haulouts surveyed) showed no significant trends over time. We also calculated bounded count estimates for comparison. Finally, we used broad-scale behavioural data {{to estimate}} {{the proportion of the}} total stock that could be considered countable, to produce two <b>adjusted</b> <b>estimates.</b> We selected recent surveys with good coverage and ignored <b>adjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> that were lower than MCP. For the PS-LS stock, the adjusted MCP (with 95 % CL) was 672 (575 - 768) and 727 (623 - 831) walrus in 2007 and 2009, respectively. For WJS, the best estimates were the adjusted MCP of 503 (473 - 534) in 2008 and the adjusted bounded count of 470 (297 - 1732) in 2009. While both stocks appear to have remained stable over three decades, differences in survey coverage and possible differences in walrus distribution make precise population estimation difficult. </p...|$|E

30|$|Municipalities {{are defined}} as areal {{partitions}} of a geographical region.

To do this, we smooth the <b>adjusted</b> Mercalli <b>estimate</b> of each municipality in relation to the <b>adjusted</b> Mercalli <b>estimates</b> of its nearest neighbors. The influence of a neighbor on a given municipality is inversely determined by its geodesic distance to the municipality. This distance is measured as the pairwise distance between the largest city of the municipality and its neighbor. Since the <b>adjusted</b> Mercalli <b>estimate</b> (Eq.  2) of a municipality is conditioned to the local support that it had for the event (Eq.  2) by considering the largest city in each municipality, we give a high level of confidence to the distance estimation.|$|R

40|$|This paper formalizes {{certain aspects}} of the sales {{comparison}} approach to valuation that heretofore have been quite ad hoc. Specifically, it applies statistical theory to decisions about how many comparables to select, what the criteria for comparable selection should be, and how the proper weights for each <b>adjusted</b> value <b>estimate</b> can be determined such that the final value estimate is both unbiased and of minimum variance. Several results are derived that run counter to conventional practice; for example, it may not always be optimal to consider first the "best" comparables {{because of a lack of}} independence among their <b>adjusted</b> value <b>estimates.</b> Furthermore, it is always desirable to consider more comparables (regardless of how "bad") so long as their <b>adjusted</b> value <b>estimates</b> are optimally weighted in the final value estimate. Finally, weights usually selected for "inferior" comparables are typically too small. A final exercise empirically applies the methodology to a sample of sales.

40|$|The aim was {{to assess}} {{associations}} of general and oral health perceptions, {{and the impact of}} general and oral health functional problems on general health perceptions. Data were collected from adults, 60 – 71 yr of age in 2008, and included global self-ratings of general and oral health, Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP- 14) scores, and health problem scores [using the five items from the EuroQol instrument (EQ- 5 D) ]. Responses were collected from 444 subjects (response rate = 68. 8 %). Self-rated general and oral health showed fair to good agreement (kappa = 0. 47). <b>Adjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> of self-rated general health showed that worse ratings were associated with lower social status [prevalence ratio (PR) = 0. 42] and with more health problems (PR = 0. 64). <b>Adjusted</b> <b>estimates</b> of self-rated oral health also showed that worse ratings were associated with lower social status (PR = 0. 48) and with more health problems (PR = 0. 63), as well as with higher OHIP scores (PR = 0. 21). The interaction of health problems and OHIP scores was significant for self-rated general health, with self-rated general health being worse when both health problems and OHIP score were higher. For older adults, general health and oral health were associated, although oral health impact was only associated with general health for those with more health problems, indicating that those in worse health suffer more impact from oral health problems.
