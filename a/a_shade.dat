Infuriated, he renders her unconscious with a ball of fire and abducts her.|$|E
5|$|Green was the {{traditional}} color worn by hunters in the 19th century, particularly the shade called hunter green. In the 20th century most hunters began wearing the color olive drab, <b>a</b> <b>shade</b> of green, instead of hunter green.|$|E
5|$|Army {{trousers}} were {{of similar}} pattern to the U.S. Army trousers, or civilian designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They were typically <b>a</b> <b>shade</b> of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E

5|$|Brisingr is told in third-person {{from the}} {{perspectives}} of multiple primary protagonists. These characters include the humans Eragon, Roran, and Nasuada, and the dragons Saphira and Glaedr. The humans Galbatorix and Murtagh return as antagonists, along with Murtagh's dragon, Thorn. The Ra'zac return for a minor antagonist role, and Varaug, <b>a</b> <b>Shade,</b> also appears for a main antagonist role. Many minor characters reprise their roles in Brisingr from previous installments of the Inheritance Cycle, including the elves Arya, Islanzadí, and Oromis; the dwarf Orik; the humans Angela, Katrina and Elva; and the dragon Glaedr.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the snake}} is subcylindrical, and is taller than it is wide. It has an upper surface that is {{typically}} <b>a</b> <b>shade</b> of blueish gray, while the belly is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. The tail of the snake is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to bring in}} and then kill <b>a</b> <b>Shade</b> {{at the end of}} the book was made when Paolini realized he needed a new ending for the book after it was split up. He was in need of plot points that were strong enough to keep the reader interested through the ending of the book. The point of view of Glaedr and Oromis' confrontation with Thorn and Murtagh was combined with the Shade battle to further keep the reader interested.|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon (Papio anubis), {{also called}} the Anubis baboon, {{is a member of}} the family Cercopithecidae (Old World monkeys). The species is the most wide-ranging of all baboons, being found in 25 {{countries}} throughout Africa, extending from Mali eastward to Ethiopia and Tanzania. Isolated populations are also present in some mountainous regions of the Sahara. It inhabits savannahs, steppes, and forests. The common name is derived from its coat color, which is <b>a</b> <b>shade</b> of green-grey at a distance. A variety of communications, vocal and non-vocal, facilitate a complex social structure.|$|E
5|$|The olive baboon {{is named}} for its coat, which, at a distance, is <b>a</b> <b>shade</b> of green-grey. Its {{alternative}} name comes from the Egyptian god Anubis, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as <b>a</b> <b>shade</b> tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E

5|$|Gray was {{not chosen}} for camouflage, however, it did, at times, provide {{enough of a}} mask along tree lines during battle; keeping the line of Infantry hidden long enough to strike effectively. At {{the time of the}} American Civil War, the {{usefulness}} of camouflage was not generally recognized. Gray was chosen for Confederate uniforms because gray dye could be made relatively cheaply and it was the standard uniform color of the various State Militias. The gray uniforms worn by early State volunteers was normally <b>a</b> <b>shade</b> of cadet gray, which is not suitable for combat wear, as it gives away the position of the individual easily from its bright blue-gray tones, and for this reason it was preserved by some men for dress-parade functions. The gray mentioned is dull toned, often varying in color depending on the region and time during the conflict, resulting in a uniform that could blend in with the tree lines, or hide the men in the field wearing them.|$|E
5|$|The fruits are small, {{round and}} yellow, and can ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, peaking in spring and summer. Like all figs, the fruit {{is in the form of}} a syconium, an {{inverted}} inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. F.rubiginosa is exclusively pollinated by the fig wasp species Pleistodontes imperialis, which may comprise four cryptospecies. The syconia are also home to another fourteen species of wasp, some of which induce galls while others parasitise the pollinator wasps, and at least two species of nematode. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. Ranging along the Australian east coast from Queensland to Bega in southern New South Wales (including the Port Jackson area, leading to its alternative name), F.rubiginosa grows in rainforest margins and rocky outcrops. It is used as <b>a</b> <b>shade</b> tree in parks and public spaces, and when potted is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai.|$|E
5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they {{must be aware of}} their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as <b>a</b> <b>shade</b> of green.|$|E

5|$|The {{small round}} yellow fruit ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, {{although}} they peak in autumn and winter (April to July). Known as a syconium, the fruit is an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Ficusobliqua is pollinated by two species of fig wasp—Pleistodontes greenwoodi and P.xanthocephalus. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. The range is along the east coast from Queensland, through New South Wales in rainforest, savanna woodland, sclerophyll forest and gallery forest. It is used as <b>a</b> <b>shade</b> tree in parks and public spaces, and is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai. All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji.|$|E
5|$|An army of Kull (Urgals who {{can grow}} up to 8 feet) reach Eragon right outside the Varden's entrance, but are driven off {{with the help of}} the Varden, who escort Eragon, Saphira, Murtagh, and Arya to Farthen Dûr the {{mountain}} hideout of the varden. When they arrive in Farthen Dûr, Eragon is led to the leader of the Varden, Ajihad. Ajihad imprisons Murtagh after he refuses to allow his mind to be read to determine if he is a friend or a foe to the Varden. Eragon is told by Ajihad that Durza was not destroyed by Murtagh's arrow, because the only way to kill <b>a</b> <b>Shade</b> is with a stab through the heart. Orik, nephew of the dwarf King Hrothgar, is appointed as Eragon and Saphira's guide. Orik shows them a place to stay and introduces them to Hrothgar. Eragon also meets Ajihad's daughter, Nasuada, and Ajihad's right-hand man, Jörmundur. He also runs into Angela and Solembum, who have arrived in Tronjheim, and visits Murtagh in his prison. He is tested by two magicians, The Twins, as well as Arya.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Roran is sent {{on various}} {{missions}} {{as part of}} the military force of the Varden. One of the targets is a convoy of supply wagons guarded by enchanted soldiers that can't feel pain. The unit suffers extreme casualties, and the commander Martland Redbeard is replaced after losing his hand. During a mission to attack a large enemy force raiding a village, plans made by the new commander, Captain Edric almost cause the operation to fail, but Roran gives new orders and kills one hundred and ninety-three enemy soldiers by himself, leading the Varden to victory. Despite saving the mission, Roran is charged with insubordination and is flogged as a punishment. After the public whipping, Nasuada promotes Roran to commander and sends his unit on a mission. He leaves in command of a group of both men and Urgals to enforce the idea of men and Urgals working together. When an Urgal, Yarbog, challenges Roran for leadership of the unit, he wrestles the Urgal and forces him to submit. After returning to the Varden, his squad joins the siege of Feinster, a city in the Empire. As the siege begins, Eragon rescues the elf Arya and departs to find the leader of the city, but discovers that three magicians are attempting to create <b>a</b> <b>Shade.</b> While racing to kill the magicians, Eragon has a vision through Glaedr's Eldunarí showing Oromis and Murtagh fighting. Murtagh is using power of several Eldunari, and Glaedr and Thorn fight in the sky. Soon Glaedr is badly wounded. In the midst of the fighting, Galbatorix possesses Murtagh and tries to lure Oromis to his side: when he fails, and after Oromis suffers a seizure, Galbatorix uses Murtagh to kill him and Glaedr is killed shortly after. After the vision, the magicians have managed to create the Shade Varaug. Eragon and Arya fight desperately to slay Varaug. Eragon then distracts Varaug by battling him through the mind. Arya then stabs Varaug in the heart. After the successful siege, Nasuada tells Eragon the Varden's plans for invading the Empire.|$|E
