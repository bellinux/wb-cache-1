40|$|One out {{of every}} three people lacks access to {{sufficient}} nourishment in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the greatest food insecurity in the world today. Low agricultural productivity and expansionary demographic trends will necessitate greater reliance on imports if the food needs of the region are to be met in the future. However, sub-Saharan Africa is distant from major food export markets, and many of its countries are landlocked. In my research, I quantify the influence of the region?s transport-prohibitive characteristics on food security. By constructing regression models from agricultural trade data, I demonstrate that geographically isolated countries face substantially higher grain import prices, and these higher prices can raise the prevalence of hunger. I find that 300 kilometers between the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>disembarkation</b> and the major population agglomeration in the importing country explains a one percentage point increase in the undernourished population. This result highlights the needs for infrastructure investment and low trade barriers to minimize the cost of remoteness and promote the eradication of hunger in the region...|$|R

40|$|In September 1346, Edward III {{brought his}} victorious army {{to the gates}} of Calais to begin a siege that over 12 months {{developed}} into the largest military operation conducted by the English on French soil during the fourteenth century. It is also perhaps the least understood campaign of Edward III’s reign, because {{of the loss of}} the army pay records. We know from chronicles that the men of Calais conducted a heroic defence of their town, and we know too that the English created and maintained an enormous logistical operation first to besiege and then to capture the port. What is little understood, however, is the scale, scope and chronology of the siege. The role played by English naval forces has received little attention, yet there is a series of pay records relating to their service which can compensate for the loss of the vadia guerre accounts and which can enrich understanding of the campaign. Using this evidence, this article reappraises the whole expedition, highlights the numbers of ships and mariners involved in the siege, and draws attention to periods of intensive military activity. Edward III’s ultimate objective was to capture, hold and use the town as a safe <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>disembarkation</b> for future invasions...|$|R

Further, GAO's work was limited in scope and cannot be projected to represent systemic weaknesses. In response to this report, DHS provided a written update on numerous border protection efforts it has taken to enhance border security since 2003.

The analysis is performed for the two materials, Titanium alloy and AISI 4130 Steel and two FEM element type, shell and solid, to select preliminary design model for flight condition. Thermal boundary conditions are applied at inlet port until 5 s, and these conditions are maintained until 150 s.
