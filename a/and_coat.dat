5|$|Cremello or Blue-eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin, {{pale blue}} eyes and cream-colored coats, {{indicating}} that pigment cells and pigment {{are present in the}} skin, eyes, <b>and</b> <b>coat,</b> but at lower levels. Dominant white horses do not have pigment cells, and thus no pigment, in the skin or coat. In addition, dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be distinguishable from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, <b>and</b> <b>coat</b> color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{coats of}} {{arms of the}} U.S. states {{date back to the}} {{admission}} of the first states to the Union. Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of ratification of the United States Constitution, many of the original colonies referred to themselves as states shortly after the Declaration of Independence was signed on 4 July 1776. Committees of political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal <b>and</b> <b>coat</b> of arms. Many of these members were signers of the Articles of Confederation, Declaration of Independence, and United States Constitution. Several of the earliest adopted state coats of arms and seals were similar or identical to their colonial counterparts.|$|E

Danny's father is so badly injured that he needs expensive surgery; so Maxie pays for a specialist to perform it.

40|$|Coated paper {{quality is}} heavily {{affected}} by sheet uniformity, including uniformity {{of the base}} sheet <b>and</b> <b>coating</b> in both the planar and through-thickness design. Controlling this uniformity is easier if the sheet uniformity can be qualitatively or quantitatively defined.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{color of the}} Namib Desert Horse is bay, {{although}} {{there are a few}} chestnut and brown horses. The gene for gray does not occur in the breed. There are many individuals with dorsal striping but no zebra stripes. No other colors have been recorded. The Namib Desert Horses are athletic, muscular, , and strong boned. They are short-backed with oblique shoulders and good withers. The horses have the appearance of well-bred riding horses in head, skin, <b>and</b> <b>coat.</b> Overall, they have good conformation, with few deformities. Club hooves are occasionally seen in foals, likely due to trauma to the hoof while traveling long distances.|$|E
5|$|The serval {{is similar}} to the {{sympatric}} caracal, but has a narrower spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The African golden cat is darker, with different cranial features. It resembles the cheetah in its build <b>and</b> <b>coat</b> pattern, though not in size. The serval shares its adaptations to its marshy habitat with the jungle cat; both cats have large and sharp ears that help in locating the prey efficiently, and their long legs raise them above muddy ground and water.|$|E
5|$|The triumphal archway at the {{boundary}} between Fleur-de-Lys and Santa Venera {{is known as the}} Wignacourt Arch or the Fleur-de-Lys Gate. It has three doorways, and it is adorned with Wignacourt's coat of arms and three sculpted fleurs-de-lis, the heraldic symbols of Wignacourt. The suburb of Fleur-de-Lys got its name from this arch, and fleurs-de-lis are featured on the flags <b>and</b> <b>coat</b> of arms of both Fleur-de-Lys and Santa Venera. One of the original plaques on the arch gave due respect to the engineer Bontadino de Bontadini. The arch together with the aqueduct's water towers and fountains were the first expression of baroque architecture in Malta.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{along with}} the law authorizing the change of the flag ratio, a state flag was adopted. This flag {{displays}} the national emblem in a banner form. The ratio of the flag {{is the same as}} that of the national flag, i.e. 3:5. The state flag, called the historical national (armorial) flag in law, was proposed by Česlovas Juršėnas, the vice-speaker of the Seimas, and by Edmundas Rimša, the chairman of the Commission of Heraldry. This flag was also proposed at the same time as the grand coat of arms; both were meant to honor the 750th anniversary of the coronation of Mindaugas in 1253. The designer of the State (historic) flag <b>and</b> <b>coat</b> of arms was Arvydas Každailis. Historically, this flag was used during the Battle of Grunwald, and has served as the government flag for Central Lithuania from 1922 until 1939. This was one of the few flags considered to become the national flag during the drive for national independence. Several other countries, including Finland, Spain, Venezuela, Germany and Thailand, have an official national flag for civilian use and a state flag for government use.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French {{and their}} Indian allies ambushed Braddock's reduced {{forces and the}} general was mortally wounded. After {{suffering}} devastating casualties, the British panicked and retreated in disarray. Washington rode {{back and forth across}} the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces into an organized retreat. In the process, he demonstrated bravery and stamina, despite his lingering illness. He had two horses shot from underneath him, while his hat <b>and</b> <b>coat</b> were pierced by several bullets. Two-thirds of the British force of 976 men were killed or wounded in the battle. Washington's conduct in the battle redeemed his reputation among many who had criticized his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity.|$|E
5|$|The balcony is {{topped by}} a niche {{consisting}} of allegorical figures of Justice and Truth, as well as triumphal sculptures of a winged female figure and a putto. Some parts of the sculptures, such as the scales held by Lady Justice, are now missing. The empty spaces between these figures contained Pinto's bust <b>and</b> <b>coat</b> of arms, but they were removed during the French occupation of Malta or in the early 19th century. It is not known how the bust of Pinto looked like, however {{it may have been}} either sculpted similar to the bust on the façade of Auberge de Castille or an original work. In either case it was probably made of bronze, and stood on a marble plinth which is still there. Similar to other busts of the time, {{it may have been the}} work of Jacques Saly. The triumphal figures are similar to those found on the 17th century funerary monument of Nicolas Cotoner sculpted by Domenico Guidi, but it is unknown who worked on the replica of the Castellania.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, {{historian}} Enrique Ramírez Brau {{speculated that}} Cofresí {{may have had}} Jewish ancestry. A theory, held by David Cuesta and historian Úrsula Acosta (a member of the Puerto Rican Genealogy Society), held that the name Kupferstein ("copper stone") may have been chosen by his family when the 18th-century European Jewish population adopted surnames. The theory was later discarded when their research uncovered a complete family tree prepared by Cofresí's cousin, Luigi de Jenner, indicating that their name was spelled Kupferschein (not Kupferstein). Originally from Prague, Cofresí paternal patriarch Cristoforo Kupferschein received a recognition <b>and</b> <b>coat</b> of arms from Ferdinand I of Austria in December 1549 and eventually moved to Trieste. His last name was probably adapted {{from the town of}} Kufstein. After its arrival, the family became one of Trieste's early settlers. Cristoforo's son Felice was recognized as a noble in 1620, becoming Edler von Kupferschein. The family gained prestige and became one of the city's wealthiest, with the next generation receiving the best possible education and marrying into other influential families. Cofresí's grandfather, Giovanni Stanislao Kupferschein, held several offices in the police, military and municipal administration. According to Acosta, Cofresí's father Francesco received a lateinschule education and left at age 19 for Frankfurt (probably in search of a university or legal practice). In Frankfurt he mingled with influential figures such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, returning to Trieste two years later.|$|E
