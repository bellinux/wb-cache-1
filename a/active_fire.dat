30|$|Although both MODIS and VIIRS {{satellites}} {{have a good}} visual agreement {{regarding the}} spatial–temporal distribution of <b>active</b> <b>fires,</b> they show inconsistencies with the reported information during the Tavira wildfire. Both reports (ANPC 2012; Viegas et al. 2012) state that the fire reached Odeleite Stream in day 19 at 17  h, 3  h later it reached the burnt area from 2009 (day 19 at 20  h) and 7  h later the fire reached its south limit (day 19 at 24  h) (Fig.  5 b, section “Probabilistic fire spread simulations: framework and assessment”). However, both MODIS and VIIRS satellites detected <b>active</b> <b>fires</b> with different spatial and temporal distributions, e.g., both MODIS Aqua—VIIRS overpasses detected <b>active</b> <b>fires</b> in the Odeleite Stream day 19 at 14  h, earlier than reported by Viegas et al. (2012). In addition, the MODIS Terra overpass from day 19 at 22  h detected <b>active</b> <b>fires</b> beyond the area burned in 2009, close to the southern edges of the fire scar perimeter.|$|R

25|$|A fire {{extinguisher}} is an <b>active</b> <b>fire</b> protection device used to extinguish or control small fires, often in emergency situations. It {{is not intended}} for use on an out-of-control fire, such as one which has reached the ceiling, endangers the user (i.e., no escape route, smoke, explosion hazard, etc.), or otherwise requires the expertise of a fire department. Typically, a {{fire extinguisher}} consists of a hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent which can be discharged to extinguish a fire. Fire extinguishers manufactured with non-cylindrical pressure vessels also exist, but are less common.|$|E
25|$|Anaximander {{attributed}} some phenomena, such as {{thunder and}} lightning, {{to the intervention}} of elements, rather than to divine causes. In his system, thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the sound is proportionate {{with that of the}} shock. Thunder without lightning {{is the result of the}} wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less <b>active</b> <b>fire</b> to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow.|$|E

40|$|In several biomes, {{including}} croplands, wooded savannas, {{and tropical}} forests, many small fires occur each year {{that are well}} below the detection limit of {{the current generation of}} global burned area products derived from moderate resolution surface reflectance imagery. Although these fires often generate thermal anomalies that can be detected by satellites, their contributions to burned area and carbon fluxes have not been systematically quantified across different regions and continents. Here we developed a preliminary method for combining 1 -km thermal anomalies (<b>active</b> <b>fires)</b> and 500  m burned area observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate the influence of these fires. In our approach, we calculated the number of <b>active</b> <b>fires</b> inside and outside of 500  m burn scars derived from reflectance data. We estimated small fire burned area by computing the difference normalized burn ratio (dNBR) for these two sets of <b>active</b> <b>fires</b> and then combining these observations with other information. In a final step, we used the Global Fire Emissions Database version 3 (GFED 3) biogeochemical model to estimate the impact of these fires on biomass burning emissions. We found that the spatial distribution of <b>active</b> <b>fires</b> and 500  m burned areas were in close agreement in ecosystems that experience large fires, including savannas across southern Africa and Australia and boreal forests in North America and Eurasia. In other areas, however, we observed many <b>active</b> <b>fires</b> outside of burned area perimeters. Fire radiative power was lower for this class of <b>active</b> <b>fires.</b> Small fires substantially increased burned area in several continental-scale regions, including Equatorial Asia (157 %), Central America (143 %), and Southeast Asia (90 %) during 2001 – 2010. Globally, accounting for small fires increased total burned area by approximately by 35 %, from 345 Mha/yr to 464 Mha/yr. A formal quantification of uncertainties was not possible, but sensitivity analyses of key model parameters caused estimates of global burned area increases from small fires to vary between 24 % and 54 %. Biomass burning carbon emissions increased by 35 % at a global scale when small fires were included in GFED 3, from 1. 9 Pg C/yr to 2. 5 Pg C/yr. The contribution of tropical forest fires to year-to-year variability in carbon fluxes increased because small fires amplified emissions from Central America, South America and Southeast Asia—regions where drought stress and burned area varied considerably from year to year in response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation and other climate modes...|$|R

500|$|Sawtooth National Forest has an <b>active</b> <b>Fire</b> Management Program which {{recognize}}s that forest fires are {{a natural part}} of the ecosystem, but this was not always the case. The 1987 forest plan did not recognize fire as an ecosystem process or as a tool for ecosystem management; this was rectified in the 2012 forest plan. Previous firefighting efforts, which emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, caused dead and dying trees to accumulate well in excess of the level found when fires are allowed to burn out naturally. Historically speaking, fires became more common in parts of the SNRA after the development of lodgepole pine forests, which occurred prior to 1450AD. Between 1989 and 1998 there were on average 50 fires per year, with 58 percent of them caused by lightning. The Smoky Mountains of Idaho were named from the frequent forest fires, and in 2007 the Castle Rock Fire burned [...] of the Smoky Mountains near Ketchum. In 2005 the Valley Road Fire burned [...] in the White Cloud Mountains after being ignited from embers that came from a trash barrel which were blown out on a windy day. In August 2013 the Beaver Creek Fire and the Kelley Fire were both ignited by lightning and burned [...] and , respectively, of the Fairfield and Ketchum ranger districts. Another lightning-caused fire, the McCan Fire, burned [...] of the Fairfield Ranger District and other lands north of Fairfield in 2013. Both natural and prescribed fires are used as a tool to maintain desired vegetation and fuel levels. While the forest's fire plan operates within historical fire regimes, locally fire is actively suppressed to protect human life, investments, and resources.|$|E

The VIIRS sensor operates with a specific pixel aggregation scheme, with the along-scan growth of pixel size significantly reduced. In addition, VIIRS is expected to detect more fires than MODIS, given its spatial resolution (Csiszar et al. 2014).

30|$|The {{simulation}} framework {{was designed}} to emphasize the most active period of the Tavira wildfire: from ignition (day 18 at 13  h) until it reached its southern edges (day 19 at 24  h) (UTC time).

Different time steps were defined to establish the duration of each simulation and compare the probabilistic results with the spatial–temporal distribution of <b>active</b> <b>fires</b> and the reported fire front location information.|$|R
30|$|Simulations re-initialized at t 3 {{present the}} highest burn probabilities within the <b>active</b> <b>fires</b> footprint, {{possibly}} {{due to a}} combination of factors: 72  % of the ignitions occurred over shrub fuel type (Fig.  11), a larger number of ignition points (n =  133) and a shorter simulation duration, with lower error accumulation. Later in the simulation’s time span, re-initializing simulations with satellite data produced better results comparing with t 0, e.g., day 20 at 22  h, simulations t 0, t 1, t 2 and t 3 present medium probability values of 74, 86, 90 and 94  %, respectively. The underestimation of fire spread simulations initialized at t 0 is now being counterbalanced by the re-initialization of simulations with satellite <b>active</b> <b>fires.</b> Nevertheless, likely or probable burn probabilities were still obtained for simulations initialized at t 0 at this time.|$|R

2500|$|A {{fire hydrant}} is an <b>active</b> <b>fire</b> {{protection}} measure, {{and a source}} of water provided in most urban, suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire. Before the existence of fire hydrants, a primitive fire suppression system known as [...] "fire plugs" [...] consisted of burying a wooden water pipe (often no more than a hollowed out log) along the streets for teams of bucket brigades to form and fight fires. Wooden pegs would then need to be hammered over fire plugs in order to stop the flow of water. The invention of a post or pillar type fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr., Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801. It had a combination hose/faucet outlet and was of [...] "wet barrel" [...] design with the valve in the top. It is said that Graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant, but this cannot be verified {{due to the fact that}} the patent office in Washington D.C. was burned to the ground in 1836 where all patent records from that time period were destroyed in the process. In 1863, Birdsill Holly invented the modern version of the fire hydrant. While Holly was only one of many involved in the development of the fire hydrant, innovations he introduced are largely responsible for the fire hydrant taken for granted today. In 1869, Holly was issued U.S. patent #94749, for an [...] "improved fire hydrant".|$|E

Confusion about fire intensity, fire severity, burn severity, and related terms can result in the potential misuse of the inferred information by land managers and remote sensing practitioners who require unambiguous remote sensing products for fire management. The objective of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive review of current and potential remote sensing methods used to assess fire behavior and effects and ecological responses to fire. We clarify the terminology to facilitate development and interpretation of comprehensible and defensible remote sensing products, present the potential and limitations of a variety of approaches for remotely measuring <b>active</b> <b>fires</b> and their post-fire ecological effects, and discuss challenges and future directions of fire-related remote sensing research...|$|R
