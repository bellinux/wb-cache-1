40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the illumination characteristics of LED lights objectively to ease the selection of surgical lighting. Methods. The illuminance distributions of 5 main and 4 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lights</b> were measured in 8 clinically relevant scenarios. For each light and scenario, the maximum illuminance E-c (klux) and the size of the light field d(10) (mm) were computed. Results. The results showed: that large variations for both E-c (25 - 160 klux) and d(10) (109 - 300 mm) existed; that using <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lights</b> reduced both E-c and d(10) by up to 80 % and 30 %; that with segmented lights, uneven light distributions occurred; and that with colored LED lights shadow edges on the surgical field became colored. Conclusions. Objective illuminance measurements show a wide variation between lights and a superiority of main over <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lights.</b> Uneven light distributions and colored shadows indicate that LED lights still need to converge to an optimal desig...|$|R

Also, building numbers are often obscured by darkness, making it difficult for emergency workers to find the scene of an emergency. For these reasons, emergency vehicles are often equipped with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lighting,</b> such as: ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the cost of rear-end collisions in Denmark, and to define the potential financial benefits of a high, center-mounted <b>auxiliary</b> brake <b>light</b> for automobiles. The study was limited to passenger cars struck from behind. The annual cost of two different preventive programs involving <b>auxiliary</b> brake <b>lights</b> was compared to the annual cost of the accidents expected to be prevented in each program. The finding was that rear-end collisions cost on average over 13, 700 1980 Danish kroner (approx. US$ 2300), 70 % of which was property damage. There are so many rear-end collisions that even if the new brake-light configuration were only one-third as effective in Denmark as it has been in U. S. field trials the mounting of required <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lights</b> would be a sound investment. Substantial savings would be anticipated whether the <b>auxiliary</b> brake <b>lights</b> were required on all passenger cars as of a particular date, or only on newly registered passenger cars, although the former preventive program is preferable by usual cost benefit criteria.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for calculating the diffraction efficiency kinetics of the grating recorded by two parallel circular polarized recording beams was proposed, based on Jones-matrix and photochromic two-state theory. The diffraction efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating {{was measured by}} system of four-wave coupled light path. The theoreical analysis and the experimental results show that, in the condition of adding linearly polarized <b>auxiliary</b> violet <b>light,</b> when linearly polarized reconstruction light parallel with linearly polarized <b>auxiliary</b> violet <b>light,</b> the diffraction efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating is maximum; when linearly polarized reconstruction light perpendicular to linearly polarized <b>auxiliary</b> violet <b>light,</b> the diffraction efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating is minimum. The angle between linearly polarized reconstruction light and linearly polarized <b>auxiliary</b> violet <b>light</b> produces a cosine modulation on the kinetics of the diffraction efficiency. It indicates that parallel circular polarization recorded grating in bacteriorhodopsin induced by polarized violet light became polarizing grating. Â©, 2015, Chinese Optical Society.

50|$|The Byzantines fielded {{various types}} of light cavalry to {{complement}} their Kataphraktos, {{in much the same}} way as the Romans employed <b>auxiliary</b> <b>light</b> infantry to augment their armoured infantry legionaries. Due to the empire's long experience, they were wary of relying too much upon foreign auxiliaries or mercenaries (with the notable exception of the Varangian Guard). Imperial armies usually comprised mainly citizens and loyal subjects. The decline of the Byzantine military during the 11th century is parallel to the decline of the peasant-soldier, which led to the increased use of unreliable mercenaries.|$|E
50|$|The ferries' masts now carry four red, {{one white}} and one green light at various points. Prior to refit, {{they had only}} a {{forward-facing}} white light. This is because all the ferries have been upgraded to a class 3 certificate, enabling them to sail much further and to various other locations such as Llandudno and Barrow-in-Furness. The extra lights are only used in this situation. Briefly, the Royal Daffodil carried a white half mast light which was suspended within the rigging. This was due to an electric failure in her main mast head lamp and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>light</b> had to be used.|$|E

50|$|Limited {{depth of}} field is an {{important}} consideration in macro photography. Depth of field is extremely small when focusing on close objects. A small aperture (high f-number) is often required to produce acceptable sharpness across a three-dimensional subject.

40|$|Green-weight {{is a novel}} system {{designed}} to supply a high-rise building with all its needs of electricity using wind energy and to supplement its lighting needs with natural sunlight. David Fisher has proposed an ingenious method to harness the wind for electricity production in an urban setting. His approach is based on using horizontal wind turbines instead of the typical and esthetically awkward looking vertical wind turbines and to incorporate them within the building structure. In this paper we will present our proof-of-concept study of the proposed system. Based on our prototype design of the wind turbines and overall system analysis. In {{the second part of}} our paper we will present our proposed <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lighting</b> system. Our system is designed to collect and transfer the sunlight into the building. We estimate that our <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lighting</b> system will save between 40 to 60 % from the power needed to light the building during daytime. Another very importantly aspect of our lighting system is the proven fact that natural lighting enhances the living experience of the building occupants (for example, to combat psychological seasonal disorders) ...|$|R

5000|$|One {{category}} of presence sensing devices is Photoelectric Sensors. Light Curtains {{fall into this}} category. Light curtains use many infrared light beams to form a perimeter around machinery. When two or more consecutively adjacent beams are interrupted, a kill-switch stops the machine until the boundary is reset. Light curtains must be {{placed in front of}} the work area. This makes it difficult for press brake operators to work on small parts. One cannot help but disrupt the beam. The operator might [...] "mute" [...] the light curtain {{in order to get the}} job done. Certain parts of the beam can be muted. For example, muting the front and rear of the beam allows the middle to offer continued protection for the operator. Additionally, it may be necessary to use <b>auxiliary</b> <b>light</b> beams if the operator will reach between the main light beams and the edge of certain machines.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the small}} size of fully {{automatic}} camcorders with large view screens and long-life rechargeable batteries has reduced the housing size and made underwater videography an easy, fun activity for the diver. Low-cost wide-angle lens add-ons are available for many cameras and some can even be fitted outside the camera housing for versatile use. This lets the photographer get closer and make the subject clearer and also with fewer focusing and depth of field problems. Today cameras are more sensitive to low light conditions and make automatic color balancing adjustments. Nevertheless, deeper water videography still needs <b>auxiliary</b> <b>light</b> sources to bring out colors filtered out of sunlight by the distance it has travelled through water. The longest wavelengths of light are lost first (reds and yellows) leaving only a greenish or blue cast in deep water. Even a hand light will help show off some of the magnificent colors of a coral reef or other marine life if used during recording.|$|E
