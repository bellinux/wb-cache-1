40|$|A generic {{parallel}} combinatorial {{method was}} used in order to attempt to develop new asymmetric processes for the aza-Diels-Alder reaction. Initially, an N-para-methoxyphenyl glyoxylate derived imine and its reactions {{with a variety of}} dienes was examined. Several new adducts were obtained, which included both "normal" "inverse" electron-demand aza-Diels-Alder products, and an acyclic product. These results strongly suggested the intervention of a stepwise addition-cyclisation mode of the reaction of diene with the imine. Later, new W-phosphorus imines were examined as dienophile substrates for aza-Diels-Alder reactions. The results of the reactions between these imines and a variety of dienes showed a reduced level of imine reactivity when compared to the N-para-methoxyphenyl C-carboxylate-derived system. Several new products were obtained and the results indicated a stepwise reaction process was in operation, due to the formation of other di-dehydro-piperidinone or <b>acyclic</b> <b>ketone</b> or aldehyde derivatives, hi this study, the first apparent N-phosphonyl imino-Diels-Alder reaction on such systems has been recorded.

40|$|The first enantioselective, {{catalytic}} vinylogous Mukaiyama-Michael {{reaction of}} siloxyfurans with simple alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes {{has been reported}} using chiral imidazolidinones. This methodology provides access to enantioenriched gamma-butenolides, a privileged motif in organic synthesis. The utility of this organocatalytic Mukaiyama-Michael reaction was highlighted by the total syntheses of ( [...] ) -spiculisporic acid and ( [...] ) - 5 -epi-spiculisporic acid. Investigations into the total syntheses of cylindrocyclophanes A and F necessitated {{the development of a}} novel B-alkyl Suzuki cross-coupling of trimethylanilinium salts using a nickel(0) catalyst and bulky phosphine ligand. This methodology study revealed a very competitive nickel-catalyzed demethylation pathway, which produced dimethylaniline byproducts. A possible explanation for this side reaction is discussed. This technology was applied to a dimerization strategy for the C 2 -symmetric cylindrocyclophane F. Synthesis of a dimerization precursor included an enantioselective organocatalytic 1, 4 -addition of 3, 5 -dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylaniline into an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. However, the B-alkyl Suzuki cross-coupling was unsuccessful in promoting a dimerization. Next, the synthesis of cylindrocyclophane A was explored using an alternative ring-closing metathesis dimerization strategy. A dimerization precursor was to be assembled via the cross-coupling of trimethylanilinium salts with potassium (vinyl) trifluoroborate salts, whose syntheses featured an organocatalytic 1, 4 -conjugate reduction of a beta,beta-disubstituted enal. This cross-coupling strategy revealed olefin isomerization as a major side-reaction in the nickel-catalyzed Suzuki dimerization, making this route a non-productive approach to the natural product. Lastly, formal synthesis of cylindrocyclophane A was accomplished using (i) a nickel-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling of an activated vinyl stannane with a judiciously chosen trimethylanilinium salt and (ii) an asymmetric palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation of an <b>acyclic</b> <b>ketone.</b> The latter represents the first example of application of the Pd 2 (dba) 3 /t-Bu-PHOX catalyst system to effect an asymmetric allylic alkylation on an acyclic system with good stereoselectivity.

40|$|Part I. Ultra-violet light {{irradiation}} of dollarαdollar,dollarβdollar-unsaturated ketones possessing a dollarγdollar-hydrogen {{as well as}} a dollarγdollar-alkyl substituent results in isomerization to their dollarβdollar,dollarγdollar-unsaturated isomers. The process occurs by an intramolecular dollarγdollar-hydrogen abstraction by the excited carbonyl to generate a dienol intermediate. The deconjugation reaction is not efficient for dollarαdollar,dollarβdollar-unsaturated ketones which do not possess a dollarγdollar-alkyl substituent; this is because thermal 1, 5 -hydrogen transfer in the dienol intermediate gives back starting ketone efficiently. Part I of this thesis describes a procedure for trapping dienols generated photochemically from several dollarγdollar-unsubstituted dollarαdollar,dollarβdollar-unsaturated ketones. The trap used is chlorotrimethylsilane {{in the presence of a}} weak organic base imidazole. This yields (Z) - 2 -trimethylsiloxy- 2, 4 -dienes regioselectively and with high stereoselectivity in synthetically useful yields. Thermal procedures such as sequential treatment of the unsaturated ketone with lithium diisopropylamide and chlorotrimethylsilane, or treatment of the ketone under equilibrating conditions with triethylamine and chlorotrimethylsilane, yields predominantly the kinetic 2 -trimethylsiloxy- 1, 3 -dienes or mixtures of the kinetic and the E- and Z-siloxy- 2, 4 -dienes.;The triplet energies of an acyclic dollarαdollar,dollarβdollar-unsaturated ketone and acyclic dollarαdollar,dollarβdollar-unsaturated ester were determined by a technique of competitive quenching of a series of triplet sensitizers of varying triplet energy. The triplet energy of the <b>acyclic</b> <b>ketone</b> and ester were both found to be 72. 0 dollar±dollar 0. 5 kcal/mol. This value is comparable to that of the cyclic analogues.;Part II. Part II of the thesis describes the fluorescence behaviour of N-benzoylcarbazole, 52, N-naphthoylindole, 89, N-mesitoylindole, 90, and Indomethacin, 91, as well as the photochemical behaviour of 89, 90, and 91 in the presence of cyclopentene. Compounds 52, 89, and 91 fluoresce weakly at anomalously long wavelength. The intensity and wavelength is dependent upon solvent polarity.

40|$|Part I. The {{stereochemistry}} of hydride {{reduction of}} the <b>acyclic</b> <b>ketone</b> 3 -phenyl- 2 -butanone and the cyclic analogue 2 -phenyl cyclohexanone was investigated {{using a variety of}} aluminum, boron, and silicone hydrides. It was observed that in both the acyclic and cyclic systems, temperature, metal cation associated with the hydride, solvent, and groups alpha to the ketone group fail to be a dominant factor in directing stereochemistry during reduction. The size of the hydride was however found to be of greatest importance in the cyclic systems while of much lesser significance in the acyclic system. Isotope effects and product ratio studies suggest the possibility of non chair even distorted boat conformations in the transition state to adequately explain rates of reduction, isotope effects, and steric effects leading to observed products. A new carbon- 13 method was developed to accurately determine product ratios which used the paramagnetic metal complex Cr(AcAc) (, 3) as a relaxation agent. ^ Part II. The carbon- 13 proton coupled spectrum {{of a wide variety of}} ortho-substituted aromatics which in principal were capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding were studied. It was found that a large majority of the 1, 2 substituted aromatics with the amino,phenol, and amide groups as proton donors, bonded in tramolecularly with accepting groups such as ketone and ester carbonyls, nitro, methoxy, and others to the extent that on the NMR time scale exchange rates were slow enough so as to be able to see the three bond couplings into the aromatic ring. The value of the couple is in the region of 5 - 7 Hz for an anti geometry between the C(, 3) and hydrogen bonded proton and about 2 - 3 Hz for the syn arrangement. These values were found to be both ring size independent (size of the ring in the hydrogen bonding array) and the coupling constant relatively insensitive to dihedral angle. ^ Part III. The conformational analysis on a series of acyclic vicinal acyclic nitro-alcohols were performed. The systems employed were designed to test both the preference for hydrogen bonding as a controlling factor in conformation as well as electronegative effects. Found was that the nitro group contrary to its behavior in aromatic systems is a poor hydrogen bond acceptor and that the stereochemistry for both erythro and threo isomers are dominated by steric interactions. It is found that where there were vicinal dialkyl or alkyl-aryl groups the trans arrangement between these groups is preferred. The effect of the trihalo group -CX(, 3) is one of varying steric size (CF(, 3) ( [...] - 3 ̆e) CBr(, 3)) rather than electronic effects. In one case containing the -CCl(, 3) group preferred conformations suggest some type of attractive steric or electronic effects between the trihalo methyl and nitro groups. ...|$|E
