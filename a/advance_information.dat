5|$|Many German radio {{messages}} were encoded using the Enigma machine and other enciphering techniques and the codes were changed frequently. A team of code breakers stationed at Bletchley Park worked to break codes {{as quickly as}} possible to provide <b>advance</b> <b>information</b> on German plans and troop movements. British military intelligence code-named this information Ultra intelligence as it could only be provided to the top level of commanders. The Enigma code used by Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, Oberbefehlshaber West (Supreme Commander West; OB West), commander of the Western Front, was broken by the end of March. German intelligence changed the Enigma codes right after the Allied landings of 6 June but by 17 June the Allies were again consistently able to read them.|$|E

Nearly 10 million refugees fled to India. R was instrumental {{in the formation of the}} Bangladeshi guerilla organisation Mukti Bahini and responsible for supplying information, providing training and heavy ammunition to this organisation. It is also alleged that R planned and executed the 1971 Indian Airlines hijacking as a false flag operation to ban overflight by Pakistani aircraft and disrupt Pakistani troop movement in East Pakistan. Special Frontier Force, the paramilitary wing of R actively participated in military operations especially in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The war ended in the successful creation of Bangladesh.However, four years later Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated on 15 August 1975 at his residence. RAW operatives claimed that they had <b>advance</b> <b>information</b> about Mujib-ur-Rahman's assassination but Sheikh Mujib tragically ignored inputs. He was killed along with 40 members of his family. R thus failed to prevent the assassination which led to the loss of a charismatic leader who was appreciative of India for its help. Later, R successfully thwarted plans of assassinating Sheikh Hasina Wazed, daughter of Mujibur Rahman, by Islamist extremists.|$|E

500|$|In {{the season}} eight premiere, it is {{revealed}} that the Veritas device does not allow others to control Clark, but rather strips him of his powers. Wandering the globe with Russian gangsters, Clark is eventually found and rescued by Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) and John Jones, with the latter restoring Clarks powers. During season eight, Clark uses his new job at the Daily Planet to access <b>advance</b> <b>information,</b> which he uses to stop crime around the city. In subsequent episodes, Clark adopts the name [...] "Red-Blue Blur" [...] as his superhero moniker. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Clark wrestles with the idea of having to kill Davis Bloome (Sam Witwer), a new friend, after discovering that Davis is actually Doomsday, a genetically engineered creature created by General Zod to kill Clark and destroy Earth. In the season eight finale, Clark finds a way to separate Davis' personality from that of Doomsday, and buries Doomsday a mile underground. When Davis subsequently kills Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore), Clark decides that his human-learned emotions have caused him the most trouble, as it was his compassion for Davis that led to Jimmy's death. He vows that [...] "Clark Kent is dead".|$|E

It is believed that competency in the use of these technologies has contributed to the ability of A 2 ̆ 6 E design firms to perform engineering design services effectively and efficiently. Review of the literature suggests that the use of <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> technologies has had lasting interactive effects on the strategy, structure, management, tasks, and the personnel of organizations. There does not, however, appear to be any dissertation research on the impact of <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> technologies on architecture and engineering firms.

The objective of the research was to determine the impacts that <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> technologies have had on A 2 ̆ 6 E design firms and to determine if those impacts have been favorable or not. Additionally, a group of 2 ̆ 2 competency 2 ̆ 2 indicators was developed as part of the research.

40|$|Efforts {{to improve}} {{information}} literacy levels in academic institutions are often focused on undergraduate students, and mostly address {{the improvement of}} information retrieval skills. This practice is also evident in information literacy programs offered for postgraduate researchers, if offered at all. Although there have been radical transformations in scholarly communication and practice in recent years, there is still an assumption among many that researchers on postgraduate level are sufficiently information literate {{to deal with the}} new challenges. A gradual awareness of the unique needs of postgraduate researchers in a dynamic and demanding academic environment is, however, developing. Literature in this regard is, unfortunately, limited and scattered, with the majority of studies performed in academic institutions outside the borders of South Africa. The aim of this paper, which forms part of an exploratory component of a doctoral study, is to suggest important components which {{should be included in the}} framework for planning and ultimately designing an <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> literacy program focussing on postgraduate engineering researchers. This paper will report on the foundational exploration required to determine what an <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> literacy program for postgraduate engineering students should entail. This includes: (1) a basic conceptualization of <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> literacy; (2) a review of reports of information literacy programs aimed at postgraduate researchers; (3) the identification of <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> literacy activities featuring during the research process; and (4) an encapsulating conceptualization (i. e. definition) of <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> literacy, building on (1) – (3). The latter could direct data collection from postgraduate engineering researchers on their research information needs and skills to determine their needs for an <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> literacy program. In this paper issues (1) – (4) are presented as an exploratory framework for a study on designing a research focused <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> literacy program for engineering postgraduates...|$|R
