500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Give It Away" [...] is {{performed}} in the time signature of 4/4 time. The track begins with a distinctively [...] "dry" [...] guitar tone that is similar in style {{to the rest of}} the record. Producer Rick Rubin had a considerable influence on the sound of Blood Sugar Sex Magik by removing much of the reverb and guitar layering that epitomized the band's previous album Mother's Milk. This caused the record to contain simpler and dryer guitar and bass chords that were not filtered through guitar effects—those that did, however, were made with vintage electronics from the 1960s and 70s. For [...] "Give It Away", along with the rest of the album, Rubin sought to achieve a sense of atmosphere that was similar to 60s records that were made without commercialism or viability in mind and to downplay on [...] "big" [...] sounds: [...] "What you hear is what you get—there's not a lot of trickery. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> the biggest sound, with walls of guitar and huge drums. But I don't think those things matter." [...] The song follows a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure; when Kiedis begins singing, Frusciante jumps into a funk-oriented riff that is repeated throughout the verse while Flea plays a complex bass-line that makes use of virtually the entire fretboard.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the major}} film studios {{approached}} Hepburn to produce the movie version of Barry's play. She chose to sell the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio, {{on the condition that}} she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, George Cukor, and picked James Stewart and Cary Grant (to whom she ceded top-billing) as co-stars. Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, [...] "I don't want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers... think I'm too la-di-da or something. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to see me fall flat on my face." [...] Thus the film began with Grant knocking the actress flat on her backside. Berg describes how the character was crafted to have audiences [...] "laugh at her enough that they would ultimately sympathize with her", which Hepburn felt was crucial in [...] "recreating" [...] her public image. The Philadelphia Story {{was one of the biggest}} hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall. The review in Time declared, [...] "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven." [...] Herb Golden of Variety stated, [...] "It's Katharine Hepburn's picture... The perfect conception of all flighty but characterful Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the story without her is almost inconceivable." [...] Hepburn was nominated for her third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.|$|E

Luke and Noah's portrayers, Hansis and Silbermann, spoke with magazine The Advocate about the attention the storyline has generated. [...] "The fan response has been really great to both the individual characters and where we're taking the relationship," [...] Silbermann stated. [...] "Noah and Luke were voted top couple in a Soap Opera Digest poll. The funny thing is, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> them to be happy, but a lot want them to suffer heartache and tragedy [...] because that's what couples on daytime TV do.

[...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking.

[...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting.
