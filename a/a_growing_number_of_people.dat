5|$|<b>A</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> {{among them}} Captain William Rooke Creswell, the {{director}} of the Commonwealth Naval Forces, demanded an autonomous Australian navy, financed and controlled by Australia. In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was not impressed with the Admiralty, and in 1908 invited the United States Great White Fleet to visit Australia. The visit prompted public enthusiasm for a modern navy and led to the order of two 700-ton s, a purchase that angered the British. The surge in German naval construction in 1909 led the Australian admiralty to change its position on an Australian navy, which resulted in the Naval Defence Act of 1910 being passed which created the Australian navy.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh tried to revive the Bábí community, mostly through correspondence, writing {{extensively}} to give the Bábís {{a new understanding of}} the Bábí religion, while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by the Báb and a Manifestation of God hidden. He was soon recognized by the Bábís, as well as government authorities, as the foremost Bábí leader, and there was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> joining the Bábí movement. He also gained sympathy from government officials and Sunni clerics. Bahá'u'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. The Persian government asked the Ottoman government to extradite Bahá'u'lláh to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bahá'u'lláh from the sensitive border region to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{important}} issue {{during the campaign}} {{was that of the}} languages in the country. The status of the Swedish and Russian languages was an hot-button issue. <b>A</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> believe that the Swedish language should be abolished as the country's second official language, as {{only a small percentage of}} the country use Swedish as their first language and that a large number of government officials do not use Swedish. A report by the Council of Europe stated that the Swedish language's status as Finland's second official language was in danger of being eroded in the longer term because of the officials' poor language skills and the lack of opportunities to study the language. However, the status of Russian was considered to be rising as several municipalities in eastern Finland sought to increase the role of the language at local schools. At the time, Swedish was spoken by 5.42% of the population as their mother tongue, with Russian spoken by 1.01% and the Sami languages spoken by 0.03%.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} a topic of {{discussion}} of who is {{held accountable for the}} collection and distribution of personal information. Some will say that it is the fault of the social networks because {{they are the ones who}} are storing the vast amounts of information and data, but others claim that it is the users who are responsible for the issue because it is the users themselves that provide the information in the first place. This relates to the ever-present issue of how society regards social media sites. There is <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that are discovering the risks of putting their personal information online and trusting a website to keep it private. Yet in a recent study, researchers found that young people are taking measures to keep their posted information on Facebook private to some degree. Examples of such actions include managing their privacy settings so that certain content can be visible to [...] "Only Friends" [...] and ignoring Facebook friend requests from strangers.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, {{the phrase}} [...] "yellow peril" [...] was popularized in the U.S. by {{newspapers}} owned by William Randolph Hearst. [...] It {{was also the}} title of a popular book by an influential U.S. religious figure, G. G. Rupert, who published The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident in 1911. [...] Based on the phrase [...] "the kings from the East" [...] in the Christian scriptural verse Revelation 16:12, Rupert, who believed in the doctrine of British Israelism, claimed that China, India, Japan and Korea were attacking England and the U.S., but that Jesus Christ would stop them. In his 1982 book The Yellow Peril: Chinese Americans in American fiction, 1850-1940, William F. Wu states that [...] "Pulp magazines in the 30s had a lot of yellow peril characters loosely based on Fu Manchu...

2500|$|Another {{development}} {{facilitating the}} invention and popularization of the proto-hamburger was the increased production of beef through livestock intensification. By the late 19th century, an increasing {{amount of land}} was being devoted to cattle and <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> being employed as cowboys, resulting in the United States {{becoming one of the}} world's largest producers and consumers of beef. The 1880s were declared The Golden Age of Beef, during which the abundance of rural beef production made vital its transportation by rail from agricultural to urban areas. This gave rise to various methods of meat preservation for making possible the consumption of fresh meat in urban and industrialized areas, among the refrigerator cars and different methods of packaging meat (such as corned beef), which were promoted by industrialists like Gustavus Swift (1839–1903). Around this time, the city of Chicago, along with other cities on the East Coast, became a focal point for the large-scale processing of beef. Beef was already inexpensive at that time, and it was available to the working class. This put the Hamburg steak within reach of {{the vast majority of the}} population, giving rise to what some authors jokingly call the [...] "American beef dream". In this era, the number of steakhouses that specialized in serving steaks increased markedly; some restaurants even served steak along with seafood, in a dish known as Surf and turf.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic bishops {{issued on}} 25 May 2014, the 23rd {{anniversary of the}} {{independence}} of the state, a pastoral letter that some saw as critical of the Government. An English translation of the document, the original of which is in the Tigrinya language, extends to 17 pages. The bishops spoke of the emigration of the many young Eritreans who risk their lives in the hope of emigrating to other countries. They repeated what they had written in 2001: [...] "o-one leaves a land of milk and honey to seek another country offering the same opportunities. If one's homeland is a place of peace, jobs and freedom of expression {{there is no reason to}} leave it to suffer hardship, loneliness and exile in an effort to look for opportunity elsewhere." [...] They spoke also of [...] "the delusion engendered as result of the non-achievement of the ends proposed, the uselessness of one’s own aspirations, looking to distant lands as the only alternative for self-fulfilment, are bringing <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to frustration and desperation. They find themselves looking at a horizon that grows always darker and heavier. Alongside this, the breakup of the family unit inside the country – through military service unlimited in terms of time and monetary reward and through the imprisonment of many young people in actual prison or in punishment camps – is exposing to misery not only elderly parents with no visible means of support, but also entire families and it is having serious consequences at the economic level as well as at the psychological and mental levels." ...|$|E
2500|$|McKinney gained {{national}} attention for remarks she made following the 2001 US attacks, {{charging that the}} United States had advance knowledge of the attacks and that US President George W. Bush may have been aware and allowed them to happen, allegedly due to his father's business interests: [...] "It is known that President Bush's father, through The Carlyle Group, had–at {{the time of the}} attacks–joint business interests with the bin Laden construction company and many defense industry holdings, the stocks of which have soared since September 11." [...] In the month that followed the attacks, when New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani refused to cash a $10 million check written by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in light of the Prince's suggestion that the attacks were an indication that the United States [...] "should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the Palestinian cause," [...] McKinney published an open letter to the Saudi Prince. She expressed her disappointment at Giuliani's action and stated, [...] "Let me say that there are <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in the United States who recognize, like you, that U.S. policy in the Middle East needs serious examination...Your Royal Highness, many of us here in the United States have long been concerned about reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that reveal a pattern of excessive, and often indiscriminate, use of lethal force by Israeli security forces in situations where Palestinian demonstrators were unarmed and posed no threat of death or serious injury to the security forces or to others." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 9, {{eight days}} after the Longhorns' final game, DeLoss Dodds {{announced}} Abe Lemons' firing. Dodds was not specific as to the reasons, vaguely citing a [...] "series of incidents from this and past years, along {{with the need for}} new leadership and direction." [...] The news met with surprise and outrage from players and fans. Lemons, who, despite some struggles, had presided over the resurrection of Texas basketball during the preceding six seasons, professed shock. Even with the collapse following Wacker's injury, there had been no indications that his job was in jeopardy. Privately, though, Dodds had faced pressure from important administrators and boosters to dismiss the popular Lemons ever since he had arrived at Texas the prior autumn. A powerful faction of UT officials and donors felt that Lemons was presiding over an undisciplined program and that he had become excessively and irresponsibly outspoken. His refusal to enforce a curfew or to punish players for missing practices, for instance, had already drawn criticism in the past. A lack of academic progress during his time at Texas was another reflection of a shortage of discipline and another cause for embarrassment for UT officials. Only one player that Lemons recruited to Austin graduated during his tenure. Moreover, his sharp-tongued and indiscriminate public insults and criticism of people ranging from UT administrators and faculty to officials and coaches at other schools to SWC administrators and referees had progressively earned Lemons the ill will and resentment of <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> with influence over UT athletics. Lemons remained a popular figure among fans, but his support among administrators and powerful donors had dissipated. Following the end of the season, the UT Office of the President and the Board of Regents directed Dodds to fire Lemons, who had two years at $52,000 per year remaining on his contract. The ousted head coach did not leave quietly, commenting that he wanted a glass-bottomed car so that he could see Dodds' face as he ran him over, and adding, [...] "I hope they notice the mistletoe tied to my coattails as I leave town." [...] Despite the acrimonious parting, Lemons would be invited back to reunions in later years and would eventually be inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1994.|$|E
