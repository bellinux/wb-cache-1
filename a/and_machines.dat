5|$|Around midnight, {{the men of}} the 72nd and the 52nd passed Bab al-Wad noiselessly {{and then}} {{separated}} towards their respective targets. One company took Deir Ayyub, which was empty, but then were discovered as they did so by enemies on a nearby hill. They suffered the joint fire of the Legion's artillery <b>and</b> <b>machines</b> guns. Thirteen men were killed and several other injured. The company, composed mainly of immigrants, then retreated to Bab al-Wad. The 52nd Battalion was preparing to take the hill in front of Yalu, but received an order to retreat.|$|E
5|$|The Center for Advanced Power Systems is a {{multidisciplinary}} research center organized to perform basic and applied research {{to advance the}} field of power systems technology.

5|$|The Combine is {{composed}} of various species <b>and</b> <b>machines.</b> The most commonly encountered enemies throughout Half-Life 2 and its expansions are the transhuman Overwatch soldiers and human Civil Protection officers. A variety of combat machines also encountered, ranging from APCs and helicopter gunships to a giant 'Smart wall' which encloses occupied cities and gradually destroys anything in its path. A number of weaponised alien 'synths' are also encountered by Freeman.|$|E
5|$|The {{galvanization}} of Mogadishu's {{real estate}} sector {{was in part}} facilitated by {{the establishment of a}} local construction yard in November 2012 by the Municipality of Istanbul and the Turkish Red Crescent. With 50 construction trucks <b>and</b> <b>machines</b> imported from Turkey, the yard produces concrete, asphalt and paving stones for building projects. The Istanbul Municipality was also scheduled to bring in 100 specialists to accelerate the construction initiative, which ultimately aims to modernize the capital's infrastructure and serve it over the long-term.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Kerst {{worked at}} General Electric Company for a year, {{working on the}} {{development}} of x-ray tubes <b>and</b> <b>machines.</b> He found this frustrating, as x-ray research required high energies that could not be produced at the time. In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where the head of the physics department, F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better particle accelerator. The result of these efforts was the betatron. When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction, reaching energies of 2.3 MeV.|$|E
5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 {{was the first}} manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities <b>and</b> <b>machines</b> developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E

IGMW focuses on the manufacturing of gear and power transmission components for a variety of industries. The importance and influence of the <b>machining</b> <b>and</b> manufacturing industry will be looked at locally, within Canada, in North America, and around the world, to compare different markets and strengthen the analysis of the Ideal Gear & Machine Works company. By looking at competition within the industry and upcoming threats to the gear <b>and</b> <b>machining</b> business, a strategic analysis will be completed to analyse choices needed to be made at Ideal Gear <b>and</b> <b>Machine</b> Works. A conclusion will be drawn regarding a set of product proposals and business plans which will provide Ideal Gear <b>and</b> <b>Machine</b> Works stronger competitive advantage within the <b>machining</b> industry <b>and</b> greater profitability...|$|R
