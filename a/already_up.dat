500|$|Critics also {{commented on}} the Hackney controversy. Sarah Dean of the UK edition of The Huffington Post said: [...] "If having a blonde, leather-clad superstar brandishing a gun at a shop owner's face isn't glamourising violence, I'm not sure what is" [...] and added that, in essence, the video [...] "seems more like an {{opportunity}} for her to live out her sexual fantasies than anything beneficial to music fans." [...] Amanda Dobbins of New York stated that [...] "After viewing the final product, we're guessing [...] probably won't be down with the shower sex, the regular sex, the domestic abuse, the armed robbery, or any of Britney's other questionable activities, either." [...] Katherine St Asaph of Popdust joked about the situation, saying, [...] "Britney Spears’ video for 'Criminal' is out, and gang recruitment is <b>already</b> <b>up</b> 200% since 8 a.m.! This has not happened." [...] Marianne Garvey of the UK website of E! Online said, [...] "With the 'fantasy' getting so hot and heavy and Britney stripping down to nothing, the guns are {{the last thing you}} notice." ...|$|E
500|$|Hewson {{has long}} {{advocated}} for a children's museum for Ireland, {{inspired by a}} positive experience her daughters had at the Dallas Children's Museum in the mid-1990s. In 2003, plans were announced to build the so-called Exploration Station {{as part of an}} overall €500million Heuston Gate development project near the Dublin Heuston railway station. The children-oriented science centre was to be owned by the Irish Children's Museum charitable trust, with Hewson as a prominent member of the museum. Hewson said, [...] "Seeing as we're nearly the last European country in on it, we can learn from children's museums <b>already</b> <b>up</b> and running and expand on them." [...] However, {{over the next few years}} the science centre faced significant cost overruns in the planning stages and a possible European Commission investigation into how the Office of Public Works had handled the awarding of the contract for it. The effects of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 then put a halt to the entire Heuston Gate project. As of November 2012, there were no signs that the Heuston Gate or science centre projects would be revived.|$|E

2500|$|In 1846 Konstantin's sister, Grand Duchess Olga, married Crown Prince Charles of Württemberg. He {{went with}} her to Stuttgart then he {{continued}} to Altenburg to be introduced to Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg. His parents had arranged the meeting thinking that Alexandra might make a good match for Konstantin. Alexandra was strikingly beautiful, tall and slim and Konstantin was immediately eager to marry her. [...] "I don't know {{what is happening to}} me. It is as if I am a completely new person. Just one thought moves me, just one image fills my eyes: forever and only she, my angel, my universe. I really do think I’m in love. However, what can it mean? I've only known her a few hours and I'm <b>already</b> <b>up</b> to my ears in Passion".|$|E

2500|$|On 15 September 2012, Walcott came on as a {{substitute}} for Gervinho and scored his first goal of the season in a 6–1 win over his former club Southampton. On 26 September, he scored twice in a 6–1 win against Coventry City in the League Cup. On 7 October 2012 Walcott once again found the back of the net in a 3–1 away victory against West Ham United to take his number of goals <b>already</b> <b>up</b> to four. On 30 October 2012, Walcott scored Arsenal's first goal in first half stoppage time and their fourth goal in second half stoppage time in a League Cup tie at Reading to help the club complete a comeback from 4–0 down to 4–4. Arsenal won 7–5 in extra time, in which Walcott completed his hat-trick and backed up his argument that he should be played as a striker. Former Gunner Niall Quinn praised Walcott's performance as incredible, in what he described as [...] "the most extraordinary game that I've seen." [...] This took him to five League Cup goals for the season, a total which would make him the top scorer in the 2012–13 competition.|$|E
