40|$|Haematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSC) are a rare {{population}} of cells {{that have the}} ability to self-renew and differentiate giving rise to various blood lineages, thereby reconstituting the whole haematopoietic system. This is an essential characteristic, exploited in bone marrow transplantation therapy in response to myeloablative treatment. Due to their rarity, the lack of sufficient HSC numbers for transplantation {{has proved to be a}} major clinical issue. Separately, in the development of leukaemia, acquired mutations in HSCs give rise to malignant cells. These cells, like HSCs, {{have the ability to}} self-renew and differentiate forming immature blasts and are termed cancer (leukaemic) stem cells. They are thought to remain in a quiescent state and are therefore not targeted by standard chemotherapy, inducing relapse in haematopoietic malignancies. In this study, a cross species stem cell based screen was conducted on a 12, 000 small molecule library across a range of adult and embryonic tissue types with a view to identifying compounds that would (i) expand HSCs ex vivo and in vivo for transplantation and (ii) eradicate cancer stem cells in leukaemia. A number of small molecules were identified as lead compounds and were assessed in our investigation. We found that Yohimbine, an alpha- 2 adrenergic receptor (adra- 2) antagonist, and Oxa- 22, cis- 2 -Methyl- 5 -trimethylammoniummethyl- 1, 3 -oxathiolane iodide (M 3 Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist) elicited a 2 - and 1. 5 - fold increase in HSC frequency (respectively) in vivo. Further competitive transplantation studies showed that Yohimbine and Oxa- 22 treated cells also enhanced the reconstitution of B cells and T cells respectively. In parallel, we also assessed Oxa- 22 and a third compound, Phthalylsulfathiazole- an <b>antibacterial</b> <b>sulphonamide,</b> in the leukaemic setting to ascertain whether compounds could target leukaemic stem cells (LSCs). We found that these compounds promoted proliferation in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines. Furthermore, when Oxa- 22 and Phthalylsulfathiazole were administered in vivo models of AML, they accelerated disease progression by increasing the number of LSCs. Collectively, these results show that using small molecules we can target neuronal related pathways to enhance HSC number and function. Further investigation is required to elucidate the exact mechanisms of the compounds however, these data may prove to be influential in directing new methods of stem cell expansion for transplantation therapies. Small molecules targeting neuronal or antibacterial related pathways were also found to target malignant LSCs and alter their behaviour. By driving LSCs out of their dormant state, these small molecules may pave the way for potential targeting of LSCs in conjuction with standard current chemotherapies that incorporate and kill proliferating cancer cells...|$|E
5000|$|... 1952 Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society His {{nomination}} reads: Distinguished {{for work}} in Bacterial biochemistry; his demonstration (1940) of the antagonistic action of p-aminobenzoic acid against the <b>antibacterial</b> action of <b>sulphonamides</b> allowed him to propose the theory of competitive inhibition of essential metabolites by substances of similar constitution which has received world wide acceptance and has led to important advances in nutrition (folic acid) and design of inhibitory substances. Woods himself in 1940 undertook secret work which deprived him then of the power to follow up his discovery. Since the war however he has developed a school of microbiology in Oxford, actively engaged in folic acid and related studies.|$|R
40|$|Death, poor {{condition}} and unsatisfactory breeding {{performance in a}} rabbit colony was attributed to infection with Passalurus ambiguus. The trouble disappeared after treatment with 50 ppm fenbendazole in the food for 5 days. In laboratory trials 12 · 5 ppm for 5 days eliminated more than 99 % of adult and most immature pinworms, 25 and 50 ppm eliminated all immature and adult pinworms. These doses were also effective against Obeliscoides cuniculi. Rabbits are bred for use in pharmacological trials from a breeding colony containing about 600 Yellow-Silver rabbits. Intercurrent mortalities occurred mainly among the young rabbits (some 40 - 60 in about 3 months), but also among the dams (10 - 15 over the same period). Treatment with a coccidiostat (0 · 012 % amprolium in the drinking water for 7 days), changing the diet, and <b>antibacterial</b> therapy (<b>sulphonamide)</b> under veterinary supervision brought only a brief temp?ra~y improvement. We were called in by the vetermarlan when several more deaths had occurred and the cause was still unknown. A pinworm infection was diagnosed and treatment initiated. Opinions on the pathogenicity of oxyurid infections in animals are divided. Oxyuriasis in man is clearly classified as pathogenic, but Passalurus ambiguus is generally regarded as non-pathogenic and of no economic significance for rabbits and hares (Flynn...|$|R
2500|$|The popular {{story of}} Winston Churchill's father paying for Fleming's {{education}} after Fleming's father saved young Winston from death is false. According to the biography, Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution by Kevin Brown, Alexander Fleming, {{in a letter}} to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia, described this as [...] "A wondrous fable." [...] Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during World War II. Churchill was saved by Lord Moran, using sulphonamides, since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in Carthage in Tunisia in 1943. The Daily Telegraph and The Morning Post on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug Sulphapyridine, known at the time under the research code M 693, discovered and produced by May & Baker Ltd, Dagenham, Essex – a subsidiary of the French group Rhône-Poulenc. In a subsequent radio broadcast, Churchill referred to the new drug as [...] "This admirable M". It is highly probable that the correct information about the sulphonamide did not reach the newspapers because, since the original <b>sulphonamide</b> <b>antibacterial,</b> Prontosil, had been a discovery by the German laboratory Bayer, and as Britain was at war with Germany at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with a British discovery, penicillin.|$|R
40|$|At {{the start}} of the {{interview}} pioneering respiratory physician Guy Scadding talks of his childhood and his medical training at Middlesex Hospital Medical School, which he compares with the more formalised programmes of the present day. He describes the period between qualifying with conjoint in 1929 and gaining his MRCP and MD (with the University gold medal) in 1932; house jobs at the Middlesex and Connaught Hospital, Walthamstow, and a position at the Brompton Hospital where he became interested in respiratory medicine. Next, Professor Scadding outlines his early career as resident medical officer at the Brompton; the main surgical advances in thoracic medicine in the 1930 s, particularly in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis and bronchiectasis, and the high level of responsibility he had as the only registrar working with one physician and two surgeons. The interview moves on to his appointment at the Postgraduate Medical School soon after it opened in 1935; Sir Francis Fraser's leadership and recruitment policies, the stimulating intellectual environment he found there, and the need to maintain a private practice in these pre-NHS years. Professor Scadding then speaks about his appointment as consultant at the Brompton in January 1939, and his wartime experiences at the Brompton with the Emergency Medical Service and then in Fahid, Egypt with the Royal Army Medical Corps where he spent three years before returning to Hammersmith and the Brompton in late 1945. He discusses postgraduate education at the Brompton and within the University of London; the development of postgraduate teaching facilities, the Institute of Diseases of the Chest- of which he was dean 1946 - 60 - and its incorporation into the Postgraduate Medical Federation in 1955, and the merger with the Institute of Cardiology to form the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1972. Professor Scadding then reflects on the impact of <b>antibacterial</b> drugs, particularly <b>sulphonamides</b> and penicillin, on respiratory medicine, and relates his experiences as part of the team administering penicillin to Winston Churchill at Carthage in 1943. In the final stages of the interview, he looks back on changes in the incidence and treatment of respiratory disease over the years; the decreasing incidence of tuberculosis and increasing incidence of lunch cancer, and the development of improved tests for respiratory function...|$|R
