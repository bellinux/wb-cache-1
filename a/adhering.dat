5|$|IUPAC was {{established}} in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry {{for the advancement of}} chemistry. Its members, the National <b>Adhering</b> Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies of sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National <b>Adhering</b> Organizations and three Associate National <b>Adhering</b> Organizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IUPAC nomenclature) is the recognized world authority in developing standards for the naming of the chemical elements and compounds. Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities. These committees run different projects which include standardizing nomenclature, finding ways to bring chemistry to the world, and publishing works.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG- 1 to <b>adhere</b> to human {{epithelial}} cells was investigated and compared with {{its ability to}} <b>adhere</b> to a test hydrocarbon (hexadecane). RAG- 1, a microorganism originally isolated for growth on hydrocarbon, <b>adhered</b> to epithelial cells when grown under conditions which promote its adherence to hexadecane; similarly, RAG- 1 cells <b>adhered</b> poorly to epithelial cells when grown under conditions which cause the cells to possess low affinity towards hexadecane. A mutant derived from RAG- 1, MR- 481, deficient {{in its ability to}} <b>adhere</b> to hydrocarbon, was similarly unable to <b>adhere</b> to epithelial cells. RAG- 1 adherence to epithelial cells was not blocked by a number of sugars tested. Streptococcus pyogenes, whose adherence to epithelial cells has been previously attributed to hydrophobic interactions, was also able to <b>adhere</b> to hexadecane. Results suggest that hydrophobic interactions mediate adherence of the strains studied to both epithelial cells and hydrocarbon...|$|R

In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, Hosapattana (later named Vijayanagara), {{on the banks of the}} Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district.

5|$|During the Palladian revival {{period in}} Ireland, even quite modest mansions were {{cast in a}} neo-Palladian mould. Palladian {{architecture}} in Ireland subtly differs from that in England. While <b>adhering</b> as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them â perhaps because it was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum triplex may be {{confused}} with G.saccatum or G.fimbriatum, as the rays do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G.triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris <b>adhering</b> to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it {{from the rest of}} the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.|$|E

5|$|Monastic reform {{became an}} {{important}} issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not <b>adhering</b> to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life.

Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.|$|E
