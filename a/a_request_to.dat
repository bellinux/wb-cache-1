5|$|After the {{evacuation}} of Dunkirk in 1940, the British Armed Forces wanted to adopt a submachine gun similar to the MP 40.

5|$|In 1781, Kempelen {{was ordered}} by Emperor Joseph II to {{reconstruct}} the Turk and deliver it to Vienna for a state visit from Grand Duke Paul of Russia and his wife.

5|$|Along {{with his}} {{political}} career, Dekert's business enterprise was growing.

In 1776 he leased the Tobacco Monopoly (or Company; Kompania Tabaczna) from the Polish Treasury; ten years later, in 1786, he leased a theatre in Warsaw.|$|E

In 1928 the IOC turned down <b>a</b> <b>request</b> <b>to</b> stage rugby at the Amsterdam games. An exhibition tournament was held at the 1936 Berlin Games, with France, Germany, Italy and Romania competing.

5|$|Hollywood was in {{the midst}} of a widely publicized search to find an actress to portray Scarlett O'Hara in David O. Selznick's {{production}} of Gone with the Wind (1939). At the time, Myron Selznick—David's brother and Leigh's American theatrical agent—was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh made <b>a</b> <b>request</b> <b>to</b> Myron Selznick that she be considered to play the part of Scarlett O'Hara.|$|E
5|$|Implicit in the {{decision}} to develop atomic bombs was the need to test them. Lacking open, thinly-populated areas, British officials considered locations overseas. The preferred site was the American Pacific Proving Grounds. <b>A</b> <b>request</b> <b>to</b> use it was sent to the American Joint Chiefs of Staff in the summer of 1950, but no reply was received until October 1950, when the Americans turned down the request. As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. Penney spoke to Omond Solandt, the chairman of the Canadian Defence Research Board, and they arranged for a joint feasibility study.|$|E

The Soviet Union also donated about $15 million worth of rice and wheat flour.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Court of Chancery {{would not}} {{entertain}} <b>a</b> <b>request</b> <b>to</b> administer an estate {{as soon as}} a flaw in the will was discovered, rather leaving it to the ecclesiastical courts, but from 1588 onwards the Court did deal with such requests, in four situations: where it was alleged that there were insufficient assets; where it was appropriate to force a legatee to give a bond to creditors (which could not be done in the ecclesiastical courts); to secure femme covert assets from a husband; and where the deceased's debts had to be paid before the legacies were valid.|$|E

5|$|The easternmost {{stretch of}} US-60 in Oklahoma was revised in 1965. Previously, US-60 passed {{directly}} through Seneca, Missouri.

The remainder of the bypassed portion of US-60 in Missouri, east of Route 43, was to be abandoned. This request was approved by the Oklahoma Highway Commission on March 1, submitted to AASHO on May 5, and approved by AASHO on July 12.|$|E
5|$|Their {{motives for}} {{escaping}} evolved over time. Those who fled {{in the years}} shortly after the Wall was built had experienced the formerly open border first-hand and often had relatives in the West or had traveled there. By contrast, later escapees {{had grown up with}} the closed border, desired greater freedom and were dissatisfied with conditions in East Germany. Their attempts to escape were often triggered by specific events such as a wish to avoid conscription, repression by the authorities or the refusal of <b>a</b> <b>request</b> <b>to</b> emigrate. Many escapees had previously clashed with the state authorities and had been imprisoned for political offenses, often related to earlier unsuccessful escape attempts.|$|E

5|$|After Washington issued his 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality {{he became}} {{concerned}} that Spain, which {{later that year}} joined Britain in war against France, might work in consort to incite insurrection in the Yazoo against the U.S., using the opening of trade on the Mississippi as an enticement. At that same time though, mid-1794, Spain was attempting to extract itself from its alliance with the British, and to restore peace with France. As Spain's prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, was attempting to do so, he learned of John Jay's mission to London, and became concerned that those negotiations would result in an Anglo-American alliance and an invasion of Spanish possessions in North America. Sensing the need for rapprochement, Godoy sent <b>a</b> <b>request</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. government for a representative empowered to negotiate a new treaty; Washington sent Thomas Pinckney to Spain in June 1795.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} in England, de Vere {{returned}} to the Continent in 1342, where he served with Northampton, who had been made lieutenant of Brittany. They both {{took part in the}} Battle of Morlaix that year. The next year the two earls were sent to Scotland to relieve Lochmaben Castle, and in 1345 they were again campaigning in Brittany. Tradition has it that, returning to England, their ships were forced ashore by bad weather, and the party was robbed of their possessions by the locals. In the summer of 1346 de Vere was campaigning with the king in Normandy, and took part in the Battle of Crécy. According to the chronicler Froissart, de Vere was fighting with the Black Prince, and was among the captains who sent <b>a</b> <b>request</b> <b>to</b> Edward III for reinforcements when the king famously answered 'Let the boy win his spurs'. Oxford was also at the Siege of Calais, but reportedly fell ill in 1348, and did not take part in any major campaigning until 1355.|$|E
5|$|After sailing {{for some}} hours, Leopard, {{commanded}} by Captain Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, approached Chesapeake and hailed <b>a</b> <b>request</b> <b>to</b> deliver dispatches to England, a customary {{request of the}} time. When a British lieutenant arrived by boat he handed Barron an order, given by Vice-Admiral George Berkeley of the Royal Navy, which instructed the British ships to stop and board Chesapeake to search for deserters. Barron refused to allow this search, and as the lieutenant returned to Leopard Barron ordered the crew to general quarters. Shortly afterward Leopard hailed Chesapeake; Barron could not understand the message. Leopard fired a shot across the bow, followed by a broadside, at Chesapeake. For fifteen minutes, while Chesapeake attempted to arm herself, Leopard continued to fire broadside after broadside until Barron struck his colors. Chesapeake only managed to fire one retaliatory shot after hot coals from the galley were brought on deck to ignite the cannon. The British boarded Chesapeake and carried off four crewmen, declining Barron's offer that Chesapeake {{be taken as a}} prize of war. Chesapeake had three sailors killed and Barron was among the 18wounded.|$|E
