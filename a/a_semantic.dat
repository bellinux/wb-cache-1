40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} how the {{semantics}} of conjunctions affects prosody across clauses/sentences. Nespor and Vogel (1986) observe that phonological rules across sentences may apply when there exists <b>a</b> positive <b>semantic</b> relation (i. e., and, therefore, because) between two sentences. The {{question is whether}} <b>a</b> positive <b>semantic</b> relation universally helps to join two prosodic domains. We conducted experiments to see whether {{this is the case}} in English and Japanese. The result shows that in English, <b>a</b> positive <b>semantic</b> relation helps to join two prosodic domains, but <b>a</b> negative <b>semantic</b> relation does not. However, the data show that in Japanese, <b>a</b> positive <b>semantic</b> relation does not help to join two prosodic domains any more than <b>a</b> negative <b>semantic</b> relation. In fact, in Japanese, two prosodic domains were more detached in the examples of positive semantic relations than in those of negative semantic relations. We discuss syntactic brackets, word/morpheme status of conjunctives and the semantic closeness of negative relations. 1...|$|R

25|$|Knowing {{the meaning}} of a lexical item {{therefore}} means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of <b>a</b> <b>semantic</b> field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words rose and rabbit without knowing what a marigold or a muskrat is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word red without knowing {{the meaning of}} scarlet, but understanding scarlet without knowing the meaning of red may be less likely. <b>A</b> <b>semantic</b> field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like German shepherd, would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. corgi, or poodle), thus expanding the semantic field further.|$|E
