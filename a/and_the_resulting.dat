5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> vigilantism also took its toll.|$|E

5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies.

The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> molecule is called a gene product.|$|E
