5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{released}} in Europe on November 14, 2008. It {{was published in the}} region by Rising Star Games. The game was also released in Australia on January 15, 2009. In North America, the title was published by Marvelous Entertainment USA in partnership with Xseed Games. The North American version used a different localization to the European version with further polishing performed by Xseed Games, which contributed the delay in releasing the game. Another reason for the delay was the game's unique nature, which made it <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> for the company, in addition to the flagging popularity of the DS at the time. Xseed Games spent an unspecified time deliberating over whether to release it in North America at all before approving the decision. Initially scheduled for March 2009, the game eventually released in North America on June 16. In English territories, the subtitle was changed to Murder and Mystery in Paradise, while the game's original title remained intact.|$|E
25|$|Tiffany's career {{suffered}} as musical tastes {{changed in the}} early 1990s, swinging away from dance-pop and towards harder-edged rock and rap. This was shown in her third album, the urban-influenced New Inside. It was her first album away from Tobin, {{and some of her}} fans felt the new soulful, sultrier Tiffany was <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b> New Inside received mixed reviews from critics, but was successful in Japan.|$|E
25|$|The ZR-1 {{displayed}} ability both {{in terms}} of acceleration and handling capabilities, but carried with it high price. MSRP for the (375hp) ZR-1 in 1990 was $58,995, almost twice the cost of a (250hp) non-ZR-1, and had increased to $66,278 by 1995; some dealers successfully marked units as high as $100,000. Even at base MSRP, this meant that the ZR-1 was competing in the same price bracket as cars like the Porsche 964, making it <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> for GM dealers.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, GM {{introduced}} a hybrid diesel-electric military (light) truck, {{equipped with a}} diesel electric and a fuel cell auxiliary power unit. Hybrid electric light trucks were introduced in 2004 by Mercedes Benz (Sprinter) and Micro-Vett SPA (Daily Bimodale). International Truck and Engine Corp. and Eaton Corp. have been selected to manufacture diesel-electric hybrid trucks for a US pilot program serving the utility industry in 2004. In mid-2005 Isuzu introduced the Elf Diesel Hybrid Truck on the Japanese Market. They claim that approximately 300 vehicles, mostly route buses are using Hinos HIMR (Hybrid Inverter Controlled Motor & Retarder) system. In 2007, high petroleum price means <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> for hybrid trucks and appears the first U.S. production hybrid truck (International DuraStar Hybrid).|$|E
500|$|While filming Weir {{guiding the}} team to find the ZPM, {{the fact that she}} can see [...] "everything" [...] without looking at {{anything}} was <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> for an actor, but with Higginson's drive in her eyes, this would make the scene more believable for the audience. The scene was not written in the original script. The set for the core room in the Asuran city was the same set as Atlantis' gate room, though {{in order to make it}} look as different as possible, the cameras were placed at angles not usually used for filming in the gate room, such as where they would normally place lights.|$|E
500|$|In March 2011 Veronica Henry {{reviewed}} Epiphany 2.32, saying [...] "To be fair, {{this would}} be <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> as a primary desktop browser for most users. In fact, there isn't even a setting to let you designate it as your default browser. But for those instance {{where you need to}} fire up a lighting-fast browser for quick surfing, Epiphany will do the trick." [...] She further noted, [...] "Though I still use Firefox as my primary browser, lately it seems to run at a snail's pace. So, {{one of the first things}} I noticed about Epiphany is how quickly it launches. And subsequent page loads on my system are equally as fast." [...] Henry criticized Epiphany for its short list of extensions, singling out the lack of Firebug as a deficiency. Web instead supports Web Inspector offered by the WebKit engine, which has similar functionality.|$|E
50|$|Theorists have {{examined}} the value of repetition for soft <b>sell</b> versus <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> messages, {{in order to determine}} their relative efficacy. Frank Kardes and others have concluded that a soft sell, with an implied conclusion rather than <b>an</b> overt <b>hard</b> <b>sell,</b> can often be more persuasive. Soft sell is also less likely to be irritating to consumers.|$|R

500|$|Many reviews {{focused on}} the show's fusion of Wild West and outer space motifs. TV Guides Matt Roush, for instance, called the show [...] "oddball" [...] and [...] "offbeat", and noted how {{literally}} the series took the metaphor of space operas as Westerns. Roush opined that the shift from space travel to horseback was [...] "jarring", but that once he got used to this, he found the characters cleverly conceived, and the writing a crisp balance of action, tension and humor. Several reviewers, however, criticized the show's setting; Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that the melding of the western and science fiction genres was a [...] "forced hodgepodge of two alarmingly opposite genres {{just for the sake}} of being different" [...] and called the series a [...] "vast disappointment", and Carina Chocano of Salon.com said that while the [...] "space as Wild West" [...] metaphor is fairly redundant, neither genre connected to the present. Emily Nussbaum of the New York Times, reviewing the DVD set, noted that the program featured [...] "an oddball genre mix that might have doomed it from the beginning: it was a character-rich sci-fi western comedy-drama with existential underpinnings, <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> during a season dominated by Joe Millionaire".|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} for a release in North America {{under the title}} Muramasa: The Demon Blade in October 2008 for a release the following year. The game was originally being published by Xseed Games, but in April 2009 they announced that they were dropping the title from their schedule. Publishing rights were transferred to Ignition Entertainment. Ignition Entertainment later explained {{that it was in}} hot competition with Xseed and Atlus to acquire the American publishing rights, and after seeing Muramasa at TGS 2008 they were encouraged to apply for the rights. The change between publishers was an internal agreement between Xseed, their parent company Marvelous USA, and Ignition. The situation was amicably resolved as Xseed already had a large number of Wii titles lined up, and giving Muramasa to another publisher allowed multiple titles not to be overlooked when it came to Western publicity. The game released in North America on September 8, 2009. The game's localization was done by external localization companies in close collaboration with Ignition Entertainment. Due to the game's strong Japanese atmosphere, it was seen as <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> in the West, but during localization a lot of work went into preserving it rather than adjusting it for Western tastes. Due to this, the game was not dubbed into English, but instead retained its Japanese voice track while text was localized. An aspect Ignition worked hard with was to make sure the localization was of good quality by working closely with their chosen localization partners. This was due to backlash received by fans and critics over the [...] "lackluster" [...] localization of Lux-Pain, which had been beyond their control during development.|$|E

Not only was the concept that the judicial system was entitled to 'every man's evidence' itself deeply rooted in the Constitution, but merely determining the scope of the privilege (when would it apply?) and identifying who would receive it (only regularly employed journalists? freelancers? anyone?) were difficult matters at best."

2500|$|A {{key part}} of Wells Fargo's {{business}} strategy is cross-selling, the practice of encouraging existing customers to buy additional banking products. Customers inquiring about their checking account balance may be pitched mortgage deals and mortgage holders may be pitched credit card offers {{in an attempt to}} increase the customer's profitability to the bank. Other banks have attempted to emulate Wells Fargo's cross-selling practices (described by The Wall Street Journal as <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> technique); Forbes magazine describes Wells Fargo as [...] "better than anyone" [...] at the practice.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1999, Schutz instigated the Maverick imprint at Dark Horse Comics {{which was}} {{designed}} as an umbrella title {{for a number of}} creator-owned titles, including some already published by Dark Horse and some new to the publisher. The 'Maverick' name was designed [...] "to provide a kind of identity or specific line for those sorts of individual creator visions." [...] The aim of the [...] "Maverick" [...] line was to [...] "push the medium a little bit," [...] although Schutz recognized that such titles are often <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b> To help address this, the Maverick Annual anthologies (published from 2000 as Dark Horse Maverick and later under such subtitles as Happy Endings and AutobioGraphix) placed newer creators (Farel Dalrymple, Gilbert Austin, Jason Hall, Matt Kindt) alongside the more established names of Frank Miller and Sam Kieth.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{reviews of}} the HP TouchPad were mixed. David Pogue of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It works beautifully, and conveys far more {{information}} than the iPad 2. The tablet offers [...] "real multitasking" [...] with all open apps always running." [...] Jason Chen of Gizmodo wrote, [...] "After actually holding the TouchPad, I can say it's deceptively heavy. It's around the same weight as the iPad, but you'd {{think it would be}} lighter because the back was made of plastic. That said, it's not overly heavy, just heavier than you'd think by looking." [...] Matt Buchanan, also writing for Gizmodo, praised the OS interface concept as 'good conceptually' but described the performance as [...] "slow motion... give this thing six months. It could be amazing. If it's not by then, well, I guess that says everything that needs to be said." [...] The Verge also noted poor performance, describing its interface as 'intuitive and natural' but 'sluggish, unfinished...a bit of <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> right now.' ...|$|E

The exact content and characteristics of interactions were recorded and coded using a category system based on consultative selling. The results show vast differences between advisers in their selling approach. In most cases, the sequence of problem-solving phases that advisers employed differed from those of the ideal model. Advisers generally did not probe for the wishes of clients but instead started by presenting alternative product solutions, a typical feature of <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>selling</b> approach.

2500|$|The Prince {{from the}} 2008 reboot was well {{received}} by video game critics, but criticized by {{fans of the}} series, whose main complaint was the performance of North in the role. In {{an article about the}} sexuality of the Prince of Persia reboot, Gamasutra editor Tom Cross stated that he finds the rejection of both the game and its protagonist incomprehensible. He compared Uncharted protagonist Nathan Drake to the Prince, stating that it was not just because he was voiced by , but also because the sexual tension that [...] holds reminded him of the prince. He addressed the criticism of his voice, stating that people found it annoying and improper for him to sound so much like a Han Solo-type character considering the video game is located in the Middle East. Cross found this criticism unfair, arguing that no one criticized female protagonist Elika's North American accent and added that the prince was <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> character to like than Nathan Drake, due to him being an [...] "unrepentant jerk" [...] instead of a [...] "lovable jerk," [...] but that merely makes him <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>sell.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Despite the fanfare, the {{expensive}} Macintosh was <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b> Shortly after its release in 1985, Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, threatened to stop developing Mac applications {{unless it was}} granted [...] "a license for the Mac operating system software. Microsoft was developing its graphical user interface ... for DOS, which it was calling Windows and didn't want Apple to sue over {{the similarities between the}} Windows GUI and the Mac interface." [...] Sculley granted Microsoft the license which later led to problems for Apple. In addition, cheap IBM PC clones that ran on Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. Although the Macintosh preceded the clones, it was far more expensive, so [...] "through the late '80s, the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple." [...] Windows based IBM-PC clones also {{led to the development of}} additional GUIs such as IBM's TopView or Digital Research's GEM, and thus [...] "the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac...it seemed clear as the '80s wound down that Apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market." ...|$|E
2500|$|Film critic Scott Mendelson, {{writing in}} The Huffington Post, cited Scully {{as an example}} of strong female {{characters}} on television, calling her [...] "one of the most iconic characters in the science-fiction genre". Radio Times Laura Pledger also named her as a strong TV woman, placing her at #1. Rebecca Traister of Salon.com opined that Scully had a better character arc than Mulder. She wrote, [...] "The very fact that her character was such <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> made her repeated brushes with the supernatural all the more powerful. Mulder's desire to believe was so expansive, his credulity so flexible, that it's not as though he was ever going to have either shaken from him. But Scully's surety was solid, stable, rigid; every time she saw something she thought she'd never see, we saw it crack, sparks fly from it. She was forced to question herself, grow, change". She praised her for being more [...] "rational, resilient, [...] mature" [...] than her partner and for their mature relationship. In a review of [...] "Irresistible", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

However, as the 1970s became the 1980s, school bus demand declined sharply. Declining student populations coupled with the overall recession magnified the overall importance of securing orders by contractors and large school districts. While higher-capacity buses could potentially lower operating costs across a large fleet, higher purchase prices were <b>an</b> increasingly <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> to customers.|$|R

50|$|A {{soft sell}} {{is much more}} emotionally focused when put in {{comparison}} to <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b> An advertisement or seller will attempt to trigger feelings in the buyer that will make them want to buy the product that is being advertised. This selling technique is also much more indirect in nature than that of <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b> The subtlety of a soft sell is very evident, and many buyers often do not {{realize that they are}} being purposely directed in such a way to buy a product how a seller predicts that they will. This type of sell's ultimate goal is to create a mood or image that will appeal to the buyer and make them want to invest their money in a product, all without the buyer realizing that this is occurring. Persistence is not as involved in a soft sell as it is in <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b>|$|E

5000|$|For example, if General Store Co. sold stock with a bank, whoever first bought shares would {{possibly}} have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time <b>selling</b> {{them to other}} individuals if people {{are not familiar with}} the company. The investment bank agrees to buy the shares sold and look for a buyer. This provides liquidity to the markets. The bank normally does not care about the fundamental, intrinsic value of the shares, but only that it can sell them at a slightly higher price than it could buy them. To do this, an investment bank employs traders. Over time these traders began to devise different strategies within this system to earn even more profit independent of providing client liquidity, and this is how proprietary trading was born.|$|R
