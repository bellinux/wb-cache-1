25|$|Lambic {{is usually}} a blend {{of at least two}} {{different}} beers; many producers are blenders who buy beer from other brewers and blend them together to create the desired result. A gueuze may have occupied space in several different cellars over six years or more. While those outside Belgium <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> bottled gueuze and fruited versions, a wider variety of styles is available to local drinkers. Beers are often blended again or sweetened with sugar or flavoured syrups before drinking as some can be extremely tart.|$|E
500|$|Early in the book, Eric retells {{a portion}} of Homer's Odyssey, {{describing}} the episode in which Ulysses sails near {{the land of the}} Sirens: creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with beeswax and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source. Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of Orpheus's encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a [...] "sweeter song" [...] than that of the Sirens; his ship also passes unharmed, his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice the Sirens. Eric then argues from analogy that, normally, those who force themselves to resist premarital sexual and romantic temptations <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those who listen to the plans God has for them find waiting for marriage much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). Eric expands on the concept of the [...] "sweeter song" [...] throughout the book and often refers to it. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is [...] "the beautiful side of love"; the Ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting, satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as breakups, unrequited love, and sexual frustration.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 2012, {{the band}} {{undertook}} the 'XXXV Tour' across Europe and the UK, to celebrate 35 years in existence. The shows were critically acclaimed.

2500|$|The gateway {{effect may}} appear due to social factors {{involved}} in using any illegal drug. Because {{of the illegal}} status of cannabis, its consumers <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> themselves in situations allowing them to acquaint with individuals using or selling other illegal drugs. Utilizing this argument some {{studies have shown that}} alcohol and tobacco may additionally be regarded as gateway drugs; however, a more parsimonious explanation could be that cannabis is simply more readily available (and at an earlier age) than illegal hard drugs. In turn alcohol and tobacco are easier to obtain at an earlier point than is cannabis (though the reverse may be true in some areas), thus leading to the [...] "gateway sequence" [...] in those individuals since they are most likely to experiment with any drug offered.|$|E
2500|$|Claims {{of divine}} ancestry and divine favour were often {{attached}} to charismatic individuals who rose [...] "as if from nowhere" [...] to become dynasts, tyrants and hero-founders {{in the ancient}} Mediterranean world. Yet all these legends offer the father as divine, the mother [...] virgin or not [...] as princess of a ruling house, never as slave. The disembodied phallus and its impregnation of a virgin slave of Royal birth are unique to Servius. Livy and Dionysius ignore or reject the tales of Servius' supernatural virgin birth; though his parents came from a conquered people, both are of noble stock. His ancestry is an accident of fate, and his character and virtues are entirely Roman. He acts {{on behalf of the}} Roman people, not for personal gain; these Roman virtues <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> favour with the gods, and win the rewards of good fortune.|$|E

"For that I {{am quite}} prepared," [...] Hector said quietly; [...] "but you <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> Monsieur de Beauvais, {{that it is}} not so easy a thing to kill the colonel of one of her majesty's regiments as it is to stab a churchman in his carriage." ...|$|E

60|$|It may be {{that the}} makers of Noah's Arks know that their animals <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their way into young mouths, and paint them accordingly.

"By {{all this}} you see, Philip, {{that those who}} think the Prince of Navarre merely a merry, {{careless}} young fellow, who is likely to rule his little kingdom in patriarchal fashion; and to trouble himself with nothing outside, so long as his subjects are contented and allowed to worship in their own way, <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> themselves sorely mistaken.

5000|$|A recession-proof {{job is a}} {{job that}} one <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> even during hard {{economic}} times.

40|$|We {{generate}} a longitudinal dataset using the rotating panel {{component of the}} nationally representative Labour Force Surveys from 2001 to 2003.

Informal sector workers <b>are</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> formal sector employment than the searching unemployed. Whites <b>are</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and remain in formal sector jobs.

6000|$|He then devotes some eighty pages--and {{very well}} {{employed}} they are-- in detailing the strange and sad story of Madame Guyon and the [...] "Quietist" [...] movement at Louis Quatorze's Court. Much of this he has taken, {{with all due}} acknowledgment, from Upham; but he has told the story most pleasantly, in his own way, and these pages will give a better notion of Fenelon, and of the [...] "Eagle" [...] (for eagle read vulture) [...] "of Meaux," [...] old Bossuet, than they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> elsewhere in the same compass.|$|E

50|$|His {{accession}} {{to a large}} fortune in 1845 enabled him to devote himself entirely to the absorbing occupation of his life: the study of Virgil.
