5|$|Astronomy {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in {{recorded}} history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient Indigenous Peoples of The Americas performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as <b>astrometry,</b> celestial navigation, observational astronomy and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.|$|E
5|$|Hubble {{accommodates}} five science instruments {{at a given}} time, {{plus the}} Fine Guidance Sensors, which are mainly used for aiming the telescope but are occasionally used for science (<b>astrometry).</b> Early instruments were replaced with more advanced ones during the Shuttle servicing missions. COSTAR was strictly a corrective optics device rather than a true science instrument, but occupied {{one of the five}} instrument bays.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2009, July 3, 2009, and August 8, 2009, {{use of the}} NIFS {{integral}} field spectrograph with ALTAIR {{allowed the}} astronomers {{to collect data on}} the spectrum of the faint object and its star. Analysis of the spectra and the objects' <b>astrometry</b> (how the star and the faint object change position in the sky) led to the confirmation of the companion HIP 78530 b.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 3B {{flown by}} Columbia in March 2002 saw the {{installation}} of a new instrument, with the FOC (which, except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for <b>astrometry,</b> {{was the last of}} the original instruments) being replaced by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). This meant that COSTAR was no longer required, since all new instruments had built-in correction for the main mirror aberration. The mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed-cycle cooler and replaced the solar arrays for the second time, providing 30 percent more power.|$|E
5|$|Sirius appears bright {{because of}} its {{intrinsic}} luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), {{as determined by the}} Hipparcos <b>astrometry</b> satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbours. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.|$|E
5|$|The 55 Cancri {{system is}} located fairly {{close to the}} Solar System: the Hipparcos <b>astrometry</b> {{satellite}} measured the parallax of 55 Cancri A as 81.03 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of 12.3 parsecs (40.3 light years). 55 Cancri A has an apparent magnitude of 5.95, making it just {{visible to the naked}} eye under very dark skies. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th magnitude and only visible through a telescope. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of 1065 AU (one thousand times the distance from the Earth to the Sun). Despite their wide separation, the two stars appear to be gravitationally bound, as they share a common proper motion.|$|E
5|$|The star {{is located}} fairly {{close to the}} Solar System: {{according}} to astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos <b>astrometry</b> satellite, it exhibits a parallax of 71.11 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of 45.913 light-years. With an apparent magnitude of +5.03, it is {{visible to the naked}} eye and its absolute magnitude of +4.29 implies a visual luminosity around 60% greater than the Sun. A solar analog, with a spectral type of G1V, it has a similar mass to that of the Sun but is slightly hotter at around 5,882 K. and slightly more metal-rich with around 110% of the solar abundance of iron.|$|E
5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as <b>astrometry.</b> From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's <b>astrometry</b> led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to Vega {{can be determined}} by measuring its parallax shift against the background stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. The first person to publish a star's parallax was Friedrich G. W. von Struve, when he announced a value of 0.125arcseconds (0.125″) for Vega. Friedrich Bessel was skeptical about Struve's data, and, when Bessel published a parallax of 0.314″ for the star system 61 Cygni, Struve revised his value for Vega's parallax to nearly double the original estimate. This change cast further doubt on Struve's data. Thus most astronomers at the time, including Struve, credited Bessel with the first published parallax result. However, Struve's initial result was actually close to the currently accepted value of 0.129″, {{as determined by the}} Hipparcos <b>astrometry</b> satellite.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{and high}} tech {{research}} and development operations {{are located in the}} city, including the Lowell Observatory, Northern Arizona University, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) and the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Flagstaff campus. Lowell Observatory continues to be an active astronomical observatory and a popular visitors center which hosts educational displays and tours. It has a distributed network of small telescopes which together create images of celestial bodies with much higher resolutions than any other single telescope can produce. Current research is involved in observations of near-Earth phenomena such as asteroids and comets. The observatory is also involved in a $30 million project with the Discovery Channel to build the Discovery Channel Telescope, a sophisticated, ground-based telescope with advanced optical capabilities for future projects. Lowell Observatory and NOFS are also collaborators on the major project, the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. NOFS is heavily involved with the science of star catalogs and <b>astrometry,</b> or the positions and distances of stars and celestial objects.|$|E
25|$|The space-based {{observatory}} Gaia, launched in 2013, {{is expected to}} find thousands of planets via <b>astrometry,</b> but prior to the launch of Gaia, no planet detected by <b>astrometry</b> had been confirmed.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the {{discovery}} of VB 10b by <b>astrometry</b> was announced. This planetary object, orbiting the low mass red dwarf star VB 10, {{was reported to have}} a mass seven times that of Jupiter. If confirmed, this would be the first exoplanet discovered by <b>astrometry,</b> of the many that have been claimed through the years. However recent radial velocity independent studies rule out the existence of the claimed planet.|$|E
25|$|The Gaia mission, {{launched}} in December 2013, will use <b>astrometry</b> {{to determine the}} true masses of 1000 nearby exoplanets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Astrometry</b> {{has also}} been used to support claims of extrasolar planet {{detection}} by measuring the displacement the proposed planets cause in their parent star's apparent position on the sky, due to their mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system. Although, as of 2009, none of the extrasolar planets detected by ground-based <b>astrometry</b> has been verified in subsequent studies, <b>astrometry</b> {{is expected to be}} more accurate in space missions that are not affected by the distorting effects of the Earth's atmosphere. NASA's planned Space Interferometry Mission (SIM PlanetQuest) (now cancelled) was to utilize astrometric techniques to detect terrestrial planets orbiting 200 or so of the nearest solar-type stars, and the European Space Agency's Gaia Mission, launched in 2013, which will be applying astrometric techniques in its stellar census.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{fundamental}} function of providing astronomers with a reference frame {{to report their}} observations in, <b>astrometry</b> is also fundamental for fields like celestial mechanics, stellar dynamics and galactic astronomy. In observational astronomy, astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping time, in that UTC is basically the atomic time synchronized to Earth's rotation by means of exact observations. <b>Astrometry</b> {{is an important step}} in the cosmic distance ladder because it establishes parallax distance estimates for stars in the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|A 25-meter-diameter radio {{telescope}} {{is located in}} Chichijima, one of the stations of the very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) Exploration of Radio <b>Astrometry</b> (VERA) project, and is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Astrometry</b> is {{the branch}} of {{astronomy}} that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestial bodies. The information obtained by astrometric measurements provides information on the kinematics and physical origin of the Solar System and our galaxy, the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the topics}} in astrophysics, astrochemistry, <b>astrometry,</b> and other fields that are {{branches}} of astronomy studied by theoreticians involve X-rays and X-ray sources. Many of the beginnings for a theory {{can be found in}} an Earth-based laboratory where an X-ray source is built and studied.|$|E
25|$|The rather {{cumbersome}} formal {{name for}} the ESA's Hipparcos Space <b>Astrometry</b> Mission was High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite; it was deliberately named in this way to give an acronym, HiPParCoS, that echoed and commemorated the name of Hipparchus. The lunar crater Hipparchus and the asteroid 4000 Hipparchus are more directly named after him.|$|E
25|$|The {{light-year}} is {{most often}} used when expressing distances to stars and other distances on a galactic scale, especially in nonspecialist and popular science publications. The unit usually used in professional <b>astrometry</b> is the parsec (symbol: pc, about 3.26 light-years; the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one second of arc).|$|E
25|$|Belonging to life then implies panbiotic ethics with {{a purpose}} to {{propagate}} and expand life in space. Directed panspermia for this purpose is becoming possible due to developments in solar sails, precise <b>astrometry,</b> the discovery of extrasolar planets, extremophiles and microbial genetic engineering. Cosmological projections suggest that life in space can then have an immense future.|$|E
25|$|To apply these equations, the {{precision}} of <b>astrometry</b> of star proper motion of 0.00001 arcsec/year, and the solar sail vehicle velocity of 0.0005nbsp&c (1.5 x 105nbsp&m/s) may be expected within a few decades. For a chosen planetary system, the area Atarget may be {{the width of the}} habitable zone, while for interstellar clouds, it may be the sizes of the various density zones of the cloud.|$|E
25|$|James Bradley {{first tried}} to measure stellar parallaxes in 1729. The stellar {{movement}} proved too insignificant for his telescope, but he instead discovered the aberration {{of light and}} the nutation of the Earth's axis. His cataloguing of 3222 stars was refined in 1807 by Friedrich Bessel, the father of modern <b>astrometry.</b> He made the first measurement of stellar parallax: 0.3 arcsec for the binary star 61 Cygni.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} <b>astrometry</b> is error correction. Various factors introduce errors into {{the measurement of}} stellar positions, including atmospheric conditions, imperfections in the instruments and errors by the observer or the measuring instruments. Many of these errors can be reduced by various techniques, such as through instrument improvements and compensations to the data. The results are then analyzed using statistical methods to compute data estimates and error ranges.|$|E
25|$|Although {{stars in}} constellations appear near {{each other in}} the sky, they usually lie at a variety of {{distances}} away from the observer. Since stars also travel along their own orbits through the Milky Way, the constellation outlines change slowly over time. After tens to hundreds of thousands of years, their familiar outlines gradually become unrecognisable. Astronomers can predict the past or future constellation outlines by measuring their individual stars common proper motions or cpm by accurate <b>astrometry</b> and their radial velocities by astronomical spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|One {{part of the}} {{scientific}} activities concerned cosmic magnetic fields and cosmic dynamos, phenomena of turbulence, magnetic and eruptive processes on the Sun, explosive energy dissipation processes in plasmas, variable stars and stellar activity. Another part was directed to the early phases of cosmic evolution and the origin of structures in the Universe, large-scale structures up to those of superclusters and to active galaxies. In this connection special methods of image processing have been developed. In addition, investigations in <b>astrometry</b> have also been performed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Astrometry</b> is {{the oldest}} search method for extrasolar planets, and was {{originally}} popular because of its success in characterizing astrometric binary star systems. It dates {{back at least to}} statements made by William Herschel in the late 18th century. He claimed that an unseen companion was affecting the position of the star he cataloged as 70 Ophiuchi. The first known formal astrometric calculation for an extrasolar planet was made by William Stephen Jacob in 1855 for this star. Similar calculations were repeated by others for another half-century until finally refuted in the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} <b>astrometry</b> {{is linked to}} the history of star catalogues, which gave astronomers {{reference}} points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements. This can be dated back to Hipparchus, who around 190 BC used the catalogue of his predecessors Timocharis and Aristillus to discover Earth's precession. In doing so, he also developed the brightness scale still in use today. Hipparchus compiled a catalogue with at least 850 stars and their positions. Hipparchus's successor, Ptolemy, included a catalogue of 1,022 stars in his work the Almagest, giving their location, coordinates, and brightness.|$|E
25|$|Directed {{panspermia}} {{to secure}} and expand life in space is becoming {{possible because of}} developments in solar sails, precise <b>astrometry,</b> extrasolar planets, extremophiles and microbial genetic engineering. After determining the composition of chosen meteorites, astroecologists performed laboratory experiments that suggest that many colonizing microorganisms and some plants could obtain many of their chemical nutrients from asteroid and cometary materials. However, the scientists noted that phosphate (PO4) and nitrate (NO3–N) critically limit nutrition to many terrestrial lifeforms. With such materials, and energy from long-lived stars, microscopic life planted by directed panspermia could find an immense future in the galaxy.|$|E
25|$|Astronomers use astrometric {{techniques}} for the tracking of near-Earth objects. <b>Astrometry</b> {{is responsible for}} the detection of many record-breaking Solar System objects. To find such objects astrometrically, astronomers use telescopes to survey the sky and large-area cameras to take pictures at various determined intervals. By studying these images, they can detect Solar System objects by their movements relative to the background stars, which remain fixed. Once a movement per unit time is observed, astronomers compensate for the parallax caused by Earth’s motion during this time and the heliocentric distance to this object is calculated. Using this distance and other photographs, more information about the object, including its orbital elements, can be obtained.|$|E
25|$|Despite the minuteness of {{the spatial}} terms, the first {{indications}} {{that something was}} wrong with Newtonian gravitation were discovered over a century-and-a-half ago. In 1859, Urbain Le Verrier, in an analysis of available timed observations of transits of Mercury over the Sun's disk from 1697 to 1848, reported that known physics could not explain the orbit of Mercury, unless there possibly existed a planet or asteroid belt within the orbit of Mercury. The perihelion of Mercury's orbit exhibited an excess rate of precession over that which could be explained by the tugs of the other planets. The ability to detect and accurately measure the minute value of this anomalous precession (only 43 arc seconds per tropical century) is testimony to the sophistication of 19th century <b>astrometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{two centuries}} claims {{circulated}} {{of the discovery}} of unseen companions in orbit around nearby star systems that all were reportedly found using this method, culminating in the prominent 1996 announcement, of multiple planets orbiting the nearby star Lalande 21185 by George Gatewood. None of these claims survived scrutiny by other astronomers, and the technique fell into disrepute. Unfortunately, changes in stellar position are so small—and atmospheric and systematic distortions so large—that even the best ground-based telescopes cannot produce precise enough measurements. All claims of a planetary companion of less than 0.1 solar mass, as the mass of the planet, made before 1996 using this method are likely spurious. In 2002, the Hubble Space Telescope did succeed in using <b>astrometry</b> to characterize a previously discovered planet around the star Gliese 876.|$|E
25|$|The {{telescope}}s amateur telescope makers build {{range from}} backyard variety to sophisticated instruments that make meaningful {{contributions to the}} field of astronomy. Instruments built by amateurs have been employed in planetary study, <b>astrometry,</b> photometry, comet and asteroid discovery to name just a few. Even the “hobbyist” end of the field can break down into several distinct categories such as: observing deep sky objects, observing the planets, solar observing, lunar observation, and astrophotography of all those classes of objects. Therefore, the design, size, and construction of the telescopes vary as well. Some amateur telescope makers build instruments that, while looking crude, are wholly suited to the purpose they are designed for. Others may strive for a more aesthetic look with high levels of mechanical “finish”. Since some amateur telescope makers {{do not have access to}} high-precision machining equipment, many elegant designs such as the Poncet Platform, Crayford focuser, and the Dobsonian telescope have evolved, which achieve functionality and stability without requiring precision machining.|$|E
25|$|Micrometer {{measurements}} of the positions of stars in clusters were made as early as 1877 by the German astronomer E. Schönfeld and further pursued by the American astronomer E. E. Barnard prior to his death in 1923. No indication of stellar motion was detected by these efforts. However, in 1918 the Dutch-American astronomer Adriaan van Maanen was able to measure the proper motion of stars in part of the Pleiades cluster by comparing photographic plates taken at different times. As <b>astrometry</b> became more accurate, cluster stars were found to share a common proper motion through space. By comparing the photographic plates of the Pleiades cluster taken in 1918 with images taken in 1943, van Maanen was able to identify those stars that had a proper motion similar to the mean motion of the cluster, and were therefore {{more likely to be}} members. Spectroscopic measurements revealed common radial velocities, thus showing that the clusters consist of stars bound together as a group.|$|E
