5|$|Captain W. C. Pakenham, the Royal Navy's {{official}} military observer {{under the}} Anglo-Japanese Alliance, took {{notes of the}} battle's progress from <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> chair on Asahis exposed quarterdeck. His report confirmed the superiority of Japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> supported by cables {{from a single}} arch that spans the bridge diagonally. The design was selected in June 1995, with construction running between May 1996 and April 1997. It was opened on 10 May 1997 by Alex Ferguson.|$|E
5000|$|The Chimacum has two car <b>decks,</b> <b>a</b> sun <b>deck</b> and <b>a</b> {{passenger}} <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sheepshead {{is played}} with 7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A in four suits, {{for a total}} of 32 cards. This is also known as <b>a</b> Piquet <b>deck,</b> as opposed to the 52 or 54 present in <b>a</b> full French <b>deck</b> (also known as <b>a</b> Poker <b>deck,</b> or <b>a</b> regular <b>deck</b> of playing cards). <b>A</b> {{sheepshead}} <b>deck</b> is made by removing all of the jokers, sixes, fives, fours, threes, and twos from <b>a</b> standard <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|Structural {{engineers}} have several principal categories of bridge decks, {{for the purposes}} of analytic techniques. <b>A</b> beam <b>deck</b> is one where the deck and any supporting structure act together as a single beam. <b>A</b> grid <b>deck</b> uses beams and diaphragms as the supporting structure. The supporting system of <b>a</b> grid <b>deck</b> is analyzed using a grillage analysis. <b>A</b> slab <b>deck</b> is one where the deck is analyzed as a plate. If the slab has a stiffness that is different in two directions (at right angles), then the deck is known and analyzed as <b>an</b> orthotropic <b>deck.</b> <b>A</b> beam and slab deck is one where the beams may deflect somewhat independently, and any transverse forces are carried in the <b>deck.</b> <b>A</b> cellular <b>deck</b> is one where a number of thin slabs and webs will enclose cells within the <b>deck.</b> <b>A</b> boxgirder <b>deck</b> is one where the deck forms the top of the box girder during analysis.|$|R
5|$|A dry bell {{may also}} be used for bounce dives to great depths, and then used as the {{decompression}} chamber during the ascent and later on board the support vessel. In this case it is not always necessary to transfer into <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> chamber, as the bell is quite capable of performing this function, though it would be relatively cramped, as a bell is usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment.|$|E
5|$|The second Königsberg {{class was}} {{authorized}} in 1913 and laid down starting in 1914. They were named for cruisers {{that had been}} sunk {{in the early months}} of the war. They were an incremental improvement over the Wiesbaden class, being some five hundred tons heavier. They carried the standard eight 15cm guns, the forward wing mounts were placed <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> higher to improve their firing arc. They were otherwise identical to the preceding light cruiser designs.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{advertising}} {{included the}} parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại {{through the streets}} of Saigon, depicted with bags of money on his shoulders, <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> of cards in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of cognac in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising. In particular, the blonde hair referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold into his pockets, thereby questioning his nationalist credentials. Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated, while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting songs about Bảo Đại.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} is not <b>a</b> trick <b>deck</b> per se, but the cards it contains {{can be combined}} with <b>a</b> normal <b>deck</b> (or <b>a</b> packet of cards from <b>a</b> regular <b>deck)</b> in order to perform specific tricks.|$|R
50|$|A {{ship with}} <b>a</b> well <b>deck</b> (docking well) can {{transfer}} cargo to landing craft in rougher seas than {{a ship that}} has to use cranes or a stern ramp. The US Navy hull classification symbol for a ship with <b>a</b> well <b>deck</b> depends on its facilities for aircraft - a (modern) LSD has <b>a</b> helicopter <b>deck,</b> <b>a</b> LPD also has a hangar, and a LHD or LHA has <b>a</b> full-length flight <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>decking</b> {{screw gun}} {{has a long}} handle so the user {{does not have to}} bend over.|$|R
5|$|From 1933 {{to the end}} of 1938 Courageous carried No. 800 Squadron, which flew {{a mixture}} of nine Hawker Nimrod and three Hawker Osprey fighters. 810, 820 and 821 Squadrons were {{embarked}} for reconnaissance and anti-ship attack missions during the same period. They flew the Blackburn Baffin, the Blackburn Shark, the Blackburn Ripon and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers as well as Fairey Seal reconnaissance aircraft. As <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> landing training carrier, in early 1939 Courageous embarked the Blackburn Skua and Gloster Sea Gladiator fighters of 801 Squadron and the Swordfish torpedo bombers of 811 Squadron, although both of these squadrons were disembarked when the ship was relieved of her training duties in May.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the {{eastbound}} Circle line platform {{was taken}} out of use and the track layout was rearranged to remove the westbound Circle line track and widen the island platform. The eastbound Circle and District lines both serve {{the north side of the}} island platform and the westbound Circle line which was redirected to serve the south side of the island platform. The disused platform is used for Art on the Underground installations, often placed into the brick recesses in the northern retaining wall. In the 1990s <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> was constructed above the District and Circle line platforms on which was constructed a shopping mall and apartment building.|$|E
5|$|Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket {{walk down}} a winding path in search of Riku and King Mickey. A man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive {{fortress}} called Castle Oblivion. Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have forgotten all of their abilities. The hooded man explains that the deeper {{they go into the}} castle, the more memories they will lose, but they will also uncover new memories in the process. He creates <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> of cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.|$|E
50|$|Helicopter {{carriers}} {{can either}} have <b>a</b> full-length aircraft <b>deck</b> like , or have <b>a</b> large helicopter <b>deck,</b> usually aft, {{as in the}} Soviet Navy's , the Chinese Navy's Type 0891A or RFA Argus. <b>A</b> full-length <b>deck</b> maximises deck space for helicopter landing spots. Such a design also allows for <b>a</b> hangar <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> mental {{photography}} <b>deck</b> is <b>a</b> self-working <b>deck</b> {{that allows}} the magician to present spectators with <b>a</b> seemingly blank <b>deck</b> and then convert the blank cards into standard-appearance printed ones. With <b>a</b> Mental Photography <b>Deck,</b> the user appears to be printing the cards.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> Hypp <b>deck</b> is {{the same}} as <b>a</b> Gnav <b>deck</b> but {{consisting}} of only 1 copy of the 21 distinct cards.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>deck</b> {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient {{space in the}} main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, {{the player}} who organizes and directs the game play) {{randomly}} draws five cards from <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> of six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd, a book that details Strahd's long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd {{had fallen in love}} with a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that he had become a vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.|$|E
5|$|Enemies appear on-screen, and can {{be engaged}} by {{clicking}} on them. During the player's turn, three cards are randomly drawn from <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> of nine, each resulting in an attack. If the cards' combined strength and attached skills are insufficient to exhaust the enemy's HP, the heartless will counterattack. If the player survives this attack, or continues by spending additional AP, a new turn begins. Upon defeating an enemy, the player earns Lux (which unlocks rewards as it accumulates, but resets weekly), experience points (through which the player advances in level), and Munny (an in-game currency). The player also earns Fragments, cards based on the characters original to the Kingdom Hearts series and those from Disney and Final Fantasy franchises: the fragments are imbued with different properties depending on the character, such as physical or elemental strikes. Players can level up their cards to improve their attack and defense. Players can strengthen their Keyblade using materials found in each world, and new Keyblades are acquired as the story progresses. Each strengthens different types of cards; for example, Starlight is an all-around Keyblade offering boosts for Power-, Speed- and Magic-type cards, while the Snow White-inspired Treasure Trove is Power-type focused.|$|E

50|$|Amphibious {{transport}} docks {{perform the}} mission of amphibious transports, amphibious cargo ships, and the older LSDs by incorporating both <b>a</b> flight <b>deck</b> and <b>a</b> well <b>deck</b> that can be ballasted and deballasted to support landing craft or amphibious vehicles. One of the main differences between LSDs and LPDs {{is that while the}} former have <b>a</b> helicopter landing <b>deck,</b> the latter have hangar facilities in addition to <b>a</b> landing <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, <b>a</b> Spanish 40-card <b>deck</b> is used, but <b>a</b> French-suited <b>deck</b> may be {{substituted}} in which case spades correspond to swords, clubs to clubs, hearts to cups and diamonds to coins. The eights, nines and tens can be stripped out of <b>a</b> standard 52-card <b>deck</b> to make <b>a</b> suitable 40-card <b>deck.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1993, {{a remnant}} of the {{earliest}} known bridge-like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge, when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which had covered it. Dating to between 1550BC and 300BC, it consists of two rows of wooden posts, which it is believed would originally have carried <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> of some kind. It is believed {{that it did not}} cross the whole river, but instead connected the south bank to an island, possibly used for burial of the dead. As no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in Julius Caesar's account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author, it is presumed that the structure had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar's expedition to Britain in 55BC. The posts are still visible at extreme low tides.|$|E
5|$|Little Busters! was {{the first}} Key title to receive {{coverage}} in an entire issue of Dengeki G's Festival!, a special edition version of Dengeki G's Magazine which is published in irregular intervals each year by ASCII Media Works; the issue in question was the ninth, published on June 30, 2007. Along with a full 80 pages of information on Little Busters!, the magazine came bundled with a double-sided hug pillowcase, a small cell phone cleaner which could also attach to a cell phone, and a B5 size jigsaw puzzle. ASCII Media Works published the third volume of another special edition version of Dengeki G's Magazine named Dengeki G's Festival! Deluxe on June 30, 2008 which had a focus on Little Busters! Ecstasy. Along with again containing about eighty pages of information pertaining to the visual novel, the magazine also comes bundled with an ergonomic mousepad, a jigsaw puzzle, and <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> of playing cards. The third volume of another magazine in the Festival! line, Dengeki G's Festival! Comic, was sold on July 26, 2008 with Rin and Dorj on the cover, and the magazine came bundled with a hug pillowcase, a notepad, and a B2 size poster.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1872, Drache was recommissioned {{for service}} as a survey vessel, having had her 21cm gun removed and <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> house erected in its place. From May until 22 October, she {{surveyed}} the eastern coast of Holstein, operating from her base in Kiel. In November, Drache, Meteor, and the transport ship Rhein searched the eastern Baltic for any merchant ships {{that might have been}} damaged in a heavy storm. On 12 December, Drache returned to Wilhelmshaven, where she was again decommissioned. On 15 April 1874, the vessel was recommissioned for visits to British and Norwegian ports before being decommissioned again on 23 November in Wilhelmshaven. It was planned to send her to Spain in response to attacks on German nationals there, but the plan came to nothing. From 1875 to 1880, Drache made visits to Britain and Norway in the summer months. During this period, she underwent several additional modifications. In 1876, her masts were removed to improve her stability, and her remaining two guns were removed in 1878. Over the winter of 18791880, new boilers were installed, along with a barquentine sailing rig.|$|E

5|$|The German UB II design {{improved}} {{upon the}} design of the UB I boats, which had been ordered in September 1914. In service, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow. A major problem was that, because they had a single propeller shaft/engine combo, if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. To rectify this flaw, the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine), which also increased the U-boat's top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> gun. As a UB II boat, U-43 could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To accommodate all of these changes the boats' had larger hulls, and surface and submerged displacements more than twice those of the UB I boats.|$|E
5|$|The German UB II {{design of}} coastal {{submarines}} was a development from {{the design of}} the UB I boats, which had been originally ordered in September 1914. During their trials, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow, but in-service use revealed another problem. The UB I boats had a single propeller shaft/engine combo such that if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. The UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine) which not only alleviated this problem, but also had the added benefit of increasing the top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> gun. The UB II boats could also carry twice the torpedo load of their predecessors, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To contain all of these changes the hull was larger, and the surface and submerged displacement was more than doubled.|$|E
5|$|The Special Boat Section {{was founded}} in July 1940 by a Commando officer, Roger Courtney. Courtney became a {{commando}} recruit in mid-1940, and {{was sent to the}} Combined Training Centre in Scotland. He was unsuccessful in his initial attempts to convince Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes and later Admiral Theodore Hallett, commander of the Combined Training Centre, that his idea of a folding kayak brigade would be effective. He decided to infiltrate , a Landing Ship, Infantry anchored in the River Clyde. Courtney paddled to the ship, climbed aboard undetected, wrote his initials on the door to the captain's cabin, and stole <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> gun cover. He presented the soaking cover to a group of high-ranking Royal Navy officers meeting at a nearby Inveraray hotel. He was promoted to captain, and given command of twelve men, the first Special Boat Service/Special Boat Section.|$|E
