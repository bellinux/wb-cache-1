5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E
5|$|De Broglie's {{prediction}} {{of a wave}} nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving {{under the influence of}} the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how electron waves propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave equation <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum. Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.|$|E

25|$|In some societies, tariffs <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{imposed by}} local {{authorities}} on {{the movement of}} goods between regions (or via specific internal gateways). A notable example is the likin, which became an important revenue source for local governments in the late Qing China.|$|E
25|$|A noble lie, which <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{called a}} {{strategic}} untruth, {{is one that}} would normally cause discord if uncovered, but offers some benefit to the liar and assists in an orderly society, therefore, potentially beneficial to others. It is often told to maintain law, order and safety.|$|E
25|$|Though {{primarily}} a courting instrument played privately and for personal enjoyment, it <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{used in conjunction}} with chants, song, and hula. Kumu hula (dance masters), were said to be able to either make the flute sound as though it were chanting, or to chant as they played. Kumu hula Leilehua Yuen {{is one of the few}} contemporary Hawaiian musicians to perform with the nose flute in this manner.|$|E

25|$|Tatar has no neutral vowels. The vowel é {{is found}} only in loanwords. Other vowels <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> found in loanwords, but they are seen as Back vowels. Tatar {{language}} also has a rounding harmony, but it isn't represented in writing. O and ö could be written only in the first syllable, but vowels they mark could be pronounced {{in the place where}} ı and e are written.|$|E
25|$|The PZL.19 was {{designed}} by Jerzy Dąbrowski and Franciszek Misztal in 1931. The plane was of a modern construction, an all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane with a fixed landing gear and a closed canopy. The crew of two sat in tandem, there <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> fitted one passenger seat behind. It was powered by a 120hp de Havilland Gipsy III straight engine. Three aircraft were built in 1932, the first was flown in May 1932 by Bolesław Orliński. They carried registration SP-AHH, SP-AHI and SP-AHK.|$|E
25|$|A bank barn or banked barn is a {{style of}} barn noted for its accessibility, at ground level, on two {{separate}} levels. Often built {{into the side of}} a hill, or bank, both the upper and the lower floors area could be accessed from ground level, one area {{at the top of the}} hill and the other at the bottom. The second level of a bank barn <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> accessed from a ramp if a hill was not available.|$|E
50|$|The Doctors program {{required}} a custom-built photonic processor, and Starfleet outfitted Voyager with only two. This hardware itself <b>also</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> replicated, hence the Doctor <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> easily backed up, restored, or copied.|$|R

25|$|In the generational {{transmission}} of surnames, the paternal surname's precedence eventually eliminates the maternal surnames {{from the family}} lineage. Contemporary law allows the maternal surname to be given precedence, but most people observe the traditional paternal–maternal surname order. So the daughter and son of Ángela López Sáenz and Tomás Portillo Blanco are usually called Laura Portillo López and Pedro Portillo López, but <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> called Laura López Portillo and Pedro López Portillo. The two surnames of all of a couple's children {{must be in the}} same order when recorded in the Registro Civil.|$|E
25|$|A broad {{consensus}} amongst fans is {{that the}} Star Trek franchise became formulaic and mediocre in the 1990s due to over-exploitation of the franchise by Paramount and production of multiple spin-offs and movies, though fans do not necessarily agree as to when this began (some adult viewers of TOS felt it <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> formulaic and repetitive). The release in May 2009 of Star Trek, a reboot involving characters from the original series and set in an alternate timeline, was developed with the partial hope to resurrect the franchise.|$|E
25|$|The one failing {{of their}} {{marriage}} was that it remained childless. Head adored children, {{as can be seen}} in his poems and his poetry also gives considerable insight into Head's great desire for a child of his own. In his poem , for example, he takes on the perspective of a woman yearning for 'the fierce joy of motherhood' and presents a sympathetic view of her plight. Head's deeply personal poems <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> said to suggest that Ruth had at some point been pregnant (maybe more than once) and perhaps even to term.|$|E

25|$|The {{humanitarian}} {{ideal of}} the new Masonic order struck him as absolutely compatible with the Socialist ideas of Louis Goaziou. Muzzarelli contacted Goaziou in 1903 {{with the idea of}} creating in Charleroi (Pennsylvania) either a Lodge under the Grand Orient. He did not inform Goaziou of the option to form the Lodge of under Le Droit Humain, into which their wives <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> admitted, until he arrived in Charleroi in October 1903 to institute the Lodge. The charter members decided they would found the Lodge under Le Droit Humain. The first three degrees were conferred on them by Antoine Muzarelli, and over two days, October 18 and 19, 1903, the first Co-masonic American lodge, Alpha No 301 was born in Charleroi, Pennsylvania. Louis Goaziou became the first Worshipful Master.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of October, the Armada was still in no shape to depart. Lack of food and money as well as potential mutiny forcibly delayed the expedition which infuriated Philip. The Adelantado had preparation for the Armada as his main priority but soon asked to be relieved of his command to defend himself, which Philip refused. Philip instead abruptly cancelled the Irish enterprise altogether; the relenting weather, lateness {{of the season and}} disease amongst ships crews being the reasons. The Adelantado instead was to sail to La Coruna, where he was to be given orders to seize the French Port of Brest which they had briefly held in 1594 only to be defeated by Anglo French troops who took the fort there. Brest was chosen simply because it was closer to Spain but <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used as a base to attack England and also to help the Irish rebels.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then {{sought to}} solve the divine paradox — that an ignorant man <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the wisest of all men — in effort to {{illuminate}} {{the meaning of the}} Oracles' categorical statement: that he is the wisest man in the land. After systematically interrogating the politicians, the poets, and the craftsmen, Socrates determined that the politicians were impostors; that the poets did not understand their own poetry; and that the craftsmen, like prophets and seers, did not understand the things they spoke. In that light, Socrates saw himself as spokesman for the Oracle at Delphi (22e). He asked himself if he would rather be an impostor, like the “wise people” he interrogated, or if he would rather be himself, Socrates of Athens. As the defendant under trial, Socrates tells the jury that he would rather be himself than be anyone else. That in searching for a man wiser than himself, his questioning earned him the dubious reputation of social gadfly to the city of Athens.|$|E

500|$|An {{article in}} the North Carolina Law Review argued that Kennedy's {{majority}} opinion wrongly set forth {{the understanding of the}} role of an attorney. The author, Jessica Sharpe, criticized the Court's thesis that the role of the attorney is that of an advocate such that a restriction on the attorney served as a direct restriction of advocacy. This rationale, Sharpe argued, could undermine the balance of abortion restrictions because state regulations on abortion access <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> seen as an intrusion into doctor–patient speech. Because Velazquez [...] "blurred" [...] this distinction, the privileged nature of doctor–patient conversations could be subjected to future regulations and limitations.|$|E
