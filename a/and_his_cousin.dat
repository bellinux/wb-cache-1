5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened {{with the passage of the}} 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 Coffin <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cousin,</b> Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E

A Jesuit friar was informed at Vienna that Gálffy <b>and</b> <b>his</b> allies wanted to murder the prince <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cousins.</b> In late 1591 Sigismund stated {{that he was willing}} to renounce in favor of Balthasar if the members of the royal council favored <b>his</b> <b>cousin.</b> <b>His</b> offer was refused, but during the debate Kendi referred to Sigismund and Balthasar as the [...] "two monsters and greatest disasters of the Transylvanian realm". Pope Clement VIII's legate, Attilio Amalteo, mediated a reconciliation between Sigismund <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> in the summer of 1592.

5|$|Fatally, the Aulic Council {{decided to}} make Northern Italy the main theater of {{operations}} for the Habsburgs. Archduke Charles was assigned 95,000 troops and directed to cross the Adige River with Mantua, Peschiera, and Milan as the initial objectives. The Austrians based an army of 72,000 men on Ulm. Nominally commanded by Archduke Ferdinand, the army's real authority was Mack. Austrian strategy required that Archduke John with 23,000 troops secure the Tyrol and provide the link between his brother Charles's army <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cousin</b> Ferdinand's army. The Austrians also detached individual corps to serve with the Swedish in Pomerania and the British in Naples, though these were designed to confuse the French and divert their resources.|$|E

The Pritzker business empire contained over 200 businesses and was valued at $15billion.|$|E

He was a landholder in the Welsh Marches when he was married by Stephen to the widow of Pain fitzJohn, a union that gave Josce control of Ludlow Castle. Control of the castle was contested by other noblemen, and the {{resulting}} warfare between the nobles forms the background to a late medieval romance known as Fouke le Fitz Waryn, which is mainly concerned with the actions of Josce's grandson, but also includes some material on Josce's lifetime. Josce eventually lost control of Ludlow and was granted lands in compensation by Matilda and her son, King Henry II of England, who succeeded Stephen in 1154.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor's great-grandmother, Maria I of Portugal, {{had been}} a queen regnant. However, she had been married to her uncle, Pedro III of Portugal who was a Braganza.

Emperor Pedro II was the last of the direct male line in Brazil descended from Dom Afonso I, first king of Portugal and founder, in 1139, of the dynasty which headed the Brazilian Empire. There were two other male Braganzas, albeit living abroad: Pedro II's half-brother Rodrigo Delfim Pereira <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cousin</b> Miguel, Duke of Braganza. Both were barred from the line of succession, however. The former because he was an illegitimate son, and the latter because he was a foreigner and not a descendant of the first Brazilian Emperor, Pedro I.|$|E
