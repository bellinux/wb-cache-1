5|$|Divided is an American {{television}} {{game show}} broadcast by Game Show Network (GSN) {{based on the}} British series of the same name. Each episode consists of four contestants playing as one team who must agree on answers to questions they <b>are</b> <b>given.</b> <b>The</b> longer it takes the team {{to come to an}} agreement, the less money the team earns for each question. The series, hosted by Mike Richards, premiered January 19, 2017, with some critics believing that the show's name and timing were appropriate given the tumultuous preceding presidential election and its premiere date coming the day before the inauguration.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} adds new difficulty levels ('Beginner' and 'Expert') and new {{modes of}} play ('Arena Challenge' and 'Legend' modes). In 'Arena Challenge Mode,' the player can engage one-on-one duels against various opponents, where they'll be rewarded if they win. The new 'Legend Mode' elaborates {{on the individual}} prowess of each individual warrior within Dynasty Warriors. Individual weapons <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> availability to have an 11th evolved state, increasing the weapon's stats further. Due to the great emphasis in the duelling system in this expansion, it is at times seen as its own individual game - separate from the original Dynasty Warriors 4.|$|E
5|$|Those in Grammar Playroom (year ten) are {{automatically}} {{enrolled in the}} CCF and <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> option of continuing {{at the end of}} the year, following a summer camp which takes place at a local barracks. Training involves a range of activities such as drill (marching and related manoeuvres), shooting, learning how to assemble and clean weapons, tactical planning and team work. The school supplies pupils with uniform, the orderliness of which is rigorously enforced and inspected each week. Each platoon is led by a Junior Under Officer, his sergeant and corporals who are sixth form students.|$|E
5000|$|Seventeen baby girls born in 2009 in <b>the</b> United States <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renesme or Renesmee. The name rose in {{popularity}} for American girls the following year, when forty-seven girls were named Renesmee in 2010 in the United States {{and an additional}} eight girls were named Renesme. It dropped slightly in 2011, when thirty-three American girls born that year <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renesmee and another five girls <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renesme. In 2012, 59 American girls <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renesmee and in 2013, the name rose again {{in popularity}}, when 135 American girls received the name. In 2013, an additional 17 American girls <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name with its variant spelling Renesme. In 2014, 135 American girls <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renesmee, while 28 <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renesmae, 24 <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renezmae, 10 <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renesme, eight <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renezmee, seven <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renesmay and five <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Renezmay.|$|R

5|$|With Michael busy, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) work {{to reclaim}} parking spaces {{that they have}} lost due to {{construction}} in a neighboring office. They arrange {{a meeting with the}} bosses of the office park, and <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> parking spots back. The spaces are retrieved, Kevin feels happy to have won one, as his fiancée Stacy broke off their engagement and it's been a hard time for him.|$|E
5|$|X-Men vs. Street Fighter {{features}} gameplay {{similar to}} Street Fighter, but incorporates dual-character selection and tag team-based combat. Each player selects two characters {{to compete in}} a one-on-one battle, attempting to defeat the opposing team. The players <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> ability to switch between their characters at any point during the match. The game also incorporates numerous elements from X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the boys}} must pass seven final exams to graduate. Anmar, Hyder and Ali each fail two subjects, and <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> option to retake the exams. Anmar passes the retakes and aspires to study English {{literature}} in college, and his family decide to move to the safer region of Arbul now that he has graduated. Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family {{can no longer afford to}} pay for the university fees. Ali chooses not to retake the exams, and his family leave Iraq. Mohammad fails four subjects and must repeat his senior year. He chooses to do so at a different school while working at his uncle's scooter repair shop. As the documentary closes, it notes that during the year of filming, two of the boys' classmates were killed, six were kidnapped, and seventy-five left Iraq.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for the story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out the story. The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those {{who are interested in}} the story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{supports}} downloadable content; {{the first}} songs were made available {{shortly after the}} game's release. In addition, 152 of the 158 available downloadable songs for Guitar Hero World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero; the existing content is automatically upgraded to include all features new to these games and was immediately available to players upon release of Guitar Hero 5. Downloaded songs {{can be used in}} all game modes, provided all players have the song, including in the game's Career mode when players <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> option to select any song to play. The entire Guitar Hero 5 DLC library is also available in Band Hero, and vice versa, so both games embrace the same DLC library.|$|E

50|$|Bootcamp {{was filmed}} live at The SSE Arena, Wembley {{in front of}} a studio audience. Following the filming of bootcamp and prior to the filming of the six-chair challenge, the judges' {{categories}} were revealed. Cowell <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Groups, Scherzinger <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Overs, Osbourne <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Girls and Walsh <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Boys.|$|R
50|$|A Gift of Magic is a 1971 {{novel by}} Lois Duncan about a {{grandmother}} who gives her grandchildren distinct gifts. Brendon <b>is</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> gift of music, Kirby <b>is</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> gift of dance, and Nancy <b>is</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> gift of magic.|$|R
5|$|Hoepner's Panzer Corps and Prioux' Cavalry clashed head-on near Hannut, Belgium, on 12 May. Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Germans did not outnumber the French. Frequently, figures of 623 German and 415 French tanks <b>are</b> <b>given.</b> <b>The</b> German 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions {{numbered}} 280 and 343 respectively. The 2e DLM and 3e DLM numbered 176 Somuas and 239 Hotchkiss H35s. Added to this force were the {{considerable number of}} Renault AMR-ZT-63s in the Cavalry Corps. The R35 was equal or superior to the Panzer I and Panzer IIs in armament terms. This applies all the more to the 90 Panhard 178 armoured cars of the French Army. Its 25mm main gun could penetrate the armour of the Panzer IV. In terms of tanks that were capable of engaging and surviving a tank-vs-tank action, the Germans possessed just 73 Panzer IIIs and 52 Panzer IVs. The French had 176 SOMUA and 239 Hotchkisses. German tank units also contained 486 Panzer I and IIs, which were of dubious combat value given their losses in the Polish Campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when it is appropriate to disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the life experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
50|$|The draad (intelligence officer) <b>is</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> eyes. <b>Being</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> eyes signifies {{that he can}} see {{all that}} happens.|$|R
50|$|Pernille Rosendahl {{continued}} as a judge, while original judge Thomas Blachman and new judge Cutfather replaced Soulshock and Remee on the judging panel. Cutfather <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Under 25s, Rosendahl <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Groups and Blachman <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Over 25s. The winner was Sarah, mentored by Cutfather.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Blachman, Remee and Lina Rafn {{returned}} to the judging panel for their respective seventh, fifth and fourth seasons. Remee <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> 15-22s, Rafn <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Over 23s and Blachman <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Groups. Superbootcamp <b>was</b> replaced by 5 Chair Challenge. The winner was Emilie Esther, mentored by Remee.|$|R
5|$|Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb {{learn from}} their friend Baljeet that a tool they need for their latest project {{has yet to be}} invented. They and their friend Isabella borrow the time machine on display at the local museum to travel twenty years into the future. Once they arrive, Isabella stays behind with the time machine while the boys enter their sister Candace's backyard, where her sons Fred and Xavier are sitting under a tree doing nothing. The boys {{convince}} their future nephews to be active and in return <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> tool they need. As they leave, Candace spots them and it brings back upsetting memories of never being able to bust the boys. She takes her mother Linda to the museum where the boys leave, right before Linda can see them.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders {{was created}} by Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year {{designing}} the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it. The game's inspiration {{is reported to have}} come from varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game Space Monsters released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for Santa Claus and are attacked by invading aliens. However, Nishikado has cited Atari's arcade game Breakout as his inspiration. He aimed to create a shooting game that featured the same sense of achievement from completing stages and destroying targets, but with more complex graphics. Nishikado used a similar layout to that of Breakout but altered the game mechanics. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> ability to fire projectiles at their own discretion to attack moving enemies.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to come. This means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan leaders <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E
50|$|Then Alan Ladd <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> lead role, and Lewis Allen {{meant to}} direct. Eventually Mitchell Leisen <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> job of directing.|$|R

Of those who <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> CAGE 67 scored 1. 0 or more, (maximum score: 4. 0), and 36 scored 2. 0 or more, denoting a prevalence of probable alcoholism {{in this population}} of 11...|$|R
5|$|The {{only time}} in the year when {{separate}} food is cooked for the goddess is when she is offered non-vegetarian offerings. During Durga Puja, Vimala is offered non-vegetarian food and animal sacrifice, traditionally offered to the Hindu Mother Goddess. The goddess is considered to assume a destructive form during the festival and the meat is considered necessary to placate her. In strict secrecy during the pre-dawn hours, animal sacrifice of a he-goat is offered in the temple, while fish from the sacred Markanda temple tank are cooked and offered to Vimala, as per Tantric rituals. The rituals have to be completed before {{the doors of the}} main sanctum of the vegetarian Jagannath are opened at dawn and the first morning aarti is offered to the god. Vaishnava devotees of Jagannath are debarred from the temple. Only a few who witness the ceremony <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Bimala parusa (Vimala's cuisine) as prasad. The animal sacrifice and the non-vegetarian offerings to Vimala produced protests.|$|E
5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} can use both regular and special attacks. The latter use up Special Attack Stars; the player starts {{the game with}} three, and can gain more {{throughout}} the game, which carry over between areas. The types of attacks and stats such as attack power and agility differ depending on the character: Jack Frost's standard attack is throwing snowballs, Jack Lantern's is shooting fire balls, while Jack Skelton uses his knife. Their special attacks are, respectively, freezing all enemies for a few seconds; dealing {{a large amount of}} damage to all enemies; and defeating all enemies that are visible on the screen. As the player explores the floors, they need to avoid being attacked by enemies or falling into traps: each time this happens, the remaining time limit decreases by five seconds. If the timer reaches zero, the player reaches a game over state, although they <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> option to restart {{from the beginning of the}} current area.|$|E
5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E
50|$|At birth, he <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> {{title of}} ariʻirahi (chief) of the {{district}} of Afaʻahiti, in Tahiti. Other source state he <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> district of Mahina.|$|R
50|$|After his father's {{death in}} 1344, the county was divided. Bernhard <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> area around Rheda and Lippstadt. His brother Otto <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> area around Lemgo.|$|R
50|$|On {{the third}} day, each judge found out which {{category}} {{they would be}} mentoring, and the remaining 48 acts each had a one-on-one mentoring session with their mentor. Bassingthwaighte <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Under 25 Boys, Keating <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Under 25 Girls, Redfoo <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Over 25s and Minogue <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Groups category. On the fourth day, each act individually performed one song to the judges and a live audience of one thousand. On the fifth and final day of bootcamp, the judges revealed which acts they put through to home visits.|$|R
