25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone {{but the reason}} for that is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E
500|$|Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound is less {{impressed}} with the album, rating it a [...] "B" [...] and [...] "the black sheep of the Beatles' catalog". Although he admires the psychedelic tone, he considers that this experimentalism renders the more standard pop songs, such as [...] "Got to Get You Into My Life" [...] and [...] "Here, There and Everywhere", [...] "seemingly out of place" [...] within the collection.|publisher=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=24 June 2017}} Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham describes it as [...] "clearly brilliant" [...] but adds: [...] "There's an edge to the sound and a danger in the air … that makes listening to it an uncomfortable trip. It's easy to admire, even to be awed by, but some listeners find Revolver <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> love." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly favorable, calling it [...] "the only show with any sense of mystery." [...] John Teti of The A.V. Club found the episode to have a [...] "fantastic premise for a Peter Griffin adventure" [...] but went on to state that he gives the episode [...] "points for a strong first half, but I wish that the writers had pushed {{themselves}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> make this one go the distance." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN reiterated his own enjoyment of the premise {{of the episode}}, but went on to state, [...] "While I can appreciate the point that good comedy does take a certain degree of wit and cleverness, this just wasn't a very satisfying end to an idea that had so much potential." [...] In a much more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the underuse of cutaways, going on to note, [...] "Reducing the reliance on cutaways seems to be the continuing trend for the series, and I think it's a good move [...] It forces smarter writing, and creates a better narrative structure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Typically Malaysian, Bangsar has a {{wide array}} of cuisine. Indian Muslim Mamak stalls, south Indian banana leaf {{restaurants}} and Malay warungs are easily found, among the best is Yusof Tomyam and Anuar Kari Kepala Ikan. They are usually cheap, although prices in Bangsar are higher than average. Restoran Mahbub, which has been operating since 1974 in Lucky Garden, is famous for their Nasi Briyani Ayam Madu (Honey Chicken Briyani) and a wide array for dishes to accompany the nasi lemak that they serve. Devi's Corner which is located at jalan Telawi 2 is famous for authentic Indian banana leaf rice. [...] The price are reasonable. [...] Roadside hawkers usually open in the evenings and close late at night. There are many 24-hour Mamak and banana leaf restaurants. It is usually acceptable for one to patronise these joints and order only drinks, except during busy hours. Chinese kopitiam and seafood restaurants meanwhile are <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> find outside Lucky Garden.|$|E
60|$|The action did {{not have}} an air of finality, and Belding knew it. He had seen border life in Texas in the early days; he had been a sheriff when the law in the West {{depended}} on a quickness of wrist; he had seen many a man lay down his gun for good and all. His own action was not final. Of late he had done the same thing many times and this last time it seemed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> do, a little more indicative of vacillation. There were reasons why Belding's gun held for him a gloomy fascination.|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] {{said the}} king, {{with a smile}} that did not look {{particularly}} good-natured. [...] "Very true, young man. But there are other things as hard, or perhaps <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder,</b> <b>to</b> be done before you can even have the privilege of being devoured by the dragon. For example, you must first tame my two brazen-footed and brazen-lunged bulls, which Vulcan, the wonderful blacksmith, made for me. There is a furnace in each of their stomachs; and they breathe such hot fire out of their mouths and nostrils, that nobody has hitherto gone nigh them without being instantly burned to a small, black cinder. What do you think of this, my brave Jason?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I daresay you are right. It's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see how <b>a</b> fire {{could get}} in, but, after all, one can never make quite sure of anything." ...|$|R

'The tenth,' she continued, as she {{squeezed}} the envelope into her purse, {{with only the}} least hardening of voice, 'although I daresay you have not troubled to remember it--the tenth will be the eighteenth anniversary of our wedding-day. It makes parting, however advisable, and though only for the few days we should think nothing of in happier circumstances, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> bear. But there, all will come right. You will see things in a different light, perhaps. Words may wound, but time will heal.' But even as she now looked closely into his colourless sunken face some distant memory seemed to well up irresistibly--the memory of eyes just as ingenuous, and as unassuming that even in claiming her love had expressed only their stolid unworthiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] rejoined Vrouw Prinsloo, when William Wood had translated. [...] "Do you pray, prédicant, and all {{the rest}} of you who have nothing else to do, and while you are about it pray also that the bullets of Allan Quatermain may not be turned. As for me and Allan, we have other things to see to, so you must pray <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> cover us as well as yourselves. Now you come along, nephew Allan, or that liver may be {{overdone}} and give you indigestion, which is worse for shooting than even bad temper. No, not another word. If you try to speak any more, Henri Marais, I will box your ears," [...] and she lifted a hand like a leg of mutton, then, as Marais retreated before her, seized me by the collar as though I were a naughty boy and led me away to the wagons.|$|E
60|$|Hitherto {{very little}} that she desired {{had been denied}} her, and though {{that had not been}} {{sufficient}} to pervert her nature, it naturally made the suspense she had to face <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> bear, since the money before which other difficulties had melted was in this case of no avail. The commander of the Shasta had passed far beyond her power to recall him; and, if he still lived, of which she was far from certain, it was only the primitive courage and stubborn endurance which are not confined to men of wealth and station that could bring him back to her in spite of blinding fog and icy seas. Anthea had no longer any hesitation in admitting that this was what she greatly desired. Now that he had--it appeared more than possible--sailed out of her life altogether into the unknown haven that awaits the souls of the sailormen, she knew how she longed for him. Still, the days had slipped by, and there was no word from the silent north which has been for many a sailorman and sealer the fairway to the tideless sea.|$|E

60|$|She walked buoyantly {{along by}} my side, as tall {{within an inch}} or so as myself, and with a certain elegance in her gait <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> {{reconcile}} with her years. All the while she looked eagerly about her, her eyes shining with curiosity.|$|R
60|$|And yet {{the thing}} {{hangs in the}} heavens unhurt. Its opponents only succeed in {{destroying}} all that they themselves justly hold dear. They do not destroy orthodoxy; they only destroy political and common courage sense. They do not prove that Adam was not responsible to God; how could they prove it? They only prove (from their premises) that the Czar is not responsible to Russia. They do not prove that Adam {{should not have been}} punished by God; they only prove that the nearest sweater should not be punished by men. With their oriental doubts about personality they do not make certain that we shall have no personal life hereafter; they only make certain that we shall not have a very jolly or complete one here. With their paralysing hints of all conclusions coming out wrong they do not tear the book of the Recording Angel; they only make it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> keep the books of Marshall & Snelgrove. Not only is the faith the mother of all worldly energies, but its foes are the fathers of all worldly confusion. The secularists have not wrecked divine things; but the secularists have wrecked secular things, if that is any comfort to them. The Titans did not scale heaven; but they laid waste the world.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} William Ruhlmann awarded the album 4 stars stating [...] "Monk's Dream is a warm reunion of old friends, but those friends could have tried <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> {{come up with}} {{something}} fresh." ...|$|E
50|$|The soft version however, is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> nail down. The {{definition}} of a soft anti-genre might include art intentionally dispensing with conventions of its medium or violently breaking with tradition by subversion, vandalism-art, irrationality, self-defeat or other strategies in a rebellious spirit.|$|E
5000|$|IGN {{said that}} Intellivision Lives! is [...] "still blocky {{after all these}} years, sure...but these games really need the controller." [...] GameSpot editors said that {{although}} the controller emulation is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> handle, the collection does a fine job in delivering classic Intellivision games.|$|R
60|$|Keggs was a self-possessed man, but {{he found}} it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> begin.

5000|$|Ada and Ida (voiced by Sophia Ewaniuk) are twin {{elephants}} {{who sometimes}} say {{things at the}} same time. When they do, they high-five and say [...] "Jinx!" [...] followed by a giggle.

5000|$|... "Nakamura {{preferred}} {{to call the}} [...] "hidden" [...] moves [...] "intermediary" [...] moves, because they occur between the obvious-to-the-eye basic moves, {{and because they are}} not exotic or special, but are just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> catch. The key to catching them, by the way, is to watch the koshi (pelvic carriage) and hikite (pulling hand) carefully to penetrate the sleight of hand." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pitchfork was a dissenting voice, {{believing that}} [...] "following Coles Corner, it's... <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> be totally {{taken in by}} album... It begins to feel less like {{appropriation}} than note-perfect recreation... There's been no journey, no emotional progress, and little emotional payoff. For an album and artist so otherwise focused, the effect winds up more soporific than satisfying, however stylish and serene." ...|$|E
50|$|Even the PS2 and GameCube version {{are pretty}} much the same version. They are a few {{different}} things between these two. The levels have a little different in GC version like some platforms are completely gone, making this version <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> beat. On the other hand, some text font was changed and the Donald icon in life counter was smaller in GC version.|$|E

5000|$|Conductor Leonard Slatkin {{may have}} {{described}} Ron Nelson best: [...] "Nelson is the quintessential American composer.

5000|$|Stark kicked left-footed.
