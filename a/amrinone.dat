5000|$|Early {{studies in}} {{patients}} with heart failure showed that <b>amrinone</b> produced short-term hemodynamic improvement, but had limited long-term clinical benefit. Some serious side effects of long term administration included sustained ventricular tachycardia resulting in circulatory collapse, worsening myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarction, and worsening congestive heart failure. <b>Amrinone</b> has good absorption from the gastrointestinal tract [...] and may lead to some gastrointestinal upset when taken orally. The oral form of the drug {{is no longer in}} use. Currently, only acute intravenous administration takes place. The effects of <b>amrinone</b> vary widely with species and experimental condition; therefore inotropic effects are variable. [...] A loss in sensitivity to PDE III inhibitors has been observed in end stage heart failure in humans and thus other treatment options may be necessary to improvement in these stages.|$|E
5000|$|PDE III {{is present}} in cardiac muscle, {{vascular}} smooth muscle and platelets. PDE III degrades the phosphodiester bond in cAMP to break it down. When PDE III is inhibited, cAMP cannot be inactivated. An increase in cAMP with the administration of <b>amrinone</b> in vascular smooth muscle produces vasodilation by facilitating calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (a special type of smooth ER) and decreasing the calcium available for contraction. [...] In myocytes, the increase of cAMP concentration increases in turn the activity of PKA: this kinase improves the Ca2+ inward current through the L-type Ca2+ channels, which leads to calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, giving rise to a calcium spark that triggers the contraction; this results in an inotropic effect. Furthermore, PKA phosphorylates and deactivates the phospholambans that inhibit SERCA, which is an enzymatic pump that, to terminate the contraction, removes the Ca2+ from the cytoplasm, stores {{it back in the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum and promotes the subsequent relaxation as well, producing a lusitropic effect. Both inotropic and lusitropic effects are the reason why <b>amrinone</b> is used to treat heart failure.Amrinone decreases the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure while increasing cardiac output because it functions as an arterial vasodilator and increases venous capacitance while decreasing venous return. There is a net decrease in myocardial wall tension, and O2 consumption when using <b>amrinone.</b> <b>Amrinone</b> also has beneficial effects during diastole in the left ventricle including relaxation, compliance and filling in patients with congestive heart failure.|$|E
5000|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} (CHF) is {{characterized}} by a reduction in ventricular performance and abnormalities in peripheral circulation and organs. [...] A reduced release of endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF) causes a decrease in the stimulation of guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels fall in vascular smooth muscle. This impairs relaxation in the vasculature and {{is a part of the}} vicious cycle of CHF. Patients with CHF have a down-regulation of their β-1 adrenergic receptors which alters their ability to activate intracellular adenylate cyclase which catalyzes cAMP formation. cAMP is the second messenger that controls the level of calcium available to allow the heart to contract. An IV administration of <b>amrinone</b> has been shown to increase cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) while concurrently reducing the filling pressure of the left ventricle and decreasing the resistance in the peripheral vasculature. This does not lead to an increase in heart rate or blood pressure. [...] This improvement in performance of the ventricles is likely to result from a direct stimulation of the depressed myocardium as well as a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Wilmshurst, a {{cardiologist}} then working at St. Thomas' Hospital, London, approached The Guardian newspaper with a substantial dossier detailing alleged misconduct {{in the development}} of <b>Amrinone,</b> a cardiac drug manufactured by Sterling-Winthrop. The drug was supported by a study at Harvard Medical School and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, whose lead author was Eugene Braunwald, a leader in his field. Wilmshurst's group ran a series of experiments on the promising new drug but found no effect on contractility and frequent life-threatening side effects. Wilmshurst reported these findings to Sterling-Winthrop, who asked him to suppress the data. He refused, and they retaliated by threatening litigation. He continued the research and published his adverse findings in abstracts and conference presentations, until Sterling-Winthrop staff removed all stocks of the drug from the hospital pharmacy. A review by the Netherlands Committee for the Evaluation of Medicine found substantial discrepancies between the record cards of Wilmshurst's group and those submitted by Sterling-Winthrop. Wilmshurst showed that they had falsified the records, suppressing the adverse events he had reported. He then contacted the UK's Committee for the Safety of Medicines and discovered that Sterling-Winthrop had also failed to report the adverse events to the UK; they had also threatened the UK Government with closure of a large manufacturing plant in the UK. Sterling-Winthrop subsequently reported over 1,400 adverse events to the US Federal Food and Drug Administration, and terminated research and marketing in the US, while continuing to market the drug in the developing world. Finally, after a substantial Guardian feature, they withdrew the oral drug entirely in 1986. In 2003 he was given the Health Watch Award for this work.|$|E
40|$|There is {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} potent inotropic agents are beneficial or detrimental in moderate to severe heart failure. Accordingly, we studied the effects of <b>amrinone,</b> <b>amrinone</b> plus dobutamine, and dobutamine alone on mechanical performance, myocardial oxygen consump-tion, and high energy phosphate metabolism in different stages {{of congestive heart failure}} in the cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster. In hearts with moderate heart failure, administration of <b>amrinone,</b> <b>amrinone</b> plus dobutamine, and dobutamine alone increased developed pressure significantly, whereas the phosphorylation potential increased significantly only with <b>amrinone</b> and <b>amrinone</b> plus dobutamine.

In the present study, we examined the immunosuppressive action of <b>amrinone,</b> since several other cyclic AMP-elevating agents {{have been shown to}} suppress T lymphocyte activation. First, the in vivo effects of <b>amrinone</b> were investigated. Oral <b>amrinone</b> treatment, at 40 mg/kg per day, significantly prolonged median cardiac allograft survival compared with non-treated controls (22. 0 days versus 10. 5 days, P < 0. 01) when DBA/ 2 mouse hearts (H- 2 d) were heterotopically transplanted into C 57 B 1 / 6 mice (H- 2 b). Histopathological examination showed that there was less prominent cellular infiltration in the amrinone-treated than in the non-treated allografts. Plasma <b>amrinone</b> concentrations of mice after a single oral dose of 40 mg/kg were within the range of clinical relevance. To clarify the mechanism of action, in vitro studies were done. The generation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes after mixed lymphocyte culture was significantly suppressed by addition of <b>amrinone</b> to the culture medium at 5 micrograms/ml. The production of IL- 2 and the interferon-gamma during mixed lymphocyte culture was also suppressed by <b>amrinone</b> at 5 micrograms/ml. However, the level of intracellular cyclic AMP in mouse splenic lymphocytes was not affected significantly by the same dose of <b>amrinone.</b> In conclusion, <b>amrinone</b> has immunosuppressive actions at the therapeutic doses, and it may be a beneficial agent for therapy against acute cardiac allograft rejection...|$|E

40|$|In spontaneously beating atria from reserpine-treated guinea-pigs, <b>amrinone</b> (10 microM to 2 mM) induced a {{positive}} inotropic and chronotropic effect that {{was preceded by}} a transient reduction in contractile force and in frequency.

The inotropic action of <b>amrinone</b> was antagonized by low concentrations of 8 -phenyltheophylline that compete with adenosine at R-receptors on plasma membrane without significantly influencing phosphodiesterase activity. Cumulative concentrations of <b>amrinone</b> (1 mM) antagonized the reduction of rate of contraction and amplitude induced by dipyridamole 1 microM in spontaneously beating atria and restored the maximum contractile effect reached in the absence of dipyridamole.

Rest and exercise ventricular function were determined before and after 32 hours of amrinone; aerobic capacity was serially assessed. After 2 hours, 1. 64 mg/kg <b>amrinone</b> produced a 40 % (p < 0. 001) increase in cardiac output and a 32 % (p < 0. 02) decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure without altering heart rate or blood pressure.

In anesthetized dogs, intravenous bolus injections of <b>amrinone</b> at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg caused increases in cardiac contractile force and left ventricular dp/dt max with relatively small changes in heart rate and blood pressure. No significant changes in lead II ECG were observed.

Phase 1 : After the addition of <b>amrinone</b> (113 ± 33 mg three times daily), 52 patients (30 %) showed a maximal increase in treadmill exercise time exceeding 2 minutes (Naughton protocol), 72 (42 %) had a lesser increase, 24 (14 %) developed limiting adverse reactions, 20 (12 %) died and 5 dropped out of the study. Fifty-two “re-sponders” (30 %) who were free of limiting side effects and had a greater than 2 minute increase in exercise time were randomized in double-blind fashion to continued <b>amrinone</b> or switched to placebo (each plus standard treatment) for an additional 12 weeks. Phase 2 : Comparison of 31 of these 52 responders who continued to receive <b>amrinone</b> with the remaining 21 randomized to placebo revealed no significant differences in vital signs, indexes of left ventricular size and function, systolic time intervals or maximal exercise time. Continued follow-up study of patients receiving either <b>amrinone</b> or placebo revealed decreases in exercise times of 7 and 10 %, respectively (both p < 0. 05 compared with before randomization). Episodes of worsened congestive heart failure severe enough to mandate termination of double-blind treatment were as frequent in patients taking placebo (4 [18 %] of 21) as in those taking <b>amrinone</b> (4 [13 %] of 31; p = NS).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the response to <b>amrinone</b> in patients with severe baseline left ventricular dysfunction can predict improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Background. Previous studies have suggested that the inotropic response to dobutamine can identify viable myocardium in the setting of chronic coronary disease and left ventricular dysfunction. However, increased oxygen demand stimulated by dobutamine can lead to superimposition of ischemia on the hibernating state, potentially confounding interpretation of results. <b>Amrinone</b> is an inotropic agent that does not critically augment myocardial oxygen demand and may be useful for identification of hibernating myocardium in the chronically ischemic state. Methods. Forty-four consecutive patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % referred for coronary artery bypass graft surgery underwent <b>amrinone</b> stimulation (1 mg/kg body weight). Left ventricular ejection fraction was determined before <b>amrinone</b> stimulation, 20 min after infusion and 21 days after bypass surgery. Results. Baseline ejection fraction was 28 ± 7 % (mean ± SD). Ejection fraction increased to 35 ± 5 % after <b>amrinone</b> stimulation (p < 0. 0001) and to 33 ± 6 % after bypass surgery (p < 0. 0001). Postbypass ejection fraction was significantly correlated with postamrinone ejection fraction (r = 0. 65, p < 0. 0001). Furthermore, the change in ejection fraction from baseline to after bypass surgery was highly correlated with the change in ejection fraction after <b>amrinone</b> stimulation (r = 0. 75, p < 0. 0001). Of 13 patients with an increase in ejection fraction <- 10 % after <b>amrinone,</b> all 13 had an increase of at least 8 % and 11 (85 %) of 13 had an increase ≥ 10 % after bypass surgery. In contrast, of 31 patients with an increase in ejection fraction < 10 % after <b>amrinone,</b> only 2 (6 %) had an increase ≥ 10 % (p < 0. 0001) and 28 (90 %) of 31 had an increase < 5 % after bypass surgery.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The thermogenic {{effect of}} <b>amrinone</b> is unknown and its {{utilization}} {{in patients with}} severe cardiac failure could potentially increase oxygen requirements and therefore aggravate oxygen debt. Consequently, {{the present study was}} undertaken to assess the thermogenic response to <b>amrinone</b> at three different plasma concentrations under controlled conditions and to analyze amrinone's effects on various biochemical variables. DESIGN: A prospective, unblinded, controlled study. The initial control period was followed by three sequential, experimental treatments. SUBJECTS: Ten young, healthy, male volunteers with normal body weight. INTERVENTIONS: Three experimental periods. <b>Amrinone</b> was administered intravenously in progressive doses: a) 0. 5 mg/kg followed by 5 micrograms/kg/min; b) 0. 5 mg/kg followed by 10 micrograms/kg/min; and c) 1. 0 mg/kg followed by 10 micrograms/kg/min. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Oxygen consumption (VO 2) and CO 2 production were continuously measured by means of a computerized indirect calorimeter. At the highest dose, <b>amrinone</b> produced a slight and significant (p <. 01) increase in VO 2 and in resting metabolic rate (+ 4. 5 % and + 3. 7 %, respectively), while no change in CO 2 production or in respiratory quotient occurred throughout the study. At the medium and high doses, <b>amrinone</b> increased plasma free fatty acid concentrations by 38 % and 53 %, respectively (p <. 05).

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} <b>amrinone</b> and sodium nitroprusside on haemodynamic indices, left ventricular contractility, and myocardial metabolism were compared {{in patients with}} cardiac failure.

Pressure derived indices of contractility in each group of patients were unaltered by either drug. After <b>amrinone</b> administration increases in cardiac index were related to plasma <b>amrinone</b> concentration, but alterations in contractility were not.

40|$|Purpose: Phosphodiesterase (PDE) III inhibitors {{have been}} {{reported}} in various cellular pro-tective activities via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. We investigated the effects of <b>amrinone</b> on ischemia/reperfusion injury and intracellular calcium (Ca 2 +) handling if utilized as a component of terminal warm blood cardioplegia (TWBCP). Methods: Anesthetized pig hearts were subjected to 90 -min global ischemia with single-dose crystalloid cardioplegia, followed by 30 -min reperfusion under cardiopulmonary bypass. The animals were divided into three groups according to the contents of TWBCP (n = 5 each) : Control, no TWBCP; TWBCP, no additive; <b>Amrinone,</b> TWBCP with <b>amrinone.</b> The time course of cardiac function and biochemical samples were measured. Further, coronary perfusion and ventricular arrhythmia were evaluated during reperfusion. Results: Cardiac function improved with <b>amrinone.</b> Specifically, the <b>amrinone</b> group showed an increase of myocardial cAMP (p < 0. 05) and a suppression of creatine kinase, troponin-T, and lipid peroxide after reperfusion (p < 0. 05); many cases also showed much improvement of coronary perfusion and spontaneous resuscitation after global ischemia. Conclusion: Ischemia and/or reperfusion deplete myocardial cAMP, leading to impaired Ca 2 + handling and further to cardiac dysfunction. High-dose PDEIII inhibitor in TWBCP may replenish myocardial cAMP and promote rapid and sustained cardiac functional recov-ery with various cellular protective effects after open-heart surgery.

40|$|The inotropic {{response}} to <b>amrinone</b> and milrinone in isolated cat papillary muscle {{is characterized by}} a dose-dependent increase in contractility, with milrinone about five times as potent as <b>amrinone,</b> no effect on load dependence of relaxation, no change in timing and duration of the contraction-relaxation cycle, and marked temperature dependence. This response necessitates, at least in part, the presence of a well-functioning sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). <b>Amrinone</b> and milrinone are less active when the SR is poorly developed, as in frog myocardium, mammalian atrial myocardium, Purkinje fibers, and ventricular muscle from fetal and newborn animals; when the SR has been destroyed, as in single mammalian cardiac cells; and when the SR, for reasons still under investigation, has become inactive, as in isolated human ventricular myocardium. <b>Amrinone</b> and milrinone are also less active or may depress contractility under conditions in which the SR is known to function near maximal calcium saturation (as in rat ventricular myocardium) or to be overloaded with calcium (as during reoxygenation). This depressant action suggests concomitant desensitization of the contractile proteins to calcium...|$|E
40|$|The {{protective}} role of <b>amrinone</b> against {{toxicity of}} anthracyclines was examined in both mice and rats. These two anthracyclines were selected {{since they are}} characterized by different patterns of toxicity. In contrast to doxorubicin, the 4 '-deoxy derivative did not cause delayed mortality. The results of this investigation indicate that <b>amrinone</b> is an effective protective agent against acute lethal events induced by both anthracyclines. However, the inotropic agent did not reduce the delayed mortality produced by doxorubicin. This parallels the apparent lack of prevention of doxorubicin-induced myocardial toxicity in CD rats, as determined by ECG changes and by morphologic alterations following multiple drug administrations.

40|$|The {{effects of}} intracoronary and {{intravenous}} infusions of <b>amrinone</b> were studied {{to distinguish the}} drug's direct cardiac actions from its peripheral vascular and neuroendocrine properties. Intracoronary infusions of <b>amrinone</b> {{were found to have}} no haemodynamic effect other than producing a slight reduction in the left ventricular ejection fraction and some suggestion of coronary vasodilatation in patients with impaired left ventricular function. They did not improve contractility, cardiac output, or filling pressures and had no significant effect on myocardial metabolism, although therapeutic concentrations of the drug were detected in coronary sinus blood. Intravenously administered <b>amrinone</b> reduced filling pressures and improved the cardiac index in all patients, but haemodynamic improvements were most pronounced in the patients with the worst cardiac function. These changes were accompanied by improvements in the indices of contractility only in patients in whom alterations in concentrations of free fatty acid, glycerol, and glucose suggested peripheral catecholamine release. In the patients with the best basal cardiac function intravenously administered <b>amrinone</b> produced a reduction in myocardial work and evidence of myocardial ischaemia, as a result of excessive reduction of coronary perfusion pressure and increased heart rate, without any appreciable increase in cardiac index. It is concluded that, at the concentrations of the drug that can be achieved in man without adverse effects, <b>amrinone</b> has no direct positive inotropic effect. Haemodynamic changes are predominantly the result of vasodilatation, although catecholamines may be released in some patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: <b>Amrinone,</b> a {{selective}} phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, {{is reported to}} have a potent inotropic effect on the left ventricle, but the effects of this drug on right ventricular contractility in the clinical setting are unknown. The concept of ventricular/arterial coupling was applied to investigate the effects of <b>amrinone</b> on right ventricular contractility and afterload with transesophageal echocardiography. Methods and Results: The study was performed {{in the intensive care unit}} with 11 patients who had undergone cardiac operations. Right ventricular cross-sectional area was measured with transesophageal echocardiography equipped with a capability of automated border detection as a surrogate for right ventricular volume. Multiple pressure-area loops were obtained by reducing preload to measure end-systolic elastance and effective arterial elastance. External work and pressure-volume area were also measured to calculate the efficiency of energy transfer from pressure-volume area to external work. Nitroprusside (0. 3 to 0. 5 μg · kg – 1 · min– 1) and <b>amrinone</b> (1 mg · kg – 1 intravenously followed by 10 μg · kg – 1 · min– 1) were administered. With nitroprusside infusion, end-systolic elastance and effective arterial elastance remained unchanged (end-systolic elastance, 4. 73  ± 2. 18 mm Hg/cm 2 to 4. 65  ± 2. 09 mm Hg/cm 2; effective arterial elastance, 8. 05  ± 3. 84 mm Hg/cm 2 to 7. 70  ± 3. 64 mm Hg/cm 2). In contrast, <b>amrinone</b> reduced afterload (effective arterial elastance, 8. 82  ± 3. 99 mm Hg/cm 2 to 7. 05  ± 4. 01 mm Hg/cm 2, p = 0. 004) and enhanced contractility (end-systolic elastance, 4. 47  ± 1. 79 mm Hg/cm 2 to 6. 56  ± 2. 22 mm Hg/cm 2, p = 0. 007). Consequently, <b>amrinone</b> decreased the ventricular/arterial coupling ratio (effective arterial elastance/end-systolic elastance, 2. 40  ± 1. 45 to 1. 16  ± 0. 63, p = 0. 009) and improved the efficiency of energy transfer (external work/pressure-volume area, 0. 44  ± 0. 15 to 0. 54  ± 0. 15, p = 0. 013). Conclusions: Right ventricular pressure-area relations obtained with transesophageal echocardiography could successfully separate the simultaneous change in right ventricular systolic mechanics and afterload caused by <b>amrinone.</b> <b>Amrinone</b> caused enhancement of right ventricular contractility and afterload reduction.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to determine the systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic effects of <b>amrinone</b> in infants and children with a cardiac left to right shunt {{to determine if there}} is a beneficial effect on the pathophysiology of this condition. Background. <b>Amrinone</b> is a bipyridine derivative with inotropic and vasodilator effects that have not been systematically evaluated in the pediatric patient with increased pulmonary blood flow. Methods. Nineteen patients (aged 2 months to 8. 3 years) with one or more left to right shunts were evaluated during cardiac catheterization with direct hemodynamic measurements made before and 10 min (peak effect) after administration of a bolus injection of <b>amrinone,</b> 3 mg/kg body weight. The Fick method was used to calculate pulmonary and systemic blood flow, and resistances were then calculated. Results. In group A, five patients with normal pulmonary artery pressure and resistance, <b>amrinone</b> significantly reduced mean pulmonary artery pressure by 19 %, mean left atrial pressure by 39 % and systemic vascular resistance by 17 %. In group B, seven patients with pulmonary artery hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mm Hg) and normal pulmonary vascular resistance (total pulmonary resistance ≤ 3 Wood U-m 2), <b>amrinone</b> significantly reduced the pulmonary artery pressure by 27 %, systolic aortic pressure by 5 %, mean aortic pressure by 12 %, pulmonary arteriolar resistance by 36 % and total pulmonary vascular resistance by 26 %. In group C, seven patients with pulmonary artery hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mm Hg) and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (total pulmonary resistance > 3 Wood U·m 2), <b>amrinone</b> significantly reduced the pulmonary arteriolar resistance by 49 %, total pulmonary resistance by 47 % and pulmonary arteriolar/systemic vascular resistance ratio by 45 % and increased the heart rate by 15 %. Conclusions. In children with a cardiac left to right shunt, <b>amrinone</b> 1) appears to have selective vasodilator effects depending on the pulmonary artery pressure and resistance, 2) has a beneficial hemodynamic effect in children with normal pulmonary artery pressure and resistance, and 3) may have a role in the treatment of patients with pulmonary artery hypertension without causing systemic hypotension...|$|E
40|$|Hemodynamic care during {{postoperative}} {{management of}} myocardial revascularization should include vasorelaxing drugs to insure adequate graft and coronary flow, and stimulation of stroke volume to maintain vascular perfusion pressure. We tested the cardiac (inotropic and lusitropic) and vascular (relaxant) effects of diltiazem (0. 1 nM to 0. 1 mM), dobutamine (10 µM to 10 mM) and <b>amrinone</b> (10 µM to 1 mM) on isolated rat atria and thoracic aorta, {{and also on}} isolated human saphenous vein (HSV) and human mammary artery (HMA). Dobutamine produced a maximal positive inotropic effect (+dF/dt max = 29 ± 7 %) at its ED 50 for aortic relaxation (88 ± 7 µM). Conversely, at their ED 50 for aortic relaxation diltiazem depressed myocardial contractility and <b>amrinone</b> did not exhibit myocardial effects. In HSV and HMA contracted with 80 mM potassium, diltiazem and dobutamine (but not <b>amrinone)</b> had a vasorelaxant activity {{similar to that in}} rat aorta. Norepinephrine-contracted human vessels were significantly more sensitive than potassium-contracted vessels to the relaxant effect of <b>amrinone</b> (ED 50 HMA = 15 ± 5 µM, ED 50 HSV = 72 ± 31 µM, P < 0. 05). We conclude that at concentrations still devoid of myocardial effects dobutamine and <b>amrinone</b> are effective dilators in graft segment vessels and rat aorta contracted by membrane depolarization. If the difference between aortic and myocardial tissue still holds in human tissues, at the appropriate concentrations these drugs should be expected to improve cardiac performance while still contributing to the maintenance of graft patency...|$|E
40|$|Background—Mounting {{evidence}} links systemic {{and local}} inflammatory cytokine production to myocardial dysfunction and injury occurring during ischemia-reperfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, and heart failure. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs), used frequently in these states, can modulate inflammatory signaling. The mechanisms for these effects are unclear. We therefore {{examined the effects}} of 2 commonly used PDEIs, <b>amrinone</b> and milrinone, on cardiac cell inflammatory responses. Methods and Results—Primary rat cardiomyocyte cultures were treated with endotoxin (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), alone or in the presence of clinically relevant concentrations of <b>amrinone</b> or milrinone. Regulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFB), nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase isoforms, and cytokine production were assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Western immunoblotting, and enzyme-linked immunoassays, respectively. Both LPS and TNF- induced significant NFB activation, cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression, and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cytokine production; with the exception of COX- 2 expression, all were significantly reduced by <b>amrinone,</b> beginning at concentrations of 10 to 50 mol/L. In contrast, milrinone increased nuclear NFB translocation, iNOS and COX- 2 expression, and cardiomyocyte production of interleukin- 1. Cell-permeable cAMP increased inflammatory gene expression, whereas cell-permeable cGMP had no effect, indicating that the effects of <b>amrinone</b> were not due to phosphodiesterase inhibition. Similar results were seen in macrophages and coronary vascular endothelia...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Although the bipyridine agent <b>amrinone</b> is {{reported}} to have a positive inotropic effect on the left ventricle, the effect of this drug on right ventricular contractility in the clinical setting is unknown. We studied the effect of short-term intravenous administration of <b>amrinone</b> on right ventricu-lar systolic function in nine patients with severe congestive heart failure and, using radionuclide ventriculography, examined the right ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship to deter-mine whether reduced right ventricular afterload or increased contractility predominantly accounted for the observed improvement in right ventricular systolic function. In each patient the right ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship was derived with use of varying doses of nitroprusside. After nitroprusside was stopped, intravenous <b>amrinone</b> (3 mg/kg) caused decreases from baseline in pulmo-nary arterial end-systolic pressure in eight of nine patients (23 ± 11 % [overall mean ± SE], p <. 05), and in pulmonary vascular resistance in all patients (38 ± 6 %, p <. 001). Right ventricular end-systolic volume decreased (23 8 %, p <. 01) and right ventricular ejection fraction increased (31 ± 10 %, p =. 01). The amrinone-induced decrease in right ventricular end-systolic volume was compared with that predicted for right ventricular afterload reduction alone based on the effect of <b>amrinone</b> on pulmonary arterial end-systolic pressure and the pressure-volume relationship observed during infusio...|$|E
