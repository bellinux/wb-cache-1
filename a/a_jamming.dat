25|$|The U.S. {{government}} {{believes that}} such jammers were used occasionally during the War in Afghanistan, and the U.S. military {{claims to have}} destroyed six GPS jammers during the Iraq War, including one that was destroyed with a GPS-guided bomb. A GPS jammer {{is relatively easy to}} detect and locate, making it an attractive target for anti-radiation missiles. The UK Ministry of Defence tested <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> system in the UK's West Country on 7 and 8 June 2007.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, Raytheon {{completed}} ground verification {{tests for}} the ADM-160 MALD and MALD-J for integration onto the Reaper for an unmanned suppression of enemy air defenses capability. On 12 April 2013, a company-owned MQ-9 equipped with <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> pod and digital receiver/exciter successfully demonstrated its electronic warfare capability at Marine Corp Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, performing its mission {{in coordination with}} over 20 participating aircraft. A second electronic warfare test, fitted with the Northrop Grumman Pandora EW System, was conducted on 22 October 2013 with other unmanned aircraft and Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowlers, showing effectiveness in a multi-node approach against a more capable IADS.|$|E

5000|$|Types of jams include {{failures}} to feed, extract, or eject a cartridge; failure to fully cycle after firing; and {{failure of a}} recoil- or gas-operated firearm to lock back when empty (largely a procedural hazard, as a [...] "slide lock" [...] is a visual cue that the firearm's ammunition supply is empty). When <b>a</b> <b>jam</b> occurs, the handler should exercise extreme caution as a cartridge whose primer has been struck and which has been deformed in <b>a</b> <b>jam</b> can discharge unexpectedly (in a [...] "hang-fire".) One method of quickly clearing <b>a</b> <b>jammed</b> semi-automatic weapon is tap rack bang.|$|R
25|$|On 3 February 1917, Suk and Vladimir Strzhizhevsky staked {{a combat}} claim that went unconfirmed. On the 9th, <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> gun aborted his attack on an enemy plane. On 12 February 1917, {{the engine of}} Suk's Nieuport failed {{at the end of}} a {{prolonged}} reconnaissance flight. His subsequent inept deadstick landing at Bakey Airfield overturned and damaged the machine. Suk was then assigned Morane-Saulnier I s/n MS742. As the weather cleared in the Spring of 1917, the tempo of combat accelerated. Suk scored his second victory on 26 March 1917; his third on 17 April 1917. He then entered a dry spell marked by unfruitful attacks that did blunt enemy reconnaissance efforts. He resumed his victories in early September, and he would string them out until 10 November.|$|E
25|$|On the train, Hunt {{remotely}} directs Max to the list. Max verifies it {{and gives}} Hunt the code to a briefcase containing the payment along with Job in the baggage car. Ethan calls Claire and tells her {{to meet him}} there. Meanwhile, Stickell uses <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> device to prevent Max from uploading the data to her servers. Claire reaches the baggage car, finds Phelps and tells him Ethan will arrive shortly. She questions the idea of killing Ethan, since they will need a fall guy for the money, when Phelps reveals himself to be Ethan in disguise, exposing her as a co-conspirator. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video glasses that relays Phelps to Kittridge, blowing Phelps' cover as the mole.|$|E
25|$|EVA 1 {{started with}} astronauts Dave Wolf and Tim Kopra {{switching}} their spacesuit power to internal battery at 16:19 UTC. Despite a communication {{problem with the}} spacewalkers, the Japanese Exposed Facility was successfully installed on the Japanese Experiment Module {{by means of a}} complex series of steps involving the robotic arms of both the station and the shuttle. The JEF was first unberthed from the shuttle payload bay by the station arm, after which the shuttle arm took the load. The station arm was then moved to the worksite on Node-2 (Harmony), wherefrom it took the 4.1 ton facility back. The facility was then successfully latched on to the Experiment Module. As part of the EVA, the spacewalkers successfully deployed the port Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attach System (UCCAS), which could not be deployed during STS-119. During the prior mission, the deployment failed due to <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> caused by a stuck detent pin. Engineers designed a custom tool to force the pin to release, which was used to deploy the mechanism. Meanwhile, the shuttle managers announced {{that there would be no}} need for a focused inspection of the heat shield. The nose cap and wing leading-edge panels of the shuttle were cleared for entry as they were, but a reentry clearance was not given. Beyond one impact site having a gouge, the rest of the impacts were found to be mostly a loss of coating. The other activity scheduled for EVA 1, the deployment of a starboard side cargo carrier, was postponed for want of time. A fuel cell issue found before launch was analyzed, though the cell continued to function as expected with no impact to the mission.|$|E

500|$|After his 2010 {{debut album}} Doo-Wops & Hooligans, which {{produced}} the singles [...] "Just the Way You Are" [...] and [...] "Grenade", Bruno Mars revealed {{he wanted to}} create something unexpected with its follow-up. [...] "This is me going into the studio and recording and writing whatever I want," [...] Mars said confidently. [...] "This album represents my freedom." [...] It all started backstage, after a show, during <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> session in a [...] "greenroom", while singing the phrase [...] "Locked Out of Heaven". According to Philip Lawrence, the track developed a meaning as they started to write it, [...] "when you’re with someone who’s showing you {{a new way to}} love." [...] The Smeezingtons went to New York to work with Jeff Bhasker, Emile Haynie and Mark Ronson and during <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> session with drums, bass, and guitar, Mars created the riff of the song. He started singing the chorus previously created {{on the top of the}} riff. Then, The Smeezingtons went back to L.A., where they finished the lyrics and changed the original melody. Lawrence felt that the recording was [...] "sort of empty but it had a carnal vibe to it", making them enthusiastic to place a [...] "driving rhythm" [...] in it. The composer recalled thinking it was [...] "something special" [...] in the studio, the same way he did during the creation of [...] "Just The Way You Are" [...] and [...] "Billionaire".|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} eight episodes [...] "Instinct" [...] and [...] "Bloodline", Tess learns about Krypton {{and the name}} [...] "Kal-El", though she does not {{attribute}} any of the information directly to Clark. In [...] "Bulletproof", it is revealed that Tess knows where Lex is. Here, Lana informs Tess that Lex surgically implanted a nano-transmitter into Tess's optic nerve {{so that he could}} keep an eye on everything she is doing. Visibly upset by this, Tess places <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> device into her necklace to disrupt the signal, but not before telling Lex that she will cut him off from the outside world and sell off everything that he owns. In the episode [...] "Requiem", it is revealed that Tess sold controlling interest in LuthorCorp to Queen Industries. In [...] "Turbulence", Tess tries to get Clark to reveal his powers after she read one of Lionel Luthor's journals that identified Clark as [...] "The Traveler", but her effort failed. In the episode [...] "Eternal", it is shown that Tess has the Kryptonian orb that brought down the Fortress of Solitude, and in [...] "Injustice" [...] a disembodied voice emanates from the orb revealing that Tess's recent actions to get Clark to reveal his powers and kill Doomsday are because the voice was instructing her to do so. In the season eight finale, the orb activates itself and transports Zod to Smallville.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2007 singer Tim Booth's {{personal}} website {{announced that}} [...] "Tim will be rejoining James in early 2007 {{for a series}} of live shows to be announced very soon". At the same time, James' old website was replaced by a new domain holder at wearejames.com. The site confirmed the line-up as that which recorded the album Laid: Booth, Gott, Glennie, Davies, Hunter and Baynton-Power. Booth confirmed in interviews that he became convinced to rejoin the band after meeting up with Glennie and Gott the previous November for <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> session, out of which new songs were born.|$|E
2500|$|Wake Up! {{features}} mostly {{covers of}} {{songs from the}} soul music of the 1960s and 1970s, and incorporates musical elements from gospel, rock, reggae, and hip hop. Songs covered for the album include [...] "Wholy Holy" [...] by Marvin Gaye, [...] "Little Ghetto Boy" [...] by Donny Hathaway, [...] "Hard Times" [...] by Baby Huey & the Babysitters and [...] "Hang on in There" [...] by Mike James Kirkland. The lone original song for Wake Up! is the Legend-penned album closer [...] "Shine". A different version of [...] "Shine" [...] {{was included in the}} album's deluxe edition and is used during the closing credits of the 2010 film Waiting for [...] "Superman". In an interview for The Guardian, Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson of The Roots said that they intended to cover lesser-known soul songs, stating [...] "I wanted to choose cover songs that were so under the radar, so uniquely interpreted, that it would take you a second to realise that these are cover songs [...] ". Questlove has said that the band's instrumentation for the album is looser than on previous albums, with <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> and [...] "grass-roots feel". Wake Up! contains lyrical themes concerning social awareness, engagement, and consciousness. The Roots' lead MC Black Thought is featured on few tracks, as the band mostly accompanies Legend's singing with live instrumentation. Other rappers featured on the album include Common, CL Smooth, and Malik Yusef.|$|E

60|$|Down went Spike, and {{the length}} of time he was under water, proved how much he was in earnest. Up he came at length, and with no better luck than his companion. He had got hold of the bag, {{satisfied}} himself by feeling its outside that it contained the doubloons, and hauled with all his strength, but it would not come. The boatswain now proposed to take <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> hitch with a rope around the neck of the bag, which was long enough to admit of such a fastening, and then to apply their united force. Spike assented, and the boatswain rummaged about for a piece of small rope to suit his purpose. At this moment Mulford appeared at the companion-way to announce the movements {{on the part of the}} sloop-of-war. He had been purposely tardy, in order to give the ship as much time as possible; but he saw by the looks of the men that a longer delay might excite suspicion.|$|E
6000|$|The {{people of}} le Feu-Follet {{were trained to}} order and {{implicit}} obedience. By this time, too, the lieutenants were among them; and the men set about doing {{as they had been}} directed. Raoul himself passed into the felucca, followed by the three men he had selected by name. The adventurers had no difficulty, as yet, in escaping the flames, though by this time they were pouring upward from the hatch in a torrent. As Raoul suspected, his cable had been grappled; and, seizing the rope, he tightened it to a severe strain, securing the in-board part. Then he passed down to the cable himself, directing his companions to hand him the rope-end of the shank-painter, which he fastened to the cable by <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> hitch. This took half a minute; in half a minute more he was on the felucca's forecastle again. Here the chain was easily passed through a hawse-hole, and a knot tied, with a marlinspike passed through its centre. To pass the fire on the return was now a serious matter; but it was done without injury, Raoul driving his companions before him. No sooner did his foot reach the bows of le Feu-Follet again than he shouted: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{trail to}} the upper range was wide and easy of ascent, the first of it winding under crags, the latter part {{climbing}} long slopes. It forked before the summit, where dark pine trees showed against the sky, one fork ascending, the other, which Piute took, beginning to go down. It admitted of no extended view, being shut in {{for the most part}} on the left, but there were times when Hare could see a curving stream of sheep on half a mile of descending trail. Once started down the flock could not be stopped, that was as plain as Piute's hard task. There were times when Hare could have tossed a pebble on the Indian just below him, yet there were more than three thousand sheep, strung out in line between them. Clouds of dust rolled up, sheets of gravel and shale rattled down the inclines, the clatter, clatter, clatter of little hoofs, the steady baa-baa-baa filled the air. Save for the crowding of lambs off the trail, and <b>a</b> <b>jamming</b> of sheep in the corners, the drive went on without mishap. Hare was glad to see the lambs scramble back bleating for their mothers, and to note that, though peril threatened at every steep turn, the steady down-flow always made space for the sheep behind. He was glad, too, when through a wide break ahead his eye followed the face of a vast cliff down to the red ground below, and he knew the flock would soon be safe on the level.|$|E
