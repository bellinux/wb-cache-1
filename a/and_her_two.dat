5|$|The first {{seaplanes}} used in combat, {{supplied by}} French manufacturer Donnet-Lévêque, were operated from Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> sisters during the blockade.

With the commissioning of these dreadnoughts, the navy shifted Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and her sisters to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|E
5|$|The ship saw {{extensive}} service during World War I, {{owing to}} the cautious strategies adopted by the Austro-Hungarian fleet and their opponents in the Triple Entente.

These operations culminated in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in May 1917, the largest naval battle of the Adriatic Campaign.
