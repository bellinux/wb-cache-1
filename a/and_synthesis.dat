5|$|Vesicles {{sent off}} by the ER {{containing}} proteins are further altered at the Golgi apparatus and then prepared for secretion from the cell or transport {{to other parts of}} the cell. Various things can happen to the proteins on their journey through the enzyme covered space of the Golgi apparatus. The modification <b>and</b> <b>synthesis</b> of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins is common in protein processing. The Golgi apparatus removes and substitutes sugar monomers, producing a large variety of oligosaccharides. In addition to modifying proteins, the Golgi also manufactures macromolecules itself. In plant cells, the Golgi produces pectins and other polysaccharides needed by the plant structure.|$|E

25|$|A vocoder, a {{portmanteau}} of {{the words}} voice and encoder, is an analysis <b>and</b> <b>synthesis</b> system, mostly used for speech. In the encoder, the input is passed through a multiband filter, each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the control signals from the envelope followers are communicated to the decoder. The decoder applies these control signals to corresponding filters in the (re)synthesizer. Research physicist Homer Dudley invented the Vocoder at Bell Labs in 1939 which served the purpose of improving the voice-carrying capabilities of his employer's telephone lines.|$|E
