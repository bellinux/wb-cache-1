40|$|For centuries the {{clinical}} and 2 ̆ 2 curative 2 ̆ 2 conception of medicine has dominated medical thought and procedure, practically {{to the exclusion}} of all other phases of this great art and science. It has been so uppermost in the minds of most medical authorities until quite recently that they were and many are today almost entirely oblivious to other potent measures and practices that so materially contribute to the well-being of the animal organism. Thus our domain of service has been rather strictly confined to diagnosing, prescribing and <b>administering</b> <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> in which a pathological state actually exists. At the same time the major problems of prevention, control, suppression, and possible eradication of disease have been blissfully ignored. This condition still exists {{in spite of the fact}} that more than three-quarters of a century of scientific research with its wealth of dependable data and derived fundamental principles has established a sound basis for the field of Veterinary Preventive Medicine. Today this should be as accurate a field of scientific endeavor as that of any other branch of veterinary medicine. Yet regrettably, the fact remains that applied scientific hygiene and preventive medicine have not kept abreast with the needs and trends of our profession...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{functional activity}} of the antimicrobial peptide M 6 in vitro and in vivo. The peptide was identified by our group by phage library selection, rational modification and synthesis in a tetrabranched form (Pini et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49 : 2665 – 72). We found that it binds lipopolysaccharide, causes perforation of cell membranes without destroying external cell morphology and strongly binds DNA. The latter feature suggests that it could inhibit metabolic pathways, blocking DNA replication and/or transcription. We also observed that M 6 does not stimulate humoral immune response when repeatedly <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> <b>animals.</b> We also analyzed M 6 toxicity when <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> by intraperitoneal or by intravenous injection, determining a preliminary LD 50 (125 and 37. 5 mg/kg, respectively), which suggested that M 6 {{could be used in}} vivo.
