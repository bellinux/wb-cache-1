Two Chinese teams, EDward Gaming and Royal Never Give Up, <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> finishing second in their groups. Cloud9 and H2k-Gaming were respectively the only North American and European teams to advance out of groups.

5|$|Desperate, yet determined, {{units of}} FANK soldiers, {{many of whom}} had run out of ammunition, dug in around the capital and fought until they were overrun as the Khmer Rouge <b>advanced.</b> <b>By</b> the last week of March 1975, {{approximately}} 40,000 communist troops had surrounded the capital and began preparing to deliver the coup de grace to about half as many FANK forces.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell also {{investigated}} the kinetic theory of gases. Originating with Daniel Bernoulli, this theory was <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> the successive labours of John Herapath, John James Waterston, James Joule, and particularly Rudolf Clausius, {{to such an}} extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as a mathematician.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{have been}} {{developed}} into {{a broad range of}} percussion instruments that are used in both Japanese folk and classical musical traditions. An early classification system based on shape and tension was <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> Francis Taylor Piggott in 1909. Taiko are generally classified based on the construction process, or the specific context in which the drum is used, but some are not classified, such as the toy den-den daiko.|$|E

By that afternoon No. 4 Commando controlled the town.|$|E
5|$|The name {{of local}} time {{typically}} changes when DST is observed. American English replaces standard with daylight: for example, Pacific Standard Time (PST) becomes Pacific Daylight Time (PDT). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> one hour is British Summer Time (BST), and British English typically inserts summer into other time zone names, e.g. Central European Time (CET) becomes Central European Summer Time (CEST).|$|E

5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar hypothesis was <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets are {{arriving in the}} inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than {{can be explained by}} the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.|$|E
5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|Although Australia {{does not}} have any nuclear power reactors, Pangea Resources {{considered}} siting an international repository in the outback of South Australia or Western Australia in 1998, but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the Australian national Senate during the following year. Thereafter, Pangea ceased operations in Australia but reemerged as Pangea International Association, and in 2002 evolved into the Association for Regional and International Underground Storage with support from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan and Switzerland. A general concept for an international repository has been <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> one of the principals in all three ventures. Russia has expressed interest in serving as a repository for other countries, but does not envision sponsorship or control by an international body or group of other countries. South Africa, Argentina and western China have also been mentioned as possible locations.|$|E

5|$|Although {{mechanisation}} of the British cavalry {{was well}} <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> 1939, {{there was still}} a 1st Cavalry Division that served in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign during the Second World War. Eventually all the cavalry regiments were mechanised and became part of the Household Cavalry and the Royal Armoured Corps. There is still one regiment that retains their horses, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which together with the Household Cavalry Regiment was formed from the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals, which was itself an amalgamation of the Royal Horse Guards (Blues) and the 1st (Royal) Dragoons.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{with the}} fission of uranium were already {{proceeding}} at universities and research institutes in the United States. Alfred Lee Loomis was supporting Ernest Lawrence at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Vannevar Bush was also doing similar {{research at the}} Carnegie Institution. At Columbia, while Fermi and Szilard investigated the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction, Dunning considered the possibility, <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> Niels Bohr and John A. Wheeler but discounted by Fermi, {{that it was the}} rare uranium-235 isotope of uranium that was primarily responsible for fission. He had Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, uranium-235 and uranium-238 using a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson counts Þorgerðr and Irpa as {{examples}} of guardian goddesses in Germanic paganism, and compares their roles {{to that of the}} dísir and valkyries. Davidson says that if Helgi is the mythical founder of Hålogaland, it would explain Þorgerðr's last name ("bride of Helgi") and that, subsequently, she would be the wife of each ruler of the kingdom in turn. Substantially the same argument has been <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> McKinnell. Davidson compares this role to accounts of kings or leaders being granted entry into Valhalla in the Viking Age, that the idea of a guardian goddess welcoming kings was essentially an aristocratic concept, and that a tradition such as this could explain noble valkyries welcoming dead kings into the after life, using the poem Hákonarmál as an example.|$|E

5|$|In 1889, William Sadler {{moved to}} Battle Creek, Michigan, {{to work at}} the Battle Creek Sanitarium, where he served as a bellhop and helped in the kitchen. He also {{attended}} Battle Creek College for one year when he was 16. Both institutions had strong ties to his church and Sadler was mentored by local Adventist businessman John Harvey Kellogg, who heavily influenced Sadler's views. Sadler's early writings about health are similar to ideas <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> John Kellogg, including the concept of autointoxication, and the idea that caffeine has negative health effects. He similarly condemned the consumption of tobacco, meat, and alcohol. Although Sadler did drink later in his life.|$|E
5|$|Ingram's refusal allowed Rossy {{to take up}} the bishopric. He was consecrated by 16 July 1380. Oswald {{launched}} an appeal to Clement, but a letter to Thomas dated 29 October 1381, confirmed this had been rejected. A further letter was sent, as follows:To the bishops of St Andrews and Dunkeld. Mandate to enquire into the claim <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> Oswald, claustral prior of Glenluys, O. Cist., Galloway diocese, to be the true bishop of Galloway in virtue of his election by the chapter of Galloway and subsequent provision made by Urban VI. They are to impose silence on him and to put Thomas de Rossy, provided to the bishopric by Clement VII and duly consecrated, into peaceful possession. The cancellation of Oswald's appointment {{does not appear to have}} silenced Oswald, who appears active in England, a kingdom which supported Urban VII.|$|E
5|$|Ranking Democratic {{committee}} member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican {{use of a}} secret hold {{to slow down the}} Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee. The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.|$|E

In Game 1 of the conference quarterfinals against the Panthers, Brodeur became only the second goaltender to record 100 playoff wins in a 3–2 Devils victory. In Game 4 with a 4–0 victory, Brodeur broke the NHL career playoff shutout record with his 24th, surpassing Roy, who had 23. The Devils <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> winning Game 7 in double overtime, after Brodeur had made 43 saves to keep his team in the contest.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive for}} Trun by Polish and Canadian Armoured Divisions began on 16 August, with {{preliminary}} attacks {{in preparation for}} an assault against Trun and Chambois. On 17 August, both armoured divisions of the Canadian 1st Army <b>advanced.</b> <b>By</b> early afternoon, the Polish 1st Armoured Division had outflanked the 12th SS Panzer Division, enabling several Polish formations to both reach the 4th Armoured Division's objectives and significantly expand the bridgehead northwest of Trun. Stanisław Maczek—the Polish divisional commander—split his forces into three battlegroups each of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion. One of these struck southwest, cutting off Trun and establishing itself on the high ground dominating {{the town and the}} Dives river valley, allowing for a powerful assault by the Canadian 4th Armoured Division on Trun. The town was liberated on the morning of 18 August.|$|E
5|$|The iron {{industry}} was pursued by both private entrepreneurs who owned their own smelters {{as well as}} government-supervised smelting facilities. The Song economy was stable enough to produce over a hundred million kilograms (over two hundred million pounds) of iron product a year. Large-scale deforestation in China would have continued {{if not for the}} 11th-century innovation of the use of coal instead of charcoal in blast furnaces for smelting cast iron. Much of this iron was reserved for military use in crafting weapons and armouring troops, but some was used to fashion the many iron products needed to fill the demands of the growing domestic market. The iron trade within China was <b>advanced</b> <b>by</b> the construction of new canals, facilitating the flow of iron products from production centres to the large market in the capital city.|$|E
