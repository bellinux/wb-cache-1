25|$|Deke Slayton, NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, never {{intended}} to rotate Cooper and Eisele to another mission, as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training, and Eisele for incidents aboard Apollo 7 and an extra-marital affair). He assigned them to the backup crew simply {{because of a lack}} of flight-qualified manpower in the Astronaut Office at the time the assignment needed to be made. Slayton felt Cooper had no more than a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command, if he did <b>an</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>job</b> with the assignment, which he did not. Despite Eisele's issues with management, Slayton always intended to assign him to a future Apollo Applications Program mission rather than a lunar mission, but this program was eventually cut down to only the Skylab component.|$|E

[...] IGN's Matt Fowler also praised Clarke and noted that Daenerys's choice to watch Viserys die was [...] "powerful" [...] and an important shift in her character.|$|E

Steenbergen noted, [...] "Bobby has been through a lot this season, and Jim Beaver has done <b>an</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>job</b> portraying his journey.

40|$|Objective: The study {{investigated}} the impact of operational work system design on staff performance in selected construction firms in Nigeria. Research Design & Methods: The study used primary data gathered {{with the use of}} a  5 -point Likert scale questionnaire format administered to 138 respondents. A hypothesis was postulated to test the significance of the research problem. Data analysis was carried out using correlation and multiple regression analysis which proved the significance of the alternative hypothesis as a result of testing the hypothesis. Findings: The findings show that there is a significant relationship between operational work system design and staff performance. The study concludes that operational job design can be advanced as a motivation tool, which is non-monetary in nature, to improve staff performance. Implications & Recommendations: A key drive to improve performance is the satisfaction of staff coupled with <b>an</b> <b>outstanding</b> operational <b>job</b> design which takes into consideration the total physical and mental well-being of staff and its interaction with other organisational factors. The study recommends, among others, that there should be active participation of staff in the design of work in the organisation.

Battalion Chief Lou Roupoli said, [...] "The pilot did <b>an</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>job.</b> He {{kept the}} plane on its rear tires {{as long as}} he could before he brought [...]" [...] When the nose gear did touch down, there were sparks and flames from it, but no {{apparent}} damage to the rest of the plane. At 6:20pm PDT (UTC-7), the aircraft came to a stop very close to the end of the 11,096-foot (3382-meter) runway 25L. In an attempt to keep the nose gear off the ground as long as possible, reverse thrust was not used to slow the aircraft. The pilots therefore used a much larger portion of the available runway than in a typical landing, stopping 1,000 feet / 305m before the end of the runway, validating the decision to divert from Long Beach, where the longest runway is 10,000 feet (3048 m).|$|E
