Herrera denied Jew's accusations, and released signed bank loan documents on which Jew had identified his address in Burlingame.

5|$|The Governor didn't {{have the}} right to make or suspend <b>any</b> <b>laws,</b> unless in cases of urgent necessity, he could do it with the consent of the Governor-General of India. He didn't have the power of {{creating}} a new office, or granting any salary, gratuity, or allowance, without the sanction of the Governor-General of India. The Governor-General had full power to superintend and control the Governor in all points relating to the civil or military administration of the Presidency, and the Governor had to obey the orders and instructions of the Governor-General in all cases. The Governors could propose to the Governor-General drafts of <b>any</b> <b>laws</b> which they thought expedient, together with their reasons for the same; and the Governor-General communicated the resolutions to the Governor, after considering the reasons. The Governors regularly transmitted to the Governor-General true copies of all orders and acts of their governments, and also advice of all matters which they felt to be communicated to the Governor-General. The powers of the Governors were not suspended when the Governor-General visited the Presidency. The departure of the Governor from India with intent to return to Europe was deemed to be a resignation from his office. Alternately, the Governor could resign by declaring it in writing and delivering it to the secretary for the public department of the Presidency.|$|E
5|$|Though Nixon {{lost much}} popular support, even {{from his own}} party, he {{rejected}} accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office. He insisted {{that he had made}} mistakes, but had no prior knowledge of the burglary, did not break <b>any</b> <b>laws,</b> and did not learn of the cover-up until early 1973. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned —unrelated to Watergate— and was convicted on charges of bribery, tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as Governor of Maryland. Nixon chose Gerald Ford, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, to replace Agnew. One researcher suggested Nixon effectively disengaged from his own administration after the swearing in of Gerald Ford as Vice President on December 6, 1973.|$|E

5|$|The câmara {{municipal}} (town council) was {{the governing}} body in {{towns and cities}} and had existed in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} the colonial period in the 16th century. The Chamber was composed of vereadores (councilmen), the number of which depended on the size of the town. Unlike the Provincial General Council, the Constitution gave town councils great autonomy. However, when the Provincial Assembly replaced the Provincial General Council in 1834, many of the powers of town councils (including the setting of municipal budgets, oversight of expenditures, creation of jobs, and the nomination of civil servants) were transferred to the provincial government. Additionally, <b>any</b> <b>laws</b> enacted by the town council had to be ratified by the Provincial Assembly—but not by Parliament. While the 1834 Additional Act granted greater autonomy to the provinces from the central government, it transferred the towns' remaining autonomy to the provincial governments. There was no office of mayor, and towns were governed by a town council and its president (who was the councilman who won the most votes during elections).|$|E

By this statute, the British Parliament had voluntarily relinquished its ability to legislate on behalf of dominions without their consent.

25|$|For longshoremen nationwide, and {{especially}} {{for those in the}} Port of New York, this was an era of great contradiction, where landmark legal advances to protect the rights and safety of workers stood {{in stark contrast to the}} actual conditions for longshoremen. The United States was the only country with a large foreign commerce without <b>any</b> <b>laws</b> to protect the safety of its longshoremen. Even the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which legalized strikes, boycotts, and peaceful picketing did little to improve actual working conditions for longshoremen.|$|E
25|$|The {{case against}} Thomas Cromwell was weak - {{it was well}} known that Cromwell favoured {{religious}} reform, though he had not proceeded any further with his program of reforms than the king would allow, and his every act had been authorised by the king.

The literary prophets indicate that adultery was a frequent occurrence, despite their strong protests against it, and these legal strictnesses.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} British colonies of the period, Queen Elizabeth II {{was the head}} of state, and The Crown was vested with the {{legislative}} authority for matters concerning executive affairs, defence and the financing of the Federation. Her representative, Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, 1st Baron Hailes, was given the title of Governor-General rather than that of Governor more typical for a British colony. The title may have reflected the federal nature of the state, or indicated the expectations that the Federation would soon become independent. The Governor-General also had the full power by the British Government to veto <b>any</b> <b>laws</b> passed by the Federation.|$|E

A draft bill establishing a court was put forward by the Commission, but it completely excluded appeals to the Privy Council, which reacted critically and prevented any serious attempts to implement the bill in London (before federation, <b>any</b> <b>laws</b> affecting all the colonies would have to be passed by the British Imperial Parliament in London).|$|E

25|$|The draft faced staunch {{opposition}} by royalist {{members of}} the convention, led by Kasem Chatikavanich. A new draft was demanded, granting the monarch greater power and increasing royal powers to the level granted by the 1949 constitution. The monarch would appoint a Senate with the countersign of the privy council president. The royal veto could be overridden only with a two-thirds majority of the combined parliament. Furthermore, the Senate could kill <b>any</b> <b>laws</b> by not voting on them for six months. Civil servants and soldiers could not become MPs, but could form {{up to half of}} the cabinet.

As a result, Tasmanian Lieutenant-Governor Colonel George Arthur could not arrest Solomon without a warrant from London. On 17 October 1828 he wrote to the Colonial Office requesting one. This warrant took 12 months to reach Tasmania. In the meantime, Solomon opened a tobacco shop/general store in Hobart's Elizabeth Street.
