5|$|Brunel died in 1859, {{without seeing}} the {{completion}} of the bridge. His colleagues in the Institution of Civil Engineers felt that completion of the Bridge would be <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> memorial, and started to raise new funds. In 1860, Brunel's Hungerford suspension bridge over the Thames in London was demolished {{to make way for a}} new railway bridge to Charing Cross railway station. Its chains were purchased for use at Clifton.|$|E

5|$|Overall, End of Ages {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. The game was judged <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> {{end to the}} series, and {{in combination with the}} other games in the series sold more than 12 million copies by November 2007.|$|E
5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 the VitrA {{brand name}} was adopted. Also, this began {{representing}} a large range of plumbing products. Another ceramic factory was then created in 1977, <b>a</b> <b>fittings</b> plant in 1979, and a tiles factory in 1991. The following year, a bathroom furniture factory was created.|$|R

5|$|After {{finishing}} top of {{the table}} {{at the end of the}} last round, they comfortably defeated the Hurricanes 33–22 in the semi-final, and went on to beat the Waratahs in the final 20–12. It was <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> way to send off long-serving coach Robbie Deans before he departed to coach Australia. It was also the last game for Crusaders stalwarts Caleb Ralph and former captain Reuben Thorne. In July that year former captain Todd Blackadder was appointed Crusaders coach, and his former teammates Mark Hammett and Daryl Gibson were appointed as assistants.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige perhaps {{came from}} Rutland, as {{he owned the}} manor of Tinwell there later in life. The Liber Eliensis claimed {{that he had been}} born by Caesarian section, but this is most likely a later {{accretion}} to his lifestory, added after his death because of efforts to have him declared a saint. The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section was a miracle, and thus <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> beginning for a future saint.|$|E
5|$|End of Ages was {{positively}} received upon release. Despite complaints such as lessened interactivity compared to previous games and poorer graphics, publications including Macworld, Computer Gaming World, and The Washington Post judged the game <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> {{end to the}} series. After End of Agess release, Cyan abruptly announced the end of software development and the layoff of most of its staff, but was able to rehire much of the development team a few weeks later. Including End of Agess sales, the Myst franchise had sold more than 12 million copies by November 2007.|$|E

5|$|Of {{greatest}} {{interest is}} the fourth composition of historical figures, {{a young man and}} a woman, which was painted on the lowest west wall of the narthex and includes inscriptions in Old Church Slavonic. The figures are painted facing the viewer. The man's red clothing is covered in pearls and double-headed eagles, and he wears an archaic-looking despot's crown on his head. In his right hand, the man holds a sceptre with a cross. He extends his hand to a woman, clad in a despotissa's attire and wearing <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> crown.|$|E
5|$|The Christians were {{alleged to}} have helped General Mathews with a sum of Rs. 3,30,000/-. Hyder summoned a Portuguese officer and several Christian priests from Mangalore to suggest the {{punishment}} for the Mangalorean Catholics for treachery. The Portuguese officer suggested {{the death penalty for}} those Catholics who helped the British, because it was <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> punishment for people who betrayed the sovereign. But Hyder exhibited a diplomatic stance and imprisoned the Christians, rather than killing them.|$|E
5|$|The Poles, {{completely}} {{surprised by}} the Swedish invasion, in September attempted a counter-offensive, but were defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Gniew. The forces required serious modernization. The Sejm passed high taxation for the defense, but collections lagged behind. The situation was partially saved by the City of Danzig, which hurriedly embarked {{on the construction of}} modern fortifications, and by Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski. The accomplished commander of the eastern borderlands fighting quickly learned the maritime affairs and contemporary methods of European warfare. Koniecpolski promoted the necessary enlargement of the naval fleet, modernization of the army, and became <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> counterbalance for the military abilities of Gustavus Adolphus.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} ship Scotia was requisitioned {{during the}} Great War, and saw {{service as a}} freighter. On 18 January 1916 she caught fire, and was burned out on a sandbank in the Bristol Channel. One hundred years after Bruce, a 2003 expedition, in a modern version of Scotia, used information collected by the SNAE {{as a basis for}} examining climate change in South Georgia during the past century. This expedition asserted that its contribution to the international debate on global warming would be <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> testament to the SNAE's pioneering research.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} plagued with {{problems}} from the outset. The first was scope. President Kennedy had begun considering {{the structure of}} his library soon after taking office, {{and he wanted to}} include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.|$|E
5|$|However, out at {{the site}} of the accident, it was {{discovered}} that the bags of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey.|$|E

5|$|In a later review, McNulty praised scenes {{like the}} one in which Sasuke admits his crimes and agrees to go to prison, as it showed {{acceptance}} of responsibility for his misdeeds. McNulty also praised Sasuke's later journey of self-redemption, as well as his decision to respond to Sakura's feelings for him before leaving. IGN's Ramsey Isler considered Sasuke's change of heart drastic, but felt it was <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> conclusion for the character after the series' events, and fit well with him once again leaving the village, this time on good terms with his friends and the village. Manga author Hiroaki Samura was pleased with Sasuke's character arc in the series, especially his influence on Naruto and {{the fact that in the}} end he returns to Konohagakure because of Naruto. While finding Sasuke's fate in the manga's ending predictable, McNulty felt that the character's monologue after his final fight with Naruto helped to show a deeper side to him.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{was among}} several authors {{who wrote about}} Florida {{following}} the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something {{that may have been}} allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.|$|E
5|$|The {{city and}} state then had to provide a location, {{and one of the}} {{promises}} the city made was to erect <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> memorial to those who served in World War I. Thus, in January 1920 a public library, St. Clair Park, University Park, and two occupied city blocks were designated as the site for the plaza, with one new building for the American Legion to use as their national headquarters, various public buildings, and a war memorial. The Indiana War Memorial Bill was passed in July 1920 and appropriated $2 million for construction and land. Work began in 1921. The {{city and state}} reached an agreement whereby the city would pay for the site and maintenance costs, while the State of Indiana would pay for the memorial's construction. The Plaza was dedicated by the Legion in November 1921 with the laying of a cornerstone from the bridge over the River Marne at Château-Thierry.|$|E
