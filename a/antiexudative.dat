40|$|The aim {{of present}} {{research}} was {{the investigation of}} antioxidant and <b>antiexudative</b> activities of the series of thiopyrano[2, 3 -d]thiazoles synthesized based on cinnamic acid amides. Methods. Organic synthesis; spectral methods; free radical scavenging assay (DPPH test); evaluation of <b>antiexudative</b> activity (carrageenan oedema model in rats). Results. The evaluation of the free radicals scavenging activity and <b>antiexudative</b> activity of series of the 2 -oxo- 5 -phenyl- 7 -aryl(hetaryl) - 3, 7 -dihydro- 2 H-thiopyrano[2, 3 -d]thiazole- 6 -carboxylic acid amides was performed. Among the tested compounds, rel-(5 R, 6 S, 7 S) -N-(4 -methylphenyl) - 7 -(4 -methylphenyl) - 2 -oxo- 5 -phenyl- 3, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydro- 2 H-thiopyrano[2, 3 -d]thiazole- 6 -carboxamide possessed {{the highest level of}} both activities. The experimental data most probably indicate a pronounced effect of methyl groups (phenyl fragments) on the realization of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and allow a suggestion about the antiradical mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the target compounds. Conclusions. The anti-inflammatory and free radicals scavenging activities of some tiopyrano[2, 3 -d]thiazoles have been established and the most active compounds were identified. Some findings of the structure-activity relationship were set up. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} effects of - (KOR), - (DOR), and -opioid {{receptor}} (MOR) agonists on the inhibition of plasma extravasation during acute and chronic intestinal inflammation in mice. The <b>antiexudative</b> effects of KOR and DOR agonists in animals treated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors and their protein levels in the gut (whole jejunum and mucosa) and spinal cord of mice with chronic intestinal inflammation were also measured. Inflammation was induced by the intragastric administration of one (acute) or two (chronic) doses of croton oil. Plasma extravasation was measured using Evans blue and protein levels by Western blot and immunoprecipitation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: to perform the {{pharmacological}} screening of 49 sulphamoil derivatives of the haloid-benzoic and pheny-anthranilic acids, to select the most active substances for the preclinic study, to investigate its specific activity, acute and chronic toxicity. For the first time, the dependence of the pharmacological activity on the chemical structure of the sulphamoil derivatives of the bensoic and phenyl-anthranilic acids has been studied. First, the specific activity and chronic toxicity of the selected compounds has been studied, and its harmfulness has been determined. The expressed anti-inaflammatory, analgetic, febrifugal activity of the alumetoxophenylan, selected {{in the course of}} the pharmacological screening, has been detected. Some mechanisms of the <b>antiexudative</b> action and the influence of the alumetoxiphenylan on the functions of the vitally important organs and systems of the laboratory amimals organs have been studied.

Specifically, they cause the direct impact on the concrements formation. The search of drugs which would contain high biological compounds of plant origin is an actual issue of modern pharmacology. The aim of investigation was to study the anti-inflammatory activity of the new combined drug of urolytolytic action, which includes the total plant extract and succinate buffer complex. Materials and methods: aseptic exudative inflammation was caused by subplantar introduction of 0, 1 ml of 1 % solution of Î»-karahenin in the right hind paw of rats, the investigated drug was administered at doses 1, 2 and 4 ml/kg. The influence of the studied drug was evaluated in terms of swelling limbs volume. It is shown that the severity of <b>antiexudative</b> action of flarosukcine had dose-dependent nature, increasing from dose of 1, 0 ml/kg to 2, 0 ml/kg (by 5, 5 %). Further dose increase to 4, 0 ml/kg, was not defined by significant increase of activity. Anti-inflammatory activity of the drug ranged from 25 to 33 %, which can be regarded as quite distinct, since in pharmacological study of anti-inflammatory drugs pharmacological activity level of at least 20 % is significant...|$|E
40|$|ABESTRACT: Introduction & objective: Inflammation {{is a body}} {{defensive}} {{response to}} the endogenous and exogenous stimulators such as chemical, radiation, trauma and invasive microorganism, which result pain and tissue necrosis. There are many natural and synthetic drugs for treatment of inflammation and {{lot of them are}} under investigation. Sodium valporate is an antiepileptic drug used particularly in the treatment of primary generalized seizure notably absence, myocolonic seizure, acute manic phase of bipolar disorder and prophylaxis of migraine. The previous observations showed sodium valporate increases level of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) in the central and peripheral nervous system. In acute inflammation, GABA showed a significant attenuation of paw edema and nociception. The aim of this study was evaluation of anti-inflammatory effect of sodium valporate. Materials & Methods: In order to evaluated the anti-inflammatory and <b>antiexudative</b> of sodium valporate doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg were investigated on rat paw edema that induced by carrageenan. In addition, the plasma leakage in the inflamed tissue was evaluated by application of trypan blue as intravenous injection. Dexamethason was used as positive control. Results: Results showed sodium valporate doses of 400 and 600 mg/kg decreased inflammatory and exudative effect as compared to control group. Conclusion: Although the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of this drug were not evident but we can say sodium valporate in addition to already proved effects has anti-inflammatory effect...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{traffic and}} {{activation}} of eosinophils in asthmatic airways {{are thought to}} take place during the late-phase allergic reaction. The present study tests the hypothesis that when eosinophils {{are present in the}} tissue before allergen exposure, as in chronically inflamed asthmatic airways, acute anaphylactic reactions initiate an eosinophil response. Using a guinea-pig allergic model, where eosinophilia is present at baseline conditions, the traffic of resident eosinophils was examined in vivo immediately after allergen challenge. By 2 min after challenge, eosinophils had moved up to apical epithelial positions. Within 10 min, a marked migration of eosinophils into the airway lumen was demonstrated. Along with the allergen-induced egression of eosinophils, acute luminal entry of plasma proteins and eotaxin occurred. Eosinophil egression was effectively inhibited by the <b>antiexudative</b> drug formoterol, whereas the proexudative drug bradykinin could in naive animals evoke a prompt luminal entry of eosinophils. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that acute allergic reactions initiate a prompt transepithelial migration of resident eosinophils. Our data further suggest that this response in part is initiated by the plasma exudation response, which may alter the transepithelial gradient of eosinophil chemoattractants including eotaxin. We propose that prompt eosinophil response is a significant component of the acute phase of allergic reactions when occurring in airways where these cells are already present in the mucosa...|$|E
40|$|Three {{aspects of}} airway {{inflammation}} in asthma were investigated in this thesis: proof of concept, monitoring and management. In chapter 2 is shown that IL- 5 is mainly {{effective in the}} circulation. In chapter 3 is shown that steroids improve airway hyperresponsiveness, sputum eosinophils, and NO. The changes were not related. This suggests that these markers may provide different information when monitoring anti-inflammatory treatment in asthma. In chapter 4 is shown that alpha- 2 -macroglobulin is an appropriate marker for measuring microvascular leakage in sputum. This "dual induction" model may used when testing the <b>antiexudative</b> effect of drugs. Chapter 5 demonstrated that the annual decline in FEV 1 is related with CD 8 + cells. This suggests that inflammatory phenotypes in asthma may have prognostic relevance. In chapter 6 is shown that PEF-variability provides information about asthma severity. Therefore, the current guidelines {{for the treatment of}} asthma can be improved by including PEF-variability. In chapter 7 is shown that anti-IgE improves PEF, diminishes allergen responses and is paralleled by a reduction in eosinophils in biopsies and sputum and a decline in IgE+ cells. This suggests that the clinical benefits of anti-IgE in asthma may be explained by a decrease in eosinophilic inflammation and IgE bearing cells. Promotor: P. J. Sterk, K. F.

40|$|Microvascular leakage is an {{important}} feature of inflammation. However, the assessment of vascular leakage has seldom been used to monitor airway inflammation in asthma. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of inhaled substance P, a potent neurokinin 1 (NK 1) agonist and mediator of plasma extravasation, on markers of microvascular leakage in induced sputum from patients with asthma. In a crossover study, sputum was induced before and 30 minutes after inhalation of substance P or neurokinin A (as control) by 12 subjects with atopic and mild, steroid-naive asthma. The levels of alpha 2 -macroglobulin, ceruloplasmin, albumin, and fibrinogen were determined in induced sputum as markers of leakage. Substance P induced a significant increase in the levels of alpha 2 -macroglobulin, ceruloplasmin, and albumin in induced sputum (median fold change, 3. 1, 2. 2, and 2. 9, respectively) (p 0. 31). The increase in sputum leakage markers was not associated with the cumulative dose of substance P (p > 0. 12). These results indicate that NK 1 receptor stimulation causes a rapid increase in microvascular leakage as shown in induced sputum in patients with asthma. This investigational model of "dual induction" (first leakage, then sputum) may therefore be useful to test the <b>antiexudative</b> effect of newly develop drugs, such as NK 1 antagonist...|$|E
40|$|Mucosal {{exudation}} of nonsieved bulk plasma is a {{key feature}} of airway defense and inflammation. We have previously observed in guinea pig tracheobronchial airways that endogenous nitric oxide (NO) of the mucosa may tonically suppress the permeability of the subepithelial microcirculation, and that topical administration of the NO donor nitroprusside may reduce plasma exudation responses. The present study examines whether nitroprusside affects histamine-induced mucosal exudation of plasma in the human nasal airway. In a dose-finding tolerability experiment, using changes in nasal patency as response, placebo and nitroprusside (1. 2 and 3. 6 mg per nasal cavity) were applied on the mucosal surface with a nasal-spray device. Nasal peak expiratory flow (PEF) rates were measured before the application and thereafter every third minute for 15 min. Nitroprusside produced a dose-dependent decrease in nasal PEF rates compared to placebo. Placebo or nitroprusside (7. 2 mg) was then given to the right nasal cavity, followed 3 min later by challenge with saline or histamine (600 micrograms). The drug and the challenge were both applied with a nasal-spray device. With a nasal pool-device, the same {{large part of the}} nasal mucosal surface was lavaged before and after the treatment/challenge. The lavage fluid levels of alpha 2 -macroglobulin were measured as an index of mucosal exudation of bulk plasma. The histamine-induced lavage fluid level of alpha 2 -macroglobulin was significantly higher after treatment with placebo than with nitroprusside. The present data indicate that nitroprusside may have <b>antiexudative</b> effects in human airways. Hence, unlike other microvascular permeability active agents, this pharmacologic principle may be active in both guinea pig and human airways...|$|E
40|$|In their {{structure}} pyrimidin- 4 -one derivatives {{are similar}} to the endogenous nitrogen bases. This makes it possible to predict a wide range of pharmacological activities characteristic for them. The compounds of this series exhibit neurotropic, immunotropic, actoprotective, hypotensive, antihypoxic, anti-infl ammatory and antioxidant activity. Within this framework, the search for and creation of highly effective and safe anti-infl ammatory drugs in the series of N-arylpyrimidin- 4 (1 H) -one is of great current interest. The aim of the work is to carry out predictive studies and targeted synthesis of N-substituted derivatives of pyrimidine- 4 (1 H) -one with anti-infl ammatory activity, as well as toconfi rm the validity of their molecular construction by the results of pharmacological tests. Materials and methods. The research was carried out using the logical-structural approach and information technologies. The computer analysis of biological activity was carried out by the PASS program. Synthesis of the target compounds was carried out using a modifi ed procedure. The structure of the synthesized compounds was confi rmed by 1 H NMR, IR and UV spectroscopy. The investigation of the anti-infl ammatory effect of the synthesized compounds was carried out on the model of acute aseptic infl ammation. The synthesized substances were injected intraperitoneally, the magnitude of the edema was the criterion for evaluating the anti-infl ammatory activity. Results and discussion. In the course of the research {{on the basis of the}} logico-structural approach, hydroxyphenyl and alkyl derivatives of pyrimidin- 4 (1 H) -one with anti-infl ammatory properties were validated. A preliminary analysis of the pharmacological properties of the predicted structures was carried out using the PASS program and the most promising compounds were selected. To synthesize the tolyl and hydroxyphenyl derivatives of pyrimidin- 4 (1 H) -one, a modifi ed procedure was used. Its essence consists in the use of catalytic amounts of dimethylsulfoxide in order to increase the nucleophilicity of the amine component of the reaction. In order to confi rm the reliability and expediency of the molecular construction, the <b>antiexudative</b> activity of the target compounds was studied. Conclusion. The results of pharmacological studies indicate the prospect of searching for and creating new biologically active compounds having anti-infl ammatory activity among the tolyl and hydroxyphenyl derivatives of pyrimidin- 4 (1 H) -one. </p...|$|E
