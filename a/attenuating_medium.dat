In addition to the P-wave related medium parameters, shear wave parameters are also present in the complex eikonal equation needed to describe the P-wave complex-valued traveltime in an <b>attenuating</b> orthorhombic <b>medium,</b> which increases the complexity of using the P-wave traveltime to invert for the medium parameters in practice. Here, we use the acoustic assumption to derive an acoustic eikonal equation that approximately governs the complex-valued traveltime of P-waves in an <b>attenuating</b> orthorhombic <b>medium.</b> For a homogeneous attenuating orthorhombic media, we solve the eikonal equation using a combination of the perturbation method and Shanks transform. For a horizontal attenuating orthorhombic layer, both the real and imaginary part of the complex-valued reflection traveltime have nonhyperbolic behaviors in terms of the source-receiver offset. Similar to the roles of normal moveout (NMO) velocity and anellipticity, the attenuation NMO velocity and the attenuation anellipticity characterize the variation of the imaginary part of the complex-valued reflection traveltime around zero source-receiver offset...|$|R

However, the extent of striatal DN-TNF gene transfer achieved in our studies was not sufficient to achieve robust effects on neuroinflammation, rescue degenerating MSNs or improve motor function in treated mice.

Presently, there is no well developed method of determining blood composition non-invasively. This projects hopes to use ultrasound and Doppler signals to evaluate the characteristic of hematocrit, the percentage by volume of red blood cells within whole blood. These non-invasive techniques may also be developed to be used on earth for trauma patients where invasive measure might be detrimental. Computational modeling is a useful tool for collecting preliminary information and predictions for the laboratory research.

These physiological effects have been ascertained through in vitro treatment of cells with Na 2 S or NaHS, both of which are precursors of H 2 S. Since H 2 S exists as HS− in a neutral solution, a disulfide compound such as cystine could react with HS− in culture medium {{as well as in the}} cell. This study demonstrated that after the addition of Na 2 S solution into culture medium, HS− was transiently generated and disappeared immediately through the reaction between HS− and cystine to form cysteine persulfides and polysulfides in the culture medium (bound sulfur mixture: BS-Mix). Furthermore, we found that the addition of Na 2 S solution resulted in an increase of intracellular cysteine persulfide levels in SH-SY 5 Y cells. This alteration in intracellular persulfide was also observed in cystine-free medium. Considering this reaction of HS− as a precursor of BS-Mix, we highlighted the cytoprotective effect of Na 2 S on human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells against methylglyoxal (MG) -induced toxicity. BS-Mix produced with Na 2 S in cystine-containing medium provided SH-SY 5 Y cells significant protective effect against MG-induced toxicity.

On larger scales, we observe shoreline recession between ISS and RADAR images of Ontario Lacus, the largest lake in Titan’s south polar region. The recession, occurring between June 2005 and July 2009, is inversely proportional to slopes estimated from altimetric profiles and the exponential decay of near-shore backscatter, consistent with a uniform reduction of 4 ± 1. 3 m in lake depth. Of the potential explanations for observed surface changes, we favor evaporation and infiltration. The disappearance of dark features and the recession of Ontario’s shoreline represents volatile transport in an active methane-based hydrologic cycle. Observed loss rates are compared and shown to be consistent with available global circulation models. To date, no unambiguous changes in lake level have been observed between repeat images in the north polar region, although further investigation is warranted. These observations constrain volatile flux rates in Titan’s hydrologic system and demonstrate that the surface plays an active role in its evolution.
