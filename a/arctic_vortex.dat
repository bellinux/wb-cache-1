50|$|When the <b>Arctic</b> <b>vortex</b> {{is at its}} strongest, {{there is}} a single vortex, but normally, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>vortex</b> is {{elongated}} in shape, with two cyclone centers, one over Baffin Island in Canada and the other over northeast Siberia. When the Arctic pattern is at its weakest, subtropic air masses can intrude poleward causing the Arctic air masses to move equatorward, as during the Winter 1985 Arctic outbreak. The Antarctic polar vortex is more pronounced and persistent than the Arctic one. In the Arctic the distribution of land masses at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere gives rise to Rossby waves which contribute to the breakdown of the polar vortex, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere the vortex is less disturbed. The breakdown of the polar vortex is an extreme event known as a sudden stratospheric warming, here the vortex completely breaks down and an associated warming of 30-50 °C (54-90 °F) over a few days can occur.|$|E

Within {{the framework of the}} second European stratospheric arctic and midlatitude experiment (SESAME) the Juelich research center in cooperation with the university of California at Irvine performed on 3 February 1995 balloon borne in-situ measurements in the <b>Arctic</b> polar <b>vortex</b> using a combined payload, which allowed for the simultaneous observation of long-lived trace gases, chlorine containing source gases, ozone and the halogen radicals ClO and BrO, which participate in catalytic cycles leading to ozone loss. Between 19 - 23 km a layer of enhanced ClO mixing ratios with maximum values of 1150 pptv was observed with BrO mixing ratios of #propor to# 10 pptv nearly independent of altitude. The observations show for the first time an anticorrelation between ClO and O_ 3 in the <b>Arctic</b> polar <b>vortex,</b> similar to the one observed over Antarctica as early as 1987, which was a key evidence in linking halogen oxides with ozone loss. The data set obtained during the balloon flight is analyzed with regard to the following aspects. The observed enhanced ClO/Cl_y ratio of 0. 4 in this layer compared to 0. 05 typical for out-of-vortex conditions indicates chlorine activation in the <b>Arctic</b> polar <b>vortex</b> in the winter 1994 / 95.

50|$|The {{breakup of}} the {{northern}} polar vortex occurs between mid March to mid May. This event signifies the transition from winter to spring, and has impacts on the hydrological cycle, growing seasons of vegetation, and overall ecosystem productivity. The timing of the transition also influences changes in sea ice, ozone, air temperature, and cloudiness. Early and late polar breakup episodes have occurred, due to variations in the stratospheric flow structure and upward spreading of planetary waves from the troposphere. As a result of increased waves into the vortex, the vortex experiences more rapid warming than normal, resulting in an earlier breakup and spring. When the breakup comes early, it is characterized by with persistent of remnants of the vortex. When the breakup is late, the remnants dissipate rapidly. When the breakup is early, there is one warming period from late February to middle March. When the breakup is late, there are two warming periods, one January, and one in March. Zonal mean temperature, wind, and geopotential height exert varying deviations from their normal values before and after early breakups, while the deviations remain constant before and after late breakups. Scientists are connecting a delay in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>vortex</b> breakup with a reduction of planetary wave activities, few stratospheric sudden warming events, and depletion of ozone.|$|E

The diagnostics offer a novel view of the well-known differences in the climatological structure of the polar vortices. Although both vortices form in autumn to early winter, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>vortex</b> has a shorter life span and breaks down over {{a month before the}} Antarctic vortex. There are substantial differences in the distortion of the vortices from zonal symmetry; the <b>Arctic</b> <b>vortex</b> is displaced farther off the pole and is more elongated than the Antarctic vortex. While there is a midwinter minimum in the distortion of the Antarctic vortex, the distortion of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>vortex</b> increases during its life cycle. There are also large differences in the interannual variability of the vortices: the variability of the Antarctic vortex is small except during the spring vortex breakdown, whereas the <b>Arctic</b> <b>vortex</b> is highly variable throughout its life cycle, particularly in late winter. The diagnostics also reveal features not apparent in previous studies. There are periods when there are large zonal shifts (westward then eastward) in the climatological locations of the vortices: early winter for the <b>Arctic</b> <b>vortex,</b> and late winter to spring for the Antarctic vortex. Also, there are two preferred longitudes of the center of the lower-stratospheric <b>Arctic</b> <b>vortex</b> in early winter, and the vortex may move rapidly from one to the other.

40|$|The wintertime <b>Arctic</b> stratospheric polar <b>vortex</b> has {{weakened}} {{over the}} past three decades, and consequently cold surface air from high latitudes is now more likely to move into the middle latitudes. However, it is not known if the location of the polar vortex has also experienced a persistent change in response to Arctic climate change and whether any changes in the vortex position have implications for the climate system. Here, through the analysis of various data sets and model simulations, we show that the <b>Arctic</b> polar <b>vortex</b> shifted persistently towards the Eurasian continent and away from North America in February {{over the past}} three decades. This shift is found to be closely related to the enhanced zonal wavenumber- 1 waves in response to Arctic sea-ice loss, particularly over the Barents–Kara seas (BKS). Increased snow cover over the Eurasian continent may also have contributed to the shift. Our analysis reveals that the vortex shift induces cooling over some parts of the Eurasian continent and North America which partly offsets the tropospheric climate warming there in the past three decades. The potential vortex shift in response to persistent sea-ice loss in the future, and its associated climatic impact, deserve attention to better constrain future climate changes...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} 20 years, {{a hole in}} the ozone layer has formed each spring over Antarctica when {{sunlight}} returns to the polar region. Similar albeit far less extensive ozone destruction has also been observed in the <b>Arctic</b> polar <b>vortex</b> after colder than average winters. Since the <b>Arctic</b> polar <b>vortex</b> is less stable and therefore warmer than its southern counterpart, total depletion of ozone has however not occurred in the northern hemisphere. To quantify the depletion of polar ozone it is necessary to somehow follow air-masses in the stratosphere so their ozone concentrations can be measured at consecutive times. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how polar ozone depletion can be mapped and quantified by assimilating ozone data from satellites into an off-line wind driven non-dispersive transport model. With access to a large set of satellite data, assimilated fields can be built up that are far less noisy than the individual satellite ozone profiles. The transported fields can subsequently be compared to later sets of incoming satellite data so that the rates and geographical distribution of ozone depletion can be determined. To accomplish this strategy a low-diffusive transport and assimilation model DIAMOND, (Dynamical Isentropic Assimilation Model for OdiN Data) has been developed. It has been used to study Antarctic as well as Arctic polar ozone destruction by assimilating ozone profiles from the ENVISAT/MIPAS and Odin/SMR satellite-instruments.

A peak Antarctic CO VMR of 60 ppbv (where 1 ppbv = 10 (- 9) per unit volume) was measured at a potential temperature (Theta) of 710 K (similar to 27 km), about 1 km below the altitude of a pocket of elevated NOy (total reactive nitrogen) at a deep minimum in N 2 O (< 5 ppbv). The Arctic observations also show a region of elevated vortex CO with a peak VMR of 90 ppbv at 630 - 670 K (similar to 25 km) but no corresponding enhancement in NOy, perhaps because of stronger dynamical activity in the northern hemisphere polar winter and/or interannual variability {{in the production of}} mesospheric NO.

Ejection of vortex air and entrainment of mid-latitude air into the vortex are quantified and compared with climatological values obtained from the analysis of 16 Arctic winters. A number of unusual features of both winters are discussed. The most notable features are the anomalous isolation experienced by the vortex during December 1992 and the unusual degree of isolation and persistence of the vortex during February and March of both years. the 1992 - 1993 winter season is the most consistently isolated vortex on record. Only during January 1993, when entrainment is large, is this pattern of extreme isolation broken...|$|R
