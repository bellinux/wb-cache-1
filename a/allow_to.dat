5|$|Differential {{fields are}} fields {{equipped}} with a derivation, i.e., <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> take derivatives of elements in the field. For example, the field R(X), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to differential Galois theory, a variant of Galois theory dealing with linear differential equations.|$|E
