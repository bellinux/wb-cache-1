40|$|There is {{overwhelming}} consensus among language learning researchers {{on the benefits}} of developing an autonomous approach by learners (Hurd et al. 2001, p 344). Despite the difficulty in defining what Little (2004) describes as a "problematic term" and a "slippery concept", he suggests there is also broad agreement on what this means. Autonomous learners "understand the purpose of their learning programme, explicitly accept responsibility for their learning, share in the setting of goals, take initiatives in planning and executing learning and evaluate its effectiveness" (Little 2004). However, it is also argued (e. g. by Candy 1991; Little 1995) that the achievement of learner autonomy depends on the willingness of teachers to hand over these responsibilities. Teachers must be committed to creating a learning environment where learners can gradually "learn how to learn" and experience autonomy in order to become more autonomous, a process which Little (2004) calls "autonomisation". In distance learning, much of the responsibility for <b>autonomisation</b> rests with the teaching/learning materials. However, these materials are often mediated and supported by tutors who can use their contact with learners to develop learning skills.

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{study of}} the organisational changes of the State of welfare since the 1980 s in Germany, Britain, France and Italy suggests a convergent and consistent process of homogenisation driven chiefly by institutional mimetic isomorphism. This new ‘organisational settlement’ is increasingly shaped by the structural <b>autonomisation</b> of individual service delivery units. This paper argues that, when organisational autonomy becomes normatively sanctioned, that this {{increases the likelihood of}} its adoption, {{even in the face of}} different institutional conditions and welfare regimes. Hence, the paper is foremost concerned with explaining similarities and decreasing variance across countries and across sectors, and with accounting for the main driver of this homogenisation process. Why would different organisational fields across countries and welfare regimes adopt similar structures, in light of inconclusive evidence of economic efficiency gains? The convergence of the organisational settlement of the welfare delivery state is not only driven by economic globalisation or efficiency linked to performance, but primarily by the political demand to find new sources of legitimation in an age of increasing displacement of political authority to managers. The paper is structured in three main parts. First, it revisits the theory of organisational isomorphism by its application to the new patterns of change of welfare delivery. Secondly, it discusses the reform trajectories of <b>autonomisation</b> in schooling and hospital care in Britain, in comparative terms with France and Italy. Thirdly, it concentrates on Germany and it establishes empirically how this case does no longer fit the characterisation of ‘immobilisme’, especially in the health care sector. Lastly, the wider implications of organisational homogenisation for the TRUDI constellation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{begins with}} a {{critique}} of G. A. Cohen's power-oriented account of the economic 'basis' and his claim that the 'superstructure' is functionally explained. Thereafter, Marx's writings are interrogated in chronological order, focusing on The German Ideology, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte and the Capital volumes and drafts. An alternative interpretation of the basis and superstructure metaphor is proposed in light of a three-way distinction, first outlined in The German Ideology, between material production, customary consciousness and non-economic labour. Material production, the system of interactional production relations, sustains a kind of linguistic reflection by economic agents on their practice which imposes limits on non-economic labour. The 'idealistic superstructure', a term which Marx adopts in response to Stirner's account of 'hierarchy', consists of the formulation and implementation of 'universal' notions. It arises once material production is 'autonomised', only disappearing entirely in 'developed' communism. One may distinguish between the technical autonomisatlon of material production, individuals' perpetuated engagement in a division of labour, and their formal <b>autonomisation,</b> the confinement to an economic class. Technical <b>autonomisation</b> establishes a 'contradiction' between particular and commonÃ‚Â·interests, which results in conflict, {{at the same time}} as it sustains customary beliefs in 'universal' notions whose organised assertion may hold this conflict in check. In the case of modern society, the only specific case Marx outlines, the generalisation of commodity exchange is the root of customary notions of abstract equality and individualistic freedom which provide the resources for the construction of a 'Rechtsstaat'.

40|$|This article {{provides}} a comparative analysis {{of two major}} developments in health policy: the <b>autonomisation</b> of the patient and regulation by demand. The first tendency consists in shift towards understanding the patient as an autonomous actor. In practice, this tendency has manifested itself through the adoption of patients? rights to information as well as demands for a further right to informed consent. At the same time, economic policy emphasises the importance of demand in the regulation of spending on healthcare. These developments suggest the emergence of healthcare consumers. This further assumes a sovereign consumer who is fully informed and evaluates standardised health products (basket of treatments) and services (doctors, insurance).

Public management literature raises questions concerning the rationale behind agencification and how this public management reform is being implemented in Sub Sahara African countries where the NPM ideology is foreign. This study explored how the development of Technical Education Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training Authority (TEVETA) can be interpreted {{from the perspective of the}} agencification of quality assurance in the TEVETA sector in Zambia. The study focused on four main issues namely: (i) establishment of TEVETA (ii) organisation and governance of TEVETA (iii) funding of TEVETA and (iv) internal and external change drivers. To undertake this study, a qualitative research strategy was employed and the study used document review and semi structured interview guides as means of data collection. The study argues that TEVETA is a product of the Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training (TEVET) reforms of the 1990 s which swept across the country and was supported by Brentwood institutions namely the World Bank and IMF. Following the liberalisation of the economy, TEVETA was established to meet the needs of the local environment and the parastatal companies. It was established through the act of parliament, with a mandate to regulate, co-ordinate and monitor Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training. TEVETA is governed by a board of directors who serve tenures of three years and are appointed by the Minister of Education, Science Vocational Training and Early Education (MESVTEE) in accordance to the TEVET act. The Government of Republic of Zambia (GRZ) is the main source of funding at TEVETA and the current level of public funding to TEVETA is inconsistent and insufficient and has not grown to match up with the current demands of the TEVET sector in the country. The study argues that TEVETA operates with low levels of <b>autonomisation</b> with insufficient resources. Based on these study findings, the study recommends that if TEVETA is granted the levels of <b>autonomisation</b> and resources it requires fully, then it can gratify its mandate completely...|$|E

The history of the use of authentic materials is characterised by an evolution towards total responsibility by learners for both the choice of materials and the type of use they put them to (accompanied by a shift in meaning whereby authenticity comes to apply more to what the learner does than to the origin of materials). The strategy of using exercises ready-prepared by teachers, whilst still in existence, can be brought into question, at least in part, according to the types of learner and the technological possibilities available, including Internet. We consider that the use of authentic materials can lead to the development not only of linguistic but also methodological <b>autonomisation</b> in learning...|$|E

The 1973 {{diagnosis}} of a crisis in 18 th-century study and the present debate about the Enlightenment {{as a set of}} cultural and political orientations within modernity are here set in tension. Key themes of the contemporary debate are the critique of universalism as a façade of power and of Enlightenment visions of rationality and subjectivity as dominatory. Parts of this critique rely on 19 th-century aesthetic modernism, which is influential today and threatens, {{in the name of the}} particular, any possibility of universalisation. This aesthetic dimension should be rehistoricised through a reflection on the <b>autonomisation</b> of the aesthetic as a social function. Thus the constitution of cultural objects and practices, raised in DHS 5, remains central.

40|$|The {{reintroduction}} {{of local}} self-government {{at the level}} of communes (gminy) in 1990 opened the way for an in-depth reform of the local governance framework in Poland. This included not only the legal, organizational and fiscal <b>autonomisation</b> of local communities, but also went in line with general trends concerning the transformation of the public sector. Therefore, among the core elements of the transformation we may identify the extensive privatization of the public service provision schemes. In Poland, this process was not based on the theoretical background of New Public Management, {{as was the case in}} a number of Western countries. Instead, it was natural consequence of the rebirth of a market economy with a limited public sector and the intense development of the private market. Those trends were, however, compatible with the NPM programme. The expansion of market-based mechanisms in public service delivery is one of its pillars. This article provides a historical overview of the development of market-based arrangements in public service provision at the most basic level of Polish local government.

Yet, the blurred position of the Endowment has also catalysed a constellation of interests and divergent approaches related to the mere methods and objectives of democratisation policies (regime change vs. incremental transformation, empowering subjects vs. democratising institutions, visibility vs. discrete operations).

In addition to these two major points, the analysis by category of the body of results shows principally that in qualitative terms, the factors of <b>autonomisation</b> for online learning are interconnected and include: the difficulties related to distance learning and the strategies that learners develop to face those difficulties, the importance of interpersonal relationships in social and emotional terms in overcoming those difficulties, the specific modes of sociability developed for distance learning and the related development of a new type of autonomy that is both individual and collective.

40|$|Disaggregation and <b>autonomisation</b> {{of public}} service {{procurement}} {{have been at the}} cutting edge for the last two to three decades, not least due to the importance that reform programmes inspired by New Public Management (NPM) have acquired. This development has led to widespread corporatisation and increasing emphasis on leadership and managerial freedom. In this article, we explore the role of leadership in the transformation of municipal waste management in a Norwegian municipality from an entity tightly integrated in the hierarchical system of local government to a separate, private law corporation, though still under the full ownership of the municipality. The trajectory has been influenced by developments in international waste markets and by changes in EU and national law, and it includes conspicuous technological innovations, some developed locally and others adopted from the wider waste management industry. What appears especially interesting in the case we have studied is the relatively successful and rapid transition from an identity as a municipal organisation to that of a new corporate organisation. Our focus on the “how” and “why” issues of this transition favours a design based on a single case study. When approaching the “how” issues we draw on an analytical framework laid down by Ibarra et al. (2010). However, {{when it comes to the}} important “why” issues, we find Selznick’s notion of institutional leadership (1957 / 1984) remains beneficial...|$|E
40|$|The repressive {{mechanisms}} of collective memory {{have been the}} subject of a fierce debate in the human sciences - especially, but not exclusively, in the study of nationalism. This paper re-investigates the nature of national memory in the context of European nationalisms by drawing on contemporary national cases of remembering and forgetting. The explored instances are mobilized in the study of remembering/forgetting on a factual, rather than ideal level. Theoretically, it is argued that the Habermassian call for fostering ‘anamnestic solidarity’ with the past often fails in practice because of its normative undertones that disagree with Realpolitic demands. This is so because nationalist discourse, which serves to preserve the political interests of the national community, has to present itself to political forces that reside outside the community as a closed, autopoetic system akin to that theorized by Niklas Luhmann. Although the Luhmannian thesis (which would gesture towards the <b>autonomisation</b> of national memory) also fails to explain the nature of nationalist remembering/forgetting tout court, it allows more space for an exploration of nationalist self-presentation than Habermas’ normative stance. The argument in this study, which combines an appreciation of hermeneutics and autopoeia, is that the practice of (re) producing the ‘nation’s’ solitary amnesia enables nationalist discourse to respond to external political pressures. This presents the latter as a dialogical/hermeneutic project despite its solipsistic ‘façade’...|$|E
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} a {{particular}} group of arm’s length public service providers in the Netherlands, Zelfstandige Bestuursorganen [ZBO]. A ZBO provides authoritative services outside the hierarchical structure of government. Autonomy and control on ZBOs has been debated for some 30 years and {{has resulted in a}} new form of standard legislation by 2008. Control of arm’s length organisations is not a particular Dutch issue, but is found in many other countries as well. The key issue in the study is whether or not legal and economic control tools imposed upon ZBOs by minister and Parliament match each other. If a mismatch is observed, actual control might be more or less restrictive than required for the services to be delivered. The main conclusion from the research is that in only 1 case, legal and economic control tools match both by design as well as in practice. In two other cases a match was observed in practice. Particularly the income transfer ZBOs were faced with restrictive legal control tools, whereas monitoring ZBOs had more degrees of freedom but most of them also faced more legal controls than might be expected from an economic perspective. Although the study does not allow for full generalisations, it was also observed that the intended improvement of information provision towards Parliament based on new legislation has not been realised. Furthermore it was observed that Minister-Principals do not act consistently both within their own ministry {{as well as on the}} level of central government as a whole. The study concludes with some recommendations on improved information provision, legislation and a model that contributes to decision making in case of <b>autonomisation</b> of public services...|$|E
40|$|The paper first {{considers}} the {{the implication of}} Bourdieu’s philosophy of social science {{for the analysis of}} the trans-national transfer of his work. It then attempts to chart the interaction between Bourdieu’s French production and the English-language reception within the United Kingdom. It does so by following his production in chronological sequence and by attempting to insert the emergence of his “English identity” into the same biographical time-line, focusing on successive decades. In spite of the shift in Bourdieu’s production from the field of anthropology to that of sociology in the 1960 s, his work was mainly known at the time in the UK as the product of a new field of “Mediterranean” anthropology. The sociological work of the 1960 s in respect of students and their studies was received in the UK in the 1970 s as the sociology of education whilst the analyses of photography and art galleries was not received in the UK as sociology of culture until the late 1980 s. In both cases, the demarcations in the institutionalised fields of reception concealed the extent to which Bourdieu’s work had defied these sub-categorisations of sociology precisely so as to resist the development of an a-social <b>autonomisation</b> of cultural artefacts and to insist that sociological analyses should take account of the power of symbolic interaction. Proceeding chronologically, the paper emphasizes the importance for the intellectual field of reception of changes in the institutional structure of British universities after 1970, and also discusses the impact on the reception of Bourdieu’s work of the phase of “postmodern” enthusiasm in which the commodification of Bourdieu’s texts neutralised their intended political effects. Finally, the paper touches on the author’s own participation from 1990 in the reception and interpretation of Bourdieu’s texts in the UK and concludes with some comments on the contemporary struggle to appropriate Bourdieu’s post mortem reputation...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{influence}} of religious interpretations {{and the study of}} political print sources, recent historiography challenges the 'traditional' balance of power-concept to frame the Utrecht and Baden peace treaties. My contribution contests this position, from a contextual legal history point of view, combining primary sources (diplomatic correspondence), legal doctrine and 'publick treaties'. The Peace of Utrecht had to solve the legal quarrel of the Spanish Succession, before anything else. Antagonist, absolute and private law-based arguments put forward throughout the 17 th century had to make place for political bargaining in treaties. This evolution represented {{at the same time the}} <b>autonomisation</b> of the emerging public international law, and norm hierarchy. Treaty provisions could alter the French lois fondamentales or Spanish succession law. The latter thesis was controversial in 1713, since even Colbert de Torcy denied any legal validity to renunciations contrary to the loi fondamentale of indisposibility of the crown. However, the ensuing treaty practice confirmed the separation of the two Bourbon branches and thus treaty law's precedence. The 1716 bilateral alliance treaty between France and Britain, the ensuing 1717 Triple Alliance and the 1718 Quadruple Alliance confirmed international recognition as a constitutive element of succession law, hitherto the most discretionary of all constitutional branches. Although older French authors as Bourgeois (La Diplomatie secrète au XVIIIe siècle, 1909) or Baudrillart (Phillipe V et la Cour de France, 1890) treated the relevant diplomatic correspondence in detail, the importance of practical diplomatic language should be reaffirmed in the light of a cultural and sociological understanding of early XVIIIth century international law, as a praxeology, or implicit set of social conventions (Bourdieu). Law operated as the almost theological, transformative and legitimizing vector of power relations and aspirations, in the hands of the Society of Princes' monopolist legal practitioners. Consequently, 'balance of power' remains a more than useful tool to analyse European politics...|$|E
