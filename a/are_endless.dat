5|$|On 1 December 1959, Bill Shankly was {{appointed}} manager, beginning a fifteen-year spell as manager that brought three league titles, two FA Cups and a first European trophy, the UEFA Cup to Anfield. Shankly's reign as manager {{is famous for}} the establishment of the Anfield boot room as the location for his tactical discussions with his coaches. When he was not managing the club, Shankly was usually at his typewriter, personally replying to the letters which arrived at Melwood. Shankly even called some supporters at home to discuss the previous day's game, while the accounts of him providing tickets for fans <b>are</b> <b>endless.</b> When Shankly retired in 1974, he was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley. During the next nine seasons, Paisley proceeded to win six league titles and three European Cups to become the most successful manager {{in the history of the}} club. When Paisley retired in 1983, his assistant Joe Fagan took over, and continued the Boot Room tradition, and winning a treble of League, European Cup and League Cup in his first season. He again guided Liverpool to a European Cup Final, but the match was overshadowed by the Heysel stadium disaster, and he retired soon after. Striker Kenny Dalglish was then made the club's first player-manager and in his first season in charge, Dalglish led the club to a League and FA Cup double. After that great first season, Dalglish led Liverpool to a further two league titles and another FA Cup. However, the Hillsborough disaster overshadowed his reign; it was one of the reasons for Dalglish resigning on 22 February 1991.|$|E

25|$|The Buddha also {{asserted}} that karma influences rebirth, {{and that the}} cycles of repeated births and deaths <b>are</b> <b>endless.</b> Before the birth of Buddha, ancient Indian scholars had developed competing theories of afterlife, including the materialistic school such as Charvaka, which posited that death is the end, there is no afterlife, no soul, no rebirth, no karma, and they described death to be a state where a living being is completely annihilated, dissolved. Buddha rejected this theory, adopted the alternate existing theories on rebirth, criticizing the materialistic schools that denied rebirth and karma, states Damien Keown. Such beliefs are inappropriate and dangerous, stated Buddha, because such annihilationism views encourage moral irresponsibility and material hedonism; he tied moral responsibility to rebirth.|$|E
25|$|Kimchi {{refers to}} often {{fermented}} vegetable dishes usually made with napa cabbage, Korean radish, or sometimes cucumber, commonly fermented in a brine of ginger, garlic, scallions, and chili pepper. There <b>are</b> <b>endless</b> varieties with regional variations, {{and it is}} served {{as a side dish}} or cooked into soups and rice dishes. Koreans traditionally make enough kimchi to last for the entire winter season, as fermented foods can keep for several years. These were stored in traditional Korean mud pots known as Jangdokdae although with the advent of refrigerators, special Kimchi freezers and commercially produced kimchi, this practice has become less common. Kimchi is packed with vitamin A, thiamine B1, riboflavin B2, calcium, and iron. Its main benefit though is found in the bacteria lactobacilli; this is found in yogurt and fermented foods. This bacteria helps with digestion. South Koreans eat an average of 40 pounds of Kimchi each year.|$|E
25|$|Of the 11th and 12th centuries {{there are}} {{numerous}} examples of bronze doors, the earliest being one at Hildesheim, Germany (1015). The Hildesheim design affected the concept of Gniezno door in Poland. Of others in South Italy and Sicily, the following are the finest: in Sant Andrea, Amalfi (1060); Salerno (1099); Canosa (1111); Troia, two doors (1119 and 1124); Ravello (1179), by Barisano of Trani, who also made doors for Trani cathedral; and in Monreale and Pisa cathedrals, by Bonano of Pisa. In all these cases the hanging stile had pivots {{at the top and}} bottom. The exact period when the hinge was substituted is not quite known, but the change apparently brought about another method of strengthening and decorating doors, viz, with wrought-iron bands of infinite varieties of design. As a rule three bands from which the ornamental work springs constitute the hinges, which have rings outside the hanging stiles fitting on to vertical tenons run into the masonry or wooden frame. There is an early example of the 12th century in Lincoln; in France the metal work of the doors of Notre Dame at Paris is perhaps the most beautiful in execution, but examples <b>are</b> <b>endless</b> throughout France and England.|$|E

[...] For myself I look for the contrasting effects in the foliage, which changes with the tones of the sky. [...] At times, when the tree bares its pale blossoms and big blue flies, emerald fruit beetles and cicadas in great numbers fly about, everything is immersed in pure blue. [...] Then, as the bronzer foliage takes on more mature tones, the sky is radiant and streaked with green and orange, and then again, further into autumn, the leaves take on violet tones something of the color of a ripe fig, and this violet effect manifests itself most fully with the contrast of the large, whitening sun within its pale halo of light lemon. [...] Sometimes, too, after a shower I've seen the whole sky pink and orange, which gave an exquisite value and coloring to the silvery gray-greens. [...] And among all this were women, also pink, who were gathering the fruit." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw praised Olivia's {{entrance}} in the episode, {{calling it}} a [...] "Nice set-up for {{the focal point of}} this episode... Really nice storyline to heave us face-first into the new season". She lauded the Charlie-shapeshifter plot twist, stating [...] "The possibilities <b>are</b> <b>endless</b> with that storyline, and it'll be fun to see how it all plays out". SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall praised Joshua Jackson and Lance Reddick's performances, giving Jackson [...] "top honors" [...] as he [...] "once again shows us the fangs behind that cherubic smile". Stegall also noted the allusions to The X-Files, which included an episode playing during the first shapeshifter's transformation, [...] "Which is fine, as far as I'm concerned. If I can't have Mulder and Scully, I'll take Walter and Peter, and even Astrid and Charlie... I'm happy to see another show on TV that deals with the unknowable and the possibly fascinating, with an actual budget in hand. If this show started out as X-Files Light, it's developing some serious weight now." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to other [...] "mainstays" [...] of modern-day youth, technology serves {{an important role}} in the series, specifically the Internet and Kim's gadgets, the most significant of which is a cell phone-like device known as a Kimmunicator, designed to help Kim communicate with Wade and allow her access to virtually any information she desires. McCorkle elaborated on the show's emphasis on technology: [...] "Using the Internet theme in the series became an easy launching pad partially because it is such a major part of the fabric of teen life and the interactive possibilities <b>are</b> <b>endless</b> ... It's as though we get to play James Bond's 'Q' for each episode -- the more imaginative the toy, the better." [...] Particularly desirable to younger viewers, technology allows Kim to travel around the world effortlessly and to some extent mirrors children's ability to speak to anyone anywhere in the world via the Internet. Kim's ability to travel virtually anywhere around the world within a short period of time is left largely unexplained; BuzzFeed referred to Wade as an [...] "example that sitting in front of your computer all day is actually the most powerful position to be in." [...] The fact that Wade never leaves his bedroom could potentially indicate that he suffers from agoraphobia.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{halves of}} the fifth season {{received}} overwhelming critical acclaim. Following {{the end of the}} series, critic Nick Harley summarized his commendation of the show: [...] "Expertly written, virtuosic with its direction, and flawlessly performed, Breaking Bad is everything you could want in a drama. Critics will spend the next decade dissecting and arguing about what made it great, but the reasons <b>are</b> <b>endless</b> and already well documented." [...] During the final season, the show also received praise from George R. R. Martin, author of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, particularly the episode [...] "Ozymandias"; Martin commented that [...] "Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros." [...] In his review of the second half of season 5, Seth Amitin of IGN stated, [...] "This final batch of Breaking Bad {{is one of the best}} run of episodes TV has ever offered," [...] and praised [...] "Ozymandias" [...] in particular, referring to it as [...] "maybe the best episode of TV [...] ever seen." [...] Jonah Goldberg of National Review called it [...] "the best show currently on television, and perhaps even the best ever." [...] The veteran actor Sir Anthony Hopkins wrote a letter of praise to Bryan Cranston, telling him that his [...] "performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen– ever." [...] He lauded the rest of the cast and crew as well. The letter first appeared on Steven Michael Quezada's (who portrayed DEA Agent Steven Gomez) Facebook page, and in spite of it being taken down, the letter soon went viral. In 2013, Guinness World Records named Breaking Bad the highest-rated TV series of all time, citing its season 5 Metacritic score of 99 out of 100.|$|E
2500|$|He {{published}} Main Currents in Nineteenth-Century Literature in 1906 (six volumes). This {{book was}} among the 100 best books for education selected in 2008 by Will Durant. Durant and Brandes were both contributors to the Mother Earth magazine. In Volume 2 Brandes says about Kierkegaard, [...] "It is not merely in name that this irony bears a fundamental resemblance to Kierkegaard's, which also aristocratically [...] "chooses to be misunderstood". The Ego of genius is the truth, if {{not in the sense}} in which Kierkegaard would have us understand his proposition, [...] "Subjectivity is the truth", still {{in the sense that the}} Ego has every externally valid commandment and prohibition in its power; and, to the astonishment and scandal of the world, invariably expresses itself in paradoxes. Irony is [...] "divine audacity". In audacity thus comprehended there <b>are</b> <b>endless</b> possibilities. It is freedom from prejudice, yet it suggests the possibility of the most audacious defense of all possible kinds of prejudices. It is more easily attainable, we are told, by woman than by man. “Like the feminine garb, the feminine intellect has this advantage over the masculine, that its possessor by a single daring movement can rise above all the prejudices of civilization and bourgeois conventionality, at once transporting herself into the state of innocence and the lap of Nature". The lap of Nature! There is an echo of Rousseau's voice even in this wanton tirade. We seem to hear the trumpet-call of revolution; what we really hear is only the proclamation of reaction. Rousseau desired to return to the state of nature, when men roamed naked through the pathless forests and lived upon acorns. Schelling wished to turn the course of evolution back to the primeval ages, to the days before man had fallen. Schlegel blows revolutionary melodies on the great romantic [...] "wonder-horn".|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} ways in which the concept of {{identity}} can be defined. It is true in all cases that identity construction is an ongoing process of development, change and maintenance of identifying with the self. Research has shown that adolescence is a time of identity progression rather than regression. One's identity tends to lack stability in the beginning years of life but gains a more stable sense in later periods of childhood and adolescence. Typically associated with a time of experimentation, there <b>are</b> <b>endless</b> factors that go into the construction of one's identity. As well as being many factors, there are many types of identities one can associate with. Some categories of identity include gender, sexuality, class, racial and religious, etc. For transracial and international adoptees, tension is generally found in the categories of racial, ethnic and national identification. Because of this, the strength and functionality of family relationships play a huge role in its development and outcome of identity construction. Transracial and transnational adoptees tend to develop feelings of a lack of acceptance because of such racial, ethnic, and cultural differences. Therefore, exposing transracial and transnational adoptees to their [...] "cultures of origin" [...] is important in order to better develop a sense of identity and appreciation for cultural diversity. Identity construction and reconstruction for transnational adoptees the instant they are adopted. For example, based upon specific laws and regulations of the United States, the Child Citizen Act of 2000 makes sure to grant immediate U.S. citizenship to adoptees. Although this act is specific to particular laws created by the United States, it can be understood that such a notion reconstructs a sense of identity for adoptees as a United States citizen. Transnational adoptees also have to evaluate their racial, ethnic and cultural differences that are incognizant with their adoption family. Therefore, these factors may explain how tension is created with transracial and transnational adoptees.|$|E
