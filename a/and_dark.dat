5|$|As {{feathers}} grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible {{dark and}} light bands in the fully formed feather. These so-called growth bars and their widths {{have been used to}} determine the daily nutritional status of birds. Each light <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bar correspond to around 24 hours and the use of this technique has been called ptilochronology (analogous to dendrochronology).|$|E
5|$|As on Dark Horse, Harrison listed {{contributing}} musicians {{for each}} song, on the LP's back cover, {{but this time}} with an additional list for those not appearing.

Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that is apparent in both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E
5|$|Celestiial is {{a funeral}} doom metal band. However, Desolate North has been {{described}} as taking the genre in new directions with comparisons to ambient, goth, experimental, <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> folk music being made. The music has also been described as meditative and medieval.|$|E

5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> matter within the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental to the {{structure}} of the Universe is the existence of dark matter <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> energy. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen and helium are {{estimated}} to make up approximately 99 per cent of all ordinary matter in the universe. Less than five per cent of the Universe {{is believed to be}} made of ordinary matter, represented by stars, planets and living beings. The balance is made of dark energy <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> matter, both of which are poorly understood at present.|$|E

5|$|Observations, {{including}} the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and Planck {{maps of the}} CMB, suggest that the Universe is infinite in extent with a finite age, as described by the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) models. These FLRW models thus support inflationary models and the standard model of cosmology, describing a flat, homogeneous universe presently dominated by dark matter <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> energy.|$|E
