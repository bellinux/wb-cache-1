5|$|The Picidae <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> {{of eight}} living {{families}} in the order Piciformes, the others being barbets, toucans, and honeyguides in the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, the Bermuda flicker, being extinct and a further two probably being so.|$|E

On the other hand, only 5% of the actual spills came from oil tankers, while 51.8% came from other kinds of vessels.|$|E
25|$|There are {{peculiar}} chess compositions featuring double stalemate. At {{left and}} at right are double stalemate positions, in which neither side has a legal move. There {{is also a}} bizarre chess variant, Patt-schach, that begins from a double stalemate position. Each player begins by making an illegal move (although they cannot capture enemy pieces with these illegal moves, and the rules of check and checkmate are still respected), and then normal play begins. Since all pawns <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> step from promotion, they may only promote to captured pieces: if no pieces may be captured, pawns may not move to the last row.|$|E

25|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, a big effect will be low yields of grain {{according}} to the World Food Trade Model, specifically in the low latitude regions where much of the developing world is located. From this the price of grain will rise, along with the developing nations trying to grow the grain. Due to this, every 2–2.5% price hike will increase the number of hungry people by 1%. Low crop yields <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of the problem facing farmers in the low latitudes and tropical regions. The timing and length of the growing seasons, when farmers plant their crops, are going to be changing dramatically, per the USDA, due to unknown changes in soil temperature and moisture conditions.|$|E
500|$|The Picidae <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> {{of eight}} living {{families}} in the order Piciformes. Other members of this group, such as the jacamars, puffbirds, barbets, toucans, and honeyguides, have traditionally been thought to be {{closely related to the}} woodpecker family (woodpeckers, piculets, wrynecks and sapsuckers). The clade Pici (woodpeckers, barbets, toucans, and honeyguides) is well supported and shares a zygodactyl foot with the Galbuli (puffbirds and jacamars). More recently, several DNA sequence analyses have confirmed that Pici and Galbuli are sister groups.|$|E

When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky." ...|$|E
500|$|Denny Mooney was {{appointed}} chairman of Holden on 1 January 2004, {{by which time}} development of the VE Commodore was well underway. Key design and engineering work was being finalised, and investment was already being made in making the tooling with which to manufacture the car.

The interior quality benefited dramatically from this additional emphasis; Mooney pushed for panel gaps to be reduced by a further [...] over previous targets. Smaller panel gaps <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> {{of the ways that}} Holden have developed the VE to pitch it against the European competitors. Through the use of advanced steels and intensive design, the body structure is 50percent stiffer than the outgoing model, benefiting from noise and vibration reductions, handling and crash safety. However the new body has resulted in substantially increased weight over the outgoing model.|$|E
500|$|Words such as [...] "element" [...] and [...] "combining operation" [...] {{are very}} general, {{and can be}} applied to many {{real-world}} and abstract situations. Any set of things that obeys all the rules for one (or two) operation(s) is, by definition, a group (or ring), and obeys all theorems about groups (or rings). Integer numbers, and the operations of addition and multiplication, <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> example. For example, the elements might be computer data words, where the first combining operation is exclusive or and the second is logical conjunction. Theorems of abstract algebra are powerful because they are general; they govern many systems. It might be imagined that little could be concluded about objects defined with so few properties, but precisely therein lay Noether's gift: to discover the maximum that could be concluded from a given set of properties, or conversely, to identify the minimum set, the essential properties responsible for a particular observation. Unlike most mathematicians, she did not make abstractions by generalizing from known examples; rather, she worked directly with the abstractions.
