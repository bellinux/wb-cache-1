50|$|Through Executive Order No. 209, {{which was}} enacted on August 3, 1988 by President Corazon C.

The provisions of the Civil Code of the Philippines with regard to adoption were also repealed. Here, as opposed to the Civil Code wherein a person of any age may be adopted, only minors were allowed to be adopted with those older only being adoptable under certain conditions. It was also here where aliens were disqualified from adopting Filipinos, except if it were an <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> provided that: 1) the adopter is a former Filipino who is adopting a blood relative, 2) the adopter is adopting the legitimate child of his / her spouse, or 3) the adopter is married to a Filipino citizen and they seek to jointly adopt the blood relative of the latter. Cases which did not fall under the three exceptions were subject to the provisions of inter-country adoption but these were not yet in present in 1988.|$|E

50|$|LGBT {{adoption}} is the <b>adoption</b> of children <b>by</b> lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.

Joint <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> same-sex couples is legal in 26 countries and in some sub-national territories. Furthermore, 5 countries have legalized some form of step-child adoption. Opponents of LGBT adoption question whether same-sex couples have the ability to be adequate parents (see LGBT parenting) while other opponents question whether natural law implies that children of adoption possess a natural right to be raised by heterosexual parents. Since constitutions and statutes usually fail to address the adoption rights of LGBT persons, judicial decisions often determine whether they can serve as parents either individually or as couples.|$|R
