[FN#2] The tender traveller had better provide himself {{with a pair of}} stirrups, but he will often find, when on camel back, that his legs are more numbed by hanging down, than by the Arab way of crossing them before and beneath the pommel. He must, however, be careful to inspect his saddle, and, should bars of wood not suit him, to have them covered with stuffed leather. And again, for my part, I would prefer riding a camel with a nose-ring,-Mongol and Sindian fashion,-to holding him, as the Egyptians do, with a halter, or to guiding him,-Wahhabiwise,-with a stick. [FN#3] [...] "O pilgrim!" [...] The Egyptians write the word Hajj, and pronounce Hagg. In Persia, India, and Turkey, it becomes Haji. These are mere varieties of form, derived from one and the same Arabic root. [FN#4] The Egyptians and Arabs will not address [...] "Salam" [...] to an infidel; the Moslems of India have no such objection. This, {{on the banks of the}} Nile, is the revival of an old prejudice. Alexander of Alexandria, in his circular letter, describes the Arian heretics as [...] "men whom it is not lawful to salute, or to bid God-speed." [...] [FN#5] It is Prince Puckler Muskau, if I recollect rightly, who mentions that in his case a pair of dark spectacles produced a marked difference of apparent temperature, whilst travelling over the sultry sand of the Desert. I have often remarked the same phenomenon. The Arabs, doubtless for some reason of the kind, always draw their head-kerchiefs, like hoods, far over their brows, and cover up their mouths, even when the sun and wind are behind them. Inhabitants of the Desert are to be recognised by the net-work of wrinkles traced in the skin round the orbits, the result of half-closing their eyelids; but this is done to temper the intensity of the light. [FN#6] Their own pipe-tubes were of coarse wood, in shape somewhat resembling the German porcelain pipe. The bowl was of soft stone, apparently steatite, which, when fresh, is easily fashioned with a knife. In Arabia the Badawin, and even the townspeople, use on journeys an earthen tube from five to six inches shorter than the English [...] "clay," [...] thicker in the tube, with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>and</b> coloured yellowish-red. It contains a handful of tobacco, and the smoker emits puffs like a chimney. In some of these articles the bowl forms a rectangle with the tube; in others, the whole is an unbroken curve, like the old Turkish Meerschaum. [FN#7] See Wallin's papers, published in the Journals of the Royal Geographical Society. [FN#8] Shurum, (plural of Sharm, a creek), a word prefixed to the proper names of three small ports in the Sinaitic peninsula. [FN#9] Tawarah, plural of Turi, an inhabitant of Tur or Sinai. [FN#10] This feature did not escape the practised eye of Denon. [...] "Eyes long, almond-shaped, half shut, and languishing, and turned up at the outer corner, as if habitually fatigued by the light and heat of the sun; cheeks round, &c.," [...] (Voyage en Egypt). The learned Frenchman's description of the ancient Egyptians applies in most points to the Turi Badawin. [FN#11] [...] "And he" [...] (Ishmael) [...] "dwelt in the wilderness of Paran," [...] (Wady Firan?) [...] "and his mother took him a wife, out of the land of Egypt," [...] (Gen. xxi. 21). I wonder that some geographers have attempted to identify Massa, the son of Ishmael, (Gen. xxv. 14), with Meccah, when in verse 18 of the same chapter we read, [...] "And they" [...] (the twelve princes, sons of Ishmael) [...] "dwelt from Havilah unto Shur." [...] This asserts, as clearly as language can, that the posterity of, or the race typified by, Ishmael,-the Syro-Egyptian,-occupied only the northern parts of the peninsula. Their habitat is not even included in Arabia by those writers who bound the country on the north by an imaginary line drawn from Ras Mohammed to the mouths of the Euphrates. The late Dr. J. Wilson ("Lands of the Bible"), repeated by Eliot Warburton ("Crescent and Cross"), lays stress upon the Tawarah tradition, that they are Benu Isra'il converted to Al-Islam, considering it a fulfilment of the prophecy, [...] "that a remnant of Israel shall dwell in Edom." [...] With due deference to so illustrious an Orientalist and Biblical scholar as was Dr. Wilson, I believe that most modern Moslems, being ignorant that Jacob was the first called [...] "prince with God," [...] apply the term Benu-Isra'il to all the posterity of Abraham, not to Jews only. [FN#12] In 1879 the Gates of Suez are a thing of the past; and it is not easy to find where they formerly stood. [FN#13] In the mouth of a Turk, no epithet is more contemptuous than that of [...] "Fellah ibn Fellah,"-"boor, son of a boor!" [...] The Osmanlis have, as usual, a semi-religious tradition to account for the superiority of their nation over the Egyptians. When the learned doctor, Abu Abdullah Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafe'i, returned from Meccah to the banks of the Nile, he mounted, it is said, a donkey belonging to one of the Asinarii of Bulak. Arriving at the Caravanserai, he gave the man ample fare, whereupon the Egyptian, putting forth his hand, and saying, [...] "hat" [...] (give!) called for more. The doctor doubled the fee; still the double was demanded. At last the divine's purse was exhausted, and the proprietor of the donkey waxed insolent. A wandering Turk seeing this, took all the money from the Egyptian, paid him his due, solemnly kicked him, and returned the rest to Al-Shafe'i, who asked him his name-"Osman"-and his nation-the [...] "Osmanli,"-blessed him, and prophesied to his countrymen supremacy over the Fellahs and donkey boys of Egypt. [FN#14] From Samm, the poison-wind. Vulgar and most erroneously called the Simoon. [FN#15] Hugh Murray derives this word from the Egyptian, and quoting Strabo and Abulfeda makes it synonymous with Auasis and Hyasis. I believe it to be a mere corruption of the Arabic Wady [Arabic text] or Wah. Nothing can be more incorrect than the vulgar idea of an Arabian Oasis, except it be the popular conception of an Arabian Desert. One reads of [...] "isles of the sandy sea," [...] but one never sees them. The real [...] "Wady" [...] is, generally speaking, a rocky valley bisected by the bed of a mountain torrent, dry during the hot season. In such places the Badawin love to encamp, because they find food and drink,-water being always procurable by digging. When the supply is perennial, the Wady becomes the site of a village. The Desert is as unaptly compared to a [...] "sandy sea." [...] Most of the wilds of Arabia resemble the tract between Suez and Cairo; only the former are of primary formation, whereas the others are of a later date. Sand-heaps are found in every Desert, but sand-plains are a local feature, not the general face of the country. The Wilderness, east of the Nile, is mostly a hard dry earth, which requires only a monsoon to become highly productive: even where silicious sand covers the plain, the waters of a torrent, depositing humus or vegetable mould, bind the particles together, and fit it for the reception of seed. [FN#16] The intelligent reader will easily understand that I am speaking of the Desert in the temperate season, not during the summer heats, when the whole is one vast furnace, nor in winter, when the Sarsar wind cuts like an Italian Tramontana. [FN#17] This, as a general rule in Al-Islam, is a sign that the Maghrib or evening prayer must not be delayed. The Shafe'i school performs its devotions immediately after the sun has disappeared. [FN#18] This salutation of peace is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation that the observing traveller will easily make of it a shibboleth. [FN#19] To [...] "nakh" [...] in vulgar, as in classical, Arabic is to gurgle [...] "Ikh! ikh!" [...] in the bottom of one's throat till the camel kneels down. We have no English word for this proceeding; but Anglo-Oriental travellers are rapidly naturalising the [...] "nakh." ...|$|E

5000|$|The meat-based raw {{materials}} used in the pudding are sourced from the producers who farm within a six-mile (10 km) radius of the factory at Timoleague whereas {{most of the other}} ingredients used (cereals, onions, casings) are sourced outside the immediate area. One of the cardinal features of this pudding is the cereal is soaked in fresh pig's blood the night before preparation of the pudding. The following morning, the remaining ingredients are minced together in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> blended into the blood mixture before being placed in the casings. Once filled, the puddings are boiled in water for 15 minutes. After boiling, the puddings are taken out and left to cool. [...] The pudding is brown in colour, is a long cylindrical sausage shape which forms naturally into rings and is made from fresh pigs' blood, pork trimming, cereal, fresh onions, seasonings, spices and natural casings. It comes in weights of between 750 and 1000 grams (1.7-2.2 lb). Due to the inclusion of fresh blood, the taste of the pudding can be described as very clean and rustic. The process of pre-soaking pig's blood in oatmeal is a continuation of the traditional west Cork method of combining blood and cereal in a pudding to give it its distinctive regional texture and taste.|$|E
40|$|Economists {{have devoted}} {{considerable}} attention to rent-dissipation in limited-entry fisheries {{as a result}} of excessive use of capital inputs, or "capital stuffing. " We may refer to this mechanism of rent dissipation as "cost-driven rent dissipation. " An alternative potential mechanism of rent dissipation, which we refer to as "value-driven rent dissipation," may occur if limited-entry management causes fishermen to receive a lower price for their fish than would be possible under an alternative management system. In theory, value-driven rent dissipation may occur if the marginal value to a fisherman from fishing differently (for example, more slowly to take better care of the fish and improve quality) is positive but less than the marginal cost from a reduced catch share. This paper describes an economic experiment to study value-driven rent dissipation in a limited entry fishery. Following an approach developed by Knapp and Murphy (2010), subjects "fish" competitively for beans by scooping them out of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> "delivering" them to a pitcher. Given the choice of delivering to a pitcher placed close by for a lower price or a pitcher placed farther away for a higher price, unless the price differential is sufficiently high, subjects choose the closer but lower-priced pitcher. With the introduction of an individual quota to replace the competitive fishery, value dissipation ends as subjects choose the higher-priced pitcher. This simple experiment provides a powerful demonstration of a less-appreciated mechanism of rent dissipation, which is useful for both research and teaching...|$|E

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{deals with}} the Modeling, Control, and On-line {{optimization}} of Cone Crushers. Cone crushers are used for size reduction of minerals and are considered as a central element in many mineral processing plants. It consists of a cone rotating eccentrically inside <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> the particles are crushed in the cavity between these. In spite of its simple construction, the cone crusher represents a complex system from a modeling point of view, as its operation comprises many physical actions that are combined together to give the overall behavior. The main purpose {{of the work is}} to have a dynamic model that can predict the ow and the size distribution of the crusher {{as a function of the}} main manipulated variables so that realistic simulation of closed loop control strategies can be achieved. The model is based on rst principles and includes many factors that are known to aect the operation of the crusher, e. g operation of the crusher with two dierent materials. For the control of the crusher, a number of dierent approaches were considered. First, a simple PI controller of the percentage of large material in the output produced was simulated. It is known and also predicted by the model that the cone crusher's total throughput depends on the Eccentric Speed, and exhibits a quasi-concave response with respect to this variable. On-line optimization of the throughput is suggested to be based on the concept of Extremum Seeking Control (ESC). Two dierent methods of ESC were applied. The classic Band Pass Filters based approach, and the Extended Kalman Filter Based approach. Both methods were modied in order to achieve improved performance. These modications can be applied on other plants as well. Simulations of the closed loop for the two methods have demonstrated the applicability of ESC for optimizing the crusher on-line. The optimum operating point was reached in all cases, leading to improvement of the performance of the crusher.

25|$|As {{everything}} {{depended on}} the final game, the Imperial Cricket Conference agreed to a request that the match be played to a finish with time no object. The England selectors, conscious that the team had not beaten Australia in a series for 14 years, and had won just once in 19 Tests since 1920, made several changes. Carr was replaced as captain by Percy Chapman, a decision which proved enormously controversial in the press but of which Hobbs approved; Rhodes was also recalled to the team, aged 48. Amid huge public interest and excitement, the deciding match began; Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 53 on the first day, but after both sides had batted once, the match was evenly balanced {{at the end of}} the second day. Overnight rain seriously damaged the pitch before the third morning; batting became extremely difficult, and few critics—including members of the England team—expected England to score many runs. Instead, Hobbs and Sutcliffe, who had scored 49 on the second evening, began to bat confidently before the effects of a hot sun drying a damp pitch made batting even more hazardous. Concentrating on careful defence, but scoring where possible, the pair added 172 in total. Arthur Richardson, a spin bowler, was expected to be the main threat, but while it often looked like Hobbs would be dismissed, he faced most of Richardson's <b>bowling</b> <b>and</b> survived. Some critics believed that, through his batting, Hobbs had deliberately exaggerated the difficulties of facing Richardson to prevent the Australian captain putting on a more difficult bowler. Commentators praised the skilful defence of both batsmen, Hobbs in particular. Immediately after reaching 100, Hobbs was out and received a prolonged ovation from the crowd.
