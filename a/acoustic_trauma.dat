40|$|Tinnitus is a {{frequent}} consequence of noise trauma. Usually, however, the main focus regarding the consequences of noise trauma is placed on hearing loss, instead of tinnitus. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to assess various aspects of noise-related tinnitus in Finland, such as to determine the main causes of conscript acute <b>acoustic</b> <b>traumas</b> (AAT) in the military, assess tinnitus prevalence after noise trauma, characterize long-term AAT-related tinnitus prevalence and characteristics, assess occupational tinnitus, and evaluate the efficacy of hearing protection regulations in preventing hearing loss and tinnitus. The study comprised several independent noise-exposed groups: conscripts performing their military duty, former conscripts who suffered an AAT over a decade earlier, bomb explosion victims, and retired army personnel. Tinnitus questionnaires were used to assess tinnitus prevalence and characteristics. For occupational tinnitus, occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) reports to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health were reviewed. Tinnitus is a common result of AAT, blast exposure and long-term noise exposure. Despite hearing protection regulations, up to hundreds of AATs occur annually among conscripts in the Finnish Defence Forces (FDF). The most common cause is an accidental shot, accounting for approximately half of the cases. Conscript AATs are mainly due to accidental shots, while the ear is unprotected. Only seldom is an AAT due to negligence. The most common causative weapon of conscript AATs is the assault rifle, accounting for 81 % of conscript AATs. After AAT, the majority of tinnitus cases resolve during military service and become asymptomatic. However, in one-fifth of the cases, tinnitus persists, causing problems such as sleeping and concentration difficulties in many. In Finland, occupational tinnitus often remains unreported in conjunction with NIHL reports. In a survey of occupational NIHL cases, tinnitus was mentioned in only four per cent. However, a subsequent inquiry revealed that almost 90 % in fact had tinnitus, indicating that most cases remained undetected and unreported. The best way to prevent noise-related tinnitus is prevention of noise trauma. In the military, hearing protection guidelines have been revised several times over the years. These regulations have been effective in reducing hearing loss of professional soldiers. There has also been a reduction in cases with tinnitus, but the decrease was not significant. However, with improved hearing protection regulations, a significant reduction in the risk of more serious, disturbing tinnitus was observed. Tinnitus is {{a frequent}} consequence of noise trauma.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Acoustic</b> blast <b>trauma</b> is {{different}} from Noise induced hearing loss. Blast trauma can damage the tympanic membrane, ossicles and cochlea singly or in combination. It produces immediate severe hearing loss and {{may be associated with}} tinnitus and vestibular symptoms. Hearing loss recovers spontaneously in many cases but may be permanent in 30 - 55 % cases. Thirteen patients working in an explosive manufacturing unit in Andhra Pradesh were exposed to blast trauma at work place. All these workers complained of immediate hearing loss and were subjected to audiological investigations. Methods: Initial evaluation showed a severe sensorineural type of hearing loss 10 of the 13 cases (77 %). They were referred to our Medical board for disability evaluation after 2 - 3 years of initial injury. Pure tone audiometry indicated severe hearing loss in 12 of 13 cases (92 %) that was not correlating clinically. Re-evaluation with Acoustic reflex and ABR (BERA) tests were done and permanent disability was evaluated with the results of these investigations. Observations: No significant hearing loss was found in most patients and these patients had minimal disability. Conclusion: Objective hearing tests should be carried out after one year or more before evaluation of permanent disability...|$|R
50|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> is the {{sustainment}} of {{an injury}} to the eardrum {{as a result of}} a very loud noise.

50|$|Noise-related {{causes of}} hearing loss {{are divided into}} {{extrinsic}} (nosocusis) and intrinsic (sociocusis) causes: In the auditory system, the extrinsic component (nosocusis) includes hearing loss due to otologic disease, hazardous noise exposure, <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma,</b> and ototoxic agents. The intrinsic component (sociocusis) indicates the wear-and-tear effects {{of exposure to the}} everyday sounds of normal living. People who live in nonindustrialized regions avoid both nosocusis and sociocusis and demonstrate excellent hearing into old age.|$|E
50|$|Gradually {{developing}} NIHL {{refers to}} permanent cochlear damage from repeated exposure to loud sounds {{over a period}} of time. Unlike <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma,</b> this form of NIHL does not occur from a single exposure to a high-intensity sound pressure level. Gradually developing NIHL can be caused by multiple exposures to excessive noise in the workplace or any source of repetitive, frequent exposures to sounds of excessive volume, such as home and vehicle stereos, concerts, nightclubs, and personal media players.|$|E
50|$|Summarized, sound (or other stressor) {{conditioning}} is a pre-emptive medication against cochlea inflammation. It {{does not}} make the ear more resistant to noise. It reduces the inflammation caused by the <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma,</b> which would cause subsequent damages to hair cells. While an anti-inflammatory medication would increase the quantity of anti-inflammatory hormone in the whole body, noise conditioning increases the number of receptors for the anti-inflammatory hormone, and only in the areas where it is much needed (i.e. cochlea).|$|E
5000|$|Both NIHL {{caused by}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> and gradually-developed-NIHL {{can often be}} {{characterized}} by a specific pattern presented in audiological findings. NIHL is generally observed to affect a person's hearing sensitivity in the higher frequencies, especially at 4000 Hz. [...] "Noise-induced impairments are usually associated with a notch-shaped high-frequency sensorineural loss that is worst at 4000 Hz, although the notch often occurs at 3000 or 6000 Hz, as well". Doctoral students at the University of Iowa have termed this notch, specific to a noise-induced cause, a [...] "muna." [...] The symptoms of NIHL are usually presented equally in both ears.|$|E
5000|$|Marshallers {{like other}} ground {{personnel}} must use protective equipment like protective goggles or [...] "an appropriate helmet with visor, when in rotor wash areas or {{in front of}} an aircraft that is being backed using the aircraft's engines."It also prescribes [...] "earplugs, muff-type ear defenders, or headsets in the immediate area of aircraft that have engines, Auxiliary Power Unit, or Gas Turbine Compressor running."==Noise exposure== Excessive noise can cause hearing loss in marshallers, either imperceptibly over years or after a one time <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma.</b> In the United States noise limits at work are set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).|$|E
50|$|Several {{clinical}} trials {{have been conducted}} to treat temporary NIHL occurring after a traumatic noise event, such as a gunshot or firework. In 2007, individuals with acute <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> after firecracker exposure were injected intratympanically with a cell permeable ligand, AM-111. The trial found AM-111 to have a therapeutic effect on at least 2 cases of those with acute trauma. Treatment {{with a combination of}} prednisolone and piracetam appeared to rescue patients with acute trauma after exposure to gunshots. However, those who received the treatment within an hour of exposure had higher rates of recovery and significantly lower threshold shifts compared to those who received treatment after 1 hour.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{different}} people having different thresholds for what noises are painful, this pain threshold had no correlation with which noises cause hearing damage. The ear {{can not get}} more resistant to noise harmfulness by training it to noise. The cochlea is partially protected by the acoustic reflex, but being frequently exposed to noise does not lower the reflex threshold. It had been observed that noise conditioning (i.e. exposure to loud non-traumatizing noise) several hours prior to the exposure to traumatizing sound level, significantly reduced the damages inflicted to the hair-cells. The same “protective effect" [...] was also observed with other stressors such as heat-shock conditioning and stress (by restraint) conditioning. This “protective effect" [...] only happens if the traumatizing noise is presented within an optimum interval of time after the sound-conditioning session (-24 hours for a 15 min. sound-conditioning; no more protection after 48 hours).This “protective effect” had long been thought to involve the active mechanisms of the outer hair cells and the efferent system commanding them. The contractile effect of the outer hair cells, activated by the efferent nervous system has been proven to provide a protective effect against <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma.</b> [...] However, a 2006 study revealed a different protective mechanism for stress conditioning. The study revealed that the stressor (sound, heat, or stress) conditioning increases the receptibility to glucocorticoid, a kind of anti-inflammatory hormone. The effects of glucocorticoid thus mitigate the inflammation from an <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> {{that can lead to}} hearing loss. In fact, high doses of corticoids are often prescribed by physicians after an acoustic-trauma in order to mitigate the inflammatory response.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{investigated}} additional mechanisms of NIHL involving delayed or disabled electrochemical transmission of nerve impulses from the hair cell to {{and along the}} auditory nerve. In cases of extreme acute <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma,</b> {{a portion of the}} postsynaptic dendrite (where the hair cell transfers electrochemical signal to the auditory nerve) can rupture from overstimulation, temporarily stopping all transmission of auditory input to the auditory nerve. This is known as excitotoxicity. Usually, this sort of rupture heals within about five days, resulting in functional recovery of that synapse. While healing, an over-expression of glutamate receptors can result in temporary tinnitus, or ringing in the ears. Repeated ruptures at the same synapse may eventually fail to heal, leading to permanent hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|Research {{from the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) shows that workers at call and {{dispatch}} centers may face health hazards: (1) <b>Acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> from a sudden spike in noise levels (e.g., from feedback into the headsets or a sudden change in volume) (2) background noise from incoming calls, and (3) background noise and other stressors in the workplace.Employers can {{address these issues}} by (1) supplying communication systems with noise-limiting features. (2) installing noise controls to reduce background noise levels in the work environment (such as barriers between workstations or sound-absorbing materials on hard surfaces in the room), (3) providing workers {{with a variety of}} communication headsets that offer adjustable volume controls, noise-limiting or cancelling features, and improved comfort and protection from ambient noise, (4) evaluating workplace noise levels to ensure that they remain below the NIOSH recommended exposure limit (REL) of 85 dB, and (5) providing quite areas for rest breaks.|$|E
50|$|Diplacusis, {{also known}} as {{diplacusis}} binauralis or inter aural pitch difference (IPD) {{is a type of}} hearing disorder that is the perception of a single auditory stimulus as two separate sounds which may differ in pitch or in time.

Onset is usually spontaneous and can occur at the time of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> or {{in the midst of an}} ear infection. Sufferers may experience the effect permanently, or it may resolve on its own. Treatment includes a full medical examination as well as an audiological examination that may explain the nature of the problem. If needed, amplification may relieve the symptoms of diplacusis. Therapy in helping the patient understand the cause of the symptom and tinnitus retraining may provide some relief. In at least some cases, amplification makes no difference and there is no treatment other than waiting for natural resolution.|$|E
50|$|Cody and Johnstone (1982) and Rajan and Johnstone (1988a; 1988b) {{showed that}} {{constant}} acoustic stimulation (which evokes a strong MOCS response (Brown et al., 1998)) reduced {{the severity of}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma.</b> This protection was negated {{in the presence of}} a chemical known to suppress the action of the olivocochlear bundle (OCB) (strychnine), implicating the action of the MOCS in protection of the cochlea from loud sounds. Further evidence for the auditory efferents having a protective role was provided by Rajan (1995a) and Kujawa and Liberman (1997). Both studies showed that the hearing loss sustained by animals due to binaural sound exposure was more severe if the OCB was severed. Rajan (1995b) also showed a frequency dependence of MOC protection roughly consistent with the distribution of MOC fibres in the cochlea. Other studies supporting this function of the MOCS have shown that MOC stimulation reduces the temporary threshold shift (TTS) and permanent threshold shift (PTS) associated with prolonged noise exposure (Handrock and Zeisberg, 1982; Rajan, 1988b; Reiter and Liberman, 1995), and that animals with the strongest MOC reflex sustain less hearing damage to loud sounds (Maison and Liberman, 2000). This proposed biological role of the MOCS, protection from loud sounds, was challenged by Kirk and Smith (2003), who argued that the intensity of sounds used in the experiments (≥105 dB SPL) would rarely or never occur in nature, and therefore a protective mechanism for sounds of such intensities could not have evolved. This claim (that MOC-mediated cochlear protection is an epiphenomenon) was recently challenged by Darrow et al. (2007), who suggested that the LOCS has an anti-excitotoxic effect, indirectly protecting the cochlea from damage.|$|E

OBJECTIVE The objective {{was to assess the}} correlation between the degree of sensorineural hearing loss and the type of audiogram registered in <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> exposed patients. METHOD We analyzed 262 audiograms of patients exposed to <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> in correlation to 146 audiograms of patients with cochlear damage and hearing loss not related to <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma.</b> "A" group consisted of <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> cases, while "B" group incorporated cases with hearing loss {{secondary to}} cochlear ischaemia or degeneration. All audiograms were subdivided with regard to the mean hearing loss into three groups: mild (21 - 40 dB HL), moderate (41 - 60 dB HL) and severe (over 60 dB HL) hearing loss. Based on audiogram configuration five types of audiogram were defined: type 1 flat; type 2 hearing threshold slope at 2 kHz, type 3 hearing threshold slope at 4 kHz; type 4 hearing threshold notch at 2 kHz; type 5 notch at 4 kHz. RESULTS Mild hearing loss was recorded in 163 (62. 2 %) ears in the <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> group, while in 78 (29. 8 %) ears we established moderate hearing loss with the maximum threshold shift at frequencies ranging from 4 kHz to 8 kHz. The least frequent was profound hearing loss, obtained in 21 (8 %) audiograms in the <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> group. Characteristic audiogram configurations in the <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> patient group were: type 1 (N= 66; 25. 2 %), type 2 (N= 71; 27. 1 %), and type 3 (N= 68; 25. 9 %).

40|$|Hearing loss {{induced by}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> {{is a common}} {{handicap}} for the human population. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> triggers a cascade {{of changes in the}} cochlea such as a direct mechanical damage of sensory hair cells, biochemical disturbances including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exitotoxicity. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> can result in transient or permanent hearing loss depending on the physical and temporal characteristics of the acoustic stimulation as well as individual susceptibility. Interestingly, <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> triggers not only damaging, but also protective mechanisms in the cochlea such as the up-regulation of antioxidants, glucocorticoids and neurotrophins. The overall goal {{of the present study was}} to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and their interactions with the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The results demonstrate that GR plays an unequivocal role in modulating auditory sensitivity. In a GR-dependent manner, the p 38 pathway is activated after restraint stress, and ERKs are down-regulated after restraint stress followed by <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma.</b> ERKs and p 38, as well as c-jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs) regulate cell recovery and cell death. Cell recovery after <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> correlates with a down-regulation of p 38 and an up-regulation of ERKs and JNKs 24 h post trauma. In contrast, hair cell loss is accompanied by immediate post-traumatic up-regulation of all three MAPKs. A critical factor for protecting against cochlear trauma includes GR and ERK interactions and the down-stream activation of the otoprotective neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is up-regulated in the cochlea after <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma,</b> and the duration of its elevation correlate with the pattern of ERKs activation and the severity of cochlea damage. BDNF acts through receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB followed by the downstream activation of ERKs and p 38 cascades. Severe <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> leads to a down-regulation of the truncated form of TrkB thus probably providing a more robust activation of the full-length TrkB, the main mediator of BDNF-induced protective effects. The knowledge of the glucocorticoids and MAPKs cellular mechanisms are of a great importance for clinical audiology since it opens new avenues for the prevention and treatment of hearing loss. These data will help to understand the nature of individual sensitivity to <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> since hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis status is now demonstrated to be a critical factor for determining the overall sensitivity to <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma...</b>|$|E

Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, which is the key regulator for almost all kind of neuroendocine function and behavior, is highly susceptible to prenatal exposure to excess GC during development. While GC is necessary for normal activity of HPA axis, prenatal exposure to excess endogenous or exogenous GC can adversely affects the stability of HPA axis. Like any other systems of the body, auditory system also sensitive to prenatal GC induced programming of the HPA axis. The main goal of this thesis is to determine the relationship between the programming effect of the HPA axis and auditory system by prenatal synthetic GC, dexamethasone (DEX) in the final week gestation, and responses to an audiogenic stressor in the adult offspring. DEX in the late gestation was shown to increase the susceptibility of the inner ear to <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> in the adult offspring. Acute auditory brainstem response thresholds were not different between the age-matched groups. However, when measured at 48 h and 4 week postexposure, the DEX treated rats showed little or no recovery from the trauma. In addition, <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> resulted in a massive outer hair cell loss in the DEX rats compared to minor loss in the normal rats. To determine whether oxidative stress plays a role in the recovery phase of <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma,</b> the free radical scavenger PBN (100 mg/kg) was administered before, during and several times after noise exposure. PBN treatment significantly reduced the physiological and morphological cochlear differences, which were observed between DEX and control rats after <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma.</b> Prenatal synthetic GC was also involved in long-term effects on the adult offspring HPA function and persistent behavioral disorders. DEX in the final week of gestation and adult exposure to an <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> in the offspring was shown to alter the resposiveness of the HPA axis. Stereological quantification of neuronal protein expression (glucocorticoid receptor, GR) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) demonstrated gender-related differences in the basal protein expression, as well as its responsiveness to acoustic stress. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> caused a robust responsiveness of GR expression and nuclear translocation in DEX females. Gender-related behavioral difference was also evidenced in the offspring of prenatal DEX treated adults, DEX males exhibited increase level of anxiety in the elevatedplus maze.

Also it is important to prevent the development of severe lesions and disability of acoustic analyzer. In this context it is important to study not only the state of various parts of the auditory system, but also the data of the organs and systems activity, that influence the auditory analyzer - extra-aural violations. The article presents the characteristics of auditory function of 59 patients with acoustic traumawho were in the ATO zone. Cerebral blood flow and brain activity was studied by methods of rheoencephalography (REG) and electroencephalography (EEG) {{with the help of a}} computer analyzing system «DX - system" (Ukraine). Researches have shown that patients with <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> who were in the ATO zone had pronounced violations in the bioelectrical brain activity and cerebral hemodynamics.

In the surveyed patients there were identified processes of cortical rhythms desynchronization, their disorganization and tendency to zonal difference smoothness, percentage distortionof basic EEG rhythms as compared to the norm, reduction of the alpha-rhythm and growth slow of wave activity, especially in the front projections; is testifies to dysfunction primarily of stem-diencephalic brain structures.

According to REG in the studied patients with <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> who were in the ATO zone, we found significant changes in cerebral blood flow. Along with difficulty of the venous outflow, increased cerebral vascular tonus, vasoconstriction phenomena typical to SHL, instability cases (47, 5 %) and decrease (42, 4 %) of cerebral vascular tonus, were revealed, this distinguishes this SHL type from other ones. The obtained data will be useful in the diagnosis and target treatment of patients with <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> because they takes into account extra-aural changes and help to improve therapeutic and preventive measures effectiveness.

However, there are not many studies on <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma,</b> although this problem has recently become more and more important. Objective: A comparison of subjective audiometry in patients with sensorineural hearing loss after acute <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> and chronic noise exposure. Materials and methods. In the work the results of exa¬mination of 84 patients with <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma,</b> 15 healthy as the control group and 15 workers employed on 'noise' occupations as a comparison group are given. Subjective audiometry was fully carried out by clinical audiometer AC- 40 «Interacoustics» (Denmark). Hearing indices were investigated in the conventional (0, 125 - 8) kHz and extended (9 - 16) kHz frequency bands. Results: Subjective audiometry showed a reduction in sound perception in all patients. Ac¬cor¬ding to the threshold tone audiometry in patients with <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> hearing thresholds were authentically (P < 0, 05) increased by 4, 6 and 8 kHz tones of conventional (0, 125 - 8) kHz frequency band and by 14 - 16 kHz tones of the extended (9 - 16 kHz) in comparison with the control group, as with workers employed on noise occupations. All the examined patients had deterioration of speech-test audiometry and above-threshold audiometry. Conclusions: According to su¬b¬jective audiometry, the type similar disorders of auditory function are in patients with <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> as in patients with long-term noise exposure, but they are more pronounced and develop much faster. The most informative features which show the origin and progression of hearing loss in patients with <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> are: increasing hearing thresholds by 14 and 16 kHz tones of the extended (9 - 16 kHz) frequency band and by 4, 6 and 8 kHz tones of con¬ven¬tional (0, 125 - 8) kHz frequency band plus the reduction of differential thresholds (DT) according to the Lusher’s method at 4 kHz...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothalamic}} pituitary adrenal axis (HPA axis) regulates {{nearly all}} neuroendocrine {{responses of the}} body. An active HPA axis is crucial to maintaining homeostasis. An altered reactivity of the HPA axis can affect several physiological systems including the auditory system. The mechanism underlying {{the interaction between the}} HPA axis and the auditory system is not known. The overall objective of this thesis was to define the functional relationship between the HPA axis and the auditory system and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate how the cochlea is protected against <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> with previous activation of HPA axis. Activation of the HPA axis with either restraint stress or sound conditioning prior to <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> significantly elevates plasma corticosterone, activates GRs in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) and significantly lowers ABR threshold shifts. This protective effect was block by either adrenalectomy or combine use of glueocorticoid synthesis inhibitor (metyrapone) or receptor antagonist (RU 486). Moreover, the combined use of metyrapone and RU 486 prior to <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> leads to the exacerbation of hearing loss indicating that an optimal HPA axis response is crucial for the recovery from trauma. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFêB), a GR regulated transcription factor, was also involved in this corticosterone mediated protective mechanism. Enhancement of nuclear translocation of NFê 13 in the spiral ganglion neurons coincides with lower ABR threshold shifts indicating an interaction between GR and NFê 13 in the SGNs. This can be the main factor, which contributes to the protection of cochlea against <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma.</b> A selective NFêB inhibitor PDTC was use to confirm the role of NFêB in the cochlea. Pretreatment of PDTC caused an elevation of auditory thresholds and lowered nuclear translocation of NFêB in the SGNs. Steroid receptor co activator 1 (SRC- 1), a GR co- regulatory protein also contributes to this GR mediated protective mechanism of hearing. The expression of SRC 1 in the SGN was increase after sound conditioning and <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma,</b> which could be the probable mechanism of sound conditioning triggered protection of hearing. In conclusion, the findings from this study imply that the HPA axis modulates the sensitivity of the cochlea against <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> by the release of glucocorticoid. Glueocorticoid regulates the expression and activation of GR locally in the cochlea. Active GR interacts with transcription factor NFêB and this interaction ultimately determines the susceptibility of cochlea against <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of hearing loss and tinnitus, {{particularly}} in industrial environments. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) results in direct mechanical damage as well as in indirect metabolic processes. Metabolic disorders have multiple origins: ionic, ischemic, excitotoxic and production of cochlear free radicals causing cell death, due to necrosis or apoptosis. The efficacy of magnesium, administered either to prevent or to treat NIHL has been demonstra-ted in several studies in animals and in humans. Magnesium, which easily crosses the hematocochlear barrier, presents neuroprotective and vasodilatory effects, and thus, is able to limit the cochlear damage. Magnesium therapy is well documented because it is usually prescribed in other pathologies. Its side effects and contraindi-cations are few and it is cheap. This article presents also some arguments that emphasize the interest of magnesium therapy in <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma.</b> Key words: <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma,</b> guinea pig, cochlea, magnesium, noise-induced hearing loss According to 2005 estimates by the World Healt...|$|E
40|$|Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) {{is a growing}} health issue, with costly {{treatment}} and lost quality of life. Here we establish Drosophila melanogaster as an inexpensive, flexible, and powerful genetic model system for NIHL. We exposed flies to <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> and quantified physiological and anatomical effects. Trauma significantly reduced sound-evoked potential (SEP) amplitudes and increased SEP latencies in control genotypes. SEP amplitude but not latency effects recovered after 7 d. Although trauma produced no gross morphological changes in the auditory organ (Johnston’s organ), mitochondrial cross-sectional area was reduced 7 d after exposure. In nervana 3 heterozygous flies, which slightly compromise ion homeostasis, trauma had exaggerated effects on SEP amplitude and mitochondrial morphology, suggesting a key role for ion homeostasis in resistance to <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma.</b> Thus, Drosophila exhibit <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> effects resembling those found in vertebrates, including inducing metabolic stress in sensory cells. This report of noise trauma in Drosophila is a foundation for studying molecular and genetic sequelae of NIHL...|$|E
40|$|Next to {{elevated}} hearing thresholds, {{noise exposure}} {{can also cause}} ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and hyperacusis, {{a condition in which}} normal sounds are being perceived as too loud. At present there are no treatments available that consistently cure tinnitus and hyperacusis, partly because the underlying mechanisms of these conditions are not yet completely understood. In this dissertation, the neurophysiological consequences of <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> are studied. The balance between excitation and inhibition in the central auditory nervous system is disrupted as a result of <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma.</b> In particular, a decreased inhibition in neurons that respond to frequencies below the trauma frequency are responsible for this. Further, <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> causes an increased amplification of the signal in the brain. This is both determined by measuring the auditory brain stem response as well as by measuring neural responses to amplitude modulated sound. The disrupted balance between excitation and inhibition, and the amplification of the signal in the brain may underlie neuropathology of tinnitus and hyperacusis. To investigate this, the present thesis describes a possible new method to demonstrate whether an animal experiences tinnitus or hyperacusis. These results could {{contribute to the development of}} an animal model in which a direct relationship can be established between the neurophysiological consequences of <b>acoustic</b> <b>trauma</b> and the presence of tinnitus or hyperacusis. Such an animal model can be used for the development of new treatments...|$|E
