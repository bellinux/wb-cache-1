5|$|Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Caliphate's survival.|$|E
5|$|Hedgehogs are not {{native to}} the Outer Hebrides—they were {{introduced}} in the 1970s to reduce garden pests—and their spread poses <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eggs of ground nesting wading birds. In 2003, Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of hedgehogs in the area although these were halted in 2007 due to protests; trapped animals were instead relocated to the mainland.|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{introduced}} feral {{dogs were}} <b>a</b> great <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species on Isabela, {{but they have}} since been eradicated from the island.

Fishing with nets poses <b>a</b> current <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species; this not only reduces {{the availability of the}} cormorant's food, but also often results in birds becoming caught in the nets and killed.|$|R

5|$|Human {{activities}} such as encroachment of settlements, agriculture, and hunting in rural areas poses <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Natal red rock hare, due to which its population is decreasing. Since the 1900s, more than 21% to 50% of its habitat has been destroyed, which is predicted to remain between 21% and 50% till 2022, decreasing its population by 20% or more by then.|$|E
5|$|In the northwest, the Fan {{fire started}} on June 25 and was {{originally}} considered <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town of Gardiner, Montana, {{just outside the}} park's north entrance.

5|$|Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, {{were not}} <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Puerto Rican parrot {{population}} {{when it was}} more readily self-maintaining, {{but as a result}} of the fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now a threat as well. Hurricane Hugo passed through the species' range in September 1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Some {{claim that}} {{swooping}} {{can be prevented}} by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} controversy over hedgehogs on the Uists. Hedgehogs are not {{native to the}} islands, but were introduced in the 1970s to reduce garden pests.

In 2003 Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of hedgehogs in the area, but these were halted in 2007; trapped animals are now relocated to the mainland.|$|E

5|$|When Axis forces posed <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle East in the Second World War, the Haganah {{organized}} a full-time, elite force, the Palmach.

5|$|Abd el-Hamid {{meanwhile}} {{reported the}} dire situation of his forces at 5:30 PM on October 17. The 16th Brigade {{had been in}} heavy combat for three consecutive days – ammunition was becoming scarce, and the brigade was heavily outnumbered and outgunned due to its losses, including the destruction of its artillery units. Abd el-Hamid received orders from 16th Division headquarters to retreat. His brigade abandoned its Chinese Farms positions and reinforced {{the lines of the}} 18th Mechanized Brigade to the north during the night of October 17/18. This finally opened the Tirtur and Akavish roads to Israeli forces, ensuring Operation Abiray-Lev would proceed. Missouri remained in Egyptian hands though, posing <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Israeli corridor to the canal.|$|E
5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers vary greatly per year. The amount of Pilot Whales killed each year is not believed to be <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sustainability of the population, but the brutal appearance of the hunt has resulted in international criticism especially from animal welfare organisations.|$|E

5|$|As the {{hurricane}} turned northward and {{was seen as}} <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian Islands, officials in the Papahanaumokuakea requested that all 17personnel in the region be evacuated. Several days before the storm passed through the islands, an AC-130 aircraft was flown to the area and evacuated the people stationed on Tern Island, while a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration vessel evacuated the temporary residents on Laysan Island. Hurricane Neki caused relatively little damage in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. All of the structures were undamaged; however, two small natural habitat islands, Round and Disappearing Islands, were affected substantially. The former lost some land area and the latter was completely washed away.|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks is a {{compilation}} of 22 uncredited, untitled Cambodian psychedelic and garage rock songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the tracks were recorded, musicians in the thriving music scene were combining Western rock and pop genres with their own styles and techniques. When the Khmer Rouge {{came to power in}} 1975, artists were among those viewed as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> regime's agrarian socialist vision, and several of the performers on the album are believed to have been among those killed during the ensuing Cambodian Genocide of 1975-1979. Little information about them or their creative output has survived.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highly populated region.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Amphipolis, the Chalkidian League, led by Olynthos, began to fear Philip's {{territorial}} ambitions (since Amphipolis also controlled access to Chalkidiki), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him. However, the Athenians still hoped to receive Amphipolis from Philip and so refused. Philip himself feared an alliance of the powerful Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved to reassure the Olynthians by offering them an alliance on very advantageous terms. As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of Potidea, located in {{the territory of the}} Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that time under the control of Athens, and represented <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stability of the league.|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{show that}} up to 500,000people living in the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 {{individuals}} being considered to be at high risk. Lahars pose <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchina, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating {{that the threat of}} a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall.|$|E
