50|$|Streptomyces canus is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Streptomyces {{which has been}} isolated from soil in the USA. Streptomyces canus produces resistomycin, tetracenomycin D, amphomycin, <b>aspartocin</b> D and <b>aspartocin</b> E.|$|E
30|$|Actinobacteria especially, {{species of}} the genus Streptomyces are {{reported}} to produce diverse antimicrobial lipopeptides with their applications in pharmaceutical industries. Amphomycin was the first lipopeptide to be discovered from Actinoplanes friuliensis, followed {{by a number of}} related antibiotics, including crystallomycin, <b>aspartocin,</b> glumamycin, laspartomycin, tsushimycin, and the best studied so far, daptomycin (Schneider et al. [2009]). As apparently 99 % of the microbial species are still unexplored (Davies [1999]; Watve et al. [2001]) therefore, possibility of discovering actinobacteria producing potent and novel lipopeptides still remains. In the light of this, present study was aimed at purification and characterization of a novel antimicrobial lipopeptide produced by Streptomyces amritsarensis.|$|E
40|$|Three lipocyclopeptides, aspartocins A (1), B (2), and C (3), were {{obtained}} from the <b>aspartocin</b> complex by reversed-phase HPLC separation. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic studies coupled with the previously published chemical degradation results. All three compounds, 1, 2, and 3, share the same cyclic decapeptide core of cyclo(Dab 2 -Pip 3 -MeAsp 4 -Asp 5 -Gly 6 -Asp 7 -Gly 8 -Dab 9 -Val 10 -Pro 11 -). They differ only in the side chain moiety corresponding to Asp 1 -isotetradecenoic acid, Asp 1 -anteisotetradecenoic acid, and Asp 1 -isotridecenoic acid for aspartocins A, B, and C, respectively. The cyclic substructure of aspartocins contains two D-amino acid residues, and the geometry of the peptide linkages appears to be all trans including the two tertiary amide bonds. The result is consistent with the hypothesis that a normal peptide to be cyclic requires D-configured residues or cis amide bond(s) incorporated...|$|E
30|$|Antimicrobial lipopeptides {{have been}} {{purified}} from many bacterial genera including several Streptomyces spp. such as S. violaceus var. aspartocinius (<b>aspartocin),</b> S. griseoflavus (tsushimycin), S. viridochromogens (laspartomycin), S. coelicolor (calcium-dependent antibiotic), S. roseosporus (daptomycin), S. fradiae (A 54145), S. parvulus var. parvuli (parvuline) and S. canus (amphomycin) (Schneider et al. [2009]). The present study reports {{the production of}} another novel lipopeptide from a Streptomyces sp. The primary structure of lipopeptide was determined {{using a combination of}} chemical reactions and mass spectrometry techniques. It consists of six amino acids linked to aliphatic chain of -(CH 2) 7 -CH 2 -(CH 3) 2 and a long tail of fatty acid chain with six times repeated the molecular mass of 161  Da which is corresponding to -C 12 H 19. Based on structure and molecular weight (878.5  Da), it is different from already reported lipopeptides viz. daptomycin (1620.6  Da), <b>aspartocin</b> (1317  Da), glumamycin (1290.4  Da), tsushimycin (1304.7  Da) and arylomycin A 6 (867.4  Da). Lipopeptides vary in their amino acid and/or fatty acid composition and all these variations in length and branching of the fatty acid chains and amino acid substitutions lead to remarkable lipopeptide diversity and activities. Generally, they are reported to be thermostable, resistant to proteolytic enzymes and inhibit the growth of microorganism by altering the membrane integrity (Mandal et al. [2013]). Similarly, lipopeptide in the present study is found to be completely stable for 1  h at 70 °C, retaining 81.8 % activity even after autoclaving (121 °C for 15  min). It exhibits absolute activity over a broad pH range of 5.0 – 9.0 and found to be resistant to hydrolytic enzymes: trypsin, proteinase K and lipase. Similarly, paenibacterin, an antimicrobial lipopeptide produced by Paneibacillus sp. strain is reported to be resistant to trypsin and lipase enzymes (Guo et al. [2012]). The strong antibacterial activity of the present lipopeptide can be related to the carbon chain length (C 12) of the lipid tail as bactericidal activity of the lipopeptides depends upon the length of the lipid tail. Safety evaluation of the lipopeptide demonstrates its non-cytotoxic and non-mutagenic nature which is a prerequisite for development of a drug.|$|E
