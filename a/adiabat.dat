To do this, generally, the parcel is lifted from {{the portion of the}} planetary boundary layer (PBL) that lies below the morning inversion.

50|$|Observations {{that can}} be used to infer the {{temperature}} of Earth's interior range from the oldest rocks on Earth to modern seismic images of the inner core size. Ancient volcanic rocks can be associated with a depth and temperature of melting through their geochemical composition. Using this technique and some geological inferences about the conditions under which the rock is preserved, the temperature of the mantle can be inferred. The mantle itself is fully convective, so that the temperature in the mantle is basically constant with depth outside the top and bottom thermal boundary layers. This is not quite true because the temperature in any convective body under pressure must increase along an <b>adiabat,</b> but the adiabatic temperature gradient is usually much smaller than the temperature jumps at the boundaries. Therefore, the mantle is usually associated with a single or potential temperature that refers to the mid-mantle temperature extrapolated along the <b>adiabat</b> to the surface. The potential temperature of the mantle is estimated to be about 1350 C today. There is an analogous potential temperature of the core but since there are no samples from the core its present-day temperature relies on extrapolating the temperature along an <b>adiabat</b> from the inner core boundary, where the iron solidus is somewhat constrained.|$|E

50|$|The {{usual way}} {{of finding the}} LFC is to lift a parcel from a lower level along the dry {{adiabatic}} lapse rate until it crosses the mixing ratio line of the parcel: this is the lifted condensation level (LCL). From there on, follow the moist adiabatic lapse rate until the temperature of the parcel reaches the air mass temperature, at the equilibrium level (EL). If the temperature of the parcel along the moist <b>adiabat</b> is warmer than the environment on further lift, one has found the LFC.|$|E

50|$|A more {{realistic}} {{description of the}} uppermost part of the convection zone is possible through detailed three-dimensional and time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations, taking into account radiative transfer in the atmosphere. Such simulations successfully reproduce the observed surface structure of solar granulation, as well as detailed profiles of lines in the solar radiative spectrum, {{without the use of}} parametrized models of turbulence. The simulations only cover a very small fraction of the solar radius, and are evidently far too time-consuming to be included in general solar modeling. Extrapolation of an averaged simulation through the adiabatic part of the convection zone by means of a model based on the mixing-length description, demonstrated that the <b>adiabat</b> predicted by the simulation was essentially consistent with the depth of the solar convection zone as determined from helioseismology. An extension of mixing-length theory, including effects of turbulent pressure and kinetic energy, based on numerical simulations of near-surface convection, has been developed.|$|E
40|$|We derive exact {{results for}} {{the rate of change}} of {{thermodynamic}} quantities, in particular the configurational specific heat at constant volume, C_V, along configurational <b>adiabats</b> (curves of constant excess entropy S_ex). Such curves are designated isomorphs for so-called Roskilde liquids, in view of the invariance of various structural and dynamical quantities along them. Their slope in a double logarithmic representation of the density-temperature phase diagram, γ can be interpreted as one third of an effective inverse power-law potential exponent. We show that in liquids where γ increases (decreases) with density, the contours of C_V have smaller (larger) slope than configurational <b>adiabats.</b> We clarify also the connection between γ and the pair potential. A fluctuation formula for the slope of the C_V-contours is derived. The theoretical results are supported with data from computer simulations of two systems, the Lennard-Jones fluid and the Girifalco fluid. The sign of dγ/dρ is thus a third key parameter in characterizing Roskilde liquids, after γ and the virial-potential energy correlation coefficient R. To go beyond isomorph theory we compare invariance of a dynamical quantity, the self-diffusion coefficient along <b>adiabats</b> and C_V-contours, finding it more invariant along <b>adiabats...</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{calculated}} that, for an Earth-sized object with a kilobar atmospheric pressure of hydrogen, {{in which a}} convective gas <b>adiabat</b> has formed, geothermal energy from residual core radioisotope decay will maintain a surface temperature above the melting point of water. Thus, it is proposed that interstellar planetary bodies with extensive liquid-water oceans may exist. It is further suggested that these planets are likely to remain geologically active for long periods, providing there is a geodynamo-created protective magnetosphere, with possible sea floor volcanism (hydrothermal vents) providing an energy source for life. Thus theoretically, humans might live on a planet without a sun, although food sources would be limited. The author admits these bodies {{would be difficult to}} detect due to the intrinsically weak thermal microwave radiation emissions emanating from the lower reaches of the atmosphere, although later research suggests that reflected solar radiation and far-IR thermal emissions may be detectable if such an object were to pass within 1000 AU of Earth. A study of simulated planet ejection scenarios has suggested that around 5% of Earth-sized planets with Moon-sized natural satellites would retain their satellites after ejection. A large satellite would be a source of significant geological tidal force heating.|$|E
40|$|In the {{analysis}} of impedance-match experiments, the release <b>adiabat</b> of the standard material is often approximated by reflecting the Hugoniot in the pressure-particle velocity (P-UP) plane. In cases {{where it has been}} tested experimentally, this reflected shock approximation (RSA) {{has been found to be}} fairly accurate at pressures as high as 100 GPa. The success of the RSA is usually attributed to the lack of thermal effects, i. e., that the Hugoniot and release <b>adiabat</b> are nearly identical in the pressure-density (P-rho) plane. This report demonstrates that this explanation is not correct. The success of the RSA does not arise from the absence of thermal effects [...] it arises because of thermal effects. When the Hugoniot and <b>adiabat</b> are identical in the P-rho plane, the <b>adiabat</b> lies below the reflected Hugoniot when mapped into the P-UP plane. Material strength effects also cause the exact <b>adiabat</b> to lie below the RSA. A thermal offset between the Hugoniot and the <b>adiabat</b> compensates for these two effects, so that the RSA turns out to give good results for many materials, even at high pressures. However, this fortuitous cancellation of errors does not occur in all cases. This report shows that the RSA is not accurate for two "soft" materials, Teflon and PMMA, and for a high-strength material, tungsten. The issues discussed here apply to use of the RSA at low pressures, not to very high pressures, where it is already well-known to be inaccurate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of vibrational nonequilibrium sustained by an external heat source on the shock wave structure is investigated. The gas with stationary nonequilibrium has the five {{fields of the}} nonequilibrium degree S with qualitatively different acoustical properties. Nonequilibrium leads to the strong modification of shock waves. The shock wave <b>adiabat</b> for a nonequilibrium gas with an exponential relaxation law is constructed. Unlike the frozen <b>adiabat,</b> this <b>adiabat</b> has two branches. Possible shock wave structures are described in S –D bifurcation diagram (D is the stationary wave speed). Weak shock waves are unstable. They disintegrate into sequence of the self-sustaining waves. Two types of the self-sustained waves (the pulse and the wave with non-zero asymptote) are obtained...|$|E

For QCE cycles in which nonadiabatic dissipation and time spent on two <b>adiabats</b> are included, the efficiency $\eta_m$ at maximum power output is bounded from above by $\frac{\eta_{_C}}{ 2 -\eta_{_C}}$ and from below by $\frac{\eta_{_C}} 2 $.
