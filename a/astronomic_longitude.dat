50|$|The {{deflection}} of {{the vertical}} has a north-south component ξ and an east-west component η. The value of ξ is the astronomic latitude minus the geodetic latitude (taking north latitudes {{to be positive}} and south latitudes to be negative); the latter is usually calculated by geodetic network coordinates. The value of η is the <b>astronomic</b> <b>longitude</b> minus the geodetic longitude (taking east longitudes to be positive and west longitudes to be negative). When a new mapping datum replaces the old, with new geodetic latitudes and longitudes on a new ellipsoid, the calculated vertical deflections will change too.|$|E
40|$|Summary. In {{the present}} note we express the ‘natural ’ {{covariant}} and contra-variant moving frames {{in the actual}} gravity field of the Earth {{in terms of a}} ‘normal ‘ and a ‘disturbing ’ part, the latter being expressed by the components of the deflection of the vertical and of the disturbing potential at P. An elementary displacement of a point P i n the actual gravity field of the Earth is expressed by the d. ifferential relation where x * being the natural coordinates (see Marussi 1949), x * l = @ (astronomic latitude), x* ’ = A (<b>astronomic</b> <b>longitude),</b> x* ’ = W (actual geopotential) and v * the local covariant natural frame giving, in general, the displacement reference frame; vf directed towards the actual meridian, v; towards the actual parallel and v: towards the actual isozenithal. Here the term ‘actual ’ has the meaning of the term ‘geodetic ’ used by Marussi 1952. v * = v t s v Decomposing v * and x * in a normal and a disturbing part (2) x * = x + 6 x (3 1 where, and from now on, the terms without asterisks are the normal part, referred to a uniquely defined model field, e. g. the Somigliana-Pizzetti ellipsoidal type of normal field, and the terms with 6 the disturbing part; (1) is written dP = (v t 6 v) T (dx t d 6 x...|$|E
40|$|Geodesy is {{a science}} whose goal is to {{determine}} the whole or part of earth’s shape. To determine its shape in other words to be showed in a coordinate system, we must obtain information with observations at proper points which are on physical surface. Among the information, there is also information obtained from astronomical observations which are done to celestial bodies. Geographical positions of earth’s points can be obtained both astronomic and geodetic. <b>Astronomic</b> latitudes and <b>longitudes),</b> (ΛΦ are achieved by astronomic observations. Geodetic latitudes and longitudes),φ (λ are geographical coordinates relating to be chosen ellipsoid and today they can be achieved by GPS technology easily. Satellite based positioning technique GPS is widely used in engineering measurements and practical geodetic applications. In this study, astronomic observations and GPS observations have been done in 7 points of a network with 17 points which has been established in the campus area of Karadeniz Technical University. So, both astronomic and geodetic latitudes – longitudes have been determined in these 7 points. In addition, astronomic and geodetic latitude – longitude values which belong the same points have been compared by each other. PS 5. 6 – Geodetic Infrastructure and Theor...|$|R
