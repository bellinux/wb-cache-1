5|$|After {{its last}} {{performance}} at the Gaiety in 1872, Thespis appears to have remained unperformed until 1953, <b>although</b> <b>an</b> attempted reconstruction from the 1940s has been discovered. Tillett and Spencer, who discovered the ballet music, identified twenty separate reconstructions of Thespis between 1953 and 2002. About half of these use music adapted from Sullivan's other works; the others use new music {{for all but the}} surviving songs, or, in a few cases, re-compose those as well. No version has become predominant in recent productions.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Baker {{lost much}} of his savings in the Panic of 1907 and could only afford to send {{one of his sons}} to college. Thornton agreed to let his talented younger brother {{continue}} his education, a sacrifice that Hobey Baker never forgot. <b>Although</b> <b>an</b> above-average student, Baker stayed an extra year at St. Paul's in 1909 to allow his father another year to save money. By the time Baker left St. Paul's, his sporting achievements had helped make him one of the school's most popular students.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>an</b> RST cannot {{distinguish}} GAS infection from asymptomatic carriage of the organism, most authorities recommend antibiotic {{treatment in}} the event of a positive RST result from a person with a sore throat. US guidelines recommend following up a negative result with a microbial culture, whereas European guidelines suggest relying on the negative RST.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>an</b> earlier {{organization}} {{included a}} divisional anti-tank battalion (two companies of 37mm guns and one company of 75 mm guns), in December 1941 these AT battalions {{were removed from}} the divisional structure and reorganized as independent tank destroyer battalions; their towed guns were replaced with self-propelled ones as soon as the latter became available.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>an</b> {{extremely}} competent administrator, {{there were}} reservations within the New Zealand government following Godley's appointment as {{commander of the}} division. Allen, although publicly supportive of Godley, privately believed an alternative commander should be found after the division completed its training. Godley was a distant and remote divisional commander, not popular with most soldiers of his command. He also favoured the professional officers of the NZEF, {{most of whom were}} seconded from the British Army, over those drawn from the Territorial Force.|$|E

5|$|Archpriests {{and priests}} {{would use a}} less ornate mantle in their arms, and an ecclesiastical hat of the style they wear liturgically. <b>Although</b> <b>an</b> Orthodox monk (not an abbot) {{displaying}} personal arms is rare, a hieromonk (monk who has been ordained a priest) would appropriately display a monastic hat (klobuk) and a black cloak or veil suggestive of his attire, and a hierodeacon (monastic deacon) would display an orarion behind the shield.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{existing}} infantry battalions of the Citizens Force were redesignated {{to perpetuate the}} numerical designations of the AIF, and <b>although</b> <b>an</b> {{attempt was made to}} allocate these designations based on regional considerations, ultimately this was not always possible and ultimately when the 3rd Division was re-established, only two of its component battalions—the 37th and 39th Battalions—had previously been assigned to the division.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s Adkins {{had gained}} a cult {{following}} and began touring regularly, receiving offers from more record labels. In 1994 Miles Copeland III of I.R.S. Records purchased {{the rights to}} Adkins' recordings, and <b>although</b> <b>an</b> album was planned for release, it never materialized. Frustrated, Adkins soon gained back rights {{to some of his}} songs after a deal with Mississippi blues label Fat Possum, who recorded and released 1999's What The Hell Was I Thinking? and booked him a tour alongside T-Model Ford and Elmo Williams.|$|E

5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that <b>although</b> <b>an</b> original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside was {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Greece's mountainous terrain {{favored a}} {{defensive}} strategy {{and the high}} ranges of the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities. However, air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles. <b>Although</b> <b>an</b> invading force from Albania could be stopped by {{a relatively small number}} of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult to defend against an attack from the north.|$|E

5|$|Hostilities {{between the}} English and Dutch in 1664 {{led to a}} change in {{government}} policy: colonial governors were now authorised to issue letters of marque against the Dutch.

5|$|Juveniles have a 43% {{chance of}} {{surviving}} their first year, and the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years, <b>although</b> <b>an</b> age of 17years has been recorded. The temperature and rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates {{with the number of}} young fledging each year and their survival rate. Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.|$|E
