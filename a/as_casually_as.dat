For {{it seemed to him}} that to wear any other finery was less beautiful, and that to put on ornaments or arms made of gold worked by hammering, stamping, or by other means, was a vulgar and common thing.In the Muisca territories, there were a number of natural locations considered sacred, including lakes, rivers, forests and large rocks. People gathered here to perform rituals and sacrifices mostly with gold and emeralds. Important lakes were Lake Guatavita, Lake Iguaque, Lake Fúquene, Lake Tota, the Siecha Lakes, Lake Teusacá and Lake Ubaque.|$|E
500|$|Nico {{had made}} her {{recording}} debut in 1965 with the single [...] "I'm Not Sayin'"; at Andy Warhol's suggestion she joined The Velvet Underground as a chanteuse, and sang three tracks on their 1967 album The Velvet Underground & Nico. Nico and the group were regulars at the Factory. However, Lou Reed was reluctant to include her in the band. This, coupled with her {{desire to be a}} soloist, made Nico leave the group <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> she had joined. The band members continued to accompany her as she performed on her own and played on her 1967 solo debut, Chelsea Girl. The folk-pop album included songs by Bob Dylan, Tim Hardin, and Jackson Browne (with whom Nico had a brief affair).|$|E
2500|$|Kate Zernike of The New York Times {{described}} M.B. {{as having}} [...] "close-cropped hair", not dressed <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> on September 19, 2010, but his [...] "hair and bearing much the same" [...] {{as in the}} Rutgers dormitory surveillance camera photo.

5000|$|Music critic Johnny Lofthus, {{writing for}} Allmusic, praised the album, calling it [...] "homey and gorgeous" [...] and calling Harmer's voice [...] "starkly beautiful." [...] "There's fully formed adult {{alternative}} stuff here, from the robust head-nod lilt of 'Almost' to 'New Enemy's more stately melody... This immediacy helps sell All of Our Names, since music {{like this can}} be smothered by over-production." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3 of 5 stars, stating it is [...] "suffused with a peaceful fatalism, a mood that's <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> downbeat <b>as</b> Harmer's overcast voice itself." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1931 Frederick Griffith coauthored a {{paper on}} acute tonsillitis—its sequelae, epidemiology, and bacteriology. In 1934, Griffith {{reported}} voluminous findings on the serological typing of Streptococcus pyogenes. More <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> well as medically called simply streptococcus, S pyogenes is implicated in conditions ranging from the usually minor strep throat, to the sometimes fatal scarlet fever, to the often fatal puerperal fever, to the usually fatal streptococcal sepsis. Streptococcal infection was a frequent coinfection complicating recovery from lobar pneumonia by pneumococci infection.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{before it}} became {{possible}} to simulate molecular dynamics with computers, some undertook {{the hard work of}} trying it with physical models such as macroscopic spheres. The idea was to arrange them to replicate the properties of a liquid. J.D. Bernal said, in 1962: [...] "... I took a number of rubber balls and stuck them together with rods of a selection of different lengths ranging from 2.75 to 4 inches. I tried to do this in the first place <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> possible, working in my own office, being interrupted every five minutes or so and not remembering what I had done before the interruption." ...|$|E
2500|$|Changes {{in fashion}} were {{interpreted}} {{as signs of}} deeper changes in the American feminine ideal. The short skirt and bobbed hair {{were likely to be}} used as a symbol of emancipation. Signs of the moral revolution consisted of premarital sex, birth control, drinking, and contempt for older values. [...] Before the War, a lady did not set foot in a saloon; after the War a woman, though no more [...] "a lady", entered a speakeasy <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> she would go into a railroad station. [...] Women had started swearing and smoking publicly, using contraceptives, raising their skirts above the knee and rolling their hose below it. [...] Women were now competing with men in the business world and obtaining financial independence and, therefore, other kinds of independence from men.|$|E

He composed <b>as</b> easily and <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> he spoke.".Shamsur Rahman Faruqi in his research and published Essay [...] "How to read Iqbal?" [...] provided a comparison of Iqbal with Nazeer Akbarabadi, by saying that [...] "Iqbal was placed better because he had, among others, Bedil (1644-1720) in Persian and Mir Anis (1802-1874) in Urdu." [...] He further asserts: [...] "The mention of Mir Anis may surprise some of us until we realize it that Mir Anis’s Marsiyas are the best premodern model in Urdu of narrative-historical, narrative-lyrical, and oral-dramatic poetry, and Iqbal’s poetry extends and exploits the possibilities created by Anis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now for my request," [...] rejoined Lady Blakeney {{in a more}} quiet, more matter-of-fact tone of voice. [...] "You must {{represent}} me, here, when I am gone: explain <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> and <b>as</b> naturally as you can, that I {{have gone}} to join my husband on his yacht for a few days. Lucie, my maid, is devoted and a tower of secrecy; she will stand {{between you and the}} rest of the household, in concocting some plausible story. To every friend who calls, to anyone of our world whom you may meet, you must tell the same tale, and if you note an air of incredulity in anyone, if you hear whispers of there being some mystery, well! let the world wag its busy tongue--I care less than naught: it will soon tire of me and my doings, and having torn my reputation to shreds will quickly leave me in peace. But to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes," [...] she added earnestly, [...] "tell the whole truth from me. He will understand and do as he thinks right." ...|$|R

5000|$|In essence, Bismarck's colonial {{motives were}} obscure {{as he had}} said {{repeatedly}} [...] "... I am no man for colonies" [...] and [...] "remained as contemptuous of all colonial dreams as ever." [...] However, in 1884 he consented to the acquisition of colonies by the German Empire, {{in order to protect}} trade, to safeguard raw materials and export markets and to take opportunities for capital investment, among other reasons. In the very next year Bismarck shed personal involvement when [...] "he abandoned his colonial drive <b>as</b> suddenly and <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> he had started it" [...] as if he had committed an error in judgment that could confuse the substance of his more significant policies. [...] "Indeed, in 1889, Bismarck tried to give German South-West Africa away to the British. It was, he said, a burden and an expense, and he would like to saddle someone else with it." ...|$|R

6000|$|There {{had been}} no need to reserve the small hours for these ruminations. The next few days were wet and windy; every glance at the {{streaming}} panes cast my mind {{into a sort of}} vacancy. The wind trumpeted smoke into the room; I could fix my mind on nothing. Then the weather faired. There came [...] "a red sky at night," [...] and Spica flashing secrets to me across the darkness; and that supper-time I referred <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> possible to Mr Anon.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, she {{accepted}} his appearances without protest, {{and watched him}} always. He discovered that the meals of the establishment were irregular and fragmentary. They depended chiefly on tea, pickles, and biscuit, as he had suspected from the beginning. The girls were supposed to market week and week about, but they lived, {{with the help of}} a charwoman, <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> the young ravens. Maisie spent most of her income on models, and the other girl revelled in apparatus as refined as her work was rough. Armed with knowledge, dear- bought from the Docks, Dick warned Maisie that the end of semi-starvation meant the crippling of power to work, which was considerably worse than death.|$|E

6000|$|During {{the winter}} of his sixteenth year a brother of Mr. Burns {{returned}} from Kansas, which was then a strange and far-off land, and from him Harold drew vast streams of talk. The boy was insatiate when the plains were under discussion. From this veritable cattleman he secured many new words. With great joy he listened while Mr. Burns spoke of cinches, ropes, corrals, buttes, arroyos and other Spanish-Mexican words which the boys had observed in their dime novels, but which they had never before heard anyone use in common speech. Mr. Burns alluded to an aparejo or an arroyo <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> Jack would say [...] "singletree" [...] or [...] "furrow," [...] and his stories brought the distant plains country very near.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{though he}} was not greatly astonished, Sproatly drew back a pace or two into the shadow, for it became evident that {{there were only two}} courses open to him. He could judiciously {{announce}} his presence by making the door rattle, and then go in and mention <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> possible that Mrs. Hastings and Agatha were in the hotel. He felt that he ought to do it, but there was the difficulty that he could not warn Hawtrey without embarrassing Sally. Sproatly pursed his face up in honest perplexity as it became evident that the situation was a delicate one, and then decided on the alternative. He would go back quietly, and keep Mrs. Hastings out of the room if it could be done.|$|E

60|$|Now Densham was no strategist. He {{had come}} to ask a question, and he was dying to ask it. He knew very well {{that it would not}} do to hurry matters--that he must put it <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> {{possible}} towards the close of his visit. But at the same time, the period of probation, during which he should have been more than usually entertaining, was scarcely a success, and his manner was restless and constrained. Every now and then there were long and unusual pauses, and he continuously and with obvious effort kept bringing back the conversation to the reception last night, in the hope that some remark from her might make the way easier for him. But nothing of the sort happened. The reception had not interested her in the slightest, and she had nothing to say about it, and his pre-occupation at last became manifest. She looked at him curiously after one of those awkward pauses to which she was quite unaccustomed, and his thoughts were evidently far away. As a matter of fact, he was at that moment actually framing the question which he {{had come to}} ask.|$|E
60|$|Horne Fisher had in him {{something}} of the aristocrat, which is very near to the anarchist. It was characteristic of him that he turned into this dark and irregular entry <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> into his own front door, merely thinking {{that it would be}} a short cut to the house. He made his way through the dim wood for some distance and with some difficulty, until there began to shine through the trees a level light, in lines of silver, which he did not at first understand. The next moment he had come out into the daylight at the top of a steep bank, at the bottom of which a path ran round the rim of a large ornamental lake. The sheet of water which he had seen shimmering through the trees was of considerable extent, but was walled in on every side with woods which were not only dark, but decidedly dismal. At one end of the path was a classical statue of some nameless nymph, and at the other end it was flanked by two classical urns; but the marble was weather-stained and streaked with green and gray. A hundred other signs, smaller but more significant, told him that he had come on some outlying corner of the grounds neglected and seldom visited. In the middle of the lake was what appeared to be an island, and on the island what appeared to be meant for a classical temple, not open like a temple of the winds, but with a blank wall between its Doric pillars. We may say it only seemed like an island, because a second glance revealed a low causeway of flat stones running up to it from the shore and turning it into a peninsula. And certainly it only seemed like a temple, for nobody knew better than Horne Fisher that no god had ever dwelt in that shrine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I! I {{tell you}} that the Chancellor gave it to me, gave it to me with his own hands, willingly,--pressed it upon me. No, don't scoff!" [...] he went on quickly. [...] "Listen! This is a genuine thing. The Chancellor's mad. He was lying in a fit when I left the Palace. It will be in all the evening papers. You will hear the boys {{shouting}} it in the streets within a few minutes. Don't interrupt and I'll tell you the whole truth. You can believe me or not, as you like. It makes no odds. I arrived punctually and was shown up into the anteroom. Even from there I could hear loud voices in the inner chamber and I knew that something was up. Presently a little fellow came out to me--a dark-bearded chap with gold-rimmed glasses. He was very polite, introduced himself as the Chancellor's physician, regretted exceedingly that the Chancellor was unwell and could see no one,--the excitement and hard work of the last few days had knocked him out. Well, I stood there arguing as pleasantly as I could about it, {{and then all of a}} sudden the door of the inner room was thrown open. The Chancellor himself stood on the threshold. There was no doubt about his being ill; his face was as pale as parchment, his eyes were simply wild, and his hair was all ruffled as though he had been standing upon his head. He began to talk to the physician in German. I didn't understand him until he began to swear,--then it was wonderful! In the end he brushed them all away and, taking me by the arm, led me right into the inner room. For a long time he went on jabbering away half to himself, and I was wondering how on earth to bring the conversation round to the things I wanted to know about. Then, all of a sudden, he turned to me and seemed to remember who I was and what I wanted. 'Ah!' he said, 'you are Dorward, the American journalist. I remember you now. Lock the door.' I obeyed him pretty quick, for I had noticed they were mighty uneasy outside, and I was afraid they'd be disturbing us every moment. 'Come and sit down,' he ordered. I did so at once. 'You're a sensible fellow,' he declared. 'To-day every one is worrying me. They think that I am not well. It is foolish. I am quite well. Who would not be well on such a day as this?' I told him that I had never seen him looking better in my life, and he nodded and seemed pleased. 'You have come to hear the truth about the meeting of my master with the Czar and the Emperor of Germany?' he asked. 'That's so,' I told him. 'America's more than a little interested in these things, and I want to know what to tell her.' Then he leaned across the table. 'My young friend,' he said, 'I like you. You are straightforward. You speak plainly and you do not worry me. It is good. You shall tell your country what it is that we have planned, what the things are that are coming. Yours is a great and wise country. When they know the truth, they will remember that Europe is a long way off and that the things which happen there are really no concern of theirs.' 'You are right,' I assured him,--'dead right. Treat us openly, that's all we ask.' 'Shall I not do that, my young friend?' he answered. 'Now look, I give you this.' He fumbled through all his pockets and at last he drew out a long envelope, sealed at both ends with black sealing wax on which was printed a coat of arms with two tigers facing each other. He looked toward the door cautiously, and there was just that gleam in his eyes which madmen always have. 'Here it is,' he whispered, 'written with my own hand. This will tell you exactly what passed this afternoon. It will tell you our plans. It will tell you of the share which my master and the other two are taking. Button it up safely,' he said, 'and, whatever you do, do not let them know outside that you have got it. Between you and me,' he went on, leaning across the table, 'something seems to have happened to them all to-day. There's my old doctor there. He is worrying all the time, but he himself is not well. I can see it whenever he comes near me.' I nodded as though I understood and the Chancellor tapped his forehead and grinned. Then I got up <b>as</b> <b>casually</b> <b>as</b> I could, for I was terribly afraid that he wouldn't let me go. We shook hands, and I tell you his fingers were like pieces of burning coal. Just as I was moving, some one knocked at the door. Then he began to storm again, kicked his chair over, threw a paperweight at the window, and talked such nonsense that I couldn't follow him. I unlocked the door myself and found the doctor there. I contrived to look as frightened as possible. 'His Highness is not well enough to talk to me,' I whispered. 'You had better look after him.' I heard a shout behind and a heavy fall. Then I closed the door and slipped away as quietly as I could--and here I am." ...|$|E
