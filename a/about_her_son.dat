500|$|Lupton {{insists that}} the title, {{one of the many}} similes Angelou used, is tied to the book's themes. Lupton also {{considered}} the title [...] "ironic"; Angelou uses [...] "old-fashioned" [...] and [...] "positive" [...] words—singin' [...] and swingin' —that reflect several meanings related to the text. These words describe the beginnings of Angelou's career as an entertainer, but the irony in the terms also depict the conflict Angelou felt <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>son.</b> The words gettin' merry like Christmas are also ironic: [...] "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was Angelou's most unmerry autobiography". Because music is one of the book's themes, Angelou uses abbreviated verb endings in her title that reflect Black dialect and evoke the sound of a blues singer.|$|E
500|$|Writing for {{the book}} Movie Blockbusters, Andrew Willis commented that the film was {{specifically}} written {{to appeal to the}} Indian diaspora. He explained that the film was aimed at invoking nostalgia among the large section of NRI's in Canada, United Kingdom and North America. In {{the second half of the}} film, Rahul and Anjali move to London, where they enjoy an affluent lifestyle, among several non-Indian neighbours and friends. However, there is a perpetual dissatisfaction among them, especially Anjali, in living away from home. Additionally, she dresses up in a traditional sari and performs the duties of a loyal housemaker. She also frets <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>son</b> and younger sister being [...] "too influenced" [...] by Western culture. The film, thus tries to form an emotional connection with the expatriate Indian audiences.|$|E
500|$|Singin' and Swingin opens {{shortly after}} Angelou's {{previous}} autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. Marguerite, or Maya, {{a single mother}} with a young son, is in her early twenties, struggling to make a living. Angelou writes in this book, like her previous works, about {{the full range of}} her own experiences. As scholar Dolly McPherson states, [...] "When one encounters Maya Angelou in her story, one encounters the humor, the pain, the exuberance, the honesty, and the determination of a human being who has experienced life fully and retained her strong sense of self". Many people around Angelou influence her growth and—as critic Lyman B. Hagen states—"propel Angelou ever forward". The book's opening chapters find Maya concerned with, as Hagen asserts, [...] "apprehension <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>son,</b> a desire for a home, and facing racial conflicts, and seeking a career". Maya is offered a job as a salesgirl in a record shop on Fillmore Street in San Francisco. At first she greets her boss' offers of generosity and friendship with suspicion, but after two months of searching for evidence of racism, Maya begins to [...] "relax and enjoy a world of music". The job allows her to move back into her mother's house and {{to spend more time with}} her son.|$|E

2500|$|The {{past and}} present are {{constantly}} intertwined in The House in Paris, and the middle section, [...] "The Past," [...] is an imagined history. Characters in the past already have in mind future characters and events. For example, hours after conceiving Leopold, Karen thinks <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>son</b> as if he already exists: [...] "the idea of you, Leopold, began to be present with her." [...] This thought of Karen's is, in the end, Leopold's, since he imagines these events; the reader learns Leopold's past while he does, [...] "simultaneously gaining information from disconnected fragments derived {{from a combination of}} hints and opinions filtered through all he experiences in the house in Paris." [...] Bowen herself discussed the [...] "bendability" [...] of time in an essay published in 1951, in which she discusses [...] "factitious memory": [...] "one route to the past (or the idea of the past) is factitious memory. That is to say, by art we are made to seem to remember that which we have not actually known." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} continuity, events in {{different}} episodes contradict each other, {{as there is}} a loose sense of canon. One such example is in [...] "The Other Cousin" [...] and [...] "N.R.A.y RAY", in which Toot is pictured with a penis, something that is not consistent with other episodes. Another is Foxxy's various and contradictory stories <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>son</b> Timmy (one involves selling him on the black market, another involves her accidentally shooting him after believing him to be rabid, when he was really just brushing his teeth). Plots and gags are often used that do not make any type of internal sense, but are used as one-off jokes, as when Foxxy, who is in her twenties, is said to have a teenage grandson. Some episodes begin with a fake recap of events supposed to have happened in a (non-existent) previous episode. According to executive producer Bill Freiberger, [...] "Very little on Drawn Together can be considered canon. If you try to find continuity on this show you'll drive yourself nuts. The only thing that's consistent is we try to make the show as funny as possible. And we'd never let a little thing like continuity {{get in the way of}} that." ...|$|E
