The service aimed {{to reduce the number}} of section 136 detentions under the Mental Health Act and improve referral pathways for those presenting with mental health issues.

Dedicated Street Triage mental health nurses <b>accompanied</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> to incidents where it was suspected that mental health issues were a presenting concern. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen strategic and operational stakeholders to review whether the project was successful.

Girls, as young as 10, are being sold to the brothels of Bangkok, other Thai cities and overseas.” However, despite his efforts {{to raise awareness of}} local establishments' engaging in child prostitution, he was accused by those same institutions of being a pedophile himself, as was a common retaliatory tactic to quickly eliminate pesky activists. On 30 September 2002, living in Thailand, Parlaman was charged with molesting a 12-year-old boy, but released on bail by the local magistrate due to lack of evidence, as the sole incriminating evidence against him was a bruise on the boy's neck.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} police officers' {{work with}} internal control of foreigners through a discussion of, among other things, the nation-state, {{rule of law}} ideals {{as well as the}} police profession and the conditions surrounding that profession. Internal control of foreigners, practised by <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> has two main aims: to control migration and to fight crime amongst people unauthorised to reside in the country. There has been a demand for increased efficiency in the internal control of foreigners, since Sweden joined the Schengen agreement. <b>Police</b> <b>officers</b> are now expected to be observant in all their work carried out, of the possibility that people they encounter are in the country without permission. The authors have <b>accompanied</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> in Malmö and Stockholm in their work. They have also studied cases in the legal system and of the special board that handles cases of offences made by <b>police</b> <b>officers.</b> The authors discuss the importance of different factors to the police work on internal control of foreigners. Certain factors are more important than others and there is an interplay and reinforcement of some of these: the political and historical context, the discretion of the police, grey areas in the rules, the work tools of the police as well as inspection possibilities. A state of tension can be identified between the ideals of the nation-state and rule of law ideals. Several factors interplay to create a potential for and an apparent risk of ethnic discrimination in the police work on the internal control of foreigners. This study shows that the prerequisites necessary to perform the control efficiently, unerringly and with proper discretion are lacking. <b>Police</b> <b>officers</b> are put to the almost impossible task of determining who is in the country without permission...|$|R

Additionally, I witnessed another officer performing an analysis of a suspected illegal substance. Drawing from critical autoethnographic methods, this paper details the events of the evening from my first-person perspective and is threaded with analyses of various facets of my privilege that emerged. The nagging questions that grew from these recognitions of unearned privilege are posed both to myself (as author) and also to readers, with the invitation to ponder the issues with me...|$|R

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 May, the gunmen ordered one of the hostages to {{telephone}} the BBC's news desk. During the call, Oan took the receiver and spoke directly to the BBC journalist.

At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy's telephone lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field telephone for outside communication. As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, became seriously ill and his colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field telephone to negotiate for a doctor. The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer.

[...] It was not to be conceived that from mere rage Phineas Finn would lay a plot for murdering a man in the street.
