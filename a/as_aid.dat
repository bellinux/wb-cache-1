In 1986, the couple travelled to strife-torn areas in Nicaragua and El Salvador on a visit organised by Central American Mission Partners.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, 1683, the Captain of the frigate HMS Falcon was sailing from England to the West Indies and beckoned {{the other}} {{officers}} {{to be present}} as he broke open his secret instructions. He learned that his mission was {{to aid in the}} hunt for a large treasure near Hispaniola. A sloop in convoy, HMS Bonetta (sometimes Bonito), was designated to do most of the searching, but the Falcon would act <b>as</b> <b>aid</b> and protection. These instructions were from Sir John Narborough, a rear admiral and commissioner of the Royal Navy, who also had the ear of King Charles II.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} August 1942, Mihailović issued {{directives}} to Chetnik units ordering them {{to prepare}} for a large scale anti-Partisan operation alongside Italian and NDH troops. In September 1942, aware that they were unable to defeat the Partisans alone, the Chetniks tried to persuade the Italians to undertake a large operation against the Partisans in western Bosnia. Trifunović-Birčanin met with Roatta on 10 and 21 September and urged him to undertake this operation as soon as possible to clear the Partisans from the Prozor–Livno area and offered 7,500 Chetniks <b>as</b> <b>aid</b> on the condition that they be provided with the necessary arms and supplies. He was successful in obtaining some arms and promises of action. The proposed operation, faced with opposition from Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić and a cautious Italian high command, was nearly cancelled, but after Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin promised to cooperate with Croat and Muslim anti-Partisan units, it went ahead, with less Chetnik involvement.|$|E

25|$|Blood is {{generally}} {{drawn from the}} father to help determine fetal antigen status. If he is homozygous for the antigen, there is a 100% chance of all offspring in the pairing to be positive for the antigen and at risk for HDN. If he is heterozygous, there is a 50% chance of offspring to be positive for the antigen. This test can help with knowledge for the current baby, as well <b>as</b> <b>aid</b> in the decision about future pregnancies. With RhD, the test is called the RhD genotype.

Shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War, an urgent operational demand for Britain's aircraft carriers, and thus their accompanying aircraft, had become apparent. The rate of production was substantially increased, and further orders for the Sea Hawk were soon placed. The issuing of a 'Super-Priority' status for the Sea Hawk by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1951, served to speed up production considerably as well <b>as</b> <b>aid</b> the supply of vital materials for its manufacture.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} is being conducted on Cynomya cadaverina {{to gain more}} information on its lifecycle {{as well as its}} behavior in order to better pinpoint time of death with postmortem interval estimation. This information will further aid forensic entomologists as well as investigators in solving medicocriminal investigations. Also, continued research on mitochondrial DNA analysis will be able to provide more identifications in cases where identification may have seemed impossible. Although Cynomya cadaverina is not as forensically or medically important as some of the other species of fly, it can still be a powerful tool in investigations as well <b>as</b> <b>aid</b> in maggot therapy.|$|E
25|$|Most {{monetary}} flows between nations are not counted <b>as</b> <b>aid.</b> These include market-based flows such as foreign direct investments and portfolio investments, remittances from migrant workers {{to their families}} in their home countries, and military aid. In 2009, aid {{in the form of}} remittances by migrant workers in the United States to their international families was twice as large as that country's humanitarian aid. The World Bank reported that, worldwide, foreign workers sent $328 billion from richer to poorer countries in 2008, over twice as much as official aid flows from OECD members. The United States does not count military aid in its foreign aid figures.|$|E

25|$|The PNG {{government}} subsequently {{imposed a}} blockade on Bougainville. It was enforced using UH-1 Iroquois helicopters and Pacific-class patrol boats {{that had been}} supplied to PNG <b>as</b> <b>aid</b> by the Australian government in the late-1980s {{as part of a}} defence co-operation program underway since independence. Other Australian support, as part of its capacity-building effort, included funding for the PNGDF, provision of arms and ammunition, logistics, training, and some specialist and technical advisors and personnel. Similar assistance was also provided to the police. The helicopters had been provided by Australia without weapons and on the provision {{that they would not be}} used for combat; however, the PNGDF subsequently fitted machine-guns in contravention of the agreement and later used them as gunships. The blockade would remain in effect until the ceasefire in 1994 (although it was informally continued for some parts of Bougainville until 1997).|$|E
25|$|The frills of ceratopsians are {{incredibly}} diverse. They {{may have been}} used for protective purposes as the frill sometimes splays over the neck. However, some say that the frill would have provided little protection from other large dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus. Other possible functions include intraspecific communication for mating purposes or as a visual display of territorial protection, as seen in many common day organisms such as red-breasted robins. The frills also could have been used for species recognition purposes, as they seem to develop fairly early in life. There has also been evidence that ceratopsians care for their young, as bone-beds have been found of adult individuals with a nest of juveniles, although some refute this as viable evidence of care for young. There have also been bone-beds found with hundreds of adult ceratopsians, indicating herd activity. A few specimens have been found with puncture wounds, supporting the use of horns as protective or combative weapons. Other research examining juvenile ceratopsians reveals a change in horn morphology over time, suggesting frills and horns could have been used for intraspecific communication of age. Horns also could have been used for thermoregulation as indicated by isotope analysis, <b>as</b> <b>aid</b> in knocking down vegetation, or for horn-locking agonistic behavior.|$|E
