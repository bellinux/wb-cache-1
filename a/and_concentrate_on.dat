5|$|At the 2009 National Championships, Tarwater {{qualified}} {{to represent the}} United States team in the World Championships {{for the third time}} in his career by placing sixth in the 200-meter freestyle. He also placed fourth in the 100-meter butterfly, and fifth in the 200-meter butterfly. In the preliminary round of the 4×200-meter freestyle, he helped the United States turn in the top qualifying time. The United States later won the event, earning Tarwater a gold medal. After the 2009 season, Tarwater decided to retire from competitive swimming <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> his academic work at Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, {{aimed to}} move the network away from freight {{services}} <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. He saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes. On 1 June 1935 the LPTB gave the required six months' notice to the O that it intended to terminate operations on the Brill Tramway.|$|E

5|$|During the {{operations}} {{along the south}} coast of New Britain the AIB officers sought to discourage the Japanese from moving west of the Wide Bay area by circulating rumours among the local population that a large Australian base had been established at Jacquinot Bay. In reality no such base existed at this time. The AIB force continued to make guerilla attacks on Japanese positions until early October, when it was ordered to cease offensive operations <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> intelligence gathering ahead of the landing of Australian infantry and support units at Jacquinot Bay. The AIB's operations from June to October were assisted by occasional air attacks and naval bombardments conducted by elements of the Allied air forces and navies.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E
5|$|Little {{documentary}} {{evidence of the}} games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account {{in the form of}} his De Spectaculis ("On the Spectacles"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events of the games as an illustration of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} his {{experience}} in World War I, Kenney {{had a great deal}} of respect for Japanese fighters. He decided to conserve his bombers, <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> attaining air superiority over New Guinea. Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided. SWPA had a low priority, and simply could not afford to replace losses from costly daylight missions. What he needed was an effective long-range fighter, and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would fit the bill, but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems. Kenney had Charles Lindbergh teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft.

Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

In 1999, she returned to active competition in the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series where she ran strongly, and finished sixth in the series championship standings the following year. Robinson returned to NASCAR in 2001, and made her debut in the Winston Cup Series (now the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) but was unable to compete successfully.

5|$|The Hurricane Warning Service, {{operated}} by the United States Weather Bureau and the predecessor to the National Hurricane Center, issued hurricane warnings from Fort Myers to Miami, including the Florida Keys on October4. Miami Weather Bureau chief Grady Norton urged residents to take precautions <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> further advisories. On October5, the hurricane warning was revised to include Naples to Jupiter. Additionally, other warnings were issued for areas surrounding Lake Okeechobee due to flooding concerns. Four U.S. Navy wartime housing project areas in Key West were evacuated. About 100Seminoles fled the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation, with 95% of the property still inundated from the September hurricane. Two 25-car trains evacuated about 5,000people in the Lake Okeechobee area in Lake Harbor and transported them to Sebring. Many residents throughout South Florida boarded-up their windows and sandbagged their properties. The American Red Cross opened 143shelters, which 21,663people sought refuge in.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main lines 4.Bf4, 4.Nf3 and 4.e4, the only {{significant}} other fourth move is 4.e3 to continue by 4...Nxe5 5.Nh3 (or the other move-order 4.Nh3 and 5.e3) so that the white knight starts the journey Ng1–h3–f4–d5 reach its ideal d5-square. The idea with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3 was favorite of a leading Soviet coach and writer Mikhail Shereshevsky, who wrote in his 1994 book The Soviet Chess Conveyor that the line was first shown to him by a strong correspondence player Donatas Lapienis. Black has tried to prevent White's idea by the suitably strange-looking move 5...Ng6, taking the f4-square from the Nh3. Then White can develop along various setups, the most active being 6.Qh5 with the possibility Nh3–g5 in store to recycle the knight towards a more central position. Black can also ignore White's intentions <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> his own play by placing the Nb8 on c5, {{in order to put}} pressure on the d3-square. After 5...g6 6.Nf4Bg7 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d6 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.Qd2 a5 11.b3 Nc5 the position of Black's knights is secured and Black's position is similar to the Leningrad variation of the Dutch Defence (once he has played f7–f5). White has no reason, however, to abandon the a1–h8 diagonal to Black, and he can try 5...g6 6.Bd2 d6 7.Nf4 Bg7 8.Bc3 0-0 9.Be2 Nbd7 10.Nd2 b6 and in one game White gained a minimal edge.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, {{when all}} {{airframe}} maintenance at Laverton {{was transferred to}} Nos.2 and 3 Aircraft Depots, No.1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting telecommunications equipment as well. The aircraft engine repair facilities at No.1 AD were closed down in 1968. Staff were transferred to No.3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, {{to prepare for the}} introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber to Australian service <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> maintaining the new aircraft's engines. No.1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, telecommunications and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government. From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, Telecommunications Installation and Maintenance Squadron and Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin and Pearce), Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other ground-based mechanical and electro-mechanical systems), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (communications, navigation and other ground-based maintenance at Laverton, as well as spectrometric analysis of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).|$|E

5|$|Michèle Mouton {{was born}} 23 June 1951 in Grasse, a {{town on the}} French Riviera known for its perfume industry, close to the {{mountain}} stages famously featured in French rallies. Her parents grew roses and jasmine on their large property. After graduating from high school, Mouton began law studies, but would soon drop out <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> a career in rallying. Although Mouton began driving her father's Citroën 2CV when she was 14 years old, she did not turn her interest to rallying until 1972, when her friend Jean Taibi asked her to practise the Tour de Corse with him. Mouton later co-drove {{for him in the}} 1973 Monte Carlo Rally, the first-ever World Rally Championship (WRC) event. After a few more rallies, Mouton's father suggested a switch to driving if she wanted to continue in rallying, and promised to buy her a car and give her one-year to prove herself. Driving an Alpine-Renault A110, she debuted at the Critérium Féminin Paris-Saint-Raphaël and then tackled the Tour de France Automobile. In the Île de Beauté, a complementary event to the Tour de Corse at the end of 1973, Mouton finished eighth overall.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{subsequently}} became {{heavily involved}} in fighting throughout the front it occupied, especially 3rd Parachute Battalion, which launched several attacks on a geographical feature known as 'Green Hill'; during multiple attacks, several companies from the battalion were able to gain {{the crest of the}} hill, only to be driven back by enemy counterattacks. On the night of 78 January the brigade was relieved from the frontline and transported to Algiers, with the exception of 2nd Parachute Battalion, which remained under the command of 78th Infantry Division {{because of a lack of}} troops to replace it. Plans were made to use the brigade in conjunction with US II Corps to cut Axis lines of communications around Sfax and Gabes, but these were never finalised. On 24 January it was transferred back to V Corps and came under the command of 6th Armoured Division, but did not remain there for long; two days later it came under the command of XIX French Corps, located in area around Bou Araba. There it was given command of several French units and stationed between 36th Infantry Brigade and 1st Guards Brigade. On 2 February 1 Parachute Battalion was ordered to mount an attack on the massifs of Djebel Mansour and Djebel Alliliga, supported by a company belonging to the French Foreign Legion. The battalion launched its attack during the night and by the next morning had captured both features against fierce opposition; however, heavy casualties meant that the battalion was forced to retreat from Djebel Alligila <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> Djebel Mansour. There they were cut off from supplies and almost all reinforcements, and counterattacks by 6th Armoured Division failed to reach the battalion. A battalion from the Grenadier Guards was able to capture most of Djebel Alliliga on 4 February, but both battalions came under increasingly heavy attack, and by 11:00 the next day it was decided to withdraw both battalions.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge <b>and</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E
