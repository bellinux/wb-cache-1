25|$|A {{wide variety}} of wild animals and birds have been {{observed}} in the area. The ones you might see when rambling around the countryside are wild boar, deer, foxes, hares and rabbits. The birds in your garden will include sparrows, swallows, starlings, crows, rooks, magpies, pigeons, finches and robins <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> lucky enough to see flocks of migrating wild geese flying by. In the forest, you will hear - and sometimes see - owls and woodpeckers. Some species have suffered from hunting in recent years but there are now considerable efforts to protect flora and fauna. An area of the commune's forest is now a nature reserve.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Knight reprised {{the role}} of Ruth in Pirates with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] Chicago radio host Bruce Duffie, {{interviewing}} Knight after seeing that production noted, [...] "Gillian Knight {{is one of those}} great personalities who simply go about their business season after season, giving splendid renditions of various roles, and adding luster to their home companies while not going far afield very often and, thus, passing up the opportunity for real world-wide stardom". During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house". [...] She advised audiences, [...] "Don't close your mind to anything because somebody has said, 'Oh, this is Gilbert and Sullivan,' or, 'This is modern music.' [...] Just keep an open mind <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> surprised at how much you get out of it".|$|E

2500|$|... "With {{the release}} of Unexpected, Williams has welcomed R back into her arms with a modern edge, a la Rihanna and Chris Brown, infusing her soulful lyrics with party beats and dance-like synths. Take the lead single, for instance. [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] is an immensely catchy mid-tempo jam co-written by Williams and ex-Child Beyonce's sister, Solange Knowles. The track re-launched the {{ebullient}} singer back into the mainstream, sporting a new, edgy electronica look and sound. [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] has {{a certain amount of}} memorability in the synth riff and the laid-back party lyrics. The song is carefree, and {{a far cry from the}} depth of Gospel music. The album features a collection of [...] "moods" [...] including the bouncy tracks [...] "Hello Heartbreak," [...] hilariously including [...] "It's time for the percolator" [...] as the bridge, and [...] "Lucky Girl" [...] once the smooth intro stops. These dance-pop R beats are the same light and noncommittal ones you've become accustomed to with artists like, as I said earlier, Rihanna and Chris Brown, along with the party feel of The Pussycat Dolls and other contemporaries. Another mood of Unexpected is the party jam feel exhibited by [...] "Private Party" [...] and [...] "Hungover," [...] the tracks you jam while driving down the road with your windows down. [...] "The Greatest," [...] a fantastic pop ballad, and [...] "Thank U," [...] a melodic song about thanking what held you down so you can appreciate how far you've come, round out the heavier, and slower, moods on the album. Summary; this album fits nicely into a lot of musical niches, making it a good addition to most collections. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> humming some of these tracks years down the line. Not my favorite of the year, but not too shabby either." ...|$|E
