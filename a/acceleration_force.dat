25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} {{toward the front}} of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal <b>acceleration</b> <b>force</b> (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and lean on back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain of}} the ESC {{system is the}} {{electronic}} control unit (ECU). The various control techniques are embedded in it. Often, the same ECU is used for diverse systems {{at the same time}} (ABS, Traction control system, climate control, etc.). The input signals are sent through the input-circuit to the digital controller. The desired vehicle state is determined based upon the steering wheel angle, its gradient and the wheel speed. Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the actual state. The controller computes the needed brake or <b>acceleration</b> <b>force</b> for each wheel and directs via the driver circuits the valves of the hydraulic modulator. Via a Controller Area Network interface the ECU is connected with other systems (ABS, etc.) in order to avoid giving contradictory commands.|$|E
40|$|Background: ROTEM® is {{considered}} a helpful point-of-care device to monitor blood coagulation in emergency situations. Centrally performed analysis is desirable but rapid transport of blood samples is an important prerequisite. The effect of <b>acceleration</b> <b>forces</b> on sample transport through a pneumatic tube system on ROTEM® should be tested at each institution to exclude a pre-analytical influence. The aims of the present work were: (i) to investigate the effect of pneumatic tube transport on ROTEM® parameters; (ii) to compare blood sample transport via pneumatic tube vs. manual transportation; and (iii) {{to determine the effect}} of <b>acceleration</b> <b>forces</b> on ROTEM® parameters. Methods: This is a single centre study with 20 healthy volunteers. Five whole blood samples were transferred to the central haematology laboratory by either normal transport or pneumatic delivery with different speed and <b>acceleration</b> <b>forces.</b> EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM and APTEM were analysed in parallel with two ROTEM® devices and compared. <b>Acceleration</b> <b>forces</b> were measured during transport with two different instruments. Results: Increment of transport time, speed and distance resulted in an augmentation of <b>acceleration</b> <b>forces</b> and peaks. All results of the ROTEM® analysis after manual transport or pneumatic delivery were within normal range. However, increase in <b>acceleration</b> <b>forces</b> resulted in minimally but statistically significant changes in multiple ROTEM® parameters. The higher the <b>acceleration</b> <b>forces,</b> the more ROTEM® parameters are influenced. Conclusions: <b>Acceleration</b> <b>forces</b> during transport through a pneumatic tube system have an influence on ROTEM® parameters. Prior to transfer blood samples via pneumatic tube system these influences should be tested to exclude clinically relevant blood coagulation activation in vitr...|$|R

2500|$|Railguns face {{a host of}} {{technical}} challenges before they {{will be ready for}} battlefield deployment. First, the rails guiding the projectile must carry very high power. Each firing of the railgun produces tremendous current flow (almost half a million amperes) through the rails, causing rapid erosion of the rail's surfaces (through ohmic heating, and even vaporization of the rail surface.) [...] Early prototypes were essentially single-use weapons, requiring complete replacement of the rails after each firing. Another challenge with the railgun system is projectile survivability. The projectiles experience <b>acceleration</b> <b>force</b> in excess of 100,000g. In order to be effective, the fired projectile must first survive the mechanical stress of firing and the thermal effects of a trip through the atmosphere at many times the speed of sound before its subsequent impact with the target. In-flight guidance, if implemented, would require the onboard navigation system to be built to the same level of sturdiness as the main mass of the projectile.|$|E
