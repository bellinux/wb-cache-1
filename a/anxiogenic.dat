25|$|A {{number of}} {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} a positive association between caffeine ingestion and panic disorder and/or <b>anxiogenic</b> effects. People who have panic disorder are {{more sensitive to the}} anxiety-provoking effects of caffeine. One of the major anxiety-provoking effects of caffeine is an increase in heart rate.|$|E
50|$|Globally, the {{two most}} widely used psychoactive drugs are anxiotropic agents: ethanol, an anxiolytic, and {{caffeine}}, an <b>anxiogenic.</b> While intake of both ethanol and caffeine {{has been shown to}} exert an anxiolytic effect, their withdrawal is associated with <b>anxiogenic</b> effects.|$|E
50|$|The Alpha2 {{adrenergic}} agonists Clonidine and guanfacine {{have demonstrated}} both anxiolytic and <b>anxiogenic</b> effects.|$|E
50|$|There are {{concerns}} that some GABAergics, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, {{may have an}} <b>anxiogenic</b> effect if used {{over long periods of}} time.|$|E
50|$|The non-peptide NPS {{receptor}} antagonist SHA-68 {{blocks the}} effects of NPS in animals and is <b>anxiogenic.</b> Several peptide derived NPS agonists and antagonists have also been developed.|$|E
5000|$|Ro5-4864 - {{original}} ligand {{with which}} TSPO receptor was characterised, now less used due to inter-species differences in binding affinity. Sedative yet also convulsant and <b>anxiogenic</b> in mice.|$|E
5000|$|... meta-Chlorophenylbiguanide (1-(3-Chlorophenylbiguanide, m-CPBG) is an {{allosteric}} agonist and modulator of the 5-HT3 receptor and an antagonist of the α2A-adrenergic receptor. It has <b>anxiogenic,</b> emetic and hypothermic {{effects in}} animal studies.|$|E
50|$|Pregnenolone sulfate (PS, PREGS), {{also known}} as pregn-5-en-3β-ol-20-one 3β-sulfate, is an {{endogenous}} excitatory neurosteroid that is synthesized from pregnenolone. It {{is known to have}} cognitive and memory-enhancing, antidepressant, <b>anxiogenic,</b> and proconvulsant effects.|$|E
50|$|SHA-68 {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a selective, non-peptide {{antagonist}} at the neuropeptide S receptor NPSR. In animal studies it has <b>anxiogenic</b> effects, and blocks the stimulant action of neuropeptide S.|$|E
50|$|An <b>anxiogenic</b> or panicogenic {{substance}} {{is one that}} causes anxiety. This effect {{is in contrast to}} anxiolytic agents, which inhibits anxiety. Together these categories of psychoactive compounds may be referred to as anxiotropic compounds.|$|E
50|$|An {{anxiolytic}} (also antipanic or antianxiety agent) is {{the medication}} or other intervention that inhibits anxiety. This effect {{is in contrast}} to <b>anxiogenic</b> agents, which increase anxiety. Together these categories of psychoactive compounds or interventions may be referred to as anxiotropic compounds or agents. Some recreational drugs such as ethanol (alcohol) induce anxiolysis initially; however, studies show that many of these drugs are <b>anxiogenic.</b> Anxiolytic medications have been used for the treatment of anxiety disorder and its related psychological and physical symptoms. Anxiolytics {{have been shown to be}} useful in the treatment of anxiety disorder. Light therapy and other interventions have also been found to have an anxiolytic effect.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that Muira Puama is <b>anxiogenic</b> in rodents (causes anxiety), which {{would be consistent with}} a stimulant effect, without affecting coordination. However, rather than increasing the activity of excitatory neurotransmitters, it decreases the activity of an inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABAA.|$|E
50|$|FG-7142 (ZK-31906) {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a partial inverse agonist at the {{benzodiazepine}} allosteric site of the GABAA receptor. It has anorectic, <b>anxiogenic</b> and pro-convulsant effects. It also increases release of acetylcholine and noradrenaline, and improves memory retention in animal studies.|$|E
50|$|An anxiotropic {{agent is}} one that modifies anxiety, a human emotion that has {{homologous}} processes in animals. In psychopharmacology anxiotropic agents consist of two categories of psychoactive drugs: anxiolytics that reduce anxiety and may be used therapeutically, and <b>anxiogenic</b> compounds that increase anxiety.|$|E
50|$|These neurosteroids have {{excitatory}} {{effects on}} neurotransmission. They act as potent negative allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, weak positive allosteric modulators of the NMDA receptor, and/or agonists of the σ1 receptor, and mostly have antidepressant, <b>anxiogenic,</b> cognitive and memory-enhancing, convulsant, neuroprotective, and neurogenic effects.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} a positive association between caffeine ingestion and panic disorder and/or <b>anxiogenic</b> effects. People who have panic disorder are {{more sensitive to the}} anxiety-provoking effects of caffeine. One of the major anxiety-provoking effects of caffeine is an increase in heart rate.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{receptor}} that possesses basal activity and for which inverse agonists have been identified is the GABAA receptor. Agonists for the GABAA receptor (such as benzodiazepines) create a sedative effect, whereas inverse agonists have <b>anxiogenic</b> effects (for example, Ro15-4513) or even convulsive effects (certain beta-carbolines).|$|E
50|$|There are {{individuals}} who are prone to caffeine’s <b>anxiogenic</b> effects whilst others are susceptible to its caffeine-induced sleep disturbances and insomnia. Studies with twins have shown that genetics influence individual differences in response to caffeine. Homozygous twins {{have been found to}} react in more consistent ways to the caffeine than heterozygous twins.|$|E
50|$|Some {{drugs can}} produce dysphoria, {{including}} κ-opioid receptor agonists like salvinorin A (the active constituent of the hallucinogenic plant Salvia divinorum), butorphanol, and pentazocine, μ-opioid receptor antagonists such as naltrexone and nalmefene, and antipsychotics like haloperidol and chlorpromazine (via blockade of dopamine receptors), among others. Depressogenic and/or <b>anxiogenic</b> drugs {{may also be}} associated with dysphoria.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{advertisement}} as {{a recreational}} substance, mCPP is actually {{generally considered to}} be an unpleasant experience and is not desired by drug users. It lacks any reinforcing effects, produces depressive and <b>anxiogenic</b> effects in rodents and humans, and can induce panic attacks in individuals susceptible to them. It also worsens obsessive-compulsive symptoms in people with the disorder.|$|E
50|$|Sarmazenil (Ro15-3505) {{is a drug}} {{from the}} {{benzodiazepine}} family. It acts as a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, meaning that it causes the opposite effects to most benzodiazepine drugs, and instead acts as an <b>anxiogenic</b> and convulsant. It is used in veterinary medicine to reverse the effects of benzodiazepine sedative drugs in order to rapidly re-awaken anesthetized animals.|$|E
50|$|Cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4, Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) is a peptide {{fragment}} {{derived from}} the larger peptide hormone cholecystokinin. Unlike cholecystokin which {{has a variety of}} roles in the gastrointestinal system as well as central nervous system effects, CCK-4 acts primarily in the brain as an <b>anxiogenic,</b> although it does retain some GI effects, {{but not as much as}} CCK-8 or the full length polypeptide CCK-58.|$|E
50|$|Suritozole (MDL 26,479) is an investigational {{cognition}} enhancer. It acts as {{a partial}} inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA ion channel complex, but does not have either <b>anxiogenic</b> or convulsant effects, unlike other BZD inverse agonists such as DMCM. It was investigated {{for the treatment of}} depression and Alzheimer's disease, but clinical development seems to have been discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Cannabis is {{paradoxical}} {{in that it}} simultaneously produces stimulating, sedating and mildly psychedelic {{properties and}} both anxiolytic or <b>anxiogenic</b> properties, depending on the individual and circumstances of use. Depressant properties are more obvious in occasional users, and stimulating properties are more common in chronic users. Khantzian noted that research had not sufficiently addressed a theoretical mechanism for cannabis, and therefore did not include it in the SMH.|$|E
50|$|LY-293284 is a {{research}} chemical developed by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and used for scientific studies. It acts as a potent and selective 5-HT1A receptor full agonist. It was derived through structural simplification of the ergoline based psychedelic LSD, but is far more selective for 5-HT1A with over 1000x selectivity over other serotonin receptor subtypes and other targets. It has <b>anxiogenic</b> effects in animal studies.|$|E
50|$|CBD is a 5-HT1A {{receptor}} agonist, {{which may}} {{also contribute to}} an anxiolytic effect. This likely means the high concentrations of CBD found in Cannabis indica mitigate the <b>anxiogenic</b> effect of THC significantly. The effects of sativa are well known for their cerebral high, hence its daytime use as medical cannabis, while indica {{is well known for}} its sedative effects and preferred night time use as medical cannabis.|$|E
50|$|Pentylenetetrazol {{has been}} used {{experimentally}} to study seizure phenomena and to identify pharmaceuticals that may control seizure susceptibility. Pentylenetetrazol is also a prototypical <b>anxiogenic</b> drug and, has been extensively utilized in animal models of anxiety. Pentylenetetrazol produces a reliable discriminative stimulus which is largely mediated by the GABAA receptor. Several classes of compounds can modulate the pentylenetetrazol discriminative stimulus including 5-HT1A, 5-HT3, NMDA, glycine, and L-type calcium channel ligands.|$|E
50|$|Rodents {{typically}} {{spend more}} time in the dark compartment than in the light compartment. If rodents are injected with anxiolytic drugs, percentage of time spent in the light compartment will increase. Locomotion and rearing, which is when the rodent stands up on its hind legs and is a sign of exploration, in the dark compartment also increase. When injected with <b>anxiogenic</b> drugs, more time is spent in the dark compartment.|$|E
5000|$|Anxiolytic {{substances}} {{have the}} opposite effect: they reduce anxiety. The most common class of anxiolytic drugs are the benzodiazepines. However, studies suggest that benzodiazepenes may be <b>anxiogenic</b> {{in the long term}} [...] Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly prescribed antidepressants that treat anxiety in the long term, however, SSRIs are ineffective in the short term treatment of acute panic attacks or acute anxiety. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) are very effective against anxiety. Doxepin is also effective.|$|E
5000|$|The {{elevated}} plus maze (EPM) {{is a test}} measuring {{anxiety in}} laboratory animals that usually uses rodents as a screening test for putative anxiolytic or <b>anxiogenic</b> compounds and as a general research tool in neurobiological anxiety research such as PTSD and TBI. [...] The model {{is based on the}} test animal's aversion to open spaces and tendency to be thigmotaxic. In the EPM, this anxiety is expressed by the animal spending more time in the enclosed arms.|$|E
50|$|PWZ-029 is a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative drug with nootropic effects {{developed by}} WiSys, It {{acts as a}} subtype-selective, mixed agonist-inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABAA receptor, acting as a partial inverse agonist at the α5 subtype and a weak partial agonist at the α3 subtype. This gives it a mixed pharmacological profile, producing at low doses memory-enhancing effects but with no convulsant or <b>anxiogenic</b> effects or muscle weakness, although at higher doses it produces some sedative effects.|$|E
50|$|Ro4938581 is a {{nootropic}} drug {{invented in}} 2009 {{by a team}} working for Hoffmann-La Roche, which acts as a subtype-selective inverse agonist at the α5 subtype of the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABAA receptor. It has good selectivity for the α5 subtype and did not produce convulsant or <b>anxiogenic</b> effects in animal studies, making it a promising potential nootropic. Ro4938581 and a related derivative basmisanil (RG-1662, RO5186582) have subsequently been investigated for the alleviation of cognitive dysfunction in Down syndrome.|$|E
50|$|ZK-93426 (ethyl-5-isopropoxy-4-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) {{is a drug}} {{from the}} beta-carboline family. It acts as a weak partial inverse agonist of {{benzodiazepine}} receptors, meaning that it causes the opposite effects to the benzodiazepine class of drugs and has <b>anxiogenic</b> properties, although unlike most benzodiazepine antagonists {{it is not a}} convulsant and actually has weak anticonvulsant effects. In human tests it produced alertness, restlessness and feelings of apprehension, and reversed the effect of the benzodiazepine lormetazepam. It was also shown to produce nootropic effects and increased release of acetylcholine.|$|E
50|$|DMCM (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) {{is a drug}} {{from the}} beta-carboline family. It acts as a {{negative}} allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, meaning that it causes the opposite effects to the benzodiazepine class of drugs. As such, DMCM has <b>anxiogenic</b> and convulsant properties, and is used in scientific research to induce anxiety so that new anxiolytic medications can be tested, and to produce convulsions so that anticonvulsant medications can be tested. It {{has also been shown}} to produce analgesic effects in animals, thought to be because it produces panic which reduces the perception of pain.|$|E
50|$|Older non-selective inverse {{agonists}} at the benzodiazepine site such as DMCM {{are associated}} with a range of other effects including anxiety and convulsions, but because α5IA acts specifically at the α5 subtype it produces nootropic effects in animal studies, yet without any significant <b>anxiogenic</b> or pro-convulsant effects. This gives α5IA {{the potential to be a}} useful drug either to be used alongside benzodiazepines to counteract their cognitive side effects, or by itself as a nootropic with possible applications in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.|$|E
50|$|Psychiatrist/primatologist Alfonso Troisi {{proposed}} that displacement {{activities can be}} used as non-invasive measures of stress in primates. He noted that various non-human primates perform self-directed activities such as grooming and scratching in situations likely to involve anxiety and uncertainty, and that these behaviours are increased by <b>anxiogenic</b> (anxiety-producing) drugs and reduced by anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) drugs. In humans, he noted that similar self-directed behaviour, together with aimless manipulation of objects (chewing pens, twisting rings), {{can be used as}} indicators of 'stressful stimuli and may reﬂect an emotional condition of negative affect'.|$|E
