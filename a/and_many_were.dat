5|$|At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a {{nationwide}} militia of men previously considered unsuitable {{for military service}} – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve {{on the front lines}} against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{to other}} parts of Latin America, slavery played a much lesser role in the {{development}} of the Argentine economy, mostly because of the absence of gold mines and sugar plantations, which would have demanded huge numbers of slave workers. Colonial Brazil, for example, imported as many as 2.5 million Africans in the 18th century. By contrast, an estimated 100,000 African slaves arrived at the port of Buenos Aires in the 17th and 18th centuries, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> destined for Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{are owned}} by 5,000 of their members and are the largest supporter-owned {{football}} club in the United Kingdom by number of members. Each member can vote on how the club is run, including voting for board members, kit designs and season ticket prices. Most F.C. United supporters still support Manchester United <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> previously season ticket holders at Old Trafford. F.C. United fans are known for the large range of songs that they sing at matches, and the atmosphere created by fans has been praised in the media.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Liners was a cargo and {{passenger}} shipping company founded in 1898, based in Manchester, England. The line pioneered the regular passage of ocean-going vessels along the Manchester Ship Canal. Its main sphere of operation was the transatlantic shipping trade, {{but the company}} also operated services to the Mediterranean. All of the line's vessels were registered in the Port of Manchester, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> lost to enemy action during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the houses}} in the village are Grade II listed buildings, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> built using local red and blue bricks. In total, 51 {{structures}} in the parish are listed, including gatepiers, greenhouses, a tomb, railings and a wall, the village telephone box and Aldermaston Lock.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the King and his {{marriage}} came from several directions. Edward's desire to modernise the monarchy {{and make it}} more accessible, though appreciated by many of the public, was distrusted by the British Establishment. Edward upset the aristocracy by treating their traditions and ceremonies with disdain, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> offended by his abandonment of accepted social norms and mores.|$|E
5|$|South of the river, the Poles {{prepared}} for another crossing. That night, they awaited {{the arrival of}} assault boats from XXX Corps, but these did not arrive until after midnight, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> without oars. The crossings started at 03:00, with fire support from the 43rd Wessex Division. Through the remaining hours of darkness, only 153 men were able to cross– less than ¼ of the hoped for reinforcement.|$|E

5|$|The {{damage to}} Salé was considerable; a wall from the Almohad Caliphate was {{severely}} damaged, and the Great Mosque of Salé {{was struck by}} six cannonballs. Several homes were destroyed, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> burnt down. Between 12 and 15 civilians were killed, along with six to seven soldiers. Tactically, the battle was a victory for France. In order to prevent Tangier from receiving a similar bombardment, Morocco agreed to pay 100,000 francs to the French on 29 November 1851.|$|E
5|$|The first {{gendarmerie}} members {{arrived in}} Albania on November 10, 1913. They were soon {{faced with a}} peasant revolt. One International Gendarmerie officer was killed <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> imprisoned after the revolt erupted in June 1914. Dutch officers were gradually replaced by officers from Austria-Hungary and Germany, who arrived in Durrës on July 4. Soon, World War I broke out and by August 4, most of the Dutch officers {{had returned to the}} Netherlands. By September 19, 1914, the last two imprisoned officers were released.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{held out}} against German forces for 18 days, against overwhelming odds. On 28 May, {{forced into a}} small pocket along the Leie river and after failed attempts to broker a ceasefire on the 27th, the Belgian king and military surrendered unconditionally. Belgian casualties during the campaign numbered some 6,000 killed and 15,850 wounded. Some 112,500 French and Belgian troops escaped to the UK via Dunkirk {{but the majority of}} the Belgian survivors were made prisoners of war <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> not released {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|According to Chard, in the 48 {{years of}} his career, Johnson {{published}} around 2,700 imprints, averaging 56 per year. About half of these were pamphlets (e.g. sermons, religious tracts, political leaflets) <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> reprints; therefore he averaged around 20 to 30 new books per year. About 25% of his publications were of anonymous authors; these were usually political or religious works. He published more religious works than any other genre (1,067 titles). Johnson made roughly 750 copies for each print run, although many of his political and religious works would have been printed in editions of 250, as their topics were often ephemeral.|$|E
5|$|As castles {{were not}} simply {{military}} buildings but centres of administration and symbols of power, {{they had a}} significant impact on the surrounding landscape. Placed by a frequently-used road or river, the toll castle ensured that a lord would get his due toll money from merchants. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems due to their role in managing the lord's estate, which gave them greater influence over resources. Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer parks and were important in their upkeep. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> found next to castles. Not only were they practical in that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the battle, they were poorly armed <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> {{equipped}} only with hunting rifles. They relied mostly on light infantry weapons, but obtained a few artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns and improvised their own land mines. They also obtained several hundred anti-tank weapons such as M79 and M80 rocket launchers, but were critically short of ammunition throughout the battle. The capture of JNA barracks somewhat improved the situation as Vukovar had the priority in the supply of arms. It is estimated that the Vukovar battlefield consumed around 55–60 percent of all ammunition available to the Croatian forces.|$|E

5|$|By the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan, the Principality of Wales was {{incorporated}} into England and was given an administrative system like the English, with counties policed by sheriffs. English law was introduced in criminal cases, though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes. After 1277, and increasingly after 1283, Edward embarked on a full-scale project of English settlement of Wales, creating new towns like Flint, Aberystwyth and Rhuddlan. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside them, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> protected by extensive walls.|$|E
5|$|None of the Peace dollar mintages are {{particularly}} rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for most years for {{little more than}} the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace dollar, minted only at the Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low-mintage 1928-P Peace dollar. The prices for the 1928-P dollar are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced that limited quantities would be produced <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> saved. In contrast the 1934-S dollar was not saved in great numbers so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but mid-grade uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1537, Cáceres {{arrived at}} the Peñol de Cerquín. He {{immediately}} sent envoys to Lempira, requesting his submission; Lempira executed the envoys and declared his defiance. In response, Cáceres launched a direct assault against the fortress but found it impregnable. No roads climbed the mountain, and sheer wall prevented attempts to climb it. Well-engineered defences manned by large numbers of gathered warriors prevented the Spanish from storming the approaches, and horses were useless on the steep terrain. Cáceres had no choice except to lay close siege to the Peñol. He divided his men equally amongst the eight approaches to the fortress, and fierce fighting ensued, in which five Spaniards were killed <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> injured, including Cáceres. The siege held firm, {{but was unable to}} gain any ground.|$|E
