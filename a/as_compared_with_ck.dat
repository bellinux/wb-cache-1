CK and G showed a lower SFA/UFA ratio values than C 1, C 1 +G, and C 2 (p <  0.05). The increase of SFA/UFA ratio indicated a reduction of UFA or an increase of SFA.

To study the effect of previous crops on soil respiration in cucumber (Cucumis statirus L.) fields in solar greenhouses, soil respiration, plant height, leaf area and yield were measured during the growing season (from the end of Sept to the beginning of Jun the following year) from 2007 to 2010. The cucumber was grown following fallow (CK), kidney bean (KB), cowpea (CP), maize for green manure (MGM), black bean for green manure (BGM), tomato (TM), bok choy (BC). <b>As</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK,</b> KB, CP, MGM and BGM may increase soil respiration, while TM and BC may decrease soil respiration at full fruit stage in cucumber fields.

In order to reveal the effect of different management approaches on soil P and phosphatase activity in 0 – 20 [*]cm and 20 – 40 [*]cm soil, this research was conducted to study variations in the characteristics of P and phosphatase activity under 3 -year tillage without mulching (CK), no-tillage with corn straw mulching (NTSM) and no-tillage with grass (NTG) in Liaoning apple orchard. The results showed that NTSM and NTG could significantly increase soil P content (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK.</b> However, the effect was different between NTSM and NTG; with the NTSM approach, the improvement in the P content in 20 – 40 [*]cm was remarkable, and in the NTG approach, the improvement in the soil surface P content was significant. At the same time, soil phosphatase activity significantly increased (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) under NTSM and NTG. The soil surface and 20 – 40 [*]cm phosphodiesterase (PD) activity was enhanced under the two management approaches, however, the effect of NTG was stronger than NTSM.

The kinetic constants and the phosphorylation efficiencies (V(max) /Km) of all the mutants with the parent peptide RRRADDSDDDDD and a series of derivatives, in which individual aspartic acids were replaced by alanines, have been determined. Three mutants, namely K 74 A,K 75 A,K 76 A,K 77 A; K 79 A, R 80 A,K 83 A; and R 191 A,R 195 A, K 198 A, display dramatically lower phosphorylation efficiency and 8 - 50 -fold higher Km values with the parent peptide, symptomatic of reduced attitude to bind the peptide substrate <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK</b> 2 wild type.

In contrast, the phosphorylation efficiencies of the other substituted peptides decrease more markedly with these mutants than with CK 2 wild type. These data show that {{one or more of the}} basic residues clustered in the 191 - 198, 79 - 83, and 74 - 77 sequences are implicated in the recognition of the acidic determinants at positions + 1, + 3, and + 4 /+ 5, respectively, and that if these residues are mutated, the relevance of the other acidic residues surrounding serine is increased. In contrast the other two mutants, namely R 228 A and R 278 A,K 279 A, R 280 A, display with all the peptides V(max) values higher than CK 2 wild type, counterbalanced however by somewhat higher Km values. It can be concluded from these data that all five mutations performed are compatible with the reconstitution of tetrameric holoenzyme, but all of them influence the enzymatic efficiency of CK 2 to different extents. Although the basic residues mutated in the 74 - 77, 79 - 83, and 191 - 198 sequences are clearly implicated in substrate recognition by interacting with acidic determinants at variable positions downstream from serine, the other basic residues seem to play a more elusive and/or indirect role in catalysis...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the feasibility and the clinical significance of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect cytokeratin 7 (CK 7) mRNA expression in peripheral blood cells of patients undergoing radical cystectomy for clinically nonmetastatic bladder cancer. Patients and Methods: From 2005 to 2009, 59 patients undergoing radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection were prospectively investigated.

Variation in HA was analyzed after long-term fertilization, including fertilization with manure (M), inorganic N, P and K fertilizer (NPK), manure combined with inorganic N, P, and K fertilizer (MNPK), and a no-fertilizer control (CK).

However, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the control treatment (CK), a slight increase in LAIm and chlorophyll content was observed with 3 ~ 4 dS/m salinity. Saline water improved tomato quality, including fruit density, soluble solid, total acid, vitamin C and the sugar-acid ratio. There was a positive relationship between the overall tomato quality and salinity of irrigation water, as analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). The tomato yield decreased with increased salinity. The 5. 5 dS/m treatment reduced the tomato yield (Yt) by 22. 4 ~ 31. 1 %, 12. 6 ~ 28. 0 % and 11. 7 ~ 27. 3 %, respectively in 2012, 2013 and 2014, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK.</b> Moreover, a significant (P≤ 0. 01) coupling effect of salinity and soil matric potential on Yt was detected. Saline water caused Yt to increase more markedly when the lower limit of soil matric potential was controlled at a relatively lower level. The critical salinity level that produced significant increases in the BERi was 3 dS/m~ 4 dS/m. Following the increase in BERi under saline water irrigation, marketable tomato yield (Ym) decreased by 8. 9 %~ 33. 8 % in 2012, 5. 1 %~ 30. 4 % in 2013 and 10. 1 %~ 32. 3 % in 2014 <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK.</b> In terms of maintaining the Yt and Ym, the salinity of irrigation water should be controlled under 4 dS/m, and the lower limit of soil matric potential should be greater than - 20 kPa...|$|R

That is the application of SP into sandy soil can decrease the infiltration capacity of water into deep layer under the saturation state, and the larger the application amount is, the larger the decreased degree is, which is helpful to store water within a certain arable layer.|$|R

For instance, as for the treatments of CK, SP 0.08, SP 0.2, SP 0.5 and SP 1, under the irrigation condition of small amount of high drops on the surface, the time needed by wetting front to reach the distance of 20 cm are 5.4, 7.7, 9.4, 22.1 and 498.9 min respectively, which increases by 42.59 %, 74.07 %, 309.26 % and 9138.89 % respectively <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK.</b>|$|R

The temperature, total carbon, Kjeldahl nitrogen, and seeds germination index were measured during the fermentation. The results showed that, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK,</b> the disposal inoculated with microorganism agents could obviously raise the temperature with the highest reaching 63. 5 ˚C and accelerate the organic matter decomposing with lower 4 % than control on the 16 d. The contents of Kjeldahl nitrogen declined from 2. 44 % to 1. 47 %. Furthermore, the seeds germination index achieved 80 % on the 22 d, higher 9 % than the control. The research described the factors in composting process for discussing the relativity of microorganism and chicken manure composting, which could provide the theoretical basis for the harmlessly efficient decomposition and rapid fermentation of poultry manure...|$|R
