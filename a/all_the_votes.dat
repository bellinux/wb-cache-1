5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling the levers of patronage, and the election's result was never really in doubt.

5|$|In 1678, Ashmole {{stood as}} a {{candidate}} in a by-election for the Lichfield borough parliamentary constituency caused {{by the death of}} one of the two incumbent members. During Ashmole's campaign his cousin, Thomas Smalridge, who was acting as a kind of campaign manager, fell ill and died. Ashmole did not visit the constituency, and, as Ashmole's own horoscope had predicted, he lost the election. He also put himself forward {{as a candidate}} in the general election of 1685. Surviving documents indicate that he was the most popular candidate, but after King James II requested he stand down (in an age when monarchs were likely to interfere with parliamentary elections), Ashmole did so. On election day, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> cast for Ashmole, instead of being declared invalid, were declared as votes for the King's candidate, and only {{as a result of this}} ruse was the candidate favoured by the Court (Richard Leveson) elected.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{advanced}} tolls was {{reviewed by the}} county council on 23 October 1991, where 64 voted in favor and 19 were opposed, the latter representing the Socialist Left Party, the Red Electoral Alliance and the Progress Party. In June 1992, the county council was asked to prioritize between the Hardanger Bridge and the Triangle Link, as {{there would not be}} sufficient state grants to build both projects. Both would require between NOK200 and 300 million, and it would not be possible to start both projects in the period from 1994 to 1997. In the council meeting on 18 June 1992, a proposal to waiver prioritization was rejected. The council then, with 44 against 30 votes, chose to prioritize the Hardanger Bridge, which received most votes from the Labour and Centre Party. The Conservative Party was the only party for which <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> were cast in favor of the Triangle Link.

On 5 May the Yugoslav government first announced {{the results of the}} elections, which showed that 72.6 percent of the eligible electorate had cast a total of 2,778,172 ballots. The party of Bogoljub Jevtić had received 1,738,390 (62.6%) votes and 320 seats in parliament and the Opposition Bloc led by Vladko Maček had received 983,248 (35.4%) votes and 48 seats.

The election results initially published by authorities caused an upheaval amongst the public, forcing the government to publish the results of a recount on 22 May. The recount showed that 100,000 additional ballots that had not been recorded on 5 May had been cast and that Jevtić's party had received 1,746,982 (60.6%) votes and 303 seats, the Opposition Bloc had received 1,076,345 (37.4%) and 67 seats, and that Zbor had received 24,008 (0.8%) votes and again no seats.|$|E

500|$|The True Finns {{gained the}} highest support in their electoral history; {{and the rise}} of 15% was also the largest electoral victory for any party in Finland's post-war history. Their support was highest in Satakunta with 23.6% of the votes and lowest in Helsinki with 13% of the votes. Their rise was said to be because of being a [...] "one-man party" [...] led by Soini's [...] "verbal acuity and {{political}} agility" [...] that resulted in the [...] "closest thing to a landslide victory obtainable in Finland's multiparty politics." [...] With the exception of Helsinki, the support for True Finns was spread out evenly across the country. The party enjoyed strongest support in the municipality of Kihniö, where the party received an absolute majority of votes with 53.2%—largely due to Lea Mäkipää who gained 665 votes, nearly 50% of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> cast.

500|$|During the 2009 {{election}} several {{opinion polls}} showed that Folkvord and Dahle had enough support to earn two seats in parliament.

Folkvord stated several times that he would demand an immediate withdrawal of Norwegian troops from Afghanistan if elected to parliament. He said this decision involved both the [...] "enthusiastic warriors of the Progress Party" [...] and [...] "the disillusioned skeptics of the Socialist Left". Folkvord later felt he needed to set pressure on the Labour Party which would, according to him, move them further to the left. Labour Party member Reiulf Steen had reacted positively towards {{the idea of having}} Folkvord in parliament saying, [...] "I am a great admirer of Erling Folkvord. He has integrity and great courage. Besides I am overjoyed that Red supports the Red-Green coalition". When the votes were counted Red had an increase of 1% from the 2005 election, but it was not enough to secure Folkvord a seat in parliament.
