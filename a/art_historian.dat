5|$|Hergé took up {{painting}} as a hobby, producing abstract art works which {{were influenced by}} the styles of Joan Miró and Serge Poliakoff. He showed his work to the <b>art</b> <b>historian</b> Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing.

5|$|In his {{usage of}} grisaille, van der Weyden distinguishes between the earthly realm {{of flesh and}} blood, and the divine, {{represented}} by ancient sculptural figures, who appear frozen in time. <b>Art</b> <b>historian</b> Shirley Blum believes these figures were relegated to the architectural elements {{so as not to}} crowd the central devotional image.|$|E

5|$|The <b>art</b> <b>historian</b> Hans J. Böker {{claims that}} Foliot began the {{construction}} of the Bishop's Chapel at Hereford Cathedral. Böker contends that the architectural style of the chapel (which was destroyed in 1737) resembled that of the German imperial chapels, and was deliberately chosen by Foliot to demonstrate his loyalty to King Henry. However most sources credit Robert of Hereford, bishop from 1079 to 1095, as the builder of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} not been {{conclusively}} dated. <b>Art</b> <b>historian</b> André Grabar placed it in the 14th century, scholar Nikola Mavrodinov dated it to the 13th century, while archaeologist Krastyu Miyatev is {{of the opinion that}} both theories are equally likely.

50|$|Duncanson {{was largely}} {{forgotten}} from American art history until {{his work was}} rediscovered in the 1950s and 1960s.

5|$|An oil sketch {{attributed}} to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel and entitled Three Female Nudes, is possibly a preliminary study by Etty for Youth and Pleasure, or a copy {{by a student}} of the three central figures. <b>Art</b> <b>historian</b> Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of figures, the subject matter or the sea serpent approaching the group appear to relate to the completed Youth and Pleasure, and considers it more likely to be a preliminary sketch for a now-unknown work.|$|E
5|$|<b>Art</b> <b>historian</b> Charles de Tolnay {{believed}} that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Art</b> <b>historian</b> Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on the {{similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right-hand wing, above the Adoration.|$|E

50|$|Inscriptions dated 1153-1178 CE {{have been}} found at Kiradu. Based on this, Indian {{historian}} Gaurishankar Ojha assigned the temples to the 12th century CE. <b>Art</b> <b>historians</b> Ratna Chandra Agrawala and Stella Kramrisch have also dated the Someshvara temple to the 12th century.

50|$|Janson’s {{commitment}} {{has brought}} the Essential Vermeer {{to the attention of}} <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> and specialists in 17th-century Dutch art as well as writers who use it regularly as a reference point.

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian <b>art</b> <b>historian</b> Andreas Aubert (1851–1913), whose writing {{initiated}} modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the Symbolist painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch (1863–1944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print The Lonely Ones echoes Friedrich's Rückenfigur (back figure), although in Munch's work the focus has shifted away from the broad landscape and toward the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to the Altar of the City Patrons, art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have {{questioned whether the}} diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures with the historical Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the <b>art</b> <b>historian</b> Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, {{as opposed to those}} of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur {{attracted}} {{attention in}} 1885, when Yzerman, the Chairman of the Archaeological Society in Yogyakarta, made a discovery about the hidden foot. Photographs that reveal reliefs on the hidden foot {{were made in}} 1890–1891. The discovery led the Dutch East Indies government {{to take steps to}} safeguard the monument. In 1900, the government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess the monument: Brandes, an <b>art</b> <b>historian,</b> Theodoor van Erp, a Dutch army engineer officer, and Van de Kamer, a construction engineer from the Department of Public Works.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the development of}} Czech art history from {{the late nineteenth century}} to the present. It argues that while Czech <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> were anxious to establish a distinctive art historical voice in Europe, they were led a symbiotic relationship with the Vienna School. Most of the leading <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> of {{the early years of the}} Czechosovak Republic after 1918 studied with Alois Riegl, Franz Wickhoff, Max Dvořák of Josef Strzygowski, and maintained a strong loyalty to the values and methods of their teachers. Thus for all that 1918 marked a political watershed, there was considerable continuity with the Vienna School of the Habsburg Empire. Despite the numerous subsequent political and ideological events, including four decades of Communist, Czech <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> continued to regard Vienna School <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> as fundamental points of reference, and this has been sustained by a self-understanding that has emphasised continuity with the past...|$|R
