40|$|The optimal {{analysis}}/synthesis filters {{giving the}} maximum coding gain are derived in subband schemes. The optimal analysis filters consist of {{the emphasis of}} the <b>picture</b> <b>signal</b> and ideal band-splitting. The characteristic of the emphasis {{is determined by the}} spectrum of the <b>picture</b> <b>signal.</b> A large improvement of coding gain is achieved by the subband scheme with the optimal subband filters obtained here. Approximated emphasis characteristic determined from a spectrum model of <b>picture</b> <b>signals</b> can be used and the ideal hand-splitting filters can be replaced by conventional subband filters since the degradation of coding gain due to these approximations is small. Computer simulation of super HD image coding by the proposed scheme is performed. SN ratio of the reconstructed image is increased and edges are reconstructed very well compared to the conventional subband scheme. The proposed scheme is very suited to super HD image coding since the improvement of SN ratio is large for images with high correlation between the neighboring pixels. 1...|$|R
