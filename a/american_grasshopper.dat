50|$|Schistocerca {{americana}} is {{a species}} of grasshopper in the family Acrididae known commonly as the <b>American</b> <b>grasshopper</b> and American bird grasshopper. It is native to North America, where it occurs in the eastern United States, Mexico, and the Bahamas. Occasional, localized outbreaks of this grasshopper occur, and it {{is often referred to}} as a locust, though it lacks the true swarming form of its congener, the desert locust (S. gregaria).|$|E
40|$|Cannibalism {{is common}} among the Acrididae and the Mormon cricket, Anabrus simplex Haldeman (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae). This {{behavior}} {{has been proposed}} as a mechanism for the horizontal transmission of Microsporida and entomopathogenic fungi. Aanecdotal observations suggested that the migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes Fabricius (Acrididae), and A. simplex did not eat cadavers that {{had been killed by}} insect pathogenic fungi. The hypothesis tested was that A. simplex or M. sanguinipes would not cannibalize individuals freshly killed by the entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana Bals. -Criv. (Vuill.) (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae), or Metarhizium acridum (Driver and Milner) Bischoff, Rehner, and Humber. Cannibalism was examined in a series of no-choice tests with individual insects. Test insects included healthy adults of M. sanguinipes; the differential grasshopper, M. differentialis (Thomas); the <b>American</b> <b>grasshopper,</b> Schistocerca americana (Drury) (Acrididae); and A. simplex. Individual, starved Acrididae or A. simplex were confined in small cages with either a fungus-killed (but unsporulated) or uninfected cadaver. The insects were then observed periodically for the first 4 hr. After 24 hr, the cadavers were scored for the degree to which the...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} {{in behavior}} induced by high rearing density is often {{part of a}} migratory syndrome in insects called phase polyphenism. Among locust species, swarming and the expression of phase polyphenism are highly correlated. The <b>american</b> <b>grasshopper,</b> Schistocerca americana, rarely swarms {{even though it is}} closely related to the swarming Old World desert locust, S. gregaria, as well as two swarming New World locusts. Anecdotal field observations of locust-like behavior in S. americana indicate that it may express behavioral phase polyphenism, but empirical investigations are lacking. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that S. americana expresses locust-like density dependent changes in behavior during both the first and final nymphal instars. I then compared the expression of behavioral phase change between S. americana and S. gregaria. First instar S. americana exhibited significant geographic variation in behavior with grasshoppers from a North Carolina population expressing more pronounced density-dependent changes relative to grasshoppers from a Texas population. The behavior of final instar S. americana was only slightly affected by rearing density and there was no evidence for a difference between populations. Comparison with S. gregaria revealed that the magnitude of density-dependent behavioral change, particularly among final instar nymphs, was much reduced in S. americana...|$|E

40|$|Hatch, the {{emergence}} of a nymph from the egg, is an important phenomenon {{in the life of a}} grasshopper. The embryo, the developmental stage that precedes the nymph, is the longest living stage, often lasting more than 10 months. The timing of hatch is important to grasshopper management because the timing of manage-ment activities is linked to nymphal emergence from eggs in the soil. Most North <b>American</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> have one generation per year. Eggs are usually laid (oviposited) during late summer and early fall and hatch the following spring. There are usually five developmental stages (instars) that are present over a period of about 45 days during the late spring to early summer. Grasshoppers can usually be found as adults in the summer months up to late Septem...|$|R
40|$|Many {{grasshopper}} {{species are}} considered of agronomical importance because they cause damage to pastures and crops. Comprehension of pest population dynamics requires {{a clear understanding}} of the genetic diversity and spatial structure of populations. In this study we report on patterns of genetic variation in the South <b>American</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Dichroplus elongatus which is an agricultural pest of crops and forage grasses of great economic significance in Argentina. We use Direct Amplification of Minisatellite Regions (DAMD) and partial sequences of the cytochrome oxydase 1 (COI) mitochondrial gene to investigate intraspecific structure, demographic history and gene flow patterns in twenty Argentinean populations of this species belonging to different geographic and biogeographic regions. DAMD data suggest that, although genetic drift and migration occur within and between populations, measurable relatedness among neighbouring populations declines with distance and dispersal over distances greater than 200 km is not typical, whereas effective gene flow may occur for populations separated by less than 100 km. Landscape analysis was useful to detect genetic discontinuities associated with environmental heterogeneity reflecting the changing agroecosystem. The COI results indicate the existence of strong genetic differentiation between two groups of populations located at both margins of the Parana ́ River which became separated during climate oscillations of the Middle Pleistocene, suggesting a significant restriction in effective dispersion mediated by females and large scale geographic differentiation. The number of migrant...|$|E
40|$|The zygomycetous fungus Entomophaga grylli is a {{pathogen}} {{that shows}} host-specific variance to grasshopper subfamilies. Three pathotypes of the E. grylli species complex were differentiated by three molecular techniques. In the first method, the three pathotypes showed different fragment patterns generated by random amplifica- tion of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). There was {{little or no}} interisolate variability in RAPD fragment patterns within each pathotype. Passage of an isolate of pathotype 3, originally from an Australian grasshopper (Praxibulus sp.), through a North <b>American</b> <b>grasshopper</b> resulted in no differences in the resultant RAPD fragment patterns. In the second method, polymorphic RAPD fragments were used to probe the genomic DNA from the three pathotypes, and pathotype-specific fragments were found. In the third method, restriction fragments from genomic DNA of the three pathotypes were cloned and screened for pathotype specificity. A genomic probe specific for each pathotype was isolated. These probes did not hybridize to DNA from Ento- mophaga aulicae or from grasshoppers. To facilitate the use of RAPD analysis and other molecular tools to identify pathotypes, a method for extracting DNA from resting spores from infected grasshoppers was devel- oped. The DNA from the fractured resting spores was of sufficient integrity to be blotted and probed with the pathotype-specific DNA probes, thus validating {{the use of these}} probes for pathotype identification in field- collected grasshoppers...|$|E
40|$|Three {{aromatic}} juvenoids (fenoxycarb, JH- 286 {{and a new}} pyrazole analog) {{were evaluated}} for morphogenetic, chromotropic, morphometric and prothoracicotropic activities on the <b>American</b> <b>grasshopper,</b> Schistocerca americana (Drury), and their activities {{compared with those of}} commercial methoprene and synthetic JH-III. Fenoxycarb, the most active insect growth regulator examined, was found to induce a significant mortality in developing nymphs and caused severe morphogenetic damage during ecdysis to the adult. Juvenoid treatment were also observed to promote some overaged nymphs and to induce chromotropic changes in both the cuticle and hemolymph pigmentation. Except for a reduced larvicidal action, similar levels of activity were obtained when fenoxycarb was tested on the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forskal). The chromoproteins responsible for the green coloration characteristic of the hemolymph of S. americana and S. gregaria were isolated and characterized. Hemolymph from last instar nymphs and adults of S. americana was characterized by the presence of yellow lipophorin (Lp), a green chromoprotein (G-P), and two cyanoproteins (Cp-I and Cp-II). Treatment with fenoxycarb enhanced the concentration of the two cyanoproteins in nymphs and adults, and induced the appearance of a third cyanoprotein (Cp-F) in nymphs. Hemolymph from last instar nymphs of S. gregaria was characterized by the presence of yellow lipophorin (Lp) and two blue cyanoproteins (HCp and LCp), whereas only Lp and LCp were present in adults. Treatment with fenoxycarb increased the concentration of both cyanoproteins in nymphs, but only of LCp in adults. The non-steroidal ecdysone-agonist 2 RH- 5849 (1, 2 -dibenzoyl- 1 -tert-buthyl-hydrazine) was found to be an effective neuropoison when injected on S. americana. Treated grasshoppers became immediately hyperactive, followed by loss of coordination, paralysis and eventually death. We discovered that this insect growth regulator also induced bilateral autotomy of the methatoracic legs. However, no evidence of ecdysonergic or morphogenetic activities were found. Synergism studies with neurotoxins of known mode of action suggested that RH- 5849 has a mechanism of action similar to that of 4 -amino pyridine, which blocks potassium channels...|$|E
50|$|The {{largest of}} this widespread, varied complex of insects are the giant wetas of New Zealand, {{which is now}} split among 12 species. The largest {{of these is the}} Little Barrier Island giant weta (Deinacrida heteracantha), the largest {{specimen}} was weighed at 71.3 g, one of the largest insects weights ever known. These heavyweight insects can be over 9 cm long. The largest grasshopper species is often considered to be the Australian giant grasshopper (Valanga irregularis), which ranges up to 9 cm in length. The <b>American</b> eastern lubber <b>grasshopper</b> (Romalea guttata) can allegedly range up to 10 cm in length. However, the greatest grasshopper sizes known, to 12 cm, have been cited in the South <b>American</b> giant <b>grasshopper</b> (Tropidacris violaceus).

40|$|The family Poxviridae {{contains}} two subfamilies: the Entomopoxvirinae (poxviruses of insects) and the Chordopoxvirinae (poxviruses of vertebrates). Here we present the first {{characterization of the}} genome of an entomopoxvirus (EPV) which infects the North <b>American</b> migratory <b>grasshopper</b> Melanoplus sanguinipes and other important orthopteran pests. The 236 -kbp M. sanguinipes EPV (MsEPV) genome consists of a central coding region bounded by 7 -kbp inverted terminal repeats and contains 267 open reading frames (ORFs), of which 107 exhibit similarity to previously described genes. The presence of genes not previously described in poxviruses, {{and in some cases}} in any other known virus, suggests significant viral adaptation to the arthropod host and the external environment. Genes predicting interactions with host cellular mechanisms include homologues of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein, stress response protein phosphatase 2 C, extracellular matrixin metalloproteases, ubiquitin, calcium binding EF-hand protein, glycosyltransferase, and a triacylglyceride lipase. MsEPV genes with putative functions in prevention and repair of DNA damage include a complete base excision repair pathway (uracil DNA glycosylase, AP endonuclease, DNA polymerase β, and an NAD+-dependent DNA ligase), a photoreactivation repair pathway (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase), a LINE-type reverse transcriptase, and a mutT homologue. The presence of these specific repair pathways may represent viral adaptation for repair of environmentally induced DNA damage. The absence of previously described poxvirus enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism and the presence of a novel thymidylate synthase homologue suggest that MsEPV is heavily reliant on host cell nucleotide pools and the de novo nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. MsEPV and lepidopteran genus B EPVs lack genome colinearity and exhibit a low level of amino acid identity among homologous genes (20 to 59 %), perhaps reflecting a significant evolutionary distance between lepidopteran and orthopteran viruses. Divergence between MsEPV and the Chordopoxvirinae is indicated by the presence of only 49 identifiable chordopoxvirus homologues, low-level amino acid identity among these genes (20 to 48 %), and the presence in MsEPV of 43 novel ORFs in five gene families. Genes common to both poxvirus subfamilies, which include those encoding enzymes involved in RNA transcription and modification, DNA replication, protein processing, virion assembly, and virion structural proteins, define the genetic core of the Poxviridae...|$|R
