5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marshalsea.|$|E

5|$|People {{associated}} with the church include Henry Maurice (elected Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford {{shortly before his death}} in 1691; his father, Thomas, was the perpetual curate of the church) and the 19th-century writer and priest Owen Wynne Jones (who was the curate for <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1860s). The 19th-century Calvinistic Methodist preacher Richard Owen was born in the parish, and is buried in the graveyard that surrounds the church.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, and drew heavily from the {{conventions}} of Westerns, especially Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns such as Once Upon <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West (1968), and John Sturges' film The Magnificent Seven (1960). Sholay was also influenced by the westerns of Sam Peckinpah, such as The Wild Bunch (1969) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973); and by George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery {{was inspired by a}} similar scene in North West Frontier (1959), and a scene showing the massacre of Thakur's family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family in Once Upon <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West. Some plot elements were borrowed from the Indian films Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971) and Khote Sikkay (1973).|$|E

Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating {{explosives}} such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known to spend hours at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.|$|E
5|$|Benedicte Wrensted (1859–1949) was {{a notable}} Danish female photographer, who {{emigrated to the}} USA in 1894. Wrensted learned her craft from her {{maternal}} aunt, Charlotte Borgen, and for <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1880s operated a studio on Torvet 8, in Horsens, Denmark. Much of her photographic career is anchored to her studio in Pocatello, {{a small town in}} southeastern Idaho, where she took photographs of the local inhabitants and recorded the growth of the town. Perhaps her most famous work remains her documentary photographs of the Shoshone Great Basin Native Americans which are considered of great anthropological importance. Wrensted became a U.S. citizen in 1912, at age 53, and in the same year ended her career as a photographer. Many of her Native American images are preserved at the Smithsonian Institution and National Archives.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{served with}} the Mediterranean Fleet after a brief stint in the Channel Fleet. In 1905, she resumed service with a now re-organised Channel Fleet and was {{also part of the}} Atlantic Fleet for <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> service of the Home Fleet from 1907, she was placed in reserve in 1912. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Caesar returned to the Channel Fleet before being transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in 1915 after a brief spell as a guard ship at Gibraltar. From 1918 to 1919 she served as a depot ship, firstly in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and then the Black Sea, in support of naval operations against the Bolsheviks. In this latter role, she was the last of the pre-dreadnought battleships to see service outside the United Kingdom. Returning to England in 1920, she was decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1921.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel, however, {{was still}} {{disappointed}} with the failure to destroy the Turkish army. The Turks had fought hard, forcing {{the commitment of the}} Desert Mounted Corps in heavy action before the moment for a sweeping pursuit came. When it did, the men and horses were too tired and could not summon the required energy. In February 1918, the EEF began a series of operations across the Jordan. Allenby soon found his British troops diverted to France, to be replaced by two Indian cavalry divisions, and the Australian Mounted Division faced a similar fate for <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, during the second Transjordan operations Chauvel faced great difficulties with the terrain, the weather and a tenacious enemy; the campaign was not a success. The Desert Mounted Corps found itself fighting outnumbered, with Turkish reinforcements closing in from all sides. Chauvel was forced to withdraw to the West Bank of the Jordan. Subsequently, the 5th Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was disbanded and Chauvel replaced it with the 5th Light Horse Brigade, formed from the Australian and New Zealand components of the now disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and a composite French cavalry regiment of Spahis and Chasseurs d'Afrique.|$|E
5|$|Following their wedding, {{the couple}} leased Windlesham Moor, near Windsor Castle, until July 1949, {{when they took}} up {{residence}} at Clarence House in London.

He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hamlet of Gwardamanġa, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten.

5|$|In 1947 {{the ship}} was sold to the South African Navy, {{together}} with her sister ship, Rosamund, and departed England on 22 November after a refresher course at the minesweeping school at HMS Lochinvar, Port Edgar, Scotland. The sisters arrived at Cape Town on 24 December, making stops at Gibraltar, Freetown and Walvis Bay en route. She was rechristened by {{the mayor of the}} city, A. E. Hirst, on 21 January 1948. The navy had originally intended to rename the ship Maritzburg, but decided to use the city's full name after protests. In November of that year, the sisters exercised with the British 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron. Later that month, together with the frigate , they visited ports in Portuguese Mozambique, returning to Durban on 12 December. While serving as a midshipmans' training ship, Pietermaritzburg became the largest South African warship to visit Knysna in September 1953.

5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E
5|$|Iowan resumed cargo {{service with}} American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though {{the company had}} {{abandoned}} its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, Iowan continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal.	For <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1920s, Iowan was chartered to the United American Line. In May 1922, the Associated Press reported that Iowan, sailing under the United American banner, was loading wheat, flour, and lumber at Tacoma, Washington, for England and European ports. Later that same month, on 29 May, Iowan rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line cargo ship Welsh Prince in the Columbia River near Astoria, Oregon. Seven men aboard Welsh Prince were killed and three were injured in the crash and subsequent fire.|$|E
