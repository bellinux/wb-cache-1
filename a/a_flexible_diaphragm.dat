50|$|If {{the engine}} must be {{operated}} in any orientation (for example {{a chain saw}} or a model airplane), a float chamber is not suitable. Instead, a diaphragm chamber is used. <b>A</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragm</b> forms {{one side of the}} fuel chamber and is arranged so that as fuel is drawn out into the engine, the diaphragm is forced inward by ambient air pressure. The diaphragm is connected to the needle valve and as it moves inward it opens the needle valve to admit more fuel, thus replenishing the fuel as it is consumed. As fuel is replenished the diaphragm moves out due to fuel pressure and a small spring, closing the needle valve. A balanced state is reached which creates a steady fuel reservoir level, which remains constant in any orientation.|$|E
50|$|Back in the U.S., Frederick Grinnell, who was {{manufacturing}} the Parmalee sprinkler, {{designed the}} more effective Grinnell sprinkler. He increased sensitivity {{by removing the}} fusible joint from all contact with the water, and, by seating a valve {{in the center of}} <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> he relieved the low-fusing soldered joint of the strain of water pressure. By this means the valve seat was forced against the valve by the water pressure, producing a self-closing action, so that the greater the water pressure, the tighter the valve. The flexible diaphragm had a further and most important function. It caused the valve and its seat to move outwards simultaneously until the solder joint was completely severed. Grinnell got a patent for his version of the sprinkler system. He also took his invention to Europe, where it was a much bigger success than the Parmalee version. Eventually, the Parmalee system was withdrawn, which left an open path for Grinnell and his invention.|$|E
2500|$|These early {{headphones}} used moving iron drivers, {{with either}} single-ended or balanced armatures. [...] The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles {{of a permanent}} magnet, which were positioned close to <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> steel <b>diaphragm.</b> [...] The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves. [...] The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor sound quality. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their impedance varied; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75ohms. Those used with early wireless radio {{had to be more}} sensitive and were made with more turns of finer wire. Impedance of 1000 to 2000ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and triode receivers.

50|$|On the {{formation}} of British Railways on 1 January 1948, operators decided to produce a new range of standard coaches, instead of perpetuating existing designs—but the new types had to be compatible with the old. Two of the pre-BR companies (the GWR and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway) favoured the British Standard gangway, whereas the other two (the London and North Eastern Railway and the Southern Railway) used the Pullman type. In the design of their new Mark 1 coaches, British Railways decided to standardise on the Pullman type in view of its resistance to telescoping. These gangways consisted of a flat steel plate, having a large aperture for the passageway. At the bottom it was rivetted to the buffing plate, whilst the top was supported on the coach end by two telescopic spring units. On the coach end was a wooden doorframe; this {{was connected to the}} faceplate by <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragm</b> made from plasticised asbestos. When two coaches were coupled, a curtain was used to cover the inside surfaces of the diaphragms and faceplates. The doorframe was fitted with a lockable door, of either sliding or hinged type, depending on the interior layout of that end of the coach.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} adoption of electronic fuel injection, most carbureted automobile engines used mechanical fuel pumps to transfer fuel from {{the fuel tank}} into the fuel bowls of the carburetor. Most mechanical fuel pumps are diaphragm pumps, which are a type of positive displacement pump. Diaphragm pumps contain a pump chamber whose volume is increased or decreased by the flexing of <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> similar to the action of a piston pump. A check valve is located at both the inlet and outlet ports of the pump chamber to force the fuel to flow in one direction only. Specific designs vary, but in the most common configuration, these pumps are typically bolted onto the engine block or head, and the engine's camshaft has an extra eccentric lobe that operates a lever on the pump, either directly or via a pushrod, by pulling the diaphragm to bottom dead center. In doing so, the volume inside the pump chamber increased, causing pressure to decrease.This allows fuel to be pushed into the pump from the tank (caused by atmospheric pressure acting on the fuel in the tank). The return motion of the diaphragm to top dead center is accomplished by a diaphragm spring, during which the fuel in the pump chamber is squeezed through the outlet port and into the carburetor. The pressure at which the fuel is expelled from the pump is thus limited (and therefore regulated) by the force applied by the diaphragm spring.|$|E

The Club Car was rendered obsolete in that sense, so the car was returned to Newport Workshops and rebuilt again. It re-entered service on 21 March 1963, renamed Norman. The name and purpose had been recycled from the previous carriage, which had been reserved for use by railway officials on inspection tours around the state, and other high-profile events. The car was extensively rebuilt for the new purpose; <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragm</b> was fitted to the flat end in lieu of the full-width, collapsible steel-plated diaphragm, which had been intended to make the Spirit of Progress train look like one unit rather than individual carriages. End windows were cut into the body at that end either side of the doorway. An additional door was also cut into the rounded end of the carriage, allowing access/egress when the carriage was parked in a railmotor dock or similar; and both ends were fitted with external marker lights above the roofline and at around waist height. Internally the car was gutted and nearly everything was replaced. The flat end was refitted with a small 11 ft office/meeting area with four individual seats provided, replacing the former guard compartment and male bathroom. The ladies' bathroom was retained and made unisex. A 14 ft kitchen area with buffet counter was fitted over where the former buffet and semicircle tables were placed, and expanding somewhat into the observation saloon. That saloon was fitted with a central table of 17 ft, surrounded with 21 seats. The three windows adjacent to the kitchen were partially filled in, allowing for a higher cooking surface.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new analytical approach for quasi-static modeling of an electrostatically actuated diaphragm compressor {{that could be}} employed in a miniature scale refrigeration system. The compressor consists of <b>a</b> <b>ﬂexible</b> circular <b>diaphragm</b> clamped at its circumference. A conformal chamber encloses the diaphragm completely. The membrane and the chamber surfaces are coated with metallic electrodes. A potential difference applied between the diaphragm and the chamber pulls the diaphragm toward the chamber surface progressively from the outer circumference toward the center. This zipping actuation reduces the volume available to the refrigerant gas, thereby increasing its pressure. A segmentation technique is proposed for analysis of the compressor by which the domain is divided into multiple segments for each of which the forces acting on the diaphragm are estimated. The pull-down voltage to completely zip each individual segment is thus obtained. The required voltage for obtaining a speciﬁc pressure rise in the chamber can thus be determined. Predictions from the model compare well with other simulation results from the literature, {{as well as to}} experimental measurements of the diaphragm displacement and chamber pressure rise in a custom-built setup...|$|R

30|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of {{forces from the}} simple equivalent lateral force method, which is commonly used for designing the lateral force-resisting system, is based on assumptions for elastic mode shapes of structures with rigid diaphragms (Fleischman and Farrow 2001; SEAOC 1999). Therefore, for structures with flexible diaphragms, the diaphragm design forces calculated according to the code methods may not be appropriate. When a structure with <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is considered to have a rigid diaphragm, the period will be underestimated. For structures with periods on the descending branch of the spectral acceleration period plot, this may result in some structural base shears being slightly overestimated. However, the actual displacement will be greater than predicted. That is, the structure with <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragm</b> will have larger displacements along the diaphragm length compared with the displacements because of a rigid diaphragm assumption. This unaccounted increased displacement, because of a rigid diaphragm assumption, may increase the possibility of damage because of structural pounding with neighboring structures. It will also affect the distribution of forces between vertical lateral force-resisting ‘VLFR’ elements, which may be critical if they, or the elements they are connected to, do not possess sufficient strength or ductility (Sadashiva et al. 2012).|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>flexible</b> timber <b>diaphragms</b> in many existing unreinforced masonry buildings poses a significant {{challenge for the}} assessment of their seismic vulnerability. When <b>diaphragms</b> are <b>flexible,</b> different parts of a structure can interact with each other dynamically, in a way not typically encountered in modern structures with rigid diaphragms. As a result, the seismic analysis methods developed for buildings with rigid diaphragms, as well as our basic understanding of the dynamic behaviours of buildings under earthquake excitations, cannot be applied directly for buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> This thesis addresses two issues that require immediate attention in improving the seismic analysis of unreinforced masonry buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms,</b> namely (1) to enhance our understanding of the dynamic response characteristics of low-rise buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms,</b> and (2) to investigate the applicability of an array of existing analysis methods developed for rigid diaphragm structures. The research work presented in this thesis begins with a basic analysis of the elastic behaviour of symmetric buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> Through <b>an</b> analytical study of their modal properties, it is shown that at least two dominant modes are present in the dynamic responses of buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> Using the results of modal analysis, an improvement to the linear static analysis method is proposed. The inelastic behaviours of symmetric- and asymmetric-plan building systems with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms</b> are then investigated through a systematic parametric analysis. It is shown that the effect of diaphragm flexibility varies depending on the level of stiffness- and strength-eccentricity of the system. A general diaphragm classification is developed to explain the influence of diaphragm flexibility on the global building response. A simple numerical modelling technique to incorporate the dynamic behaviours of <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms</b> in <b>a</b> three-dimensional equivalent frame modelling approach is also investigated, and validated against shake table test data. Finally, the applicability of nonlinear static procedures utilising single-mode, multi-mode and adaptive pushover analyses are investigated.

She jumped bail in 1914 after her arrest for distributing birth control information and left the United States for the United Kingdom.

It was shut down after eleven days and resulted in her arrest. The publicity surrounding the arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States.
