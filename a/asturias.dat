5|$|In Spain {{there are}} several traditions about beings with vampiric tendencies. In <b>Asturias</b> {{highlights}} the Guaxa, which is described as an old vampire who sticks his single tooth and sucks the blood of its victims. Cantabria equivalent exists in the name Guajona. Catalonia is {{the legend of the}} Dip, an evil vampire dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} has been fully {{protected}} in Italy since 1976, and now holds {{a population of}} over 1,269-1,800. Italian wolves entered France's Mercantour National Park in 1993, and at least fifty wolves were discovered in the western Alps in 2000. By 2013 the 250 wolves in the Western Alps imposed a significant burden on traditional sheep and goat husbandry {{with a loss of}} over 5,000 animals in 2012. There are approximately 2,000 wolves inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula, of which 150 reside in northeastern Portugal. In Spain, the species occurs in Galicia, Leon, and <b>Asturias.</b> Although hundreds of Iberian wolves are illegally killed annually, the population has expanded south across the river Duero and east to the <b>Asturias</b> and Pyrenees Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Among the Puerto Ricans {{who fought}} {{alongside}} General Franco {{on behalf of}} the Nationalists was General Manuel Goded Llopis (1882–1936), a high-ranking officer in the Spanish Army. Llopis, who was born in San Juan, was named Chief of Staff of the Spanish Army of Africa, after his victories in the Rif War, took the Balearic Islands and by order of Franco, suppressed the rebellion of <b>Asturias.</b> Llopis was sent to lead the fight against the Anarchists in Catalonia, but his troops were outnumbered. He was captured and was sentenced to die by firing squad.|$|E
5|$|For Gore's wide-reaching {{efforts to}} draw the world’s {{attention}} {{to the dangers of}} global warming which is centerpieced in the film, Al Gore, along with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Gore also received the Prince of <b>Asturias</b> Prize in 2007 for international cooperation. The related album, which featured the voices of Beau Bridges, Cynthia Nixon and Blair Underwood, also won Best Spoken Word Album at the 51st Grammy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Gore is the {{recipient}} of a number of awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize (together with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) in 2007, a Primetime Emmy Award for Current TV in 2007, a Webby Award in 2005 and the Prince of <b>Asturias</b> Award in 2007 for International Cooperation. He also starred in the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2007 and wrote the book , which won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Villa {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart Patricia González, {{who had also}} been a footballer in her teenage years. Together they have three children: Zaida, Olaya — named after the wife of Fernando Torres, who is {{a close friend of}} Patricia — and Luca. The names of his children are engraved on his personalised Adidas F50 boots; while one boot bears the Spanish flag, the other has the flag of <b>Asturias.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1938, another PanzerI {{was sent}} to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45mm gun, {{captured}} from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to <b>Asturias</b> in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|On July 31, {{a funeral}} {{was held at}} the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Palma. The service was {{attended}} by Primer Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and Prince and Princess of <b>Asturias,</b> Felipe and Letizia. Other people attending the mass were leader of the opposition Mariano Rajoy, Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba and Patxi López, among others. At least 2,000 gathered outside of the cathedral and a minute of silence was held across Spain in memory of the dead.|$|E
5|$|The Philippines {{was named}} in honor of King PhilipII of Spain. Spanish {{explorer}} Ruy López de Villalobos, during his expedition in 1542, named the islands of Leyte and Samar Felipinas after the then-Prince of <b>Asturias.</b> Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago. Before that became commonplace, other names such as Islas del Poniente (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands San Lázaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Center for Emergency Coordination {{declared}} a rain pre-emergency for {{the province of}} Castellón in the anticipation that Hurricane Vince would bring rains capable of flooding. The Instituto Nacional de Meteorología (INM) issued a bulletin that warned of a 40% chance of flooding. Four Spanish autonomous communities (<b>Asturias,</b> Catalonia, Castile and León, and Galicia) issued flood warnings, and Canarias issued a wind warning. Spanish fishing fleets off the Andalusian coast returned to port and weathered the storm on their moorings {{rather than in the}} open ocean.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish anarcho-syndicalists, {{who opposed}} the war out of doctrinaire cynicism and a belief that neither faction were on the workers' side, angrily repudiated their former idols (including Kropotkin, Malato and Grave) after {{discovering}} they had authored the manifesto. A small number of anarchists in Galicia and <b>Asturias</b> dissented and were heatedly denounced {{by the majority of}} Catalan anarcho-syndicalists (who prevailed in the anarchist union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo).|$|E
5|$|The need {{to secure}} a {{replacement}} for Melbourne grew as the carrier's age caused the operating costs to increase to over A$25million per year. In June 1977, the Defence Force Development Committee approved an investigation into acquiring a STOVL/helicopter carrier. By August 1979, the decision was limited to three ships: a modified American Iwo Jima-class amphibious assault ship, an Italian Giuseppe Garibaldi-class carrier, and a Sea Control Ship design that later became the Spanish Navy's Principe de <b>Asturias.</b> By February 1981, the Iwo Jima class was the preferred option.|$|E
5|$|The {{orchestra}} {{has made}} many non-classical recordings, including such titles as Hawaiian Paradise (1959), Evita (1976), Broadway Gold (1978), Folk Music of the Region of <b>Asturias</b> (1984), Academy Award Themes (1984), Japanese Light Music (1993), The Symphonic Music of Pink Floyd (1994) and The Symphonic Music of The Who (1995). In May 2011 the orchestra recorded the 205 national anthems {{to be used}} at medal ceremonies at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London the following year. These versions of the anthems were re-used at the 2016 Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|This {{magnificent}} {{and tragic}} satire criticizes {{the prototype of}} the Latin American dictator who appeared in several places {{at the beginning of}} the century and has since reappeared, his existence being fostered by the mechanism of tyranny which, for the common man, makes every day a hell on earth. The passionate vigour with which <b>Asturias</b> evokes the terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of the time makes his work a challenge and an invaluable aesthetic gesture.|$|E
5|$|Between February and June 1806, Emerald {{underwent}} repairs at Deptford dockyard and was recommissioned under Captain John Armour; Frederick Lewis Maitland assumed {{command in}} the first quarter of 1807. While in the Basque Roads in April, Emerald captured the 14-gun privateer Austerlitz, a brig from Nantes under the command of Captain Gatien Lafont. Emerald, while escorting a Spanish polacca that she had taken, spotted and captured the privateer on 14 April after a ten-hour chase. Austerlitz had been out of port two days but had made no captures; the polacca was the Spanish ship Prince of <b>Asturias,</b> which had sailed from La Guayra with a cargo of cocoa, bark and indigo. Emerald sent both prizes into Plymouth, where they arrived on 22 April. Emerald herself set off in pursuit of another vessel from La Guayra.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{he won the}} Prince of <b>Asturias</b> Awards in Arts, and on 23 March 2007, the University of Cadiz {{recognized}} de Lucía's {{musical and}} cultural contributions by conferring on him the title of Doctor Honoris Causa. In 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Berklee College of Music in Boston, and performed at the Montreux Festival. However, he is known some years to select countries where he doesn't usually perform and played at Arena in Pula, Croatia in 2006 and 2010, and in Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia in 2013. He appeared at the 49th Carthage International Festival on 31 July, playing at the Roman Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In honour of Schumacher's racing {{career and}} {{his efforts to}} improve safety and the sport, he was awarded an FIA Gold Medal for Motor Sport in 2006. In 2007, in {{recognition}} of his contribution to Formula One racing, the Nürburgring racing track renamed turns 8 and 9 (the Audi and Shell Kurves) as the Schumacher S, and a month later he presented A1 Team Germany with the A1 World Cup at the A1GP World Cup of Motorsport 2007 awards ceremony. He was nominated for the Prince of <b>Asturias</b> Award for Sport for 2007, which he won both for sporting prowess and for his humanitarian record.|$|E
5|$|Marie's {{popularity}} {{was severely}} affected during Michael's reign and, after {{refusing to be}} part of the regency council in 1929, she was accused by the press, and even by Princess Helen, of plotting a coup. During this time, there were numerous rumours as to Princess Ileana's marriage. After talk of Ileana marrying the Tsar of Bulgaria or the Prince of <b>Asturias,</b> she was eventually betrothed to Alexander, Count of Hochberg, a minor German prince, in early 1930. This betrothal was, however, short-lived and Marie never managed to conclude a political marriage for her youngest daughter, instead marrying her to Archduke Anton of Austria–Tuscany in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Missionary {{efforts to}} Scandinavia during the 9th and 10th centuries helped {{strengthen}} {{the growth of}} kingdoms such as Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, which gained power and territory. Some kings converted to Christianity, although not all by 1000. Scandinavians also expanded and colonised throughout Europe. Besides the settlements in Ireland, England, and Normandy, further settlement took place in what became Russia and in Iceland. Swedish traders and raiders ranged down the rivers of the Russian steppe, and even attempted to seize Constantinople in 860 and 907. Christian Spain, initially driven into a small section of the peninsula in the north, expanded slowly south during the 9th and 10th centuries, establishing the kingdoms of <b>Asturias</b> and León.|$|E
5|$|Onneca Fortúnez or Iñiga Fortúnez (c. 848 – after 890) was a Basque princess {{from the}} Kingdom of Pamplona, later {{known as the}} Kingdom of Navarre. She was the {{daughter}} of Fortún Garcés of Pamplona and his wife Auria. At the time of Onneca's birth, which occurred between 848 and 850, the Iberian Peninsula was largely under the domination of the Muslim Umayyad dynasty. Only the northern kingdoms of <b>Asturias</b> and Pamplona remained under Christian rule, perpetuating the Hispano-Roman Visigothic traditions. Onneca {{was a member of the}} Íñiguez dynasty, named after her great-grandfather Íñigo Arista, who founded the Kingdom of Pamplona.|$|E
5|$|Peirce was {{recognized}} at several awards ceremonies for her {{direction of the}} film {{as well as her}} work co-authorship of the screenplay with Andy Bienen. She won the Best New Filmmaker award from the Boston Society of Film Critics, the FIPRESCI and Satyajit Ray Awards at the London Film Festival, the National Board of Review award for Best Directorial Debut, Best Director and Screenwriter at the Young Hollywood Awards, the FIPRESCI and Best Screenplay awards at the Stockholm International Film Festival, and the Audience Choice Award at the St. Louis International Film Festival. In addition, Peirce was further nominated for a European Film Award, the Grand Prix <b>Asturias</b> at the Gijón International Film Festival, the Best First Feature and Best First Screenplay awards at the Independent Spirit Awards.|$|E
5|$|Besides honors, memberships, and postings to prestigious {{organizations}} worldwide, Edward Said {{was awarded}} some twenty honorary university {{degrees in the}} course of his professional life as an academic, critic, and Man of Letters. Among the honors bestowed to him was the Bowdoin Prize by Harvard University. He twice received the Lionel Trilling Book Award; the first occasion was the inaugural bestowing of said literary award in 1976, for Beginnings: Intention and Method (1974). He also received the Wellek Prize of the American Comparative Literature Association, and was awarded the inaugural Spinoza Lens Prize. In 2001, Said was awarded the Lannan Literary Award for Lifetime Achievement, and in 2002, he received the Prince of <b>Asturias</b> Award for Concord. He was the first U.S. citizen to receive the Sultan Owais Prize (for Cultural & Scientific Achievements, 1996–1997). The autobiography Out of Place (1999) was bestowed three awards, the 1999 New Yorker Book Award for Non-Fiction; the 2000 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Non-Fiction; and the Morton Dauwen Zabel Award in Literature.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and {{autonomous}} communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although {{the effect was}} mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), <b>Asturias</b> (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Army of Africa {{crossed the}} Gibraltar Strait, using Junkers Ju 52 {{transport}} planes provided by Nazi Germany, without any loyalist Air Force interference {{owing to the}} confusion and lack of decision of the Spanish Republican side. The massive airlift of troops from Spanish Morocco was the world's first long-range combat airlift and it allowed Franco's troops to join General Queipo de Llano's forces in Seville. Their quick movement allowed them to meet General Mola's Northern Army and secure most of northern and northwestern Spain, as well as central and western Andalusia. The Republican Government ended up with controlling {{almost all of the}} Eastern Spanish coast and central area around Madrid, as well as <b>Asturias,</b> Cantabria and part of the Basque Country in the north. Mola was keen {{to create a sense of}} fear within Nationalist-controlled areas. There was a massive purge of freemasons, and a wide part of the left, including some moderate socialists.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August, Murray {{commanded}} A Company—which {{consisted of}} fewer than one hundred men—in a successful attack that captured Mouquet Farm under heavy fire. His men repelled four German counterattacks before he ordered them to withdraw. He remained in command until the next morning, when he fainted from loss of blood from two wounds he had sustained during the action. Murray was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his service during the action, an event that was published in a supplement of the London Gazette dated 14 November 1916. He was later evacuated to England aboard the hospital ship <b>Asturias,</b> and admitted to the 4th General Hospital, London, where he was to share a ward with Albert Jacka and Percy Black, who were recovering from wounds received at Poziéres and Mouquet Farm respectively. After nearly six weeks of recuperation, {{he returned to the}} 13th Battalion in France on 19 October.|$|E
5|$|Production on The Orphanage {{began on}} May 15, 2006 in Llanes, <b>Asturias.</b> This {{location}} was chosen {{due to the}} area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place. The orphanage was an old colonial house {{from the end of}} the nineteenth century. Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages. After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona to finish up the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there. Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.|$|E
5|$|Some common loons {{remain in}} Iceland year-round, {{although}} most migrate. In North America, they winter mainly along north Atlantic and north-east Pacific coasts, many stopping {{off on the}} Great Lakes during their migration. They migrate in the day, starting about two hours after sunrise and flying at altitudes of 1500 to 2700 m above sea level, above the convective and turbulent layer of air. In winter they {{can be seen on}} North America coasts as far south as Baja California, Sonora, northern Sinaloa, southern Texas, and rarely northern Tamaulipas. In the east, several thousand winter along western European coasts, probably originating from Iceland, Greenland, and Canada. Their range extends into northwestern Europe from Finland to Portugal and southern and northwestern Spain (Galicia and <b>Asturias),</b> as well as the western Mediterranean off Catalonia, and off Morocco in Africa, although only a few hundred travel as far south as Iberia. Although wintering site fidelity is not well known, annually, adults are observed to return to the same wintering locations in the Pacific Ocean (Morro Bay), the Gulf of Mexico (Barataria Bay), the Atlantic Ocean (Maryland and Massachusetts), and the reservoir Lake Pateros.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in <b>Asturias</b> (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E
5|$|The Nationalists {{returned}} {{to focus on}} the capture of northern Spain. German test aircraft, with the latest models, faced an outdated Basque section (Escuadrilla vasca) of the Spanish Republican Air Force. Heavy aerial bombardment from 200 Nationalist, German and Italian aircraft was used far behind Basque lines in August 1937, leading to the fall of Santander after the Battle of Santander on 1 September. The formal battle in <b>Asturias</b> ended with the fall of Gijón on 21 October. Germany immediately began to ship the products of the region's industry back to Germany. Sperrle argued repeatedly with Faupel, and against HISMA's monopoly. Faupel was replaced with Eberhard von Stohrer by Franco, through Sperrle. Sperrle also {{returned to}} Germany and was replaced by Helmuth Volkmann; following disagreements with Volkmann, Von Richthofen would be replaced with Hermann Plocher in early 1938.|$|E
5|$|To {{counter the}} {{advances}} the pro-independence forces {{had made in}} South America, Spain prepared a second, large, expeditionary force in 1819. This force, however, never left Spain. Instead, it became {{the means by which}} liberals were finally able to reinstate a constitutional regime. On January 1, 1820, Rafael Riego, commander of the <b>Asturias</b> Battalion, headed a rebellion among the troops, demanding the return of the 1812 Constitution. His troops marched through the cities of Andalusia with the hope of extending the uprising to the civilian population, but locals were mostly indifferent. An uprising, however, did occur in Galicia in northern Spain, and from there it quickly spread throughout the country. On March 7, the royal palace in Madrid was surrounded by soldiers under the command of General Francisco Ballesteros, and three days later, on March 10, the besieged Ferdinand VII, now a virtual prisoner, agreed to restore the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Victoria's {{youngest}} son, Leopold, {{was affected}} by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia B and two of her five daughters, Alice and Beatrice, were carriers. Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons, Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia, Alfonso, Prince of <b>Asturias,</b> and Infante Gonzalo of Spain. The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed {{he would have been}} seriously ill. It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 {{at the time of her}} conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers. Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases.|$|E
25|$|With {{the forced}} abdication of Alfonso III by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of <b>Asturias</b> split into three {{separate}} kingdoms of León, Galicia and <b>Asturias.</b> The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 (León and Galicia in 914, <b>Asturias</b> later) under {{the crown of}} León. It continued under that name until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230, after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Asturias</b> then met {{and married}} his second wife, Blanca Mora y Araujo, in 1950. Mora y Araujo was Argentinian, and so when <b>Asturias</b> was {{deported}} from Guatemala in 1954, he went {{to live in the}} Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires. He lived in his wife's homeland for eight years. <b>Asturias</b> dedicated his novel Week-end en Guatemala to his wife, Blanca, after it was published in 1956. They remained married until Asturias' death in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Miguel Ángel <b>Asturias</b> {{was born}} in Guatemala City on October 19, 1899, the first child of Ernesto <b>Asturias</b> Girón, a lawyer and judge, and María Rosales de <b>Asturias,</b> a schoolteacher. Two years later, his brother, Marco Antonio, was born. Asturias's parents were of Spanish descent, and {{reasonably}} distinguished: his father could trace his family line back to colonists who had arrived in Guatemala in the 1660s; his mother, whose ancestry was more mixed, {{was the daughter of}} a colonel. In 1905, when the writer was six years old, the <b>Asturias</b> family moved to the house of Asturias' grandparents, where they lived a more comfortable lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|For <b>Asturias,</b> {{a legend}} is a {{cultural}} artifact {{in a state of}} constant change. Wanting {{to be part of this}} change, <b>Asturias</b> took popular and well-known legends and modified them, combining elements, and morphing some parts beyond recognition.|$|E
