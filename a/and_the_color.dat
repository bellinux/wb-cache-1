5|$|The word orange {{is both a}} noun and an {{adjective}} in the English language. In both cases, {{it refers}} primarily to the orange fruit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> orange, but has many other derivative meanings.|$|E
5|$|Channel Orange (stylized as channel ORANGE) is the 2012 debut studio album by American R {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Frank Ocean. After releasing his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra in 2011, Ocean began writing new songs with Malay, a producer and songwriter who assisted him with recording the album at EastWest Studios in Hollywood. Rather than rely on samples {{as he had}} with his mixtape, Ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on Channel Orange. He titled the album as {{a reference to the}} neurological phenomenon grapheme-color synesthesia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> he claimed to have perceived during the summer he first fell in love.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E

50|$|Parkway South High School {{opened in}} 1976, the bicentennial of the United States Declaration of Independence. For this reason, the school mascot is <b>the</b> patriot <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> are red, white, <b>and</b> blue. <b>The</b> school was {{supposed}} to be completed in 1974, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mascot would have been <b>the</b> rebel; <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> were going to be orange, blue, and black. However, construction was delayed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> mascot were changed to a bicentennial theme.|$|R
5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring {{was done with the}} computerized CAPS process, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Berkeley and Curtis {{described}} the species Agaricus cyanophos from material also {{collected from the}} Bonin Islands. This material was found near the location that the original specimens of M.chlorophos were found, {{but a couple of}} weeks later. Japanese mycologists Seiya Ito and Sanshi Imai studied these collections in the late 1930s, and concluded that Agaricus cyanophos was the same species as M.chlorophos, despite differences in cap shape, gill attachment, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of emitted light. Desjardin and colleagues agreed with this determination after examining the type material of both taxa. M.chlorophos is classified in the section Exornatae of the genus Mycena. Other luminescent species in this section are M.discobasis and M.marginata. Some authors have considered M.illuminans to be synonymous with M.chlorophos due to their morphological similarity, but molecular analysis has shown that they are distinct species.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Greece, {{green and}} blue were {{sometimes}} considered the same color, and the same word sometimes described {{the color of the}} sea <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of trees. The philosopher Democritus described two different greens: cloron, or pale green, and prasinon, or leek green. Aristotle considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.|$|E

5|$|Other {{lavender}} to violet-colored corals include Clavulina amethystinoides, {{which is}} so multiply branched so as to appear toothed, and Clavulina amethystina, {{which can only be}} reliably distinguished by its two-spored basidia in comparison to the four-spored basidia of Clavaria species. In Alloclavaria purpurea, the branching is reduced <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> usually a duller purple. The Australian coral Clavaria versatilis is also similar in appearance to Clavaria zollinger, but has branch tips that end in two short and blunt processes that are the same color {{as the rest of the}} fruit body. Ramariopsis pulchella—a small, violet-colored coral fungus rarely taller than —could be mistaken for a small C.zollingeri. It has roughly spherical spores measuring 3.0–4.5 by 2.5–3.5μm.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} synthetic diamonds can be performed, {{depending on the}} method of production <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's Diamond Spotter. Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The merle Pomeranian is {{a recent}} color {{developed}} by breeders. It {{is a combination of}} a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colors for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colors. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of silk originates in China in the Neolithic (Yangshao culture, 4th millennium BCE). Silk remained confined to China until the Silk Road opened {{at some point}} during the later half of the first millennium BCE. China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years. Not confined to clothing, silk was also used for a number of other applications, including writing, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of silk worn was an important guide of social class during the Tang Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song.

And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video.

5|$|Mushishi {{opens with}} Yoki {{and his mother}} walking along a {{mountain}} when a cliff suddenly collapses. This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)—an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember.|$|E

5|$|The American Cream is {{the only}} breed of draft horse {{developed}} in the United States that is still in existence today. The breed descends from a foundation mare named Old Granny. She was probably foaled between 1900 and 1905, and was first noticed at an auction in Story County, Iowa, in 1911 and purchased by Harry Lakin, a well known stock dealer. She was eventually sold to Nelson Brothers Farm in Jewell, Iowa. Her breeding is not known, but she was cream-colored and many of her foals were as well; they sold for above-average prices because of their color. Her cream-colored coat, pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for the breed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> {{is now known as}} gold champagne. In 1946, two years after the breed registry was formed, 98 percent of the horses registered could be traced back to Old Granny.|$|E
