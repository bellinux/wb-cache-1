Metropolitan <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> cover a larger area, such as a city or state. Wide <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> provide communication in a broad geographic area covering national and international locations. Personal <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (PANs) are wireless LANs with a very short range (up to a few meters), enabling computer devices (such as PDAs and printers) to communicate with other nearby devices and computers.|$|R

5|$|On 11 September 1940, George Stibitz {{transmitted}} {{problems for}} his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a teletype, {{and received the}} computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This configuration of a centralized computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate packet switching, a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting {{the beginnings of the}} ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of Request for Comment documents, other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the local <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (LAN) developments of Ethernet (1983) and the token ring protocol (1984).|$|E
