Using data {{on the content of}} political advertising, local television news coverage and local newspaper coverage in nine races in five Midwestern states in 2006, we discover that perceptions of ad tone respond to both exposure to advertising and exposure to local news media. Both positive and negative <b>advertising</b> <b>drive</b> tone perceptions, and the impact of ad coverage depends not on its volume or mentions of tone, but on whether that coverage is framed strategically or not...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} welfare {{effect of a}} {{quantity}} restriction on advertising in free-to-air television (and other advertising financed media) {{in the presence of}} commercial media bias. Broadcasters face a trade-off between increasing the number of viewers by sending content that is highly valued by viewers, and increasing the price of advertising by choosing advertiser friendly content. A cap on <b>advertising</b> <b>drives</b> the per-viewer price of ads up; thus, content improves for viewers. Therefore, the cap can be welfare enhancing, even when viewers are not ad averse. Competition among broadcasters makes it more likely that a cap on advertising improves welfare. Thus, there is a complementarity between regulation and competition on this market. We also show that a tax on advertising revenues has quite different effects than a cap on advertising quantity...|$|R

Having in mind the latest <b>advertising</b> <b>drive</b> of “Coca-Cola ” one can say that, so far, they have been engaged in the sale of “Coca-Cola”, and now sell Coca Cola "side of life. " The work compares two terms mark and brand, and provides the most common meanings of these terms, starting from the differences in the concepts of trade mark and brand. The universal anglicanization not only in the language of marketing, but also in other languages, the term brand is more and more being used synonymously to the term mark, which we can not agree with. Customers and consumers create a special relationship to the mark. There are different models of the evolution of the concept of branding. Corporate brand as a concept implies a coordinated portfolio of marks. The practice of marketing is based on product quality, development of trademarks and a creation of a brand. Contemporary practice of marketing starts with the creation of brands which are given characteristics of trademarks and products. Brand, in general, expresses a mission and values that the company nurtures, and must be incorporated in the vision of the company. Starting point for building a brand is a belief that must realistically indicate the value related to the client. This belief is particularly important in the process of communicating the brand, both with external and with internal factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{world of}} {{telecommunication}} and Internet services are constantly subject to change, never stopping {{to create new}} wants and desires in customer with new products and services. In this aspect, the growing emergence of the wired Internet and mobile telecommunication technology and platforms creates a new opportunity for advertisers via mobile advertising to generate new revenue streams through mobile users. In today’s environment, advancement in technology also allow consumers to have more control {{of what they want}} to see, interact with, or purchase. Hence, brand advertisers and advertising agencies are recognizing this and they are expected to be more creative and innovative in the way they advertise {{to meet the challenges of}} this new environment. Therefore, the advertising industry has to move towards trends in creativity, personalization, interactivity, new media channels, consumer control and connectivity. As such, the attempts to use the wireless network as a new advertising media are rapidly gaining more importance. Coupled with a growing consumer adoption of mobile technology, it is a matter of time when mobile advertising becomes an important part of the marketing mix strategies. Meanwhile, the Malaysian telecommunication industry is very fast in adopting new technologies and rolling out new services to its customers. There are ample opportunities in the changing traditional and new media platforms in the Malaysian advertising market. The key to the development of mobile advertising is dependant on identifying factors that will enable consumer acceptance and use of it. There are limited studies on mobile marketing, especially in the field of mobile advertising. This paper provides a broad overview of the mobile advertising landscape—from the role of the advertisers to the consumer receiving the mobile ad - as a foundation for future studies to be conducted. The literature review section of this paper will discuss the entire mobile advertising ecosystem, to provide the reader with a comprehensive understanding of the various factors involved in mobile advertising. The research will then focus on the factors of mobile advertising, specifically on (1) factors that drive a successful mobile advertising strategy (2) the importance of these factors in Malaysia and 3) will mobile <b>advertising</b> <b>drive</b> product trial in Malaysia? This research paper will not study all the factors discussed in the literature review due to limitation in terms of time and resources. However, the three factors that are being tested will provide a good foundation for future study on the other factors. The data collected from the survey were analyzed using a statistical software application, ie SPSS to measure the reliability, factor analysis and regression analysis of the data set. The survey results will reveal the result of the research on these three questions and hypothesis testing will also reveal which factor is important in the conceptual framework for a successful mobile advertising in Malaysia. Findings revealed that message customization is essential in driving a successful mobile advertising in Malaysia. The other two factors tested were relevant content and credibility, which has less significance in driving successful mobile advertising...|$|E

40|$|Since its {{launch in}} early 2005, video sharing website YouTube {{has emerged as}} a culturally, {{politically}} and economically significant medium and as one of the inheritors of the social role played by broadcast television. However its continued growth and journey to profitability is not guaranteed. This paper queries the future of YouTube by exploring the tension inherent in the site’s 3 key characteristics embodied within its slogan Broadcast Yourself ™. The site is based within regimes of consumer production and identity practices, yet it is also located within a traditional fiscal economy as indicated by the trademark identifier. The contradictory pulls of these positions pose challenges for YouTube and its parent company Google. The difficulty of sustaining an emergent social economy alongside the requirements of <b>advertising</b> <b>driven</b> economics raises questions about the future of YouTube and indicates the complex terrain of what lies beyond broadcasting...|$|R
40|$|With {{political}} campaigns becoming increasingly adversarial, scholars have recently given some much-needed {{attention to the}} impact of negative advertising on turnout. In a widely recognized Review article and subsequent book, Ansolabehere and his colleagues (1994, 1995) contend that attack <b>advertising</b> <b>drives</b> potential voters away from the polls. We dispute the generalizability of these claims outside of the experimental setting. Using NES survey data as well aggregate sources, we subject this previous research to rigorous real-world testing. The survey data directly contradict Ansolabehere et al. 's findings, yielding evidence of a turnout advantage for those recollecting negative presidential campaign advertising. In attempting to replicate Ansolabehere et al’s earlier aggregate results we uncover quite significant discrepancies and inconsistencies in their dataset. This analysis leads to the conclusion that their aggregate study is hopelessly flawed. We must conclude that attack advertising’s demobilization dangers are greatly exaggerated by Ansolabehere et al., while they completely miss negative political advertising’s turnout benefits [...] at least in voters’ own context...|$|R

40|$|Online <b>advertising</b> <b>drives</b> {{the economy}} of the World Wide Web. Modern {{websites}} of any size and popularity include advertisements to monetize visits from their users. To this end, they assign an area of their web page to an advertising company (so called ad exchange) that will use it to display promotional content. By doing this, the website owner im-plicitly trusts that the advertising company will offer legiti-mate content and it will not put the site’s visitors at risk of falling victims of malware campaigns and other scams. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale study of the safety of the advertisements that are encountered by the users on the Web. In particular, we analyze to what extent users are exposed to malicious content through ad-vertisements, and investigate what are the sources of this malicious content. Additionally, we show that some ad ex-changes are more prone to serving malicious advertisements than others, probably due to their deficient filtering mech-anisms. The observations that we make in this paper shed light on a little studied, yet important, aspect of advertise-ment networks, and can help both advertisement networks and website owners in securing their web pages and in keep-ing their visitors safe...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} luster {{of optimism}} about {{the internet and the}} world wide web has begun to fade both as the technology has matured and as financial concerns about a web site's bottom line have begun to play an increasing role in the content of a web site. The internet has embarked on a transition from its origin as a conduit for global information exchange into an <b>advertising</b> <b>driven</b> commercial marketplace. In earlier studies of political speeches and news media articles about technology policy (Rohrer 1997), I analysed the metaphors of the internet and argued that much of the political rhetoric concerning the internet was conceptualized as an elaborate conduit metaphor where the internet is conceived as the flow of goods that can travel to the user (the cyberspace conceptual metaphor) or by using a spatialization of time metaphor in which the internet is conceived as a transformative social program that will bring about a better future by creating jobs, stimulating the economy, etc. (U. S. Vicepresident Al Gore's cyberfuture metaphor). I also investigated several other alternatives for characterizing the internet and world wide web, but concluded tha...|$|R

40|$|The {{relation}} between sales and advertising is both complex and diverse. Whether <b>advertising</b> activities <b>drive</b> or follow sales is still unclear.

Findings reveal that advertising expenditures do not increase total sales of industries according to the distribution hypothesis. According to the deterministic view, advertising budgeting is often influenced by previous sales and partly by future sales expectations.
