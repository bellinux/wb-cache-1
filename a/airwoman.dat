50|$|Initially, {{recruiting}} {{was limited}} to officers and NCOs only, recruiting for the original RAF companies being undertaken by the AAF. However, {{with the coming of}} the Second World War, <b>airwomen</b> were to join the ranks and, by mid 1943, there were 182,000 women serving in the WAAF, in all the RAF trade groups. In common with the AAF, the women‚Äôs force became less `auxiliary‚Äô as the war went on but on the outbreak of war, the WAAF consisted of 234 officers and 1500 <b>airwomen,</b> all of whom could be considered pre-war volunteers in the true auxiliary mould.|$|R
40|$|Interviews {{with former}} <b>airwomen</b> {{demonstrate}} that {{the great majority of}} them did not make a permanent career in the Service. The interviews also showed that women were not leaving for work reasons, but for social reasons, including marriage and children. In addition, many <b>airwomen</b> were engaging in behaviour that did not necessarily conform to the RCAF's ideal. <b>Airwomen</b> made lifestyle choices that included dating officers, consuming alcohol, engaging in extra-marital sex, and as well pursuing homosexual relationships. The RCAF attempted to control the women's behaviour through courses, lectures and recreational activities, in order to encourage traditional and "feminine" behaviour among women. Women either did not join the Air Force or left it because their choices in their lives outside of work were incompatible with the ideal that the RCAF wanted the women to portray. In conclusion, women's priorities in their lives are different from that of men, and their work patterns are often determined by their lifecycle and the choices they make in their personal lives.
