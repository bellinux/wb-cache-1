5|$|There {{was also}} <b>a</b> <b>misconception</b> about the intoxicating effects of hemp {{because it has}} the same active substance, THC, which is in all {{cannabis}} strains. Hemp normally has a minimal amount of THC when compared to recreational cannabis strains but, in the 1930s, THC was not yet fully identified. The methods FBN used for predicting the psychoactive effect of different samples of cannabis and hemp therefore gave confusing results.|$|E
5|$|Doppler {{redshift}} vs cosmological red-shift: Astronomersoften {{refer to}} the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,which is <b>a</b> <b>misconception.</b> Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.|$|E
5|$|Murali {{works hard}} to save Venu {{so as not to}} create <b>a</b> <b>misconception</b> that he killed Venu to be with Seetha. With great difficulty, Murali manages to {{successfully}} cure Venu's cancer. However, when Murali reads the results of the operation, he becomes so overjoyed at its success that he unexpectedly dies of high blood pressure due to his over-excitement. Venu and Seetha realize that Murali had sacrificed his life for their happiness and remains in their hearts.|$|E

40|$|Misconceptions that {{students}} {{bring with them}} to the introductory science classroom plague every area of science and are especially prevalent in astronomy. One way to identify and possibly dispel some of these misconceptions is through the use of <b>a</b> <b>misconceptions</b> survey. The following is a report on the development, implementation, and some early results of the use of <b>an</b> Astronomical <b>Misconceptions</b> Survey. The survey was developed on the basis of previous research on common misconceptions in astronomy and used in sections of introductory college astronomy to identify which misconceptions were more and less prevalent among students and how effectively some of the misconceptions could be dispelled by various teaching methods...|$|R
5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained and poorly supplied, illustrated <b>a</b> <b>misconception</b> of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans to defend themselves and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved especially true in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.|$|E
5|$|Wilde died of {{meningitis}} on 30 November 1900. Different {{opinions are}} given {{as to the}} cause of the disease: Richard Ellmann claimed it was syphilitic; however, Merlin Holland, Wilde's grandson, thought this to be <b>a</b> <b>misconception,</b> noting that Wilde's meningitis followed a surgical intervention, perhaps a mastoidectomy; Wilde's physicians, Dr Paul Cleiss and A'Court Tucker, reported that the condition stemmed from an old suppuration of the right ear (from the prison injury, see above) treated for several years (une ancienne suppuration de l'oreille droite d'ailleurs en traitement depuis plusieurs années) and made no allusion to syphilis.|$|E
5|$|The third {{variation}} {{added by}} Petipa was also composed by Drigo and has survived {{as one of}} the most beloved passages of Giselle. This variation, sometimes dubbed as the Pas seul, was arranged in 1887 for the ballerina Elena Cornalba. The variation was also danced by Cornalba's successors in the role of Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre. Cornalba's variation was first performed outside of Russia by Olga Spessivtzeva in 1924 at the Paris Opéra, and from then on all productions staged outside of Russia included the variation. There was much confusion at that time as to who was responsible for composing the music, leading many ballet historians and musicologists to credit Ludwig Minkus as the author, <b>a</b> <b>misconception</b> which still persists.|$|E

5|$|While the koala was {{previously}} classified as Least Concern on the Red List, it was uplisted to Vulnerable in 2016. Australian policy makers declined a 2009 proposal {{to include the}} koala in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In 2012, the Australian government listed koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable, because of a 40% population decline in the former and a 33% decline in the latter. Populations in Victoria and South Australia appear to be abundant; however, the Australian Koala Foundation argues that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures is based on <b>a</b> <b>misconception</b> that the total koala population is 200,000, whereas they believe it is probably less than 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Many viruses can be {{synthesised}} de novo ("from scratch") and {{the first}} synthetic virus was created in 2002. Although somewhat of <b>a</b> <b>misconception,</b> {{it is not the}} actual virus that is synthesised, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a DNA virus), or a cDNA copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesise viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. , the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
