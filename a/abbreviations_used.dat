500|$|Before Crisis {{was created}} {{as part of}} the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, a {{multimedia}} series based in and on the world and characters of VII. While the film [...] was originally to be the only product of the Compilation, the production team agreed that one title was not enough to explore the world of Final Fantasy VII in full, so more titles were decided upon, including [...] and Crisis Core. Before Crisis was originally conceived by Tetsuya Nomura, one of the creative minds behind Final Fantasy VII and the Compilation. His initial idea was simply for a mobile action role-playing game using the mobile network. During pre-production, it was decided to set it within the world of Final Fantasy VII. Hajime Tabata joined at this point. He approached Tabata, who had only recently joined the company's mobile games division, and asked if the division could create a mobile game focused on the Turks. Nomura would end up designing the game's characters. Production began in 2002. It was worked on by a core team of 18 people. Staff from the original game took supervisory roles. The game's title was thought up by Tabata, and would go on to establish a system of letter-based <b>abbreviations</b> <b>used</b> by staff for titles in the Compilation. To help solidify their goal, the staff created a timeline for the world of Final Fantasy VII. Since there was little definite information concerning events prior to Final Fantasy VII, they had a relative amount of creative freedom, including creating an early, more violent incarnation of rebel group AVALANCHE. Although Before Crisis is the second title created for the series, it was the first to be released because Advent Children was delayed during post-production.|$|E

2500|$|Various fairly {{standardized}} {{abbreviations for}} vaccine names have developed, although the standardization {{is by no}} means centralized or global. For example, the vaccine names used in the United States have well-established abbreviations that are also widely known and used elsewhere. An extensive list of them provided in a sortable table and freely accessible, is available at a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web page. The page explains that [...] "The abbreviations [...] this table (Column 3) were standardized jointly by staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ACIP Work Groups, the editor of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the editor of Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (the Pink Book), ACIP members, and liaison organizations to the ACIP." [...] Some examples are [...] "DTaP" [...] for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, [...] "DT" [...] for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and [...] "Td" [...] for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. At its page on tetanus vaccination, the CDC further explains that [...] "Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case 'd' and 'p' denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism." [...] Another list of established vaccine abbreviations is at the CDC's page called [...] "Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations", with <b>abbreviations</b> <b>used</b> on U.S. immunization records. The United States Adopted Name system has some conventions for the word order of vaccine names, placing head nouns first and adjectives postpositively. This is why the USAN for [...] "OPV" [...] is [...] "poliovirus vaccine live oral" [...] rather than [...] "oral poliovirus vaccine".|$|E
