40|$|Abstract. —Because {{of their}} {{potential}} to reach large size, <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> Salvelinus namaycush are managed as trophy fish in many reservoirs in the western United States. In Colorado, restrictive harvest regulations for <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> were enacted in reservoirs exhibiting a range of productivities. Annual stockings of kokanee (lacustrine sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka) and rainbow trout O. mykiss sustained sport fisheries, but stocked fish also dominated the prey fish assemblages in these systems. Hydroacoustic surveys suggested that <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> management allowed an imbalance to develop between prey fish biomass and the biomass of piscivorous <b>lake</b> <b>trout.</b> Piscivorous fish biomass was, on average, 60 % of total pelagic fish biomass. Bioenergetics modeling confirmed the imbalance: annual <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> consumption was near or exceeded annual pelagic prey fish supply (standing stock plus production); the degree of imbalance was greater in less productive reservoirs. Annual subsidies to the food web, {{in the form of}} stocked sport fish, were necessary to allow the imbalance between predator and prey populations to persist, especially in the least-productive systems. Though highly sensitive to the size at which hatchery fish are consumed, the per capita costs to sustain <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> growth at observed levels would total about US$ 200 per <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> in the more productive reservoirs and $ 300 – 600 per <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> in the less productive reservoirs.

Trout including brook <b>trout,</b> brown <b>trout,</b> <b>lake</b> <b>trout,</b> rainbow trout and splake are also found. Limited stocking of walleye, brown <b>trout</b> and <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> is done on some lakes.|$|R

The exact mechanism for the decline is unknown, but one hypothesis is related to competitive exclusion for prey resources. We had the rare opportunity to study the diets of bull <b>trout</b> and nonnative <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> in Swan <b>Lake,</b> Montana during a concomitant study. The presence of nonnative <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> in Swan <b>Lake</b> is relatively recent and the population is experiencing rapid population growth. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the diets of bull <b>trout</b> and <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> during the early expansion of this nonnative predator. Diets were sampled from 142 bull <b>trout</b> and 327 <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> during the autumn in 2007 and 2008. Bull <b>trout</b> and <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> had similar diets, both consumed Mysis diluviana as the primary invertebrate, especially at juvenile stages, and kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka as the primary vertebrate prey, as adults. A diet shift from primarily M. diluviana to fish occurred at similar lengths for both species, 506 mm (476 – 545 mm, 95 % CI) for bull trout and 495 mm (470 – 518 mm CI) for <b>lake</b> <b>trout.</b> These data indicate high diet overlap between these two morphologically similar top-level predators. Competitive exclusion may be a possible mechanism if the observe...|$|R
