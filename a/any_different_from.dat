The film's homosexuals are not, surprisingly, <b>any</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the film's equally lecherous heterosexuals. The film's pessimism is far outweighed by Fassbinder's indictment of Fox {{as an active}} participant in his own victimization, a familiar critique found in many of the director's films.|$|E

Bunning was also {{the only member of the}} United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to have opposed Ben Bernanke for Chief of the Federal Reserve. He said it was because he had doubts that Bernanke would be <b>any</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Alan Greenspan.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{a complex}} set of reasons, {{conditions}} in Western Europe began to improve after 700. In that year, the two major powers in western Europe were the Franks in Gaul and the Lombards in Italy. The Lombards had been thoroughly Romanized, and their kingdom was stable and well developed. The Franks, in contrast, were barely <b>any</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> their barbarian Germanic ancestors. Their kingdom was weak, hopelessly divided, and ruled by a king who was barely distinguishable from a peasant. Impossible to guess at the time, {{but by the end of}} the century, the Lombardic kingdom would be extinct, while the Frankish kingdom would have nearly reassembled the Western Roman Empire.|$|E

500|$|Kathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy {{explains}} to Kathy {{that he has}} been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them {{that there is no such}} thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the [...] "all but human" [...] clones even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy breaks down in an explosion of rage and frustration, and he and Kathy cling to each other in grief. The film ends with Tommy dying on the operating table. Kathy is left alone, waiting for her donations which will begin in a month.

A Scare at Bedtime, first aired in 1997, is close to being the polar opposite of this, with extremely adult content, lewd jokes and slightly obscene anecdotes being related by the two puppets. Their origins on the Den are largely ignored, as the backstory gradually established on A Scare at Bedtime, presents them to be both in their fifties (although they don't look <b>any</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> how they used to), and residing in Ballydung Manor, the former Ballydung Asylum. Rumour has it that their parents left them in the asylum many years ago, and in revenge, Rodge took an axe to them both. But no bodies were ever found. They live with a lunatic nurse that they call [...] "Granny" [...] who practices the black arts (since she is dating Satan, whom they refer to as the [...] "quare fella" [...] throughout the series) and Pox the cat who suffers from rabies, the pox, and extreme violence at the hands of its two owners.

2500|$|The {{new head}} office was commended at the time. It {{featured}} in the 7 September 1967 edition of The Queensland Master Builder, which detailed the building's construction techniques and highlighted its modern technology. According to the MRD's magazine Queensland Roads, there were hopes [...] "that the construction of this building with its landscaped gardens and surroundings in the old Spring Hill area of Brisbane, [...] provide an incentive for other businesses and developers to {{follow the example of}} the Main Roads Department". Commissioner Barton viewed the MRD as [...] "a giant consulting engineers and construction organisation", and stated [...] "why should a department like Main Roads be <b>any</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> private business ... e hope that when our officers are dealing with people they will get the idea that we are here to do business just as efficiently and effectively as anybody else in the community". The Courier-Mail added that [...] "the building design, layout of office space and staff facilities, gives the Main Roads Department an air of big business, not the traditional Government department organisation", while the Mines and Main Roads Minister, Ronald Ernest Camm, claimed that the new building [...] "would {{be one of the most}} effective ways of organising Main Roads personnel and facilities for a bolder attack on the problems of the future".|$|E
2500|$|Justice White {{also makes}} mention of how {{important}} the O'Brien Test was in deciding this case. The O’Brien Test being a tool of the court established in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968) that determines whether governmental regulation involving symbolic speech can be justified. The restrictions of time, place, and manner can be allowed if they are (a) narrowly tailored (b) serve a substantial governmental interest and (c) there are alternative channels to communicate the information."Contrary to {{the conclusion of the}} Court of Appeals, the foregoing analysis demonstrates that the Park Service regulation is sustainable under the four-factor standard of United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), for validating a regulation of expressive conduct, which, in the last analysis is little, if <b>any,</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the standard applied to time, place, or manner restrictions. Justice White also makes clear that {{in the view of the}} majority the act of sleeping holds little value in being considered an act of expression. [...] "In the first place, we seriously doubt that the First Amendment requires the Park Service to permit a demonstration in Lafayette Park and the Mall involving a 24-hour vigil and the erection of tents to accommodate 150 people. Furthermore, although we have assumed for present purposes that the sleeping banned in this case would have an expressive element, it is evident that its major value to this demonstration would be facilitative" ...|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1990s, the opera, and {{productions}} of it, have sometimes drawn {{criticism from the}} Asian-American community as promoting [...] "simplistic orientalist stereotypes". In 2014, after a production in Seattle, Washington, drew national attention to such criticism, the Gilbert biographer Andrew Crowther wrote that The Mikado [...] "does not portray any of the characters as being [...] "racially inferior" [...] or indeed fundamentally <b>any</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> British people. The point of the opera is to reflect British culture {{through the lens of}} an invented [...] "other", a fantasy Japan that has only the most superficial resemblance to reality." [...] For example, the starting point for the plot of The Mikado is [...] "an invented 'Japanese' law against flirting, which makes sense only as a reference to the sexual prudishness of British culture". However, Crowther noted, production design and other features of traditionally staged {{productions of}} the opera, often [...] "do look somewhat insensitive, not to say insulting. ... It should [...] to avoid such things in the future, with a little sensitivity. ... G is about silliness, and fun, and ... mocking the powerful, and accepting the fundamental absurdity of life". Some commentators dismissed the criticism as political correctness. A public discussion of the issue in Seattle a month later, however, drew a large crowd where nearly all agreed that, although works like The Mikado should not be abandoned in their traditional form, there should be [...] "some kind of contextualizing apparatus to show that the producers and performers are at least thinking about the problems in the work". In 2015, a planned production by the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players was withdrawn after its publicity materials ignited a similar protest in the Asian-American blogosphere. The company redesigned its Mikado production and debuted the new concept in December 2016, receiving a warm review from The New York Times. After Lamplighters Music Theatre of San Francisco planned a 2016 production, objections by the Asian-American community prompted them to re-set the opera in Renaissance-era Milan, eliminating all references to Japan. Reviewers felt that the change resolved the issue.|$|E
