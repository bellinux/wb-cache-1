40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} external respiratory system is presented which integrates component models of airway mechanics and gas exchange at the pulmonary capillaries. The respiratory system is lumped into: (1) a conducting zone consisting of a rigid compartment in series with a collapsible segment, and (2) a respiratory zone consisting of respiratory bronchioles and alveolar sacs. Ventilation of the alveolar space is simulated by driving the airway mechanics model with a measured intrapleural pressure waveform obtained experimentally from a volunteer human subject in a clinical Pulmonary Function Laboratory (PFL). Capillary gas transfer is described using a one-dimensional spatially distributed model with transport of gas species between air in the alveoli and blood in the pulmonary capillaries driven by the species partial pressure gradient across the alveolar-capillary barrier. The effects of cyclic fluctuation of airflow upon the gas composition in the partitioned airway compartments, as well as within the pulmonary capillary, are simulated under conditions of tidal breathing, panting, and forced-vital capacity maneuvers. Simulation results compare favorably with experimental data on lung volume variation, air flow at the mouth, and expired PCO 2 obtained during these maneuvers. Model-generated predictions for <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pressure,</b> variation of gas composition in each airway compartment during breathing and species partial pressure profiles along the pulmonary capillary are calculated and compared with data obtained from a normal subject...|$|E
40|$|Many {{environmental}} factors may affect muscle plasticity but some have exclusive characteristics {{that allow them}} to play a key role to maintain the muscle capacity to generate force; these factors are: i) the oxygen availability and ii) the load applied to muscle fibres. Hyperbarism is a condition that occurs when a man is subjected to pressure increases. To keep the lungs from collapsing, the air is supplied to him under high pressure which exposes the blood in the lungs to high <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pressures.</b> Under this condition, the PO 2 become sufficiently increased, serious disorders may occur, such as modification of oxygen delivery and/or oxygen availability to permit regular muscle contraction. Also altitude hypobaric hypoxia induces modification of muscle capacity to generate work. Prolonged exposure to high altitude leads significant loss in body mass, thigh muscle mass, muscle fiber area and volume density of muscle mitochondria. Spaceflight results in a number of adaptations to skeletal muscle, including atrophy and early muscle fatigue. Muscle atrophy is observed {{in a wide range of}} muscles, with the most extensive loss occurring in the legs, because astronauts are no longer needed to support the body's weight. This review will describe the background on these topics suggesting the strategies to correct the specific muscle changes in presence of environmental stresses, such as the alteration in oxygen-derived signaling pathways or the metabolic consequence of microgravity that may indicate rational interventions to maintain muscle mass and function...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{our group}} has {{developed}} a comprehensive cardiopulmonary (CP) model that comprises the heart, systemic and pulmonary circulations, lung mechanics and gas exchange, tissue metabolism, and cardiovascular and respiratory control mechanisms. In this paper, we analyze {{the response of the}} model to hypercapnic conditions and hence focus on the chemoreflex control mechanism. Particularly, we have enhanced the peripheral chemoreceptor model in order to better reflect respiratory control physiology. Using the CO 2 fraction in the inspired air as input to the CP model, we were able to analyze the transient response of the system to CO 2 step input at different levels, in terms of <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> partial <b>pressures,</b> tidal volume, minute ventilation and respiratory frequency. Model predictions were tested against experimental data from human subjects. Results show good agreement for all the variables under study during the transient phases and low root mean square errors at steady state.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the equations governing the transport of oxygen in pulmonary capillaries. We use a mathematical model consisting of a red blood cell completely surrounded by plasma within a cylindrical pulmonary capillary. This model takes account of convection and diffusion of oxygen through plasma, diffusion of oxygen through the red blood cell, and the reaction between oxygen and haemoglobin molecules. The velocity field within the plasma is calculated by solving the slow flow equations. We investigate {{the effect on the}} solution of the governing equations of: (i) mixed-venous blood oxygen partial pressure (the initial conditions); (ii) <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> oxygen partial <b>pressure</b> (the boundary conditions); (iii) neglecting the convection term; and (iv) assuming an instantaneous reaction between the oxygen and haemoglobin molecules. It is found that: (a) equilibrium is reached much more rapidly for high values of mixed-venous blood and <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> oxygen partial pressure; (b) the convection term has a negligible effect on the time taken to reach a prescribed degree of equilibrium; and (c) an instantaneous reaction may be assumed.

40|$|Equations {{have been}} derived to {{determine}} the <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> concentrations which occur when the Magill (Mapleson A) circuit is used with a low fresh <b>gas</b> flow. <b>Alveolar</b> oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations {{are determined by the}} fresh gas flow and composition, carbon dioxide output and oxygen uptake. Gas mixing within the circuit and alterations in the inspired gas concentrations do not affect the final equilibrium. If oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output are constant, the <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> concentrations are unaffected by alterations in ventilation. The economical behaviour of the Magill (Mapleson A) circuit during spontaneous ventilation is well recognized. Because of the relative positions of the components, <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> is vented selectively from the circuit when the expiratory valve opens {{in the latter part of}} expiration. Mapleson (1954) showed that if the fresh gas flow were equal to, or greater than, the subject's alveolar ventilation, no rebreathing of <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> would occur, all the <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> being vented from the system. The validity of this analysis has been supported in clinical studies (Kain and Nunn, 1968; Norman, Adams and Sykes, 1968). Mapleson (1958), analysing the behaviour of this circuit when the fresh gas flow did not exceed the alveolar ventilation, showed that the alveolar carbon dioxide concentration was a function of the fresh gas flow and the carbon dioxide output. He deduced the relationship: F A O O 2 = FCO 2 /FF A similar relationship was deduced by Nunn and Newman (1964). These authors, like Mapleson, emphasized that under low-flow conditions FAC 02 was not influenced by alterations in ventilation. The present analysis was stimulated by the results of a detailed study of gaseous homeostasis in the Magill circuit with low fresh gas flows (Conway et al., 1976). It was noted that, despite marked altera-tions of inspired gas concentrations and ventilation, when the fresh gas flow did not exceed the predicted alveolar ventilation, there were only slight changes in the end-tidal oxygen concentrations.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and timing of}} oxygenation responses in highly active leg muscle, less active arm muscle, and cerebral tissue, have not been studied with simultaneous <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> exchange measurement during incremental treadmill exercise. Nor is it known, if blood O 2 carrying capacity affects the tissue-specific oxygenation responses. Thus, we investigated <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> exchange and tissue (m. vastus lateralis, m. biceps brachii, cerebral cortex) oxygenation during incremental treadmill exercise until volitional fatigue, and their associations with blood O 2 carrying capacity in 22 healthy men. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> exchange was measured, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to monitor relative concentration changes in oxy- (Δ[O 2 Hb]), deoxy- (Δ[HHb]) and total hemoglobin (Δ[tHb]), and tissue saturation index (TSI). NIRS inflection points (NIP), reflecting changes in tissue-specific oxygenation, were determined and their coincidence with ventilatory thresholds (anaerobic threshold (AT), respiratory compensation point (RC); V-slope method) was examined. Blood O 2 carrying capacity (total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass)) was determined with the CO-rebreathing method. In all tissues, NIPs coincided with AT, whereas RC was followed by NIPs. High tHb-mass associated with leg muscle deoxygenation at peak exercise (e. g., Δ[HHb] from baseline walking to peak exercise vs. tHb-mass: r = 0. 64, p < 0. 01), but not with arm muscle- or cerebral deoxygenation. In conclusion, regional tissue oxygenation was characterized by inflection points, and tissue oxygenation in relation to <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> exchange during incremental treadmill exercise resembled previous findings made during incremental cycling. It was also found out, that O 2 delivery to less active m. biceps brachii may be limited by an accelerated increase in ventilation at high running intensities. In addition, high capacity for blood O 2 carrying {{was associated with a}} high level of m. vastus lateralis deoxygenation at peak exercise...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} algorithms for estimating O 2 and CO 2 transfer at the pulmonary capillaries by use of a nine-compartment tidally ventilated lung model that incorporated inhomogeneities in ventilation-to-volume and ventilation-to-perfusion ratios. Breath-to-breath O 2 and CO 2 exchange at the capillary level and at the mouth were simulated by using realistic cyclical breathing patterns to drive the model, derived from 40 -min recordings in six resting subjects. The SD of the breath-by-breath gas exchange at the mouth around the value at the pulmonary capillaries was 59. 7 +/- 25. 5 % for O 2 and 22. 3 +/- 10. 4 % for CO 2. Algorithms including corrections for changes in alveolar volume and for changes in <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> composition improved the estimates of pulmonary exchange, reducing the SD to 20. 8 +/- 10. 4 % for O 2 and 15. 2 +/- 5. 8 % for CO 2. The remaining imprecision of the estimates arose almost entirely from using end-tidal measurements to estimate the breath-to-breath changes in end-expiratory <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> concentration. The results led us to suggest an alternative method that does not use changes in end-tidal partial pressures as explicit estimates of the changes in <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> concentration.

40|$|In deep {{geological}} disposal for high-level radioactive waste, the generated gas can potentially affect the sealing ability of bentonite buffers. There is a competition between water and gas: the former provides sealing by swelling bentonite, {{and the latter}} attempts to desaturate the bentonite buffer.

Different <b>gas</b> <b>pressures</b> were applied to the top surface of an upper sample, whereas the water pressure on the bottom side of the lower sample was maintained at 4 [*]MPa.
