40|$|Alcohol, as an {{alternative}} fuel, has {{attracted the attention of}} many companies and researchers worldwide. In fact, several studies have looked into emission and performance characteristics of alcohol used in compression-ignition (CI) engines. Fusel oil is an <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>fuel</b> collected as a by-product from the fermentation of alcohol. Hence, this experimental study compared fusel oil–diesel blended fuel F 20 (20 % vol fusel oil and 80 % vol diesel) with pure diesel in a single cylinder four-stroke CI engine. The test was performed at two engine loads (50 % and 75 %) and five engine speeds (from 1200 _ 2400 rpm with intervals of 300 rpm). In fact, the main goal of the current study was to determine engine power, torque, indicated specific fuel consumptions, in-cylinder temperature, energy release rate, cumulative energy release, and emissions (carbon dioxide, CO 2; carbon monoxide, CO; and nitrogen oxide, NOx) with F 20, as well as in comparison with diesel. The results revealed that the engine power and the torque for F 20 slightly dropped compared to those with pure diesel. Moreover, the indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) was slightly increased, especially with 75 % load at high engine speeds and at around 8 % at an average, while the ignition delay for F 20 had been longer by 7 % at all engine speeds and loads compared to those with diesel. Furthermore, a reduction in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions was observed at all engine loads and speeds, while the highest reduction in NOx for F 20 was 28 % with 1500 rpm at both loads. In addition, it was found that both CO 2 and CO emissions increased. Nevertheless, high water content, low cetane number, and low heating value of fusel oil had been the reasons for the negative effect displayed upon the performance of the engine...|$|R

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{commissioned}} by Sustainable Energy Ireland {{in order to}} provide an overview of marine algae as an energy resource, from either macroalgae or microalgae. It is also required to assess the potential resource in Ireland, determine the level of activity and identify research and development knowledge gaps. A biofuels obligation scheme is being proposed in Ireland which will see a percentage of fossil-fuels for transport being displaced by biofuels, ultimately reaching 10 % (on an energy basis) by 2020. The achievement of this ambitious target is contingent on finding and commercialising new resources for transport fuel, as current feedstocks are not sufficient to meet the target. Microalgae are being widely researched as a fuel due to their high photosynthetic efficiency and their ability to produce lipids, a biodiesel feedstock. Macroalgae (or seaweeds) do not generally contain lipids and are being considered for the natural sugars and other carbohydrates they contain, which can be fermented to produce either biogas or <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>fuels.</b> A supply-chain analysis was carried out for both macroalgae and microalgae, technologies identified and research topics proposed to evaluate commercialisation potential of these resources for energy.

40|$|The future {{exploitation}} of global energy resources {{is currently being}} hotly debated by politicians and by sections {{of the scientific community}} but there is little guidance available in the engineering literature as to the full gamut of options or their viability with respect to fuelling the world's vehicles. In the automotive industry extensive research is being undertaken on the use of alternative fuels in internal combustion engines and on the development of alternative powerplants but often the long-term strategy and sustainability of the energy sources to produce these fuels is not clearly enunciated. The requirement to reduce CO₂ emissions in the face of accelerating global warming scenarios and the depletion of fossil-fuel resources has led to the widespread assumption that some form of "hydrogen economy" will prevail; this view is seldom justified or challenged. As oil and natural gas resources begin to deplete it is vital to consider how to exploit the remaining reserves more efficiently and how best to produce, distribute and utilize the fuel which may form the basis of the future energy economy. The paper discusses the origins of our dependency on fossil fuels and looks at issues related to the depletion of their resources and their effects on the global climate. Two possible long-term energy strategies are considered and the impact of these on the direction of future automotive fuels is considered. The issues involved with the provision of infrastructure for fuel distribution are assessed and the compatibility of this infrastructure with that required for fuelling future generation vehicles, including those powered by fuel-cells is discussed. The exploitation and limitations of biomass fuels are considered, in particular the use of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>fuels</b> in internal combustion engines and their compatibility with future trends in engine technology to improve fuel economy are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Significant {{changes in}} the global ecosystem, {{together}} with a potential shortfall in oil resources, have stimulated intense interest {{in the development of}} other sources of energy, and most particularly biofuels since these are basically considered to be less harmful to human health than petroleum-based fuels. However, information about the impact of biofuel-derived vehicle emissions on human health is limited and incomplete.   Aim of the study: To identify those biofuels that are less detrimental to human health on the basis of published results from toxicological and chemical studies of vehicle emission products.   Tasks of the study: To review systematically all conventional and alternative fuels used in internal combustion engines, to identify all known toxic emission products formed by such fuels, to review their toxic effects on human health, and to analyse the data collected in order to develop conclusions concerning the possible health benefits deriving from the use of alternative fuels.   Materials and methods: In order to fulfil the requirements of a complete, comprehensive and up-to-date review of the toxic effects of automotive exhaust, an extensive search of official scientific data sources has been performed. Relevant publications were retrieved from public domain databases with a toxicological focus such as Toxcenter and CAplus, {{as well as from the}} websites of the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Keywords employed in the literature search were: petrol, gasoline, diesel exhaust, emission, biofuel, biogas, biodiesel, bioethanol, bioalcohol, toxicity, methanol and ethanol. A total of 295 references were initially selected relating to the period 1962 to 2008, and 142 of these presented titles and abstracts that met the main inclusion criteria, i. e. describing toxicological and epidemiological studies in humans. In cases where eligible studies relating to the goals and tasks of the review were limited or not available, some in vitro or in vivo toxicological studies involving animal models were included.   Results: In comparison with petroleum diesel, the emissions derived from biodiesel contain less particulate matter, carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons and other toxic compounds including vapour-phase C 1 -C 12 hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones (up to C 8), selected semi-volatile and particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Whilst sulphur-containing compounds appear to be undetectable in biodiesel, nitrogen oxide and a soluble organic fraction comprising unregulated pollutants including the “aggregated toxics” (i. e., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, ethylbenzene, n-hexane, naphthalene, styrene, toluene and xylene) are present at elevated levels. Toxicological studies have shown that the mutagenicity of exhaust particles from biodiesel is normally lower than those obtained from petroleum diesel, however, rapeseed oil-derived biodiesel exhibits toxic effects that are 4 -fold greater than petroleum diesel. Such enhanced toxicity is probably caused by the presence of carbonyl compounds and unburnt fuel. The toxicity of highly volatile components of biofuel exhaust has not yet been evaluated accurately. A substantial portion of these compounds was apparently lost in the process of preparing the test samples used for the assays (during the evaporation). The overall recoveries of these compounds have not been evaluated and the accuracy of the sample preparation method has not been validated. Hence, it could be that the cytotoxic effect of biodiesel exhaust is higher than that reported. Moreover, compared with fossil diesel, fuel derived from rapeseed oil emits particulate matter with increased mutagenic effects. Epidemiological investigations of the effects of biofuels on humans are very sparse but have revealed dose-dependent respiratory symptoms following exposure to rapeseed oil biodiesel, although the observed differences between this fuel and petroleum diesel are not significant. Such data, however, give rise to serious concerns about the future usage of this plant material as a replacement for established diesel fuels. Combustion of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>fuels</b> leads to a reduced formation of photochemical smog in comparison with gasoline or diesel, however, the emission of aldehydes (officially classified as carcinogenic or potentially carcinogenic) is several times higher. The toxicity of the exhaust emissions of gasoline-fuelled engines is generally significantly greater than that of alcohol-burning engines. However, some harmful effects from ethanol blends might be expected, such as enhanced emissions of carcinogenic PAHs and increased ozone-related toxicity associated with the high level of aldehydes emitted. The use of ethanol–diesel fuel blends gives rise to increases in regulated exhaust emissions and, possibly, to greater emissions of aldehydes and unburnt hydrocarbons. The most promising fuels, in terms of reduced toxicity and genotoxicity of exhaust emissions, are methanol-containing blends. However, the emission from these fuels still contains formaldehyde, which is a carcinogen. The use of biogas can significantly reduce emissions of total PAHs and formaldehyde and, consequently, the risk of lung toxicity. On the other hand, the emissions of particulate matter by compressed natural gas, and the mutagenic potencies of the exhaust, are similar to those associated with gasoline and diesel fuels.   Conclusions: The use of biofuel is currently viewed very favourably and there are suggestions that the exhaust emissions from such fuel are less likely to present risks to human health in comparison with gasoline and diesel emissions. However, the expectation of a reduction in health effects based on the chemical composition of biodiesel exhaust is far from reality. Thus, although toxicological evidence relating to the effects of biofuels on humans is sparse, it is already apparent that emissions from the combustion of biofuel and blends thereof with petroleum-based fuels are toxic. In addition to the regulated toxic compounds, such as total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, biofuel emissions contain significant amounts of various other harmful substances that are not regulated, e. g. carbonyls (including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, 3 -butadiene, acrolein, etc.). Whilst biofuels may be potentially less damaging to human health than petroleum fuels, considerable harmful effects must still be expected. Substitution of conventional fuel by biofuel decreases the concentration of regulated toxic pollutants in vehicle exhaust, but increases the concentration of some unregulated toxic pollutants emitted from on-road engines. Generally, the toxicity of biofuels decreases in the order biodiesel>biogas>ethanol>=methanol. In this respect, methanol produced by the oxidation of biogas appears to represent an alternative fuel that exhibits the least potential for damage to human health, however, this alcohol represents a source of formaldehyde pollution and is carcinogenic.. ...|$|E
