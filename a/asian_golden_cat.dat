25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> {{is similar}} to the bay cat of Borneo in both {{appearance}} and behavior. Genetic studies revealed that the two species are closely related. The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> is found in Sumatra and Malaysia, which separated from Borneo only about 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. These observations led to the belief that the Borneo bay cat is an insular subspecies of the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat.</b> Genetic analysis has shown that the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> along with the bay cat and the marbled cat, diverged from the other felids about 9.4 million years ago, and that the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> and bay cat diverged as long as four million years ago, suggesting that the bay cat was a different species long before the isolation of Borneo. Because of the evident close relationship with the marbled cat, it has recently been suggested that all three species should be grouped in the genus Pardofelis.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, an <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> was {{recorded}} {{for the first}} time by a camera-trap in the hill forests of Karen State.|$|E
25|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> {{can climb}} trees when necessary. They hunt birds, hares, rodents, reptiles, and small {{ungulates}} such as muntjacs and young sambar deer. They {{are capable of}} bringing down prey much larger than themselves, such as domestic water buffalo calves. In the mountains of Sikkim <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> reportedly prey on ghoral.|$|R
2500|$|Captive <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> kill small prey {{with the}} nape bite typical of cats. They also pluck birds larger than pigeons before {{beginning}} to feed. Their vocalizations include hissing, spitting, meowing, purring, growling, and gurgling. Other {{methods of communication}} observed in captive <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> include scent marking, urine spraying, raking trees and logs with claws, and rubbing of the head against various objects [...] much like a domestic cat.|$|R
25|$|As of December 2008, {{there were}} 20 <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> in eight European zoos {{participating}} in the European Endangered Species Programme. The pair in the German Wuppertal Zoo successfully bred in 2007, and in July 2008, two siblings were born and mother-reared. In 2008, a female kitten was also born in the French Parc des Félins. The species is also kept in the Singapore Zoo. Apart from these, a few zoos in Southeast Asia and Australia also keep <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> {{was named}} in honor of the Dutch {{zoologist}} Coenraad Jacob Temminck, who first described the African golden cat in 1827.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> lives {{throughout}} Southeast Asia, {{ranging from}} Nepal, Bhutan, India and Bangladesh to Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, southern China, Malaysia and Sumatra. It prefers forest habitats interspersed with rocky areas and inhabits dry deciduous, subtropical evergreen and tropical rainforests.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> bears a great {{resemblance}} to the African golden cat, but {{it is unlikely that}} they are closely related because the forests of Africa and Asia have not been connected in over 20 million years. Their similarity is more likely an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
25|$|It also {{lives in}} more open terrain {{such as the}} grasslands of Assam's Manas National Park. In the eastern Himalayas, <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> were {{recorded}} in temperate and subalpine forest. It has also been recorded in the Khasi hills of Meghalaya and in Dampa Tiger Reserve.|$|R
50|$|The fauna of the {{sanctuary}} include Indian elephants, Indian rhinoceros, gaurs, Asian water buffaloes, barasingha, Indian tigers, Indian leopards, clouded leopards, <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats,</b> dholes, capped langurs, golden langurs, Assamese macaques, slow loris, hoolock gibbons, smooth-coated otters, sloth bears, barking deers, hog deers, black panthers, sambar deers and chitals.|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} park is home for {{other kinds of}} big, medium, and small cats, clouded leopard/macan dahan (Neofelis nebulosa), marbled cat/kucing batu (Pardofelis marmorata), leopard cat/kucing hutan (Prionailurus bengalensis), and <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> cat/kucing emas (Catopuma temminckii). The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> can be found everywhere in the {{national park}}, as they adapt well to various kinds of habitat, both forested and open spaces. One camera trap image gave a rare photo of a <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> mother moving a cub to another location with her mouth.|$|R
25|$|The {{population}} {{size of the}} <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> is unknown and difficult to estimate. It was regarded as abundant in many countries until the later part of the last century, when poaching shifted away from tigers and leopards to this species. In China, it {{is reported to be}} the next rarest cat apart from tigers and leopards.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> (Catopuma temminckii, syn. Pardofelis temminckii), {{also called}} the Asiatic golden cat and Temminck's cat, is a {{medium-sized}} wild cat of the northeastern Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2008, and is threatened by hunting pressure and habitat loss, since Southeast Asian forests are undergoing the world's fastest regional deforestation.|$|E
25|$|Asian golden {{cats are}} poached mainly for their fur. In Myanmar, 111 body parts {{from at least}} 110 {{individuals}} were observed in four markets surveyed between 1991 and 2006. Numbers were significantly greater than those of non-threatened species. Among the observed skins was a specimen with ocelot-like rosettes — a rare tristis form. Three of the surveyed markets are situated on international borders with China and Thailand and cater to international buyers, although the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> is completely protected under Myanmar's national legislation. Effective implementation and enforcement of CITES is considered inadequate.|$|E
50|$|The Asian circuit {{starts at}} the other end of the Katanga lion enclosure. The first felines on this path are the Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae), {{followed}} by the enclosure of the rusty-spotted cats. Further on is the rare Sri Lanka leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> (Catopuma temmincki), the Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis), the jungle cats (Felis chaus), and the fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus).|$|R
50|$|The {{sanctuary}} area {{is covered}} by various forest types, depending on altitude, including dry evergreen forests, hill evergreen forests, coniferous forests, deciduous dipterocarp forests, and meadows. It is the home {{to a number of}} endangered species of animals, such as long-tailed gorals (Naemorhedus caudatus), Sumatran serows (Capricornis sumatraensis), <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> (Catopuma temminckii), and big-headed turtles (Platysternon megacephalum). Deignan's babblers (Stachyridopsis rodolphei) and Huia melasma are endemic to this area.|$|R
25|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> inhabit some of {{the fastest}} {{developing}} countries in the world, where they are increasingly threatened by habitat destruction following deforestation, along with a declining ungulate prey base. Another serious threat is hunting for the illegal wildlife trade, which has the greatest potential to do maximum harm in minimal time. It has been reported killed in revenge for depredating livestock, including poultry but also larger animals such as sheep, goats and buffalo calves.|$|R
25|$|A female <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> at the Washington Park Zoo (now the Oregon Zoo) {{showed a}} {{dramatic}} increase in the frequency of scent marking during estrus. At the same time, she often rubbed her neck and head on inanimate objects. She also repeatedly approached the male in the cage, rubbed on him, and adopted a receptive posture (lordosis) in front of him. The male's rate of scent marking increased during this time, as did his frequency of approaching and following the female. The male's mounting behavior included a nape bite, but in contrast to other small felids, the bite was not sustained.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> {{is heavily}} built, with a typical cat-like appearance. It has a head-body length of , with a tail [...] long, and is [...] tall at the shoulder. The weight ranges from , {{which is about}} two or three times that of a {{domestic}} cat.|$|E
2500|$|In China, the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> {{is thought}} {{to be a kind of}} leopard and is known as [...] "rock cat" [...] or [...] "yellow leopard". Different color phases have {{different}} names; those with black fur are called [...] "inky leopards", and those with spotted coats are called [...] "sesame leopards".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> are {{territorial}} and solitary. Previous observations {{suggested that}} they are primarily nocturnal, but a field study on two radio-collared specimens revealed arrhythmic activity patterns dominated by crepuscular and diurnal activity peaks, with much less activity late at night. In the study, the male's territory was [...] in size and {{increased by more than}} 15% during the rainy season. The female's territory was [...] in size. Both cats traveled between only [...] to more than [...] in a day, and were more active in July than in March.|$|R
2500|$|Not much {{is known}} about the {{reproductive}} behavior of this rather elusive cat in the wild. Most of what is known has been learned from cats in captivity. Female <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> are sexually mature between 18 and 24 months, while males mature at 24 months. Females come into estrus every 39 days, at which time they leave markings and seek contact with the male by adopting receptive postures. During intercourse, the male will seize the skin of the neck of the female with his teeth. After a gestation period of 78 to 80 days, the female gives birth in a sheltered place to a litter of one to three kittens. The kittens weigh [...] at birth, but triple in size over the first eight weeks of life. They are born already possessing the adult coat pattern and open their eyes after six to twelve days. In captivity, they live for up to twenty years.|$|R
50|$|The African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> {{is listed}} in CITES Appendix II. Hunting African <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> is {{prohibited}} in Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone. In Gabon, Liberia and Togo, hunting regulations are in place.|$|R
2500|$|Since Hodgson's {{description}} in 1831 {{of a male}} individual in Nepal under the binomial Felis moormensis, the country {{is believed to be}} the westernmost part of the cat's range. However, no specimen has been recorded in the country, until in May 2009 a camera trap survey yielded the first photographic record of a melanistic <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> in Makalu Barun National Park at an altitude of [...]|$|E
2500|$|In {{some regions}} of Thailand, the <b>Asian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> is called Seua fai ( [...] ; [...] "fire tiger"). According to a {{regional}} legend, {{the burning of}} an Asian golden cat's fur drives tigers away. Eating the flesh {{is believed to have}} the same effect. The Karen people believe that simply carrying a single hair of the cat is sufficient. Many indigenous people believe the cat to be fierce, but in captivity it has been known to be docile and tranquil. In the south, it's called Kang kude (คางคูด). It's believed to be a fierce animal. It can hurt or eat the livestock of the villagers and can also hurt larger animals such as elephants.|$|E
