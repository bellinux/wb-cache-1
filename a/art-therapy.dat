40|$|AbstractWithout art imagining life as {{full and}} {{meaningful}} is impossible. <b>Art-therapy</b> {{is one of}} the new technologies in humanistic psychiatry. It mainly deals with a kind of treatment based on the use of artistic production. Art is creation, play, beauty, communication, and intuition. Artists express their emotional world through art, and the spectators or readers let this world pass through the realm of their sensuality. The true essence of art is in its perceptible and imaginary nature. Art can be pictured as the mirror of direct experience and feelings and sentiments of people. Images and symbols are considered the carriers of emotions and feelings. Through feelings, art deepens the inner world of a human being, inspires us and makes us humane, creates a personality’ within a person. Creating a personality, art can solve pedagogical and psychological problems of human being. Moreover, art is a psycho-therapeutic remedy for a soul, a means of psychological and psychic relief. The object behind art- therapy is the human mind, that is, the emotional world of a human being, a human soul. Art can purify the sensual world (catharsis), and correct its orientation. Through <b>art-therapy,</b> psychical and psychological disorders can be diagnosed and cured...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is the observation of autistic barriers presented in <b>art-therapy</b> with two {{patients who suffer from}} diverse somatization problems. This is a case study, in which psychoanalytical epistemology is theoretically supported by several modern theories of the primitive development of self and object relations, notably 'autistic barriers' by Frances Tustin (1990) and 'autistic-contiguous position' by Thomas Ogden (1989). In this research, it is proposed that fibromyalgia and self mutilation, in the cases studied, are primitive autistic defense mechanisms, like the ones described by Tustin. Ogden's theory, on the other hand, permits one to theoretically position the persistence of these autistic defense phenomena in people suffering from diverse somatization problems. Ogden introduces, within the post-kleinian theory, a first position, one of object relations, named "the autistic-contiguous" position as well as a conceptual dialectic of the functioning psyche. The autistic-contiguous position is conceived as the primitive and sensory background of the paranoid-schizoid position. This research will also attempt to describe and distinguish autistic-contiguous (Ogden) and paranoid-schizoid (Klein) positions. Two clinical cases will be presented, offering signs of the presence of autistic defensive mechanisms throughout the study.

40|$|For eight weeks, we ran an art-based {{program for}} social and {{emotional}} development in Grade 5 of primary school for children aged 11 - 12. We met {{once a week for}} 45 minutes and worked with 25 children on improving their skills in communication, cooperation, manifestation, and recognition of emotions and identity enforcement. Each skill was covered by two lessons, with the first and last lessons including a class climate evaluation using the CES (classrooom environment scale) (Moos & Tricket, 1987) and B- 3 (Braun, 2006) methods. Our goal was to improve the class climate by drawing attention to the feelings of children towards their class and classmates, to their ability to cooperate in the class setting and {{to communicate with each other}} without fear, shame, or aggression.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although {{previous}} studies suggested that psychiatric day hospital {{care is a}} valuable alternative to inpatient treatment, its effectiveness for elderly patients is disputed. Small number of cases, poor definition of the psychotherapeutic setting, and absence of systematic assessment at different time points may explain the observed discrepancies. We performed an assessment of a psychiatric day hospital treatment combining individual and group psychotherapy {{in a series of}} 122 elderly depressed outpatients. METHODS: The Geriatric Depression Scale, Short Form Survey, as well as a Therapeutic Community Assessment Scale and Group Evaluation Scale were repeated at admission, 3, 6, 12 months and discharge. The day hospital program was based on psychotherapeutic treatment combining individual and group settings. All patients presented with major depression or a depressive episode of bipolar disease. Variables included severity of depressive symptoms, quality of life, adhesion to therapeutic community treatment and progress in groups of psychotherapy, <b>art-therapy,</b> and psychomotricity. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction of depressive symptoms, and improvement in mental quality of life across all time points studied. Adhesion to therapeutic community increased from admission to discharge. This was also the case for the progress in group therapy for all three groups used, yet the evolution of this parameter at intermediate time points was highly variable. Neither demographic characteristics, nor pharmacological treatment or presence of stressful life events predicted the clinical improvement.

40|$|Background The {{majority}} {{of mental health}} problems are non-psychotic (e. g., depression, anxiety, and phobias). For some people, art therapy {{may be a more}} acceptable alternative form of psychological therapy than standard forms of treatment, such as talking therapies. This study was part of a health technology assessment commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research, UK and aimed to systematically appraise the clinical and cost-effective evidence for art therapy for people with non-psychotic mental health disorders. Methods Comprehensive literature searches for studies examining art therapy in populations with non-psychotic mental health disorders were performed in May 2013. A quantitative systematic review of clinical effectiveness and a systematic review of studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of group art therapy were conducted. Results Eleven randomised controlled trials were included (533 patients). Meta-analysis was not possible due to clinical heterogeneity and insufficient comparable data on outcome measures across studies. The control groups varied between studies but included: no treatment/wait-list, attention placebo controls and psychological therapy comparators. Art therapy was associated with significant positive changes relative to the control group in mental health symptoms in 7 of the 11 studies. A de novo model was constructed and populated with data identified from the clinical review. Scenario analyses were conducted allowing comparisons of group art therapy with wait-list control and group art therapy with group verbal therapy. Group <b>art-therapy</b> appeared cost-effective compared with wait-list control with high certainty although generalisability to the target population was unclear; group verbal therapy appeared more cost-effective than art therapy but there was considerable uncertainty and a sizeable probability that art therapy was more cost effective. Conclusions From the limited available evidence art therapy was associated with positive effects compared with control in a number of studies in patients with different clinical profiles. The included trials were generally of poor quality and are therefore likely to be at high risk of bias. Art therapy appeared to be cost-effective versus wait-list but further studies are needed to confirm this finding in the target population. There was insufficient evidence to make an informed comparison of the cost-effectiveness of group art therapy with group verbal therapy.
