40|$|The “European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy” (EDIT) is an {{initiative}} of 28 European, North American and Russian institutions {{to build a}} network in “Taxonomy for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research”, with the objective to reduce the fragmentation in taxonomy through institutional integration in Europe (www. etaxonomy. eu). European Commission funding (FP 6) for this “Network of Excellence” has started in March 2006, and runs for 5 years. For EDIT Work Package 7 (WP 7) “Applying Taxonomy to Conservation” {{the aim is to}} strengthen the input of taxonomic expertise in Europe for biodiversity conservation, by organizing the participation of individual taxonomists and experts in <b>biodiversity</b> <b>inventory</b> and monitoring efforts in conservation areas (www. atbi. eu). For <b>biodiversity</b> <b>inventories</b> and monitoring, the advantage of using digital field recording tools is to simplify data recording as well as to improve data quality. The use of electronic field tools and software should be promoted to help minimizing error rates, in particular to avoid mistakes {{from the beginning of the}} recording chain. Many errors may be avoided by using authority lists, e. g. for countries, habitat-types or taxa that can already be determined in the field. Automated georeferencing and recording of date and time in standardized formats already in the field will also avoid errors when importing or retyping such data into a database. Relevant software should be usable for tools such as mobile phones with GPS (Global Positioning System) functionality up to water resistant PDAs - Personal Digital Assistant (e. g. Magellan - Mobile Mapper; Trimble – Juno, Nomad). Examples presented here for more efficient electronic data recording in the field include the application of mobile recording devices with customized forms, which are tested for field work in ATBI+M (<b>All</b> <b>Taxa</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Inventories</b> + Monitoring; www. atbi. eu) sites operated in the EDIT project. This is a general approach for recording georeferenced, individual species data using customized forms for ESRI ArcPad applications. Species names can be selected from a taxonomic authority list provided in a file in dBASE-format. Such files can be easily created, modified, and exchanged to allow individual researchers to use regional or otherwise customized species lists. Fields and field formats correspond to ABCD standards so that exports of recorded locality, event, and species data can be directly integrated into a central database and applications for individual ATBI+M websites (e. g. www. atbi. eu/mercantour-marittime/ or www. atbi. eu/gemer/). The authority species lists may be customized for a geographic area (e. g., a nature reserve) and/or a group of taxa (e. g., larger birds). This allows each expert to choose the species list needed for his/her research. Problems remain with observation records which cannot be reliably determined in the field. Therefore identification help should be made available on the PDA at least for difficult taxa...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} part of the Swedish Taxonomy Initiative (STI) - one of the most ambitious <b>all</b> <b>taxa</b> <b>biodiversity</b> <b>inventories</b> in the world. One of the pillars in STI is to support taxonomic {{research}} on the most neglected taxonomic groups with the aim to lift the level of knowledge of biodiversity in the country. There is still a lot to be discovered, especially in the microscopic world, and this includes mites. Many aspects of mite biology and diversity are poorly known, such as species richness, abundance, distribution, lifestyle and behavior of species. Mites inhabits all sorts of aquatic, terrestrial, arboreal and parasitic habitats, nevertheless even in well-studied systems mites are often overlooked. Despite being among the smallest of arthropods, they are of medical and economical importance and may be very abundant in the ecosystems they inhabit. This thesis focuses on Parasitengona (Acariformes: Prostigmata), one of the most diverse taxa among the arachnids. It includes the aquatic Hydrachnidia (water mites) and the terrestrial Trombidia (e. g. velvet mites, chiggers). A unifying characteristic of Parasitengona is their complex life cycle of active and inactive stages, parasitic larvae and predatory deutonymphs and adults. They typically parasitize and prey on arthropods, except the chiggers which have vertebrates as hosts. The aim of this thesis is to shed light on the phylogeny and taxonomy of Parasitengona with emphasis on the Swedish fauna. To achieve this, mites were collected from different localities throughout the country between the years 2007 - 2016. Water mites were sampled with a hand net. Larvae of terrestrial Parasitengona were collected with sweeping nets and sorted out from malaise trap samples from the Swedish Malaise Trap Project. To collect the adults Berlese-Tullgren extractor and pitfall traps were used as well as hand collecting and sifting with litter reducer. The material collected abroad was kindly provided through collaboration.   Methods used in the papers included morphometrics, multivariate analyses, experimental rearing, DNA extraction and sequencing, Bayesian phylogenetic analyses and molecular species delimitation. In paper I and II, we combine molecular species delimitation models and morphological data to resolve taxonomical issues. This integrative taxonomic approach of combining data resulted in Piona dispersa Sokolow, 1926 as a valid species and redescriptions, new synonyms and neotypes provided for Erythraeus phalangoides (De Geer, 1778),  E. cinereus (Dugès, 1834) and E. regalis (C. L. Koch, 1837). Based on the new inventories we produce an updated and annotated checklist of 105 terrestrial Parasitengona species for Fennoscandia in paper III, and use metadata to increase the knowledge on distribution, habitat preferences, life stages and abundance. Out of these, 20 species are new findings for the region and five are potential new species for science. In paper IV, we provide a molecular phylogeny of Parasitengona based on the genes 18 S, 28 S and COI for 80 taxa with a sampling focus on the terrestrial lineages. Based on the results we offer a revised higher-level classification of the group. In particular the analyses supported Tanaupodoidea Thor, 1935 as a separate superfamily, but Trombiculoidea Ewing, 1929 was not monophyletic and was synonymized, along with Chyzerioidea Womersley, 1954, with Trombidioidea Leach, 1815.

40|$|For {{many decades}} the genus Milnesium {{was thought to}} consist of a single, {{cosmopolitan}} species: Milnesium tardigradum Doyere, 1840. However, recently the genus has been re-evaluated, and numerous new species have been described.

It is doubtful that M. tardigradum sensu stricto is truly cosmopolitan, but to evaluate this hypothesis, specimens previously identified as M. tardigradum must be re-examined using newly proposed taxonomic characters. As part of the <b>All</b> <b>Taxa</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Inventory</b> (ATBI) we collected Milnesium specimens from various locations in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP).

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} how island biogeography affects diversity {{on the scale of}} island systems. In this study, we address how diversity varies over very short periods of time on individual islands. To do this, we compile an inventory of the ants living in the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area, Boston, Massachusetts, USA using data from a five-year <b>All</b> <b>Taxa</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Inventory</b> of the region’s arthropods. Consistent with the classical theory of island biogeography, species richness increased with island size, decreased with island isolation, and remained relatively constant over time. Additionally, our inventory finds that almost half of the known Massachusetts ant fauna can be collected in the BHI, and identifies four new species records for Massachusetts, including one new to the United States, Myrmica scabrinodis. We find that the number of species actually active on islands depended greatly on the timescale under consideration. The species that could be detected during any given week of sampling could by no means account for total island species richness, even when correcting for sampling effort. Though we consistently collected the same number of species over any given week of sampling, the identities of those species varied greatly between weeks. This variation does not result from local immigration and extinction of species, nor from seasonally-driven changes in the abundance of individual species, but rather from weekly changes in the distribution and activity of foraging ants. This variation can be upwards of 50 % of ant species per week. This suggests that numerous ant species on the BHI share the same physical space at different times. This tempora...|$|E

Intensive sampling on ten of the islands, using an assortment of passive traps and limited hand collecting, resulted in the capture of 6, 194 specimens, comprising 128 species. Among these species were seven new state records for Massachusetts (Acupalpus nanellus, Amara aulica, Amara bifrons, Apenes lucidulus, Bradycellus tantillus, Harpalus rubripes and Laemostenus terricola terricola—the last also a new country record; in passing we report also new state records for Harpalus rubripes from New York and Pennsylvania, Amara ovata from Pennsylvania, and the first mainland New York records for Asaphidion curtum). For most islands, {{there was a clear}} relationship between species richness and island area. Two islands, however, Calf and Grape, had far more species than their relatively small size would predict. Freshwater marshes on these islands, along with a suite of hygrophilous species, suggested that habitat diversity {{plays an important role in}} island species richness. Introduced species (18) comprised 14. 0 % of the total observed species richness, compared to 5. 5 % (17 out of 306 species) documented for Rhode Island. We surmise that the higher proportion of introduced species on the islands is, in part, due to a higher proportion of disturbed and open habitats as well as high rates of human traffic. We predict that more active sampling in specialized habitats would bring the total carabid fauna of the Boston Harbor Islands closer to that of Rhode Island or eastern Massachusetts in richness and composition; however, isolation, human disturbance and traffic, and limited habitat diversity all contribute to reducing the species pool on the islands relative to that on the mainland...|$|E

In each plot, when available, 16 moss samples, 16 lichen samples, and 4 soil samples were collected in paper bags and air dried in the laboratory. Specimens were isolated with LudoxAM centrifugation, and for each sample up to 50 adults plus eggs were individually mounted on microscope slides in Hoyer's medium and identified using phase contrast and DIC microscopy. Additional collections were made in the limestone caves of the Cades Cove region of the park, bird nests, and 13 different streams. To date (1 -Jun- 06), 589 samples have been collected, and of these 401 have been analyzed, yielding a total of 8133 identifiable tardigrades or, in some cases, species groups.
