50|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>antimonide</b> (AlSb) is a {{semiconductor}} of {{the group}} III-V family containing aluminium and antimony. The lattice constant is 0.61 nm. The indirect bandgap is approximately 1.6 eV at 300 K, whereas the direct band gap is 2.22 eV.|$|E
50|$|Zinc {{antimonide}} (ZnSb), (Zn3Sb2), (Zn4Sb3) is an {{inorganic chemical}} compound. Like indium antimonide, <b>aluminium</b> <b>antimonide,</b> and gallium antimonide, it is a semiconducting intermetallic compound. It {{is used in}} transistors, infrared detectors and thermal imagers, as well as magnetoresistive devices.|$|E
50|$|Wright was versatile, having {{initially}} {{considered and}} trained for a profession in engineering. This {{allowed him to}} make diverse contributions to the chemical field. In addition to his research in organic chemistry, he published numerous works on iron smelting, manganese dioxide, ternary alloys, and chemical dynamics, among others.In 1892, Wright {{was the first to}} report the existence of the stoichiometric intermetallic compound AlSb (<b>aluminium</b> <b>antimonide),</b> which is now recognized as a compound semiconductor with potential use in high-frequency, low-power consumption microelectronics applications, as well as gamma radiation detection.|$|E
50|$|A {{layer of}} indium {{antimonide}} sandwiched between layers of <b>aluminium</b> indium <b>antimonide</b> {{can act as}} a quantum well. In such a heterostructure InSb/AlInSb has recently been shown to exhibit a robust quantum Hall effect. This approach is studied in order to construct very fast transistors. Bipolar transistors operating at frequencies up to 85 GHz were constructed from indium antimonide in the late 1990s; field-effect transistors operating at over 200 GHz have been reported more recently (Intel/QinetiQ). Some models suggest that terahertz frequencies are achievable with this material. Indium antimonide semiconductor devices are also capable of operating with voltages under 0.5 V, reducing their power requirements.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the impact of lateral current {{spreading}} on light emission from <b>aluminium</b> indium <b>antimonide</b> (AlInSb) mid-infrared p-i-n light-emitting diodes (LEDs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a GaAs substrate. Due to the high effective mass of holes in Al xIn 1 âˆ’x Sb, the resistivity of p-type material determines the 3 -D distribution of current flow in the devices. This work shows that maximum light emission, as measured by electroluminescence, and 3 -times wall-plug efficiency improvement were obtained at room temperature from devices with a p-type contact grid geometry with a spacing of twice the current spreading length in the p-type material, which was measured by spatially resolved photocurrent. The LED with the optimal contact geometry exhibits improved performance at high injection current levels thanks to the more uniform carrier distribution across the device area...|$|R
5000|$|ZnTe has the {{appearance}} of grey or brownish-red powder, or ruby-red crystals when refined by sublimation. Zinc telluride typically had a cubic (sphalerite, or [...] "zincblende") crystal structure, but can be also prepared as hexagonal crystals (wurtzite structure). Irradiated by a strong optical beam burns in presence of oxygen. Its lattice constant is 0.6101 nm, allowing it to be grown with or on <b>aluminium</b> <b>antimonide,</b> gallium antimonide, indium arsenide, and lead selenide. With some lattice mismatch, {{it can also be}} grown on other substrates such as GaAs, and it can be grown in thin-film polycrystalline (or nanocrystalline) form on substrates such as glass, for example, in the manufacture of thin-film solar cells. In the wurtzite (hexagonal) crystal structure, it has lattice parameters a = 0.427 and c = 0.699 nm.|$|E
