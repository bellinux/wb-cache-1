5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> they crashed, as he realised {{that he could}} not match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|At 2 a.m. on 2 August, Atkinson's forces awoke {{and began}} to break camp, setting out before sunrise. They had moved {{only a few miles}} when they ran into the rear scout element of the {{remaining}} Sauk and Fox forces. The Sauk scouts attempted to lead the enemy away from the main camp and were initially successful. The combined U.S. forces fell into formation for battle: Generals Alexander and Posey formed the right wing, Henry the left wing, and Dodge and the regulars the center element. As the Native Americans retreated toward the river, the militia's left wing were left in the rear without orders. When a regiment stumbled across the main trail to the camp, the scouts could only fight in retreat <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> they had given their comrades a chance to escape the militia, while the Sauk and Fox kept retreating to the river. However, Warrior returned after obtaining more wood in Prairie du Chien, leaving the refueling point about midnight and arriving at Bad Axe about 10 a.m. The slaughter that followed continued for the next eight hours.|$|E
5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{most likely}} {{realised}} that this situation presented {{them with an}} opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet. Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea, <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica, followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of Euboea from the south; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap. Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae. Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day, to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium. Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics. The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; {{they did not want to}} suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment. These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle.|$|E

25|$|At the year-ending Sony Ericsson Championships, Clijsters was {{eliminated}} {{in the group}} stage. Clijsters lost her first match, a rematch of the US Open final, to Pierce 6–1, 4–6, 7–6 and her second match to Mauresmo 6–3, 7–6. This left the Belgian needing to win <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the results in the other matches went her way. Although results did not go her way and Clijsters {{was eliminated}} with one match still to play, she finished her season by defeating Dementieva in straight sets. Clijsters ended the year ranked World No. 2.|$|E

Bohemians won 5–0, while Cork shocked Shelbourne by defeating them on their home patch. Bohemians were crowned champions, and the aftermath of the result would shape the rest of Roddy Collins career.|$|E

25|$|Normally batsmen never {{attempt to}} run byes when the wicket-keeper catches the ball. However, in {{situations}} {{at the end}} of a game when the batting team must score runs quickly in order to have a chance of winning, the batsmen may risk running a bye <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the wicket-keeper fumbles the ball or throws it inaccurately when attempting to run a batsman out. The usual result of this is a batsman's being run out, but sometimes the tactic pays off with a few One Day International matches having been won on byes.|$|E

This would violate the chief principle of Change. Instead, one adjusts one's own mind through detachment so that the Change, of whatever nature, has no effect on one's peace of mind. Briefly stated, the third Noble Truth implies that elimination of the cause (craving) eliminates the result (suffering). This is implied by the scriptural quote by The Buddha, 'Whatever may result from a cause, shall be eliminated by the elimination of the cause'.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} in the Balkans deteriorated {{in such a manner}} that in 585 the Persian Shah Hormizd IV could reasonably hope to negotiate a peace treaty leaving Armenia to the Persians. Maurice rejected the offer, being able to negotiate much more favourable peace terms in 591, after substantial successes on the battlefield. For the time being, however, he had to abide by Avar and Slavic incursions <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> his forces garrisoned at Singidunum could deter the invaders, posing a constant threat to the Avar homeland, just {{on the other side of}} the Danube. The Roman presence at Singidunum was strong enough to effect constant break-offs of Avar raids. However, it could not prevent the attacks.|$|E
25|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Channel Islands lasted from 30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945. During that time, the Channel Islanders had to live under and obey the laws of Nazi Germany and work with their occupiers {{in order to survive}} and reduce the impact of occupation. Given no guidance on how to behave by the British government, there were individuals who got too close to the enemy and a few who undertook resistance activities. Most {{had no choice but to}} accept the changes and depredations to their lives <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> external forces would someday remove the forces of occupation. It was almost five years before the islanders experienced freedom again.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the cover}} of night, the French mounted sorties with object of {{destroying}} the siege trenches. Mélac personally led several of these attacks. A French engineer officer named Rovère disguised himself and got within the Imperial lines, but he was found and captured on 8 July. The second parallel was opened on 21 June and the third parallel on 16 July. Mélac flooded the moat on 26 July. The three parallels were completed on 2 August and interconnected. By this date, {{the damage to the}} fortress walls could already be seen. Meanwhile, the besiegers overran the outworks one by one. In this situation, the French increasingly relied on buried mines within threatened outworks. When the Imperials stormed such a position, before retreating, the French would light the fuse <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> many attackers would be blown up in the ensuing explosion. To prevent these losses, the Imperial engineers dug countermines.|$|E

However, in the 2012–13 Bulgarian Cup, the club was eliminated in the round of 32 by CSKA Sofia 2–2 on aggregate, losing on away goals. In the spring half-season, Ludogorets occupied the first place with just three matches to play {{before the end of the}} season. Nevertheless, they were defeated 1–0 by Levski Sofia and Levski took the lead of A Group. On the final day of the season, Ludogorets had to beat the already relegated team of Montana <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> Slavia Sofia would prevent Levski from winning their match. In the last minutes of the Levski–Slavia match, Levski conceived an own goal which subsequently led to a 1–1 draw, allowing Ludogorets to win their second championship title in dramatic fashion again. In the 2013 Supercup, they lost 5–3 on penalties to Beroe Stara Zagora after a 1–1 draw in regular time.|$|E
