5|$|Australia {{was based}} in Peoria, Arizona—the site of the Seattle Mariners spring {{training}} camp—for their preparation for the formal start of their 2009 campaign. Unlike 2006, {{in which they had}} one exhibition game, they competed against three different Major League clubs: the Seattle Mariners, the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago White Sox. Their game against Seattle was Ken Griffey, Jr.'s first game playing for the Mariners since October 1999, and was <b>also</b> <b>their</b> first victory as part of a World Baseball Classic tour.|$|E

5|$|Being well-educated themselves, the Ayyubid rulers became munificent {{patrons of}} {{learning}} and educational activity. Different madrasa-type schools were built by them throughout the empire, not only for education, but also to popularize knowledge of Sunni Islam. According to Ibn Jubayr, under Saladin, Damascus had 20 schools, 100 baths, {{and a large number}} of Sufi dervish monasteries. He also built several schools in Aleppo, Jerusalem, Cairo, Alexandria, and in various cities in the Hejaz. Similarly, many schools were built by his successors <b>also.</b> <b>Their</b> wives and daughters, commanders, and nobles established and financed numerous educational institutions as well.|$|E
5|$|Born Villain is {{the eighth}} studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was {{released}} on April 25, 2012 by Cooking Vinyl and Marilyn Manson's Hell, etc. label. It was the band's first release since the departure of Ginger Fish, who had been their drummer since 1995, and is <b>also</b> <b>their</b> first and only album to feature Fred Sablan. The album was co-produced by the band's eponymous vocalist alongside former Nine Inch Nails member Chris Vrenna, who left shortly after its completion to focus on other production work.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round. The majority of Liverpool's matches were close affairs, they didn't score more than two goals in any of their matches and this was <b>also</b> <b>their</b> biggest margin of victory. Leeds' matches ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories. They won their third round tie against Stockport County 3–0, while they beat Manchester United 1–0 in a semi-final replay following a 0–0 draw in the initial match.|$|E

It was {{released}} in the United States on DVD and VHS on November 7, 2000 by SMV Enterprises, the home media division of Sony's music and entertainment label. With a running time of 60 minutes, the video provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career, through a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances. The interview segments were conducted by Lopez's sister Lynda, who interviews not only Lopez, but <b>also</b> <b>their</b> mother, Benny Medina and Marc Anthony.|$|E
5|$|The Eagles {{opened the}} season by {{traveling}} to Kent State, whom the Eagles defeated, 21–0. The Eagles' home opener was their second {{game of the season}} and was <b>also</b> <b>their</b> first conference game of the year. Against Georgia Tech, the Eagles eked out a 9–7 halftime lead, but fell behind in the second half, eventually losing, 19–16, on a Georgia Tech touchdown that came with 8:26 remaining in the game. Despite the loss, the Eagles recovered quickly, beating Central Florida, 34–7, two weeks after the Georgia Tech game. The victory was the first in an eventual four-game win streak that culminated with a 28–23 defeat of then-No. 17 Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|The precise {{number of}} bishops, archbishops, and abbots who {{attended}} is unknown. Estimates range from 1,100 to 400, {{with the lower}} number being much more likely. The attendees were from what were later the countries of France, Germany, England, and Spain, and {{in keeping with the}} times, would have included not just the prelates who were summoned, but <b>also</b> <b>their</b> servants and officials, making the true number of people in Reims impossible to know.|$|E
5|$|The quickest {{score in}} NFL history {{occurred}} on September 8, 2013, in the Steelers season opener against the Tennessee Titans, when the Steelers scored a safety {{on the opening}} kickoff three seconds into the game. Darius Reynaud of the Titans fielded the kickoff and took a short step backwards (into the south end zone) for what was ruled to be a safety, not a touchback, because the ball {{was not in the}} end zone when it was fielded. The Steelers, however, lost the game 16-9, which was <b>also</b> <b>their</b> first home opener loss since Heinz Field opened.|$|E
5|$|The reduced length while {{retaining}} the same beam as the prior Connecticut class {{resulted in a}} disadvantageous length-to-beam ratio, causing reduced performance relative to that class. Not only was their top speed a knot slower, but <b>also</b> <b>their</b> economical speed was reduced by one and half knots. They also had 25% less coal storage, further reducing their operating range.|$|E

5|$|The species Pholiota squarrosoides has {{a similar}} outward appearance, {{but it may be}} {{distinguished}} by its brown spores and sticky cap surface underneath the scales. In the hedgehog pholiota (Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus), the overall size is smaller—cap diameter —and the spores are cinnamon-brown. Some species in the genus Cystoderma also appear similar, but can be distinguished by microscopic features, like the presence of spherical (rather than club-shaped) cells in the cuticle of the cap, and <b>also</b> <b>their</b> habitat—Cystoderma usually grows on soil, rather than wood.|$|E
5|$|Although sceptical, Harry sends Lucas to Kachimov {{to learn}} which cable the {{submarine}} will attack so Malcolm can launch a counterattack. Lucas {{is able to}} turn Kachimov by forging evidence {{that he is an}} MI5 mole. They both go to the Russian embassy and find the submarine's location, after which Malcolm launches the counterattack with seconds to spare. Kachimov is later arrested. Lucas visits Elizabeta at her home, which was <b>also</b> <b>their</b> married home and he asks her to become an asset to MI5 to save her from arrest because of her association with Kachimov. In the end, Kachimov is with Harry and Ros in a field. Kachimov states his admiration for Adam's sacrifice, but then callously says he was a replaceable resource. In the final moments, Ros hands Harry a gun and Harry kills Kachimov with a shot to the chest.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers a and b is <b>also</b> <b>their</b> smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b is actually {{the same as the}} set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by a and b is the ideal generated byg alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of a and b also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E

5|$|Bleach {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, {{but failed to}} chart in the U.S. upon its original release. The album was re-released internationally by Geffen Records in 1992 following the success of Nirvana's second album, Nevermind (1991). The re-release debuted at number 89 on the Billboard 200, and peaked at number 33 on the UK Albums Chart and 34 on the Australian albums chart. In 2009 Sub Pop released a 20th anniversary edition of Bleach featuring a live recording of a Nirvana show in Portland, Oregon from 1990 as extra material. Since its release in 1989, Bleach {{has sold more than}} 1,900,000 copies in the United States alone. It is Sub Pop's best-selling album to date. It was <b>also</b> <b>their</b> only album to feature drummer Chad Channing.|$|E
5|$|Charles I, {{who ruled}} from 1331 to 1357, {{and was the}} son of François Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, {{significantly}} enlarged the fortress by adding two large buildings: one against the eastern ramparts and the second looking out over the sea. This changed the appearance of the fortress, making it appear more of a fortified house than a fortress. The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the fortress was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but <b>also</b> <b>their</b> fortress on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but very vulnerable area of land.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the role}} of the militants in leading the Uprising, the colonial {{authorities}} immediately accused the MDRM of instigating the movement. This view was echoed by PADESM leaders and shared by the majority of French settlers. The French authorities responded by targeting not only MDRM leaders and members, but <b>also</b> <b>their</b> supporters, drawing the wider population into the conflict. Attacks against the colonial authority in the east were immediately followed by similar actions in the south of the island before rapidly spreading throughout the country. The movement enjoyed particularly strong support in the south, where the revolt attracted as many as one million peasants to fight for the nationalist cause. The French responded with heavy military action and psychological warfare, including incidences of crimes against humanity. Between July and September 1948, most of the key leaders of the Uprising were captured or killed, and the last of the fighters disbanded and fled into the forests in December 1948.|$|E
