40|$|Abstract: Anti-ribosomal P protein {{antibody}} (anti-P) in cerebral spinal fluids (CSF) {{has been}} reported to associate with NPSLE and IgG anti-P in CSF was suggested to be a useful marker for the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric syndromes of systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). There is growing evidence that chemokines, such as MCP- 1 /CCL 2 and IP- 10 /CXCL 10 are involved in the pathogenesis of NPSLE. To study the relationship between these markers in CSF from pa-tients with NPSLE, we measured the levels of IgG anti-P, MCP- 1 /CCL 2 and IP- 10 /CXCL 10 in the same samples. We found no correlations between the titer of IgG <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibody</b> and IP- 10 /CXCL 10 or MCP- 1 /CCL 2, suggesting that IgG <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibody</b> and chemokine levels might discriminate the different subset of NPSLE symptoms...|$|E
40|$|A {{subset of}} SLE {{patients}} has serologically detectable autoantibodies to the ribosomal P proteins (anti-P). We reported {{the discovery of}} covert anti-P antibodies and their masking IgG-inhibitory antibodies in the sera of healthy adults. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if these IgG-inhibitory antibodies are anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Ids). IgG and IgG-depleted fractions of plasma from two healthy adults were assayed for inhibition of anti-P F(ab') 2 binding to the ribosomal P proteins in immunoblot. <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibody</b> activity was completely inhibited by plasma IgG, whereas there was no inhibition by IgG-depleted plasma. IgG-inhibitory antibodies recognized a cross-reactive epitope among anti-P from different SLE patients. Plasma IgG from one healthy adult was depleted of pepsin agglutinators and generic anti-F(ab') 2 antibodies by adsorption with an affinity column prepared with normal IgG F(ab') 2. Unretained IgG bound exclusively to anti-P F(ab') 2 in ELISA. Using four affinity columns, we isolated IgG anti-Ids to anti-P antibodies from four healthy adults. These purified anti-Ids bound to anti-P F(ab') 2 from a healthy adult and SLE patients. They did not bind to F(ab') 2 fragments prepared from normal IgG or anti-dsDNA. Ribosomal antigens blocked this anti-Id-Id interaction. Purified anti-Ids inhibited the binding of anti-P F(ab') 2 from patients to ribosomal P proteins. SLE patients without overt anti-P antibodies also possessed IgG anti-Ids to anti-P antibodies. We conclude that IgG-inhibitory antibodies are anti-Ids to anti-P antibodies, and are directed to public idiotopes on anti-P antibodies. These anti-Ids may be part of an Id network that regulates <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibody</b> expression, and perhaps pathogenicity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Immune-mediated {{recurrent}} {{pregnancy loss}} (RPL) {{has received more}} attentionthan any other single etiologic classification. Individuals with rare blood group P have an antipp 1 pkantibody in their serum, which causes recurrent abortion in the early stages.

40|$|Anti-ribosomal P protein (<b>anti-P)</b> <b>{{antibodies}}</b> are marker antibodies in systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE). Their association with psychiatric or neurological manifestations has been proposed, but remains controversial. Anti-phospholipid antibodies are the hallmark of a syndrome that may comprise a number of neurological manifestations. Thus, <b>anti-P</b> and anti-phospholipid <b>antibodies</b> have both been associated with central nervous system involvement and their co-existence in the same sera was reported. We verified the ability of purified <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> to bind different phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins in solid-phase assays. <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> from five of eight patients bound cardiolipin (CL) when saturated with fetal calf serum (FCS); in three cases anti-CL antibodies were also detected in the flow-through. No anti-P eluate, nor any corresponding flow-through, bound beta(2) -glycoprotein I alone or prothrombin. Moreover, no anti-P eluate bound CL when the plates were blocked with bovine serum albumin {{in the absence of}} FCS. <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> with anti-CL activity bound both ssDNA and dsDNA and also nucleosomes in three patients.

Methods One-hundred fifty-six consecutive patients with CLD (65 with chronic hepatitis B, 57 with chronic hepatitis C, 23 with alcoholic liver disease and 11 with primary biliary cirrhosis), and 240 healthy blood donors were investigated for the presence of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Results <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> were present in 36. 5 % (57 / 156) of patients with CLD, and 2. 9 % (7 / 240) of controls (P= 0. 0001). In detail, <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected in 35. 4 % (23 / 65) of patients with chronic hepatitis B, 26. 3 % (15 / 57) of patients with chronic hepatitis C, 47. 8 % (11 / 23) of patients with alcoholic liver disease and 72. 7 % (8 / 11) of those with primary biliary cirrhosis. The study also demonstrated the significantly higher prevalence of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> in patients with cirrhosis (53. 0 %) than in non cirrhotic patients (26. 4 %, P= 0. 0018).

40|$|Background: Diagnosis and {{treatment}} of neuropsychiatric lupus is still a major challenge in clinical practice. We investigated the association between depression and anti-ribosomal P (<b>anti-P)</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{in a sample of}} Iranian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on adult patients with SLE referring to a referral out-patient clinic of rheumatology. Demographic data and clinical data with regards to measuring disease activity with the systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index were gathered. <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> were measured with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Depression severity was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Results: One hundred patients (80 % female and 20 % male, age = 34. 8 ± 10. 9 years) were included. <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> were present more frequently in depressed than non-depressed patients (30 % vs. 10 %, P = 0. 015). Depression severity was correlated with <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> level only in patients with disease duration of less than 2 years (r = 0. 517, P = 0. 019). There was no association between the depression severity and disease activity. Binary logistic regression analysis showed age (B = 0. 953, CI 95 %: 0. 914 - 0. 993) and positive <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> (B = 4. 30, CI 95 %: 1. 18 - 15. 59) as factors that independently associated with depression. Conclusion: We found an association between depression and presence of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies,</b> and also strong correlation between depression severity and <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> level in newly diagnosed SLE patients. Depression severity in newly diagnosed SLE patients may reflect a neuropsychiatric involvement, and in later phases, it is more affected by the chronicity of the disease as well as other environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies {{specific}} for ribosomal P proteins (anti-P) are {{a hallmark}} of systemic lupus as anti-DNA antibodies are. It {{has been reported that}} anti-P antibodies are more frequently detected in anti-dsDNA positive sera. The aim {{of the present study was}} to verify the binding ability of anti-P antibodies towards polynucleotides and nucleosomes. We purified anti-P antibodies from 8 SLE patients' sera and we analysed them by ELISA on plates coated with DNA or nucleosomes. We performed also inhibition experiments in order to verify the specificity of the binding. All the purified anti-P antibodies bound DNA, but some anti-DNA binding activity remained among the non-anti-P antibodies in the flow through. Only half of the purified antibodies bound to nucleosomes, and anti-nucleosomal activity was demonstrated also in non <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibody</b> fraction. The inhibition experiments performed on two anti-P antibodies pointed out that only the homologous antigen inhibited the binding to either P peptide or DNA coated onto the solid phase. These results show that sera in which the two specificities coexist contain antibodies endowed with a double binding ability for DNA and the P peptide...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Outbreaks of Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses {{have been}} {{reported}} starting in 1994 and 1998, respectively. Both viruses are capable of causing fatal disease in humans and effecting great economical loss in the livestock industry. Results Through screening of hybridomas derived from mice immunized with γ-irradiated Nipah virus, we identified two secreted antibodies; one reactive with the nucleocapsid (N) protein and the other, the phosphoprotein (P) of henipaviruses. Epitope mapping and protein sequence alignments between NiV and HeV suggest the last 14 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of the N protein is {{the target of the}} anti-N antibody. The <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibody</b> recognizes an epitope in the amino-terminal half of P protein. These monoclonal antibodies were used to develop two antigen capture ELISAs, one for virus detection and the other for differentiation between NiV and HeV. The lower limit of detection of the capture assay with both monoclonal antibodies was 400 pfu. The anti-N antibody was used to successfully detect NiV in a lung tissue suspension from an infected pig. Conclusion The antigen capture ELISA developed is potentially affordable tool to provide rapid detection and differentiation between the henipaviruses. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the clinical {{sensitivity and specificity}} of three different methods {{for the detection of}} serum antiribosomal P protein (anti-P) antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Sera from 60 unselected SLE patients, 100 healthy subjects and 100 patients with other rheumatic inflammatory diseases were screened for anti-P antibodies by immunoblotting (IB) on P proteins from Raji cells and by two ELISA assays, one using the C-terminal 22 aminoacid long synthetic peptide (C- 22) of P proteins, the other using a multiple antigen peptide (MAP) carrying four copies of the C-terminal 13 aminoacid long P peptide. Anti-P antibodies were found in 20 % lupus sera by IB, 16. 7 % by MAP ELISA and 11. 7 % by C- 22 ELISA. The specificity for SLE diagnosis of the three tests in healthy subjects and other rheumatic diseases was: 100 % by IB, 100 % (vs healthy subjects) and 97 % (vs rheumatic diseases) by C- 22 ELISA, 100 % by MAP ELISA. The agreement between methods was good; differences in concordance rates were restricted to weak positivities. We observed a high concordance in the results of IB and ELISA methods for <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibody</b> detection. IB on P proteins extracted from human lymphoid cells is more sensitive than both ELISAs; IB and MAP ELISA perform better than the C- 22 ELISA in determining weakly positive sera...|$|E
40|$|The {{interesting}} observation {{was made}} 20 {{years ago that}} psychotic manifestations in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus {{are associated with the}} production of antiribosomal-P protein (anti-P) autoantibodies. Since then, the pathogenic role of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> has attracted considerable attention, giving rise to long-term controversies as evidence has either contradicted or confirmed their clinical association with lupus psychosis. Furthermore, a plausible mechanism supporting an anti-P–mediated neuronal dysfunction is still lacking. We show that <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> recognize a new integral membrane protein of the neuronal cell surface. In the brain, this neuronal surface P antigen (NSPA) is preferentially distributed in areas involved in memory, cognition, and emotion. When added to brain cellular cultures, <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> caused a rapid and sustained increase in calcium influx in neurons, resulting in apoptotic cell death. In contrast, astrocytes, which do not express NSPA, were not affected. Injection of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> into the brain of living rats also triggered neuronal death by apoptosis. These results demonstrate a neuropathogenic potential of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> and contribute a mechanistic basis for psychiatric lupus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} and clinical and serological associations of anti-ribosomal P protein <b>antibodies</b> (<b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies)</b> {{in patients with}} connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and investigate the immunobiological nature of autoantibody clustering in which <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> play a part.  METHODS—IgG <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> in the sera of 267  patients with CTDs and 31  healthy subjects were analysed by immunoblotting performed on cytoplasmic extract of Raji cells. 60  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 32  systemic sclerosis, 46  primary Sjögren's syndrome, 16  poly/dermatomyositis, 11  rheumatoid arthritis, 8  undifferentiated CTD, 72  overlap CTD, and 22  primary antiphospholipid syndrome were studied. <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> were affinity purified by elution from nitrocellulose bound antigen and tested by ELISA for their binding activity to cardiolipin.  RESULTS—Anti-P antibodies were detected in 16  (6 %) patients and in none of the controls: 12 / 60 SLE (20 %) and 4 / 80 undifferentiated/overlap patients with CTD (5 %). A close association of IgG antibodies with P proteins and with cardiolipin was seen in lupus sera (p= 0. 0009, odds ratio 18. 33). <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> from 9  of 12  anti-P lupus serum samples could be affinity purified {{and none of the}} affinity purified fractions cross reacted with ELISA plate coated cardiolipin.  CONCLUSIONS—Anti-P immunoreactivity is a specific marker of SLE and lupus-like disease and its detection is recommended as a powerful diagnostic tool. <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> are strongly clustered with IgG anticardiolipin antibodies in lupus sera, even if they are independently elicited. This suggests that their cognate autoantigens play a part in a common pathogenetic pathway in SLE. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{present in}} sera from {{patients}} with chronic Chagas heart disease (cChHD) recognize peptide R 13, EEEDDDMGFGLFD, which encompasses the C-terminal region of the Trypanosoma cruzi ribosomal P 1 and P 2 proteins. This peptide shares homology with the C-terminal region (peptide H 13 EESDDDMGFGLFD) of the human ribosomal P proteins, which is in turn the target of anti-P autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and with the acidic epitope, AESDE, of the second extracellular loop of the β 1 -adrenergic receptor. <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> from chagasic patients showed a marked preference for recombinant parasite ribosomal P proteins and peptides, whereas anti-P autoantibodies from SLE reacted with human and parasite ribosomal P proteins and peptides to the same extent. A semi-quantitative estimation of the binding of cChHD <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> to R 13 and H 13 using biosensor technology indicated that the average affinity constant was about 5 times higher for R 13 than for H 13. Competitive enzyme immunoassays demonstrated that cChHD <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> bind to the acidic portions of peptide H 13, {{as well as to}} peptide H 26 R, encompassing the second extracellular loop of the β 1 adrenoreceptor. <b>Anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> isolated from cChHD patients exert a positive chronotropic effect in vitro on cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats, which resembles closely that of anti-β 1 receptor antibodies isolated from the same patient.

40|$|Background Lupus nephritis (LN) is a {{prominent}} feature in {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE), present in 15 – 30 % of patients with lupus {{at the time of}} the initial diagnosis and in 30 – 50 % during the disease progression. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the significance of anti-ribosomal P protein (anti-P) antibodies and LN and their relation to disease activity and other SLE manifestations. Patients and methods Fifty active LN patients were subjected to full clinical examination (assessment of SLE disease activity using the systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index and assessment of SLE disease severity using Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index), routine laboratory investigations, anti-dsDNA antibodies, and anti-P antibodies. Results Comparison between the data of LN in both groups (anti-P positive/anti-dsDNA negative and anti-P negative) shows that there was a statistically significant difference in age (P= 0. 042), hypertension (P= 0. 00), and psychiatric manifestations (P= 0. 004). On comparison of both groups as regards vasculitis, there was a borderline statistical significance (P= 0. 050). Comparison of both groups as regards creatinine level or biopsy class V showed a statistically significant difference with a higher percentage in the anti-P positive/anti-dsDNA negative group (P= 0. 024 and 0. 040, respectively).

40|$|Sperm {{chemotaxis}} in mammals {{have been}} identified towards several female sources as follicular fluid (FF), oviduct fluid, and conditioned medium from the cumulus oophorus (CU) and the oocyte (O). Though several substances were confirmed as sperm chemoattractant, Progesterone (P) {{seems to be the}} best chemoattractant candidate, because: 1) spermatozoa express a cell surface P receptor, 2) capacitated spermatozoa are chemotactically attracted in vitro by gradients of low quantities of P; 3) the CU cells produce and secrete P after ovulation; 4) a gradient of P may be kept stable along the CU; and 5) the most probable site for sperm chemotaxis in vivo could be near and/or inside the CU. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify whether P is the sperm chemoattractant secreted by the rabbit oocyte-cumulus complex (OCC) in the rabbit, as a mammalian animal model. By means of videomicroscopy and computer image analysis we observed that only the CU are a stable source of sperm attractants. The CU produce and secrete P since the hormone was localized inside these cells by immunocytochemistry and in the conditioned medium by enzyme immunoassay. In addition, rabbit spermatozoa express a cell surface P receptor detected by western blot and localized over the acrosomal region by immunocytochemistry. To confirm that P is the sperm chemoattractant secreted by the CU, the sperm chemotactic response towards the OCC conditioned medium was inhibited by three different approaches: P from the OCC conditioned medium was removed with an <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibody,</b> the attractant gradient of the OCC conditioned medium was disrupted by a P counter gradient, and th...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To quantitatively {{evaluate}} the diagnostic accuracy of antibodies to ribosomal P proteins (anti-P) for neuropsychiatric {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (NPSLE) in general, for psychosis, mood disorder, or both, and for other diffuse manifestations. Methods. This international meta-analysis combined standardized data from 1, 537 lupus patients contributed by 14 research teams. Weighted estimation of sensitivity and specificity with fixed-effects and random-effects models, as well as summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve analysis, was used to summarize test performance. The robustness of the overall estimates was examined in sensitivity analyses that included additional studies published up to November 1, 2004 in the Medline, EMBase, and Cochrane databases. Results. Combining {{the data from the}} 14 teams, the weighted sensitivity and specificity estimates for the diagnosis of NPSLE were 26 % (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 15 - 42 %) and 80 % (95 % CI 74 - 85 %), respectively. For psychosis, mood disorder, or both, the sensitivity and specificity were 27 % (95 % CI 14 - 47 %) and 80 % (95 % CI 74 - 85 %), respectively. For other diffuse manifestations, the sensitivity was 24 % (95 % CI 12 - 42 %), and the specificity was 80 % (95 % CI 73 - 85 %). The proportion of patients with anti-P antibodies did not vary markedly across different presentations of NPSLE. Between-study heterogeneity was substantial, but the SROC curves were consistent with the weighted estimates. In further analyses that included another 24 published studies, only the sensitivity for psychosis and/or mood disorder was slightly improved, but it was still suboptimal (42 % [95 % Cl 30 - 53 %]); the specificity remained essentially the same (81 % [95 % Cl 76 - 85 %]).

The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> in sera from patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prior to thoracic surgery and their correlation to survival, nodal involvement, and tumor volume. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 58 patients with NSCLC admitted to the Department of Pulmonary Medicine in Uppsala were collected between 1993 and 1995 and analyzed for the expression of <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies.</b> RESULTS: Antibodies against p 53 were detected in 12 patients (21 %). No association was found between increased levels of <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> and tumor volume (P =. 84). There was a numerical trend towards higher levels of <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> in patients without nodal disease, when compared with patients with nodal involvement, although not statistically significant (P =. 136). However, when patients with metastatic disease were included, statistically significantly lower levels of <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> were demonstrated, in comparison to patients without any sign of nodal engagement or metastatic disease (P =. 038). <b>Anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> and survival showed no correlation between increasing index levels of <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> and survival (P =. 18).

In this study, we measured serum <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibody</b> levels in 52 patients with lung cancer and 63 normal volunteers to determine the relationship between <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibody</b> level and clinical features of lung cancer patients. <b>Anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibody</b> level was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and expressed as an <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibody</b> index, defined as the ratio of absorption of serum sample to that of p 53 -positive serum. The median <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibody</b> index was 6. 6 for lung cancer patients, and higher than that in normal volunteers (1. 7) (P = 0. 0000). For lung cancer patients, significant differences in index levels were found by histology (4. 3, n = 25, adenocarcinoma vs 8. 7, n = 18, squamous cell carcinoma vs 64. 8, n = 2, large-cell carcinoma vs 9. 8, n = 7, small-cell carcinoma; P = 0. 0109). High <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibody</b> index levels were observed for both large-cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma. When the cut-off level was set at 7. 2, determined using the twice 95 % specificity level for normal volunteers, the sensitivities of <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> were 46. 1 % for all lung cancers, 28. 0 % for adenocarcinoma, 55. 6 % for squamous cell carcinoma, 100 % for large-cell carcinoma and 71. 4 % for small-cell carcinoma. However, {{there were no significant differences}} in index level by gender, age, smoking index, presence of previous or concomitant cancer or disease stage. Multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model demonstrated that histological type of tumour was a dominant factor associated with elevation of <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibody</b> index level (P = 0. 0184).

40|$|Abstract Background Lung {{cancer causes}} {{approximately}} one million deaths each year worldwide and protein p 53 {{has been shown}} to be involved in the intricate processes regulating response to radiation and/or chemotherapeutic treatment. Consequently, since antibodies against p 53 (<b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies)</b> are associated with mutations within the p 53 gene it seems likely that these antibodies could, hypothetically, be correlated with prognosis. Methods Serum samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) admitted to the Department of Oncology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, during 1983 – 1996 were studied. Anti-p 53 abs were measured using a sandwich ELISA (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Results The present study included 84 patients with stage IIIA-IV (advanced NSCLC). At least three serum samples from each patient were collected and altogether 529 serum samples were analysed for the presence of <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies.</b> The median value of <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> was 0. 06 (range 0 – 139. 8). Seventeen percent of investigated NSCLC first serum samples (n = 84) expressed elevated levels of <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies.</b> <b>Anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> were not correlated to tumour volume or platelets. Survival analysis showed that <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> were not associated with survival as revealed by univariate analysis (p = 0. 29). However, patients with adenocarcinoma had a significantly poorer survival if they expressed <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> (p = 0. 01), whereas this was not found for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0. 13). In patients where the blood samples were collected during radiation therapy, a statistically significant correlation towards poorer survival was found (p = 0. 05) when elevated <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> levels were present. No correlations to survival were found for serum samples collected prior to radiation therapy, during chemotherapy, or during follow-up. When <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> were measured continuously, no increase in median anti-p 53 values was observed the closer the individual patient come to death. Conclusion The result of the present retrospective study indicates that <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibodies</b> are not suitable for predictions concerning selection of patients with a more favourable outcome. Further prospective studies are, though, needed to fully elucidate this issue. </p...|$|R

Methods For assessing P gingivalis infection, serum levels of antibodies directed against P gingivalis lipopolysaccharide were measured in 694 patients with early RA {{who were not}} exposed to steroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. <b>Anti–P</b> gingivalis <b>antibody</b> titers were compared between patients with early RA and various control groups, and according to various patient characteristics. Results <b>Anti–P</b> gingivalis <b>antibody</b> titers did not significantly differ between patients with RA and controls and did not significantly differ with anti–citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), rheumatoid factor (RF), or HLA shared epitope status. <b>Anti–P</b> gingivalis <b>antibody</b> titers were significantly higher among patients who had never smoked compared to patients who had ever smoked (P[*]= 0. 0049). Among nonsmokers, high <b>anti–P</b> gingivalis <b>antibody</b> levels were associated with a higher prevalence of erosive change (47. 5 % versus 33. 3 % with modified Sharp/van der Heijde score erosion subscale ≥ 1; P[*]=[*] 0. 0135). Conclusion In this large early RA cohort, we did not detect any association of <b>anti–P</b> gingivalis <b>antibodies</b> with RA or with ACPA status.

Nevertheless, we found higher <b>anti–P</b> gingivalis <b>antibody</b> titers in nonsmokers. In addition, in this population of nonsmokers, high <b>anti–P</b> gingivalis <b>antibody</b> titers were associated with more severe disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{develop an}} enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using as {{substrate}} a synthetic 22 -aminoacid peptide, {{corresponding to the}} ribosomal P 0, P 1 and P 2 common epitope. To study the specificity and sensitivity of the method and evaluate the frequency and clinical associations of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> in two groups of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients: (a) unselected SLE patients and (b) SLE patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement.  PATIENTS AND METHODS—The C-terminal 22  aminoacid peptide of the ribosomal P proteins (Lys-Lys-Glu-Glu-Lys-Lys-Glu-Glu-Lys-Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu-Asp-Glu-Asp-Met-Gly-Phe-Gly-Leu-Phe-Asp) was synthesised according to Merrifield's solid phase procedure. Purification of the peptide was performed by preparative high performance liquid chromatography and confirmed by amino acid analysis. Using this peptide, in a concentration 5  µg/ml, an ELISA was developed. The presence of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> was evaluated by western blot using purified ribosomal proteins from rat liver. Sera from 178  consecutive patients with SLE and 28  patients with SLE and CNS manifestations were tested. Sera from 58  patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 57  patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome were used as controls. The cut off point of the assay was defined using 124  normal sera.  RESULTS—The specificity of the assay was evaluated by homologous inhibition. Pretreatment of positive sera with soluble 22 mer peptide of the ribosomal P proteins resulted in 88 % inhibition. The concordance between the peptide assay and western blot {{was found to be}} 83 %. Thirty three of 178  (18. 6 %) of the unselected SLE patients had antibodies to P-protein common epitope. Their presence was associated with more active disease (European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement, ECLAM scoring system) (p< 0. 001), higher levels of anti-ds DNA antibodies (p< 0. 05) and lower levels of the C 4 component of complement (p< 0. 01). Eleven of 28  (39. 3 %) patients with SLE and active CNS involvement had antibodies to P-protein. The overall prevalence of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> in active CNS disease patients was statistically significantly higher, as compared with unselected SLE patients (χ 2 = 6. 04, p< 0. 05). These antibodies were found in a high proportion of patients without anticardiolipin antibodies (52. 4 %) and they were associated with diffuse CNS involvement (psychiatric disorders (71 %) and epilepsy (75 %)).   CONCLUSIONS—A synthetic analogue of the common epitope of ribosomal P-proteins can be use as an antigen for the detection of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies.</b> These antibodies are associated with active SLE and CNS involvement particularly in patients without anticardiolipin antibodies. ...|$|R

To examine, in an {{inception}} {{cohort of}} {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) patients, the association between neuropsychiatric (NP) events and anti-ribosomal P (anti-P), antiphospholipid (lupus anticoagulant [LAC], anticardiolipin), anti-beta 2 -glycoprotein I, and anti-NR 2 glutamate receptor antibodies. Methods. NP events were identified using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions and clustered into central/peripheral and diffuse/focal events. Attribution of NP events to SLE was determined using decision rules of differing stringency. Autoantibodies were measured without knowledge of NP events or their attribution. Results. Four hundred twelve patients were studied (87. 4 % female; mean +/- SD age 34. 9 +/- 13. 5 years, mean +/- SD disease duration 5. 0 +/- 4. 2 months). There were 214 NP events in 133 patients (32. 3 %). The proportion of NP events attributed to SLE varied from 15 % to 36 %. There was no association between autoantibodies and NP events overall. However, the frequency of <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> in patients with central NP events attributed to SLE was 4 of 20 (20 %), versus 3 of 107 (2. 8 %) in patients with other NP events and 24 of 279 (8. 6 %) in those with no NP events (P = 0. 04). Among patients with diffuse NP events, 3 of 11 had <b>anti-P</b> <b>antibodies</b> (27 %), compared with 4 of 111 patients with other NP events (3. 6 %) and 24 of 279 of those with no NP events (8. 6 %) (P 0. 02).

40|$|T {{cells from}} {{patients}} with acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria were investigated for induction of immunoglobulin- or anti-malaria antibody secretion in vitro. Stimulation of autologous T/B cell mixtures (2 T: 1 B) with low concentrations of P. falciparum antigen and cultured for 12 days {{gave rise to}} a T-dependent IgG secretion which was significantly elevated over that in medium controls. This was achieved with both a crude P. falciparum antigen and a partially purified preparation enriched in Pf 155, a merozoite-derived antigen deposited in the red cell membrane at invasion (Perlmann et al., 1984). Control antigen (RBC ghosts) induced IgG secretion only when added at high concentrations (greater than 10 micrograms/ml). Neither of the antigens induced IgG secretion at concentrations of {{less than or equal to}} 10 micrograms/ml in control cultures of lymphocytes from patients with P. vivax malaria. Supernatants from cultures of P. falciparum patients frequently contained <b>anti-P.</b> falciparum <b>antibodies</b> when nanogram quantities (10 - 100 ng/ml) of either one of the two malaria antigen preparations was used for stimulation. No <b>anti-P.</b> falciparum <b>antibodies</b> were induced by the control antigen at any concentration. The induced <b>anti-P.</b> falciparum <b>antibodies</b> were directed to intracellular parasites and. at lower frequencies, to Pf 155 as detected on the surface of infected erythrocytes.

This study aims at {{investigating}} the prognostic values of serum p 53 protein and <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibody</b> in patients undergoing surgical treatment for {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods. Serum p 53 protein and <b>anti-p</b> 53 <b>antibody</b> concentrations were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 75 patients with HNSCC and 28 healthy controls. In 28 patients, formalin-fixed tumor tissues were also available for immunohistochemical staining by an anti-p 53 DO 7 monoclonal antibody. The results were correlated with the clinicopathologic parameters. Results. The mean preoperative serum concentration of p 53 protein in patients with HNSCC {{was significantly higher than}} healthy controls (59. 45 pg/mL vs 16. 4 pg/mL, p =. 007).
