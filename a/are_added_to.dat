5|$|A {{snowflake}} {{consists of}} roughly 1019 water molecules, which <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> its core {{at different rates}} and in different patterns, depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through {{on its way to}} the ground. As a result, snowflakes vary among themselves, while following similar patterns.|$|E
5|$|Bosses <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> die {{castings}} {{to serve}} as stand-offs and mounting points for parts that {{will need to be}} mounted. For maximum integrity and strength of the die casting, bosses must have universal wall thickness.|$|E

5|$|Oils {{that are}} used include heavy {{residual}} oil (HRO), animal fats, vegetable fats, and synthetic fats. HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, they form a thin film. Other substances <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> water-based lubricants, so that oil based additives can be mixed into the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa has {{complex systems}} of both inflectional and derivational {{morphology}}. Inflectional morphology has {{a central role}} in Ottawa grammar. Noun inflection and particularly verb inflection indicate grammatical information through the use of prefixes and suffixes that <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> word stems.|$|E
5|$|Person {{and number}} are {{indicated}} by suffixing the oblique {{case of the}} relevant pronoun. The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from grammatical particles, which <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the stem.|$|E

5|$|The carbon–fluorine bond, a {{component}} of all organofluorine compounds, is the strongest chemical bond in organic chemistry. Furthermore, this bond becomes shorter and stronger as more fluorine atoms <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the same carbon on a given molecule. Because of this, fluoroalkanes {{are some of the}} most chemically stable organic compounds.|$|E

5|$|USB 3.0 and USB 1.0 Type-A plugs and {{receptacles}} {{are designed}} to interoperate. In order to achieve USB3.0's SuperSpeed (and SuperSpeed+ for USB3.1Gen2), 5 extra pins <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the unused area of the original 4 pin USB1.0 design, making USB3.0 Type-A plugs and receptacles backward compatible to those of USB1.0.|$|E
5|$|A mercury–thallium alloy, {{which forms}} a {{eutectic}} at 8.5% thallium, {{is reported to}} freeze at−60°C, some 20°C below the freezing point of mercury. This alloy is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> gold plating baths {{to increase the speed}} of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.|$|E
5|$|A {{player can}} access a Premium Show either through playing {{specific}} songs {{already in the}} GHTV catalog or through microtransactions. Completing Premium Shows can earn the player in-game rewards such as a decorative item for their player card or on-screen fretboard. The week after their introduction, these songs <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the on-demand playlist, and after another week enter into the GHTVs rotation of songs.

5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> aqueous HCl, they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
5|$|Chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) is a {{magnetic}} compound. Its ideal shape anisotropy, which imparts high coercivity and remnant magnetization, {{made it a}} compound superior to the γ-Fe2O3. Chromium(IV) oxide is used to manufacture magnetic tape used in high-performance audio tape and standard audio cassettes. Chromates can prevent corrosion of steel under wet conditions, and therefore chromates <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> drilling muds.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat.
