500|$|The Times {{newspaper}} {{gave the}} film a generally favourable assessment: its critic wrote, [...] "Mr. Val Guest, the director, certainly knows his business {{when it comes}} to providing the more horrid brand of thrills... The first part of this particular film is well up to standard. Mr. Brian Donlevy, as the American scientist responsible for the experiment, is a little brusque in his treatment of British institutions but he is clearly <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> what he is doing. Mr. Jack Warner, representing Scotland Yard, is indeed a comfort to have at hand when Things are on the rampage." [...] Positive reviews also came from Peter Burnup in the News of the World, who found that [...] "with the added benefit of bluff, boisterous Brian Donlevy… all earnest addicts of science fiction will undoubtedly love every minute of it" [...] while the reviewer in The Manchester Guardian praised [...] "a narrative style that quite neatly combines the horrific and the factual" [...] and Today's Cinema called it [...] "one of the best essays in science fiction to date" [...] Film historian Bruce G. Hallenbeck notes a degree of national pride in some of the positive reviews. For instance, Paul Dehn in the News Chronicle said, [...] "This is the best and nastiest horror film I have seen since the War. How jolly that it is also British!". Similarly, William Whitebait in the New Statesman, who found the film to be [...] "better than either War of the Worlds or Them!", also called for [...] "a couple of cheers for the reassurance that British films can still, once in a while, come quick".|$|E
500|$|Spin {{positioned}} it {{at number}} 46 {{on their list}} of the best 50 albums of 2013. They said, [...] "Push is in fighting form, incorporating a mature {{point of view on}} his drug-dealer past while rapping with the confidence of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> the game is his to lose." [...] NME positioned it at number 48 on their list of the 50 best albums of year. They said, My Name Is My Name was the moment Clipse member Pusha T finally hit the home run he promised for so long. The beats snapped hard, the guests including Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross and 2 Chainz glittered and the overall vibe was dirty but triumphant." [...] Paste ranked it number 34 on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013 saying, [...] "each bar has the ferociousness of a lion smelling the scent of fresh blood. Among his contemporaries, Pusha T is the sharp-witted wordsmith who makes you feel like you’re listening to a master at work, devilishly cooking up something as pure and addictive as he possibly can." [...] It was named the third best hip hop album of 2013 by PopMatters. They commented saying, [...] "My Name Is My Name is easily one of the most impressive displays of lyricism of the year and contains some of 2013's best verses, as Pusha shows off his versatility..... The production is minimalistic and intelligently doesn't overshadow Pusha's performance. The beats are big and full of bass, giving life to the album and forming a unique theme, with a reunion with Pharrell triggering a nice blast of nostalgia..... My Name Is My Name has substance, style, and passion, and no doubt is an album that will still be appreciated a decade from now. [...] " [...] Consequence of Sound positioned it at number 44 on their list of the 50 best albums of the year.|$|E

Smooth, calm, confident, it builds suspense instead of depending on shock and action." [...] Co-star Ewan McGregor agrees, saying about Polanski that [...] "he's a legend... I've never examined a director and the way that they work, so much before. He's brilliant, just brilliant, and absolutely warrants his reputation as a great director." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1896, Morse {{took over}} as Princeton's regular {{football}} coach. [...] He had served a coaching function {{as far back as}} 1891, when The New York Times described his role as follows: [...] "Frank Morse, '95, coached the players in today's practice and found many points in the play to criticize." [...] The World of New York in 1896 said of Morse:"Coach Morse is a very wise young man. [...] In the first place he was perhaps the greatest half-back that Princeton ever turned out. [...] He was a star in the team of '93 which is known as the 'perfect team.' [...] This is his first year as a regular coach, and he is said {{to be one of the}} best that the New Jersey university has had."Coach Morse impressed reporters before his first Princeton-Yale game by asserting that his players were in fine physical condition [...] "after months of scientific training":"It is really refreshing to hear <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> his player perfectly say, on the eve of the great game of the year, that his men are in perfect fettle. [...] Moreover, he says frankly that the team is one of the best that Princeton has ever had, which is another violation of precedent." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Kevin D. Williamson, {{reviewing}} The Thomas Sowell Reader for Commentary, said [...] "If a mad scientist were {{to repair}} to his laboratory {{to design a}} machine that would make white liberals uncomfortable, that machine would be Thomas Sowell, whose input is data and whose output is socioeconomic criticism in several grades, ranging from bemused observation to thorough debunking to high-test scorn—all of which are represented in The Thomas Sowell Reader". Williamson says [...] "Thomas Sowell is that rarest of things among serious academics: plainspoken... His plain speaking also makes him dangerous, and that danger is intensified {{by the fact that}} Sowell is black. And not just black, but unassailably black: He's Southern-born, Harlem-raised, brought up poor, and the first of his family to be educated beyond the sixth grade... Because he is black, his opinions about race are controversial. If he were white, they probably would be unpublishable. This is a rare case in which we are all beneficiaries of American racial hypocrisy. That he works in the special bubble of permissiveness extended by the liberal establishment to some conservatives who are black (in exchange for their being regarded as inauthentic, self-loathing, soulless race traitors) must be maddening to Sowell, even more so than it is for other notable black conservatives. It is plain that the core of his identity, his heart of hearts, is not that of a man who is black. It is that of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> a whole lot more about things than you do and is intent on setting you straight, at length if necessary, if you'd only listen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Commission invited Clark to {{give the}} 1976 Boyer Lectures, a series of lectures which were {{broadcast}} and later published as A Discovery of Australia. The Boyer lectures allowed Clark to describe many of the core ideas of his published work and indeed his own life in characteristic style. [...] "Everything a historian writes," [...] he stated for example, [...] "should be a celebration of life, a hymn of praise to life. It should come up from inside <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> all about that horror of the darkness when a man returns to the dust from whence he came, {{a man who has}} looked into the heart of that great darkness, but has both a tenderness for everyone, and yet, paradoxically, a melancholy, a sadness, and a compassion because what matters most in life is never likely to happen". Clark's next work, In Search of Henry Lawson (1979), was a reworking of an essay which was originally written in 1964 as a chapter for Geoffrey Dutton's pioneering The Literature of Australia. It was worked up in some haste in response to the desire of the Macmillan publishing house for a new book with which they could cash in on Clark's popularity. Predictably, and with more than usual justification, Clark saw Lawson as another of his tragic heroes, and he wrote with a good deal of empathy of Lawson's losing battle with alcoholism: a fate Clark himself had narrowly avoided by giving up drink in the 1960s. But the book showed both its age and its haste of preparation, and was savaged by Professor Colin Roderick, the leading authority on Lawson, as [...] "a tangled thicket of factual errors, speculation and ideological interpretation".|$|E
