40|$|Stream depletion, {{which is}} the {{reduction}} in flow rate of a stream or river due to the extraction of groundwater in a hydraulically connected stream-aquifer system, is often estimated using numerical models. The accuracy of these models depends on the appropriate parameterization <b>of</b> aquifer and <b>streambed</b> hydraulic properties. Streambed conductance is a parameter that relates the head difference between the stream and aquifer to flow across the stream channel. It is a function <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> hydraulic conductivity and streambed geometry. In natural systems, streambed conductance varies spatially throughout the streambed; however, stream depletion modeling studies often ignore this variability. In this work, we use numerical simulations to demonstrate that stream depletion estimates are sensitive to a range <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> conductance values depending on aquifer properties. We compare the stream depletion estimates from various spatial patterns <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> conductance to show that modeling streambed conductance as a homogeneous property can lead to errors in stream depletion estimates. We use the results to identify feasible locations for proposed pumping wells such that the stream depletion due to pumping from a well within this feasible region would not exceed a prescribed threshold value, and we show that incorrect assumptions of the magnitude and spatial variability <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> conductance can affect {{the size and shape}} of the feasible region...|$|R

Models of E. coli release and transport commonly use a single {{set of parameters}} for the whole stream or reservoir, yet {{little is known about}} the magnitude and sources of the variability of parameters <b>of</b> the <b>streambed</b> bacteria release. The objectives of this work were: (a) to obtain and compare parameters <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> E. coli resuspension in three stream reaches with distinctly different bottom sediment textures, and (b) to see whether the modeling <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> E. coli resuspension with reach-specific parameters could provide substantially better accuracy than modeling with a single set of parameters. Sediment particle size distributions and the streambed E. coli concentrations were measured along a first-order creek in the USDA-ARS OPE 3 experimental watershed in Maryland. Afterwards, 80 m 3 of water were released into the creek at a rate of 60 L per second in four equal allotments separated by 1 &# 8211; 3 min intervals. Flow rates and E. coli concentrations were monitored with automated samplers at the ends of the three reaches with a total length of 630 m. A high concentration <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> E. coli (“hotspot”) resuspended within the first reach caused a pulse of high E. coli concentrations that propagated along the creek without substantial attenuation; inputs of sediment-borne E. coli from the next two reaches were relatively small. The E. coli transport model included one-dimensional Saint&# 8211;Venant and advective&# 8211;dispersive equations. The calibrated roughness coefficient values were comparable for the three reaches, whereas the critical stress and the entrainment rate differed among reaches by a half order and an order of magnitude, respectively. Overall, better accuracy was observed when the model contained reach-specific parameters.

Furthermore, the combined streambed Kv values upstream of the first confluence between the Platte River and the Loup River was normally distributed, which may be due to the lack of tributaries in-between and thus streambed sediments were well distributed in this reach and belonged to a single population of hydraulic conductivity values.

40|$|Management {{of water}} {{resources}} in alluvial aquifers relies mainly on understanding interactions between hydraulically connected streams and aquifers. Numerical models that simulate this interaction often are used as decision support tools in water resource management. However, the accuracy of numerical predictions relies heavily on the unknown system parameters (i. e. stream bed conductivity and aquifer hydraulic conductivity) which are spatially heterogeneous and difficult to measure directly. This paper employs an Ensemble Smoother to invert groundwater level measurements to jointly estimate spatially-varying streambed and alluvial aquifer hydraulic conductivity along a 35. 6 km segment of the South Platte River in northeastern Colorado. The accuracy of the inversion procedure is evaluated using a synthetic experiment and historical groundwater level measurements, with the latter constituting the novelty of this study in the inversion and validation of high resolution fields <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> and aquifer conductivities. Results show that the estimated streambed conductivity field and aquifer conductivity field produce an acceptable agreement between observed and simulated groundwater levels and stream flow rates. The estimated parameter fields are also used to simulate the spatially varying flow exchange between the alluvial aquifer and the stream, which exhibit high spatial variability along the river reach with a maximum average monthly aquifer gain of about 2. 3 m 3 /day and a maximum average monthly aquifer loss of 2. 8 m 3 /day, per unit area <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> (m 2).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Streambed {{hydraulic}} conductivity {{is a key}} parameter in the modeling of stream-aquifer interactions. This paper presents hydraulic conductivities <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> measured in three rivers in south-central Nebraska. Unlike traditional permeameter tests in streambeds that measure only the vertical {{hydraulic conductivity}} (K,.), the permeameter methods {{used in this study}} can measure the streambed conductivity in vertical, horizontal, and oblique directions. As a result, the anisotropy of channel sediments can be determined from <b>streambed</b> tests <b>of</b> similar sediment volume. Sandy streambeds with occasional silt/clay layers exist in the Republican and Platte rivers. The K, values are often from about 30 to 40 &day for the sandy streambed and about 1. 5 for the silt/clay layers. The K, value <b>of</b> the sandy <b>streambed</b> can vary between two locations only several meters apart in a transect, between two transects in short distances apart. and between two rivers or channels.

Nonetheless, grain-size {{methods are}} often {{preferred}} by researchers {{due to the}} low cost and less reliance on the hydraulic and geometry boundaries <b>of</b> the <b>streambed,</b> the qualities that significantly distinguish them from other methods (Alyamani and Sen 1993). Since the information regarding the characteristic properties of sediments is more attainable, sediments from grain-size distribution were estimated for hydraulic conductivity which is commonly favoured by researchers. Furthermore, streambed K is anisotropic which is well known (Chen 2000; Landon et al. 2001). The vertical hydraulic conductivity (Kv) and horizontal hydraulic conductivity (Kh) can also be measured using appropriate tests (Chen 2000; Landon et al. 2001). Nonetheless, the setback in conducting the investigation is that the original sediment structure <b>of</b> the <b>streambed</b> is inevitably destroyed during sediment sampling. It is unfortunate that the grain-size analysis methods provide neither K horizontal (Kh) nor K vertical (Kv), and they also preclude any evaluation of anisotropy and/or differences in directional K (Chen, 2000). Therefore, the values <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> K determined from grain-size analysis {{are bound to be}} significantly distinctive from either Kh or Kv values obtained from the use of other methods, such as permeability tests. To solve this, a number of researchers prioritised the measurement <b>of</b> Kv <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> rather than Kv of riverbank. In this paper, the combination of Kv of riverbank and Kv from streambeds was employed to obtain the hydraulic conductivity of sediments derived from grain-size distribution. The focus of this paper is centred mainly on the distribution pattern of Kv on the riverbank and streambed. As to reach the objectives, riverbank and streambed permeability tests and grain-size analyses were managed in the hyporheic zone of the Muda River with depth. The aim {{of this study was to}} (1) investigate the unevenness in vertical hydraulic conductivity <b>of</b> riverbank and <b>streambed</b> (K) with depth at small scale, (2) to analyse the empirical methods used individually in estimating the hydraulic conductivity (Kg) from riverbank and streambed sediments (Kgs) and differentiating the estimated values with measured values from pumping test (Kp) and permeability test (Kpt) and (3) to study the correlation between the distribution of sediment grain size and vertical hydraulic conductivity of the riverside alluvium in the Lower Muda River Basin RBF area located near to the Muda River.|$|R

We unravel the physical conditions for which the commonly used homogenous field assumption is applicable for quantifying hyporheic processes thus explaining why predictive measures based on a characteristic residence time, like the Damköhler number, are robust in heterogeneous sand bedded streams...|$|R

The flow domain, which varies in time, is bounded above by a free surface and is bounded below by an erodable streambed. An initial flow and streambed configuration are given and we would like to determine the streambed evolution. Our basic approach to modeling this process is to combine the interaction of a viscous flow with boundary constraints which represent an erodable streambed. Flow over a bed of sand causes the bed to undergo a distinct evolution. At slow flows, the bed remains flat. With increasing flow velocity, the bed passes through a set of stages: smooth, ripples, dunes, flat with chaotic flow, waves and finally antidunes. One of our main purposes is to obtain a model which has the potential of addressing this evolutionary process. We obtain a model which exhibits the general nature <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> erosion.

40|$|Streambed {{sedimentary}} structure plays {{a vital role}} in controlling the interactions between surface water and groundwater. In the study, three rivers -the Big Blue River, the Little Blue River, and the lower reach of the Platte River in Nebraska were chosen to characterize the shallow streambed for the two types of rivers (braided and meandering rivers) and investigated the variations <b>of</b> the <b>streambed</b> electrical and hydraulic conductivities with depth. In-situ and laboratory permeameter tests were conducted to determine streambed hydraulic conductivity up to 20 m below the channel surface in the three rivers. Additionally, the electrical conductivity logs were obtained using Geoprobe direct-push technique to characterize the hydrostratigraphy <b>of</b> <b>streambed</b> sediments. ^ Although the tributaries of the Big Blue River have low-permeability sediments lining beneath the stream bottom which generate smaller Kv values, the Kv values in the top 1 -m <b>of</b> the <b>streambed</b> sediments are usually greater than 5 m/d in the three rivers, indicating very permeable streambeds. Therefore, shallow streambeds are permeable over the gaining reaches of braided and meandering rivers despite their differences on the watershed size, channel width, topographic reliefs, etc. In addition, the Big and Little Blue Rivers have more fine-grained sediments deposited in the deep streambed than the Platte River. Furthermore, streambed Kv values in the three rivers exhibit a tendency to decrease with depth in the depth of 0 to 6 m below the channel surface. ^ The constant head boundary is proposed to be an alternative solution in the simulation of stream-aquifer interactions. This approach is applied in a regional groundwater flow model to evaluate the impact of groundwater irrigation on the streamflow in the lower reach of the Platte River.

It provides necessities for fish and microinvertebrate including shelter, food, and breeding spots. Therefore, it {{is an essential part}} of aquatic animal habitats and often seen as an index of stream health. There is no generally accepted method to quantify streambed physical components and depending upon state and organization a variety of methods are used. The procedure provided in the rapid bioassessment protocol (RBP) (Kaufmann et al., 1999; Sylte and Fischenich, 2002) is probably the most widely used method to assess the effect of various land use activates on stream habitat for management purposes in the United States. The RBP method was not intended as a procedure to assess streambed habitat; although it is often used for this purpose. This approach reduces the streambed physical components into the two variables: embeddedness and epifaunal substrate. Definitions and sampling procedure of these variables are vague and subjective. Streambed components with varying characteristics are grouped under the same category and some streambed components as important as gravel are not included in the categorizing <b>of</b> the <b>streambed</b> habitat. A measurement method that combines a photographic technique and grid sampling was developed to assess streambed components in a direct and simple way at the required level of accuracy. The portable photographic box (PPB) device utilizes a photographic technique to record images <b>of</b> physical <b>streambed</b> components under typical base flow of wadeable gravel-bed streams.

In addition, measurement of the dissolved oxygen and temperature in ten riffles indicated that temperature in the first layer of subsurface was similar to those measured in the water column. No evidence was found to support substrate measurement of temperature. However, the dissolved oxygen concentration varied significantly for embedded and free patches.
