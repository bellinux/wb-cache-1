5|$|The Mahabharata {{tells the}} story of Manasa's marriage. Sage Jagatkāru practised severe austerities and had decided to abstain from marriage. Once he came across a group of men hanging from a tree upside down. These men were his ancestors, who were doomed to misery as their {{children}} had not performed their last rites. So they advised Jagatkāru to marry and have <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>who</b> could free them of those miseries by performing the ceremonies. Vasuki offered his sister Manasa's hand to Jagatkāru. Manasa gave birth to a son, Astīka, who freed his ancestors.

5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>who</b> inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
5|$|Chinese kinship {{relations}} {{during the}} Han {{were influenced by}} Confucian mores and involved both immediate nuclear family and extended family members. The Chinese family was patrilineal, since a father's sons did not consider a mother's kin {{to be part of}} their clan; instead, they were considered 'outside relatives'. The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) law that any family with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes. This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period (220–265 CE). The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members, which was unlike the large extended families under one household in later dynasties. It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally, yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>who</b> moved away and lived separately from his living parents would be considered a criminal. Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other's families. However, a household with three generations living under its roof was incredibly rare. This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty (265–420), when having three or more generations under one roof was commonplace.|$|E
