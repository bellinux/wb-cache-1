5|$|<b>A</b> <b>stay-at-home</b> dad (alternatively, {{stay at home}} father, house dad, SAHD, househusband, or house-spouse) is {{a father}} who is the main {{caregiver}} {{of the children and}} is the homemaker of the household. As families have evolved, the practice of being <b>a</b> <b>stay-at-home</b> dad has become more common, and socially more acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the country}} or region, <b>a</b> <b>stay-at-home</b> dad might find more or less social support for his decision.

5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with <b>a</b> <b>stay-at-home</b> dad and households with <b>a</b> <b>stay-at-home</b> mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with <b>a</b> <b>stay-at-home</b> dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E
