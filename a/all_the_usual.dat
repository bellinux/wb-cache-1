25|$|The Africanis needs neither pampering nor special food. One view {{holds that}} it is {{consistently}} healthy and has over the years developed a natural resistance against internal and external parasites, although they do appear to be very susceptible to introduced diseases such as distemper and parvo virus, and to tick-borne biliary. Others suffer from cancer. Rabies is very prevalent among the indigenous dog populations of southern Africa.

25|$|Viruses are obligate {{intracellular}} parasites, {{characterized by}} extremely limited biological function, {{to the point}} where, while they are evidently able to infect all other organisms from bacteria and archaea to animals, plants and fungi, {{it is unclear whether}} they can themselves be described as living. Viruses consist of a strip of genetic material (DNA or RNA), covered in a protein coat and sometimes a lipid envelope. They thus lack <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> machinery of the cell such as enzymes, relying entirely on the host cell's ability to replicate DNA and synthesise proteins. Most viruses are bacteriophages, infecting bacteria, and it is possible that viruses are both extremely ancient, being at least as old as the first cells, and polyphyletic, having evolved from several entirely unrelated ancestors.|$|E

Having arrived at the destination, Amphitrites heavy guns proved effective against shore defences, but the heat within the ship was so oppressive during the 2 hour bombardment that the crew found it almost impossible to continue manning their posts, and one of the gunners actually died of heat exhaustion.|$|E
25|$|In appeals {{cases the}} Supreme Court {{generally}} had three remedies available: direct appeal from a decree {{of a lower}} court (comparable to a writ of Certiorari), and judicial review of an entire case (comparable to a petition for a writ of Mandamus), both in cases decided by the judiciary, and by an arbiter.

[...] Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it [...] "feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails". She said that Marshall [...] "swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism" [...] and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances. Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall [...] "shows terrific flair with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she [...] "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" [...] and had [...] "lively sexual tension" [...] with Depp. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from [...] "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a [...] "fresh villain" [...] whose [...] "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere". Variety's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. [...] "It has nary an original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should".

500|$|Tenebrae {{has come}} to be {{considered}} one of Argento's best films by many fans and critics, with some calling it his last great film. AllMovie refers to the film as [...] "one of Dario Argento's best thrillers". In her 1994 book on the director, Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento, Maitland McDonagh maintains that Tenebrae is [...] "in many respects... the finest film that Argento has ever made." [...] Richard Dyer, writing for the Directory of World Cinema: Italy, describes the film as a [...] "tease", one which is [...] "perhaps the apotheosis of one of the core pleasures of detective fiction: being outwitted, wrong-footed, led up the garden path". Dyer believes that the degree of lighting used in the film is unsurpassed. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine said that Tenebrae [...] "is a riveting defense of auteur theory, ripe with self-reflexive discourse and various moral conflicts. It's both a riveting horror film and an architect's worst nightmare." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club noted [...] "...Argento makes some points about the intersection of art, reality, and personality, but the director's stunning trademark setpieces, presented here in a fully restored version, provide the real reason to watch." [...] Almar Haflidason, in a review for BBC Online, opined, [...] "Sadistically beautiful and viciously exciting, welcome to true terror with Dario Argento's shockingly relentless Tenebrae." [...] Tim Lucas in Video Watchdog said, [...] "Though it is in some ways as artificial and deliberate as a De Palma thriller, Tenebrae contains more likeable characters, believable relationships, and more emphasis on the erotic than can be found in any other Argento film." [...] Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict wrote, [...] "Tenebre is a straight-up giallo in the old-school tradition. It may have been filmed in 1982, but it comes straight out of the '70s tradition. We've got <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> suspects, including a writer for a main character, lots of killer-cam point of view, some crazily over the top kills, and approximately seventy-two twists before all is revealed...
