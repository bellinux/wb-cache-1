40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that {{seismology}} has provided the most detailed information concerning the structure and state of the earth's interior. Beginning in 1969, seismometers were landed on the moon by the Apollo missions, providing the first opportunity to attempt similar studies on another planetary body. In September 1977 the operation of these instruments was terminated. A description is presented of the internal structure of the moon, as determined from the obtained lunar seismic data. The analysis of the lunar data is approached in a systematic fashion, using appropriate techniques to minimize the number of necessary assumptions, extract {{the maximum amount of}} structural information, and determine its reliability. The completed lunar seismic network consists of four stations located at the landing sites of Apollo missions 12, 14, 15, and 16.

40|$|The {{installation}} of seismometers on the Moon s surface during the Apollo era provided {{a wealth of}} information that transformed our understanding of lunar formation and evolution. Seismic events detected by the nearside network were used to constrain the structure of the Moon s crust and mantle down to a depth of about 1000 km. The presence of an <b>attenuating</b> <b>region</b> in the deepest interior has been inferred from the paucity of farside events, as well as other indirect geophysical measurements. Recent re-analyses of the Apollo data have tentatively identified this region as a lunar core, although its properties are not yet constrained. Here we present new modeling in support of seismic missions that plan to build upon the knowledge of the Moon s interior gathered by Apollo. We have devised a method in which individual events can be linked to a known cluster using the observed S-P arrival time differences and azimuth to only two stations. Events can be further identified using each cluster's unique occurrence time signatur...|$|E
40|$|Attenuation {{by heavy}} rain {{is a major}} {{operational}} problem in radar estimation of rainfall rates, and one which is increasingly severe at wavelengths shorter than 10 cm. Gate-by-gate correction algorithms, including those using both reflectivity (Z H) and differential reflectivity (Z D R), are inherently unstable. In addition values of ZH and ZDK arc affected by hail, which causes little attenuation. Methods dependent upon differential phase shift (KDP) do not give unique solutions but depend upon raindrop size distributions. A new technique which uses both KDP and differential attenuation between the horizontally and vertically polarized radiation (AH-v) is proposed. The total AH [...] " is measured from the negative ZL) R in light precipitation behind the <b>attenuating</b> <b>region.</b> Theory and observation show that corrections based on the K L) ~ - AH-v scheme should he unaffected by hail, stable and accurate. A simpler algorithm may be feasible at C-band in which the total attenuation {{is derived from the}} observed total differential attenuation.

Accordingly, the attenuation would be appreciably reduced if operational radars used vertical polarization rather than the commonly employed horizontal polarization...|$|E

40|$|In whole-body PET, it is {{not unusual}} to shorten the study time by omitting the {{transmission}} scan and to ignore attenuation during reconstruction. If a transmission scan is available, many centers reconstruct the images with, but also without, attenuation correction. Although ignoring attenuation leads to an artifact in the reconstructed images, these images still provide valuable diagnostic information in oncologic applications. Several authors have reported that the attenuation artifact may actually increase the tumor-to-background ratio. In this study, we analyzed the causes of the artifact and proposed a new algorithm to reduce the adverse effects on visual image quality. METHODS: We analyzed the causes of the attenuation artifact mathematically and numerically, and we examined its effect on tumor-to-background ratio and on signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we showed that the attenuation artifact may lead to loss of image detail in conventional maximum-likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction. A new maximum-likelihood algorithm allowing negative reconstruction values (NEG-ML) was derived to reduce this loss. RESULTS: The attenuation artifact consists of 2 components. The first component is the well-known scaling effect: The apparent activity is reduced because attenuation decreases the fraction of detected photons. The second component is a relatively smooth negative contribution that is added to <b>attenuated</b> <b>regions</b> surrounded by activity. The second component tends to increase the tumor-to-background ratio. However, a simulation experiment shows that this increase in signal may be entirely offset by an increase in noise. The negative contribution can interfere with the nonnegativity constraint of the MLEM algorithm, leading to loss of image detail in regions of high attenuation. The new NEG-ML algorithm avoids the problem by allowing negative pixel values. The algorithm is similar to MLEM in the suppression of the streak artifact but provides more anatomic information. In our department, it is in routine clinical use for reconstruction of PET whole-body images without attenuation correction. CONCLUSION: Ignoring attenuation may increase the tumor-to-background ratio, but this increase does not imply improved tumor detection. The NEG-ML algorithm reduces the adverse effect of the attenuation artifact on visual image quality. status: publishe...|$|R

It is not clear, however, how best to combine spectral masking with the non-linear processing necessary to compute automatic speech recognition features. We propose an analysis-by-synthesis approach to automatic speech recog-nition, which, given a spectral mask, poses the estimation of mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) of the clean speech as an optimization problem. MFCCs are found that minimize {{a combination of the}} distance from the resynthesized clean power spectrum to the regions of the noisy spectrum selected by the mask and the negative log likelihood under an unmodified large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer.

40|$|Proceeding: 2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC), Orlando, Florida, 25 - 31 October 2009 This work {{presents}} {{an approach to}} extend the dynamic range of X ray flat panel detectors for cone beam micro CT by using two different acquisitions of the same sample, taken at two different X ray photon fluxes with the same X ray beam peak energy and filtration. Photon flux for the first scan is chosen as the maximum possible value not saturating the detector in the low attenuation areas. The second exposure level is calculated from the data acquired in the first exposure, assuming that the detector response to the incoming radiation is linear. To combine both datasets, we model the response of a detector pixel, {{as well as the}} overall gain of the detector. Each pixel of each dataset is weighted according to its value. Pixels whose value lies within the high gain region of the detector receive the higher weights. The weighted Joint Probability Density Function (JPDF) is obtained by assuming that each dataset follows an independent Gaussian distribution. The final pixel value is calculated by means of a maximum likelihood estimation performed on the JPDF. The algorithm has been tested imaging two different phantoms on a small animal cone beam CT. We have performed comparative experiments using the proposed dual exposure technique and a regular single exposure acquisition, following a fully automated procedure. In both cases the dose delivered to the sample was the same. Image quality was assessed from the image noise level and the presence of artifacts on the reconstructed slices, at different dose levels. The dual exposure data show higher signal to noise ratio. Also, image artifacts are noticeably reduced in the dual exposure dataset. Since the proposed technique enhance the quality of the data extending the dynamic range of the detector without increasing the delivered dose, it is particularly suitable to image samples which contain both low and high <b>attenuating</b> <b>regions.</b> Furthermore, the extension of the technique to use more than two exposure levels is straightforward.

40|$|An edited {{version of}} this paper was {{published}} by Blackwell Publishing. Copyright 2000, Blackwell Publishing. See also: [URL] [URL] used over 1000 regional waveforms recorded by 60 seismic stations located in northwest Africa and Iberia to map the efficiency of L g and Sn wave propagation beneath the Gulf of Cadiz, Alboran Sea and bounding Betic, Rif and Atlas mountain belts. Crustal attenuation is inferred from the tomographic inversion of L g/Pg amplitude ratios. Upper mantle attenuation is inferred from maps of Sn propagation efficiency derived by inversion of well-defined qualitative efficiency assignments based on waveform characteristics. Regions of L g attenuation correlate well with areas of thinned continental or oceanic crust, significant sedimentary basins, and lateral crustal variations. Comparison of the Sn efficiency results with velocities obtained from an anisotropic Pn traveltime inversion shows a fairly good correlation between regions of poor Sn efficiency and low Pn velocity. A low Pn velocity (7. 6 ? 7. 8 km s- 1) and significant Sn attenuation in the uppermost mantle is imaged beneath the Betics in southern Spain, {{in sharp contrast to the}} relatively normal Pn velocity (8. 0 ? 8. 1 km s- 1) and efficient Sn imaged beneath the Alboran Sea. Slow Pn velocity anomalies are also imaged beneath the Rif and Middle Atlas in Morocco. We do not identify any conclusive evidence of lithospheric-scale upper mantle attenuation beneath the Rif, although the crust in the Gibraltar <b>region</b> appears highly <b>attenuating,</b> making observations at stations in this region ambiguous. Paths crossing the Gulf of Cadiz, eastern Atlantic and the Moroccan and Iberian mesetas show very efficient Sn propagation and are imaged with high Pn velocities (8. 1 ? 8. 2 km s- 1). The spatial distribution of attenuation and velocity anomalies lead us to conclude that some recovery of the mantle lid beneath the Alboran Sea must have occurred since the early Miocene episode of extension and volcanism. We interpret the low velocity and <b>attenuating</b> <b>regions</b> beneath the Betics and possibly the Rif as indicating the presence of partial melt in the uppermost mantle which may be underlain by faster less attenuating mantle. In the light of observations from other geophysical and geological studies, the presence of melt at the base of the Betic crust may be an indication that delamination of continental lithosphere has played a role in the Neogene evolution of the Alboran Sea region...|$|R
40|$|The gammacoronavirus, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), is a {{respiratory}} pathogen of chickens. IBV is {{a constant}} threat to poultry production as established vaccines are often ineffective against emerging strains. This requires constant and rapid vaccine production by a process of viral attenuation by egg passage, but the essential forces leading to attenuation in the virus {{have not yet been}} characterised. Knowledge of these factors will lead to the development of more effective, rationally attenuated, live vaccines and reduction of the mortality and morbidity caused by this pathogen. M 41 CK strain was egg passaged four times many years ago at Houghton Poultry Research Station and stored as M 41 -CK EP 4 (stock virus at The Pirbright Institute since 1992). It was the first egg passage to have its genome pyrosequenced and was therefore used as the baseline reference. The overall aim of this project was to analyse deep sequence data obtained from four IBV isolates (called A, A 1, C and D) each originating from the common M 41 -CK EP 4 (ep 4) and independently passaged multiple times in embryonated chicken eggs (figure 1. 1). Highly polymorphic encoding regions of the IBV genome were then identified which are likely involved in the attenuation process through the formation of independent SNPs and/or SNP clusters. This was then used to direct targeted investigation of SNPs during the attenuation process of the four IBV passages. A previously generated deep sequence dataset was used as a preliminary map of attenuation for one virulent strain of IBV. This investigation showed the nucleocapsid and spike as two highly polymorphic encoding regions within the IBV genome with the highest proportion of SNPs compared to encoding region size. This analysis then led to more focussed studies of the nucleocapsid and spike encoding region with the ultimate aim of mapping key <b>attenuating</b> <b>regions</b> and nucleotide positions. The 454 pyrosequencing data and further investigation of nucleocapsid and spike encoding regions have identified the SNPs present at the same nucleotide positions within analysed A, A 1, C and D isolates. These SNPs probably {{play a crucial role in}} viral attenuation and universal vaccine production but it is not clear if independent SNPs are also involved in loss of virulence.

Lineages distributed across wide aridity gradients provide opportunities to examine the timing, frequency, and direction of transitions between arid and mesic regions.

Our data support a minimum of seven genetically distinct and morphologically diagnosable taxa; we thus redefine the type species, ressurrect three names from synonymy, and describe three new species. Our inferred phylogeny suggests the history and diversification of lineages in the AAZ and AMT are intimately linked, with evidence of multiple independent interchanges since the late Miocene.

Here we used a repetition priming {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} paradigm that directly contrasted the effects of stimulus and decision changes to identify the underlying brain systems. Direct repetition of stimulus features caused marked reductions in posterior regions of the inferior temporal lobe that were insensitive to whether the decision was held constant or changed between study and test. By contrast, prefrontal cortex showed repetition effects that were sensitive to the exact stimulus-to-decision mapping. Analysis of resting-state functional connectivity revealed that the dissociated repetition effects are embedded within distinct brain systems. Regions that were sensitive to changes in the stimulus correlated with perceptual cortices, whereas the decision changes <b>attenuated</b> activity in <b>regions</b> correlated with middle-temporal regions and a frontoparietal control system.

NGC 7331 's morphology at 8 - 850 μm {{is dominated by}} a central dust ring. This structure is a vigorous site of star formation (hosting one-third of the present activity) but remains inconspicuous in our GALEX UV imagery. Radial profile analysis and photometry for discrete UV- and UV+IR-selected substructures indicate a decline in UV extinction with increasing galactocentric distance, although highly <b>attenuated</b> star-forming <b>regions</b> can be found throughout the disk. UV-optical surface brightness profiles suggest a recent birthrate parameter (b_ 8) that is highest in the outer part of the disk, even though the local star formation intensity peaks in the ring.

We explored abnormal {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) resting-state dynamics, functional connectivity, and weighted functional networks, in a sample of patients with severe AD (N = 18) and age-matched healthy volunteers (N = 21). We found that patients had reduced amplitude and regional homogeneity of low-frequency fMRI oscillations, and reduced the strength of functional connectivity, in several regions previously described as components of the default mode network, for example, medial posterior parietal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. In patients with severe AD, functional connectivity was particularly <b>attenuated</b> between <b>regions</b> that were separated by a greater physical distance; and loss of long distance connectivity was associated with less efficient global and nodal network topology. This profile of functional abnormality in severe AD was consistent with the results of a comparable analysis of data on 2 additional groups of patients with mild AD (N = 17) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 18). A greater degree of cognitive impairment, measured by the mini-mental state examination across all patient groups, was correlated with greater attenuation of functional connectivity, particularly over long connection distances, for example, between anterior and posterior components of the default mode network, and greater reduction of global and nodal network efficiency. These results indicate that neurodegenerative disruption of fMRI oscillations and connectivity in AD affects long-distance connections to hub nodes, with the consequent loss of network efficiency. This profile was evident also to a lesser degree in the patients with less severe cognitive impairment, indicating that the potential of resting-state fMRI measures as biomarkers or predictors of disease progression in AD...|$|R

Therefore, employing peptides corresponding to regions in the cytosolic domain of the EGF receptor, we have investigated the ability of sequences within the EGF receptor to activate Gs. A 13 -aa peptide (EGFR- 13) corresponding to the juxtamembrane region in the cytosolic domain of the EGF receptor stimulated GTP binding and GTPase activity of Gs. This peptide did not stimulate GTP binding to Gi but increased the GTPase activity of this protein. Additionally, phosphorylation of the protein kinase C site (threonine residue) within EGFR- 13 decreased {{the ability of the}} peptide to stimulate Gs and increase GTPase activity of Gi. Further, in functional assays of Gs employing S 49 cyc- cell membranes, EGFR- 13 increased the ability of Gs to stimulate adenylyl cyclase; phospho-EGFR- 13 and a 14 -aa peptide corresponding to a sequence in the cytosolic domain of the EGF receptor did not alter the functional activity of Gs. Hence, the juxtamembrane region of the EGF receptor can activate Gs and, by stimulating GTPase activity of Gi, inactivates this latter G protein. Phosphorylation of the threonine residue within this <b>region</b> <b>attenuates</b> the activity of the peptide as a modulator of G-protein function...|$|R
40|$|The dorsomedial {{hypothalamus}} (DMH) {{is critically}} {{implicated in the}} cardiovascular response to emotional stress. This study aimed {{to determine whether the}} DMH is also important in cardiovascular arousal associated with appetitive feeding behavior and, if so, whether locally released angiotensin II and glutamate are important in this arousal. Emotional (air-jet) stress and feeding elicited similar tachycardic (+ 51 beats/min and + 45 beats/min, respectively) and pressor (+ 16 mmHg and + 9 mmHg) responses in conscious rabbits. Bilateral microinjection of GABAA agonist muscimol (500 pmol) into the DMH, but not nearby hypothalamic <b>regions,</b> <b>attenuated</b> pressor and tachycardic responses to air-jet by 56 - 63 % and evoked anorexia. Conversely, stimulation of the DMH with glutamate analog kainic acid (250 pmol) elicited hypertension (+ 25 mmHg), tachycardia (+ 114 beats/min) and activated feeding behavior. Local microinjection of a glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (10 nmol) decreased pressor responses to stress and eating by 46 % and 72 %, respectively, without affecting feeding behavior. Bilateral microinjection of a selective AT 1 receptor antagonist candesartan (500 pmol) into the DMH, but not nearby sites, attenuated pressor and tachycardic stress responses by 31 % and 33 %, respectively. Candesartan did not alter feeding behavior or circulator...|$|R
40|$|Objective. WNT/β-catenin pathway {{members have}} been implicated in {{interstitial}} fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis disease processes characteristic of diabetic nephropathy (DN), processes partly controlled by transcription factors (TFs) that bind to gene promoter <b>regions</b> <b>attenuating</b> regulation. We sought to identify predicted cis-acting transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) overrepresented within WNT pathway members. Methods. We assessed 62 TFBS motif frequencies from the JASPAR databases in 65 WNT pathway genes. P values were estimated on the hypergeometric distribution for each TF. Gene expression profiles of enriched motifs were examined in DN-related datasets to assess clinical significance. Results. Transcription factor AP- 2 alpha (TFAP 2 A), myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF 1), and specificity protein 1 (SP 1) were significantly enriched within WNT pathway genes (P values < 6. 83 × 10 − 29, 1. 34 × 10 − 11, and 3. 01 × 10 − 6, resp.). MZF 1 expression was significantly increased in DN in a whole kidney dataset (fold change = 1. 16; 16 % increase; P= 0. 03). TFAP 2 A expression was decreased in an independent dataset (fold change = − 1. 02; P= 0. 03). No differential expression of SP 1 was detected. Conclusions. Three TFBS profiles are significantly enriched within WNT pathway genes highlighting the potential of in silico analyses for identification of pathway regulators. Modification of TF binding may possibly limit DN progression, offering potential therapeutic benefit...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) {{plays an important}} role in neural plasticity in the adult nervous system and has been suggested as a target gene for antidepressant treatment. The neurotrophic hypothesis of depression suggests that loss of BDNF from the hippocampus contributes to an increased vulnerability for depression, whereas upregulation of BDNF in the hippocampus is suggested to mediate antidepressant efficacy. METHODS: We have used a viral-mediated gene transfer approach to assess the role of BDNF in subregions of the hippocampus in a broad array of behavioral paradigms, including depression-like behavior and antidepressant responses. We have combined the adeno-associated virus (AAV) with the Cre/loxP site-specific recombination system to induce the knockout of BDNF selectively in either the CA 1 or dentate gyrus (DG) subregions of the hippocampus. RESULTS: We show that the loss of BDNF in either the CA 1 or the DG of the hippocampus does not alter locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, fear conditioning, or depression-related behaviors. However, the selective loss of BDNF in the DG but not the CA 1 <b>region</b> <b>attenuates</b> the actions of desipramine and citalopram in the forced swim test. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the loss of hippocampal BDNF per se is not sufficient to mediate depression-like behavior. However, these results support the view that BDNF in the DG might be essential in mediating the therapeutic effect of antidepressants...|$|R
40|$|Recruitment of {{intracellular}} {{glucose transporter}} 4 (GLUT 4) to the plasma membrane {{of fat and}} muscle cells in response to insulin requires phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3 -kinase {{as well as a}} proposed PI 3 -kinase-independent pathway leading to activation of the small GTPase TC 10. Here we show that in cultured adipocytes insulin causes acute cortical localization of the actin-regulatory neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and actin-related protein- 3 (Arp 3) as well as cortical F-actin polymerization by a mechanism that is insensitive to the PI 3 -kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Expression of the dominant inhibitory N-WASP-DeltaWA protein lacking the Arp and actin binding <b>regions</b> <b>attenuates</b> the cortical F-actin rearrangements by insulin in these cells. Remarkably, the N-WASP-DeltaWA protein also inhibits insulin action on GLUT 4 translocation, indicating dependence of GLUT 4 recycling on N-WASP-directed cortical F-actin assembly. TC 10 exhibits sequence similarity to Cdc 42 and has been reported to bind N-WASP. We show the inhibitory TC 10 (T 31 N) mutant, which abrogates insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation and glucose transport, also inhibits both cortical localization of N-WASP and F-actin formation in response to insulin. These findings reveal that N-WASP likely functions downstream of TC 10 in a PI 3 -kinase-independent insulin signaling pathway to mobilize cortical F-actin, which in turn promotes GLUT 4 responsiveness to insulin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study proposes the {{implementation}} of a fully dynamic four-network poroelastic model which is underpinned by multiple-network poroelastic theory (MPET), in order to account for the effects of varying stages of aqueductal stenosis and atresia during acute hydrocephalus. The innovation of the fully dynamic MPET implementation is that it avoids the commonplace assumption of quasi-steady behaviour; instead, it incorporates all transient terms in the casting of the equations and in the numerical solution of the resulting discrete system. It was observed that the application of mild stenosis allows for a constant value of amalgamated ventricular displacement in under 2. 4 h, whereas the application of a severe stenosis delays this settlement to approximately 10 h. A completely blocked aqueduct does not show a clear sign of reaching a steady ventricular displacement after 24 h. The increasing ventricular pressure (complemented with ventriculomegaly) during severe stenosis is causing the trans-parenchymal tissue region to respond, and this coping mechanism is most <b>attenuated</b> at the <b>regions</b> closest to the skull and the ventricles. After 9 h, the parenchymal tissue shows to be coping well with the additional pressure burden, since both ventriculomegaly and ventricular CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) pressure show small increases between 9 and 24 h. Localised swelling in the periventricular region could also be observed through CSF fluid content, whilst dilation results showed stretch and compression of cortical tissue adjacent to the ventricles and skull...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of {{dementia}} among the elderly. Neuritic plaques whose primary component is amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles which are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, are known to be the neuropathological hallmarks of AD. In addition, impaired synaptic plasticity in neuronal networks is thought to be important mechanism underlying for the cognitive deficits observed in AD. Although various causative factors, including excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysregulation and oxidative damage caused by Aβ, are involved in early onset of AD, fundamental therapeutics that can modify the progression of this disease are not currently available. In the present study, we investigated whether phloroglucinol (1, 3, 5 -trihydroxybenzene), a component of phlorotannins, which are plentiful in Ecklonia cava, a marine brown alga species, displays therapeutic activities in AD. We found that phloroglucinol attenuates the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation induced by oligomeric Aβ 1 - 42 (Aβ 1 - 42) treatment in HT- 22, hippocampal cell line. In addition, phloroglucinol was shown to ameliorate the reduction in dendritic spine density induced by Aβ 1 - 42 treatment in rat primary hippocampal neuron cultures. We also found that the administration of phloroglucinol to the hippocampal <b>region</b> <b>attenuated</b> the impairments in cognitive dysfunction observed in 22 -week-old 5 XFAD (Tg 6799) mice, which are used as an AD animal model. These results indicate that phloroglucinol displays therapeutic potential for AD by reducing the cellular ROS levels...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the control of {{unsteady}} vortical flow occurred downstream of a circular cylinder located in shallow water flow using concentrically located outer perforated cylinder. The porosities, β have been changed between 0. 1 and 0. 8 in the present study. The increments of porosity β were taken as 0. 05 in the range of 0. 1 and 0. 8 with a hole diameter of d= 10 mm. The ratio of inner cylinder diameter to outer cylinder diameter, Di/Do was selected as 0. 25, 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5 and 0. 6 the inner cylinder diameter is Di= 50 mm where the outer cylinder diameter is Dd= 100 mm. Experiments were performed at a constant depth of the water level as h= 50 mm (half of the outer cylinder diameter). Free stream velocity was taken as U∞= 100 mm/s corresponding to a Reynolds number of Re Do= 10000 based on the outer cylinder diameter. It has been observed that the inner circular cylinder was highly affected by the existence of surrounding outer perforated cylinders. It is observed that the intensity of Reynolds shear stress correlating, is completely <b>attenuated</b> in the <b>region</b> both downstream of concentric cylinder and between the concentric cylinders. It is determined from the experiments that porosity, β= 0. 55 is the most effective parameter for control of flow structure that is occurred from the inner cylinder...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous studies {{suggested}} that epicardial patch {{applied to the}} infarcted site after acute myocardial infarction (MI) can alleviate left ventricular (LV) remodeling and improve cardiac performance; however, the effects of regional epicardial patch on chronic phase of LV remodeling remain unclear. Methods and Results: We studied 20 pigs with MI induced by distal embolization and impaired LV ejection fraction (LVEF. 05). As determined by cardiac MRI, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased at 20 weeks compared with 8 weeks in both groups (P <. 05). However, the increase in LV end-diastolic volume (+ 14. 1 ± 1. 8 % vs. + 6. 6 ± 2. 1 %, P =. 015) and LV end-systolic volume (+ 12. 1 ± 2. 4 % vs. - 4. 7 ± 3. 7 %, P =. 0015) were significantly greater {{in the control group}} compared with the patch group. Furthermore, the percentage increase in LVEF (+ 17. 3 ± 4. 9 % vs. + 4. 1 ± 3. 9 %, P = . 048) from 8 to 20 weeks was significantly greater in the patch group compared with the control group. Histological examination showed that LV wall thickness at the infarct region and adjacent peri-infarct regions were significantly greater in the patch group compared with the control group (P <. 05). Conclusion: Regional application of a simple, passive synthetic epicardial patch increased LV wall thickness at the infarct <b>region,</b> <b>attenuated</b> LV dilation, and improved LVEF and +dP/dt in a large animal model of MI. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
