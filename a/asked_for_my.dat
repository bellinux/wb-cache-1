Even I had the right to act, I never <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> part. That money, as anyone in Albania knows, have been washed by the blood of patriots as Bajram Curri, Hasan Prishtina, Luigj Gurakuqi, and {{thousand}} of them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{responsibility}} {{principle is}} that a clear conscience results when people {{realize that they are}} responsible to God for every thought, word, action, and motive. Part of this principle is asking forgiveness from whomever has been offended so that no one can point a finger at you and say, [...] "You've offended me and never <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> forgiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{has shown}} cynicism towards the {{credibility}} of postmodernism and poststructuralism. In particular he has criticised the Parisian intellectual community; the following disclaimer may be taken as indicative: [...] "I wouldn't say this if I hadn't been explicitly <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> opinion – and if asked to back it up, I'm going to respond that I don't think it merits {{the time to do}} so" [...] (ibid). Chomsky's lack of interest arises from what he sees as a combination of difficult language and limited intellectual or [...] "real world" [...] value, especially in Parisian academe: [...] "Sometimes it gets kind of comical, say in post-modern discourse. Especially around Paris, it has become a comic strip, I mean it's all gibberish ... they try to decode it and see what is the actual meaning behind it, things that you could explain to an eight-year old child. There's nothing there." [...] (Chomsky on Anarchism, pg. 216). This is exacerbated, in his view, by the attention paid to academics by the French press: [...] "in France if you're part of the intellectual elite and you cough, there's a front-page story in Le Monde. That's {{one of the reasons why}} French intellectual culture is so farcical – it's like Hollywood" [...] (Understanding Power, pg. 96).|$|E

2500|$|Discussing {{his life}} in New York, Popović said: [...] "I never stopped keeping tabs on things back home. Personally, I felt like my life ended. War, the country disintegrated, I lost the job that I worked for so many years, the only thing I had left was raising my children. There was a {{newsstand}} on the 42nd Street that sold Večernje novosti and Vreme and I'd go there every day to get the paper and read it cover to cover. I was well informed. I also had contacts with numerous human rights {{organizations such as the}} Human Rights Watch and UN Human Rights Committee that <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> input on the situation once they found out I'm in New York. In the beginning, the information coming out of the Balkans was unclear, incomplete, and misinterpreted. Yugoslavia was low on their list of priorities. Germany was uniting, USSR was disintegrating, we were the last item on the priority list. I never turned down invitations to speak at meetings and lectures that were being held everywhere from schools, churches and city chambers. People from all over the former Yugoslavia would come and I always used my participation to insist on the establishment of the international war crimes tribunal".|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Brando made a rare {{television}} {{appearance in}} the miniseries , portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance. In 1978, he narrated the English version of Raoni, a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha {{that focused on the}} life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil. Brando portrayed Superman's father Jor-El in the 1978 film Superman. He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and that his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. It was revealed in a documentary contained in the 2001 DVD release of Superman that he was paid $3.7million for two weeks of work. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie's sequel, Superman II, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage. [...] "I <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> usual percentage," [...] he recollected in his memoir, [...] "but they refused, and so did I." [...] However, after Brando's death, the footage was reincorporated into the 2006 re-cut of the film, [...] and in the 2006 [...] "loose sequel" [...] Superman Returns, in which both used and unused archive footage of him as Jor-El from the first two Superman films was remastered for a scene in the Fortress of Solitude, and Brando's voice-overs were used throughout the film.|$|E

6000|$|I {{felt he was}} lying. Don't <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> reasons: I have no {{reasons to}} give. When he said [...] "I will remain at Browndown," [...] I felt he was lying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah! boo! Why does nobody <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> {{opinion on}} the matter?" [...] said uncle Rik, as he gazed at the company over a goose drumstick, which was {{obviously}} not tender.|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand, sir," [...] said he, [...] "that you <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> wife, but I {{thought it}} better {{to come to you}} myself. What is your {{business}} with her, sir, and what is your name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is my story," [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps {{you will}} now {{understand}} my sudden emotion when you <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> advice. As {{a matter of}} fact, I do not give advice now on any subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't {{make any}} difference," [...] {{proceeded}} the other, as coolly as ever. [...] "You have <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> advice, and I {{give you my}} advice. Tear up your letter of introduction, and don't stir a step further {{in the direction of}} Whitehall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--go. But don't say I'm ill. <b>Ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> man Pym, {{and tell}} him to get it from Mills, and not to say I'm at the Hermitage. Get some water too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Prince," [...] said she, [...] "it is all nonsense, you know, to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> heart; but I am not mean; {{you shall}} have {{a lock of}} my hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} wealth or poverty as you {{understand}} it," [...] answers Nature. [...] "Here I exchange realities only <b>for</b> realities.

6000|$|... "No, I do {{not judge}} him. How could I, so suddenly? You <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> impression--I explain my impression. I--I--don't know the world, nor yet {{the people in}} it; I have been too solitary--I am too young to trust my own opinions." ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{she went}} and there {{followed}} a swift council of war, the question being {{whether we were}} to strike at the Satrap's army or {{to allow it to}} retreat to Sais. In my turn I was <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> judgment of the issue, and answered, ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{officer on}} the bridge took off his cap with immense politeness. [...] "Excuse me," [...] he said, [...] "but I've <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> reckoning.

60|$|I {{forgot to}} mention, that the gentlemen that played gave a hundred guineas to the box, {{as they called}} it, {{and at the end}} of their play they <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> gentlewoman of the bedchamber, as they called her (Mrs. Amy, forsooth), and gave it her, and gave twenty guineas more among the servants.|$|E

But keep a secret from my wife, I fairly own to your Majesty that I can not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have honored me by <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> advice," [...] he said. [...] "I earnestly advise you, Mrs. Eustace, {{to break}} your engagement. I {{go even further}} than that--I entreat you not to see Dexter again." ...|$|R

60|$|LUCIUS. I {{do not ask}} him {{to trust}} me until he is victorious. I <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> life, and <b>for</b> a command in Caesar's army. And since Caesar is a fair dealer, I will pay in advance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your grandfather, Peregrine, <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> assent," [...] said Mrs. Orme; [...] "and I {{thought it}} right to give it."

6000|$|... "Your aunt {{has told}} you, I suppose. Yes; {{it is about}} Mr. Lopez. I have been very much {{astonished}} to-day by Mr. Lopez,--a man of whom I have seen very little and know less.

6000|$|... "The Society," [...] she said, [...] "is {{an admirable}} one enough, but just now I am {{beginning}} to feel it a little exacting. I think that the Prince expects {{a good deal of}} one. I shall certainly <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> release to-night." ...|$|R
