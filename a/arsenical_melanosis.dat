40|$|To {{understand}} the role of vitamin E {{in the treatment of}} <b>arsenical</b> <b>melanosis</b> and keratosis, the buccal cells of 19 patients, 14 arsenic exposed controls and 13 healthy volunteers were collected for the estimation of vitamin E both before and after supplementation with vitamin E (200 IU, caplet) daily orally for 20 weeks. The vitamin E levels in the buccal cells of patients were significantly low in comparison to healthy volunteers (healthy vs patients: 17. 2 ± 4. 4 vs 12. 3 ± 6. 1 mg/mg of protein; p= 0. 012). These low level of vitamin E in patients returned toward normal levels following supplementation with vitamin E for 20 weeks (p= 0. 044). The vitamin E levels in serum of patients were also low (healthy vs patients: 18. 9 ± 4. 4 vs 10. 2 ± 2. 6 mg/mL; p= 0. 000). Supplementation with vitamin E overcomed the low levels of vitamin E in serum. The cholesterol levels in buccal cells and serum of patients were significantly low in comparison to healthy volunteers (buccal cells of healthy vs patients: 24. 5 ± 14. 1 vs 10. 3 ± 9. 8 mg/mg of protein; p= 0. 005; serum of healthy vs patients: 153. 5 ± 22. 8 vs 125. 3 ± 37. 0 mg/dL; p= 0. 012). After supplementation of vitamin E, there was no significant change in cholesterol levels in both buccal cells and serum of patients...|$|E
