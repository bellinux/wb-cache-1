25|$|Unlike {{the innate}} immune system, the {{adaptive}} immune system is highly specific to a particular pathogen. Adaptive immunity can also provide long-lasting protection; for example, someone who recovers from measles is now protected against measles for their lifetime. In other cases it does not provide lifetime protection; for example, chickenpox. The <b>adaptive</b> <b>system</b> response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the <b>adaptive</b> <b>system</b> is unable to distinguish harmful from harmless foreign molecules; {{the effects of this}} may be hayfever, asthma or any other allergy. Antigens are any substances that elicit the adaptive immune response. The cells that carry out the adaptive immune response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Two main broad classes—antibody responses and cell mediated immune response—are also carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete antibodies, which are proteins also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies travel through the bloodstream and bind to the foreign antigen causing it to inactivate, which does not allow the antigen to bind to the host.|$|E
25|$|Front and hind hooves are {{identical}} in the foal, but differ visibly {{in the adult}} horse. This is good evidence of medium-term plasticity of the whole hoof shape, {{as a result of}} variation in its use. Slow changes in hoof shape occur under any consistent change in the horse's movement pattern and under a wide variety of pathological conditions. They can be seen now as a clear example of a complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>system,</b> a frequent feature of living beings and structures.|$|E

Using an action research methodology, six Air Force Management Services Teams were exposed to six overlapping attributes of complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> through focus group workshops with an aim to determine whether they, as experienced management consulting practitioners, saw value to themselves and their Air Force clients of using aspects of complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> for organisational understanding. The overlapping attributes of complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> were distilled from the literature reviewed. Whereas the focus group workshop participants found the attributes valuable in understanding the dynamics of organisational behaviour, they found the {{new way of thinking}} challenging on a number of different perspectives. Some aspects of the Air Force organisation, like its high levels of organisational experience, will make the introduction to and use of complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> thinking simpler, while other aspects of the Air Force organisation, like its sensitivity to complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> terminology, will make the introduction and use of complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> more challenging.

This straightforward formalism {{may be used as}} a general framework for describing and investigating <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems,</b> and examples of both of these cases are discussed.

25|$|The {{adaptive}} immune system, {{also known}} as the acquired immune system or, more rarely, as the specific immune system, is a subsystem of the overall immune system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. The adaptive immune system is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate immune system). Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>system</b> includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} interplay (exchange or trade) done {{by economic}} actors in all markets sets the prices for all {{goods and services}} which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, {{as well as the}} remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent). Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

2500|$|An {{immune system}} may contain innate and {{adaptive}} components. The innate system in mammalians for example {{is composed of}} primitive bone marrow cells that are programmed to recognise foreign substances and react. The <b>adaptive</b> <b>system</b> is composed of more advanced lymphatic cells that are programmed to recognise self substances and don't react. The reaction to foreign substances is etymologically described as inflammation, meaning to set on fire. The non-reaction to self substances is described as immunity, meaning to exempt or as immunotolerance. These two components {{of the immune system}} create a dynamic biological environment where [...] "health" [...] {{can be seen as a}} physical state where the self is immunologically spared, and what is foreign is inflammatorily and immunologically eliminated. [...] "Disease" [...] can arise when what is foreign cannot be eliminated or what is self is not spared.|$|E
2500|$|Current {{usage of}} the term [...] "complexity" [...] {{in the field of}} {{sociology}} typically refers specifically to theories of society as a complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>system.</b> However, social complexity and its emergent properties are central recurring themes throughout the historical development of social thought and the study of social change. The early founders of sociological theory, such as Ferdinand Tönnies, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto, and Georg Simmel, all examined the exponential growth and increasing interrelatedness of social encounters and exchanges. This emphasis on interconnectivity in social relationships and the emergence of new properties within society is found in theoretical thinking in multiple areas of sociology. As a theoretical tool, social complexity theory serves as a basis for the connection of micro- and macro-level social phenomena, providing a level or middle-range theoretical platform for hypothesis formation. Methodologically, the concept of social complexity is theory-neutral, meaning that it accommodates both local (micro) and global (macro) phenomena in sociological research.|$|E
