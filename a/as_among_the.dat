He was not suspended, but the incident contributed to a collapse in the standings by the Blackhawks, and they placed him on waivers in March. No team claimed him, and Fleury finished the season with the Blackhawks, recording 12goals and 21assists in 54games. Following the season, in April 2003, he was suspended again by the league for violations of its substance abuse program. The suspension ended his NHL career.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Triceratops finds {{were known}} only from solitary individuals. These remains are very common; for example, Bruce Erickson, a {{paleontologist}} of the Science Museum of Minnesota, has reported having seen 200specimens of T. prorsus in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. Similarly, Barnum Brown {{claimed to have}} seen over 500skulls in the field. Because Triceratops teeth, horn fragments, frill fragments, and other skull fragments are such abundant fossils in the Lancian faunal stage of the late Maastrichtian (late Cretaceous, 66mya) Period of western North America, it is regarded <b>as</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> dominant herbivores of the time, if not the most dominant herbivore. In 1986, Robert Bakker estimated it as making up 5/6ths of the large dinosaur fauna {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous. Unlike most animals, skull fossils are far more common than postcranial bones for Triceratops, suggesting that the skull had an unusually high preservation potential.|$|E
5|$|From 1723 to 1733, Fort Manoel {{was built}} on Manoel Island in Marsamxett Harbour, so as to protect Valletta's western flank. The Baroque fort is square in shape, with four corner bastions.

It was built to protect the entrance of Marsamxett, along with Fort Saint Elmo. The fort's architecture {{is very different from}} the Order's earlier forts, and although very small by 18th century standards, it has been described <b>as</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> most revolutionary and influential of Malta's fortifications as it is a very early example of a polygonal fort. Many other polygonal forts were built by the British later on in the 19th century.|$|E
