30|$|We {{have also}} {{observed}} that when two researchers had a <b>joint</b> <b>publication,</b> {{the chances of}} a second <b>joint</b> <b>publication</b> among them increased 3 times. Moreover, 21  % of the first <b>joint</b> <b>publication</b> among a pair of researchers occurred after they had independent papers published in the same edition of the same venue in the past. This percentage is not high, and actually the chances of publishing together are halved when researchers meet before in conferences. Thus, the reason for starting collaborations seems not to be related to meeting in conferences. Nevertheless, after a new collaboration is started and the first publication together comes out, chances drastically increase for additional publications.|$|R
