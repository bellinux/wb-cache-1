The effect of radiation damage of greatest interest to the IASCC problem is the segregation of impurities or redistribution of alloying elements {{in the vicinity of}} the grain boundary. Differences among the types of irradiation include particle type, temperature, dose, and dose rate. The different particle type results in different "effective" displacement rates due to fundamental differences in the radiation damage state. The effect of displacement efficiency is incorporated into existing models for radiation-induced segregation and compared with experimentally determined values. Comparisons between theory and experiment were made using neutron-,proton-, and ion-irradiated stainless steels. Results showed that the measured chromium depletion profile is generally narrower and shallower than that calculated from theory. Agreement between experiment and model was better in almost all cases when the particle efficiency was taken into account. Agreement was best for proton-irradiated steels, and less so for neutron and heavy ion-irradiated steels. The origins of this difference are probably due to spatial and depth resolution of the scanning transmission electron microscopy and <b>Auger</b> electron <b>spectrometry</b> measurement techniques, respectively, the lack of knowledge of the material parameters in modeling, and the uncertainty in the true displacement rate.

In the as-deposited state the coevaporated alloy film was amorphous. Upon annealing a precipitous drop in resistivity near 270 °C has been determined to be the amorphous to crystalline phase transformation. The kinetics of the transformation has been determined by isothermal heat treatment over the temperature range of 224 °C to 252 °C. An apparent activation energy of 1. 90 eV has been measured. The nucleation and growth kinetics in the crystallization process show a change in the power of time dependence from 5. 5 to 2. 4. The microstructures of films at various states of annealing have been correlated to the resistivity change. The crystalline NbSi 2 shows an anomalous metallic behavior. The resistivity (p) versus temperature curve has a large negative deviation from linearity (dfl) and it approaches a saturation value (psat) as temperature increases. The resistivity data are fitted by two empirical expressions put forth to explain the resistivity behavior in A 15 superconductors at low and high temperatures. One is {{based on the idea that}} ideal resistivity must approach some limiting value in the regime where the mean free path becomes comparable to the interatomic spacing and the other is based on a selective electron-phonon assisted scattering. In spite of the wide temperature range of analysis, it is not possible to choose one of them due to the fact that the best fit in both cases is nearly the same. The Hall coefficient (RH) changes sign from negative above ~ 250 °K to positive below ~ 250 °K...|$|R
