30|$|The {{analysis}} uses seven {{waves from}} the German Panel Study Labor Market and Social Security (PASS) covering {{the period from}} 2006 to 2013. During the observation period, Germany experienced {{a significant increase in}} average real incomes and employment, accompanied by a decrease of <b>absolute</b> income <b>poverty</b> as measured by the at-risk-of-poverty rate anchored at a fixed moment in time. PASS collects information on material deprivation with a list of 26 possessions and activities. The article discusses the difficulties of measuring material deprivation and identifies several sources of measurement error and selection bias. However, even when controlling for such errors and biases, regression models for different deprivation indices show a significant downward trend in material deprivation for the German resident population. Given the simultaneous decrease in <b>absolute</b> income <b>poverty,</b> it is concluded that measures of material deprivation behave like <b>absolute</b> income <b>poverty</b> indicators if the list of possessions and activities is not updated to changed living standard standards in society. A similar downward trend is observed also for individuals receiving basic income support. Moreover, supported individuals report deprivation differently depending on survey mode and number of previous panel interviews, raising the question of measurement equivalence in this subgroup.|$|R

The poverty line per capita changed by region from €552,39/month to €819,13/month.The numbers of those in <b>absolute</b> <b>poverty</b> rose nearly an entire percent in 2015, from 6.8% in 2014, to 7.6% in 2015. In the south of Italy the numbers are even higher with 10% living in <b>absolute</b> <b>poverty,</b> up from 9 percent in 2014. The north is better off at 6.7%, but still an increase from 5.7% in 2014. The national statics reporting agency, ISTAT, defines <b>absolute</b> <b>poverty</b> as those who can’t buy goods and services which they need to survive. In 2015, the proportion of poor households in relative poverty also increased in 2015 to 13.7 from 12.9 in 2014. ISTAT defines relative poverty as people whose disposable income is less than around half the national average. The unemployment rate in February 2016 remained at 11.7%, {{which has been the}} same for almost a year, but even having a job doesn’t guarantee freedom from poverty. Those who have at least one family employed still suffer from 6.1% to 11.7% poverty, the higher number being for those who have factory jobs. The numbers are even higher for the younger generations because their unemployment rate is over 40%. Also, children are hit hard. In 2014, 32% of those aged 0–17 are at risk of poverty or social exclusion, which is one child out of three. In the last ISTAT report poverty is in decline.|$|E
25|$|The {{poverty line}} {{threshold}} of $1.90 per day, as {{set by the}} World Bank, is controversial.

Some scholars argue that the World Bank method sets the bar too high, others argue it is low. Still others suggest that poverty line misleads as it measures everyone below the poverty line the same, when in reality someone living on $1.20 per day is in a different state of poverty than someone living on $0.20 per day. In other words, the depth and intensity of poverty varies across the world and in any regional populations, and $1.25 per day poverty line and head counts are inadequate measures.|$|E

In this paper we review the literature and estimates of child poverty in China and also provide estimates of absolute and relative child poverty in rural India for the year 1993 - 94 and 1999 - 00.

30|$|We {{asked whether}} {{material}} deprivation is decreasing in Germany. Seven waves from the German Panel Study Labor Market and Social Security (PASS), covering {{the period from}} 2006 to 2013, were used to answer this research question.

However, a more differentiated analysis demonstrated that the returns of this economic upswing were mostly reaped in the upper segments of the income distribution, while the middle stagnated and lower segments lost (Grabka and Goebel 2017). Nevertheless, looking at the PASS sample of the resident population, we observed a slight decrease in relative income poverty and even more importantly, a significant decrease in <b>absolute</b> income <b>poverty</b> (as measured by the fixed AROP).|$|R

The measure is absolute {{in the sense that the}} poverty line defines the same purchasing power from one year to the next and also in the sense that someone with a purchasing power below the poverty line is regarded as poor no matter how many others fall below this line, which is intuitively sound (cf.
