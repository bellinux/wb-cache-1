5|$|Ghazi, meanwhile, sank off the Visakhapatnam coast under mysterious circumstances. On {{the night}} of 3–4 December, <b>a</b> <b>muffled</b> {{underwater}} explosion was detected by a coastal battery. The next morning, a local fisherman observed flotsam near the coast, causing Indian naval officials to suspect a vessel had sunk off the coast. The next day, a clearance diving team was sent to search the area, and they confirmed that Ghazi had sunk in shallow waters.|$|E

Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees.

It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E

5|$|The Tiger II {{was also}} used in {{significant}} numbers, distributed into four heavy panzer battalions, during the Ardennes Offensive (also known as the Battle of the Bulge) of December 1944. At least 150 Tiger IIs were present, {{nearly a third of}} total production, and most were lost {{during the course of the}} offensive. During the Battle of St. Vith a M8 Greyhound armoured car destroyed a Tiger II after getting in behind it on the Schonberg Road, though the commander tried to traverse his turret to engage the M8.

5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering <b>a</b> <b>muffled</b> groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the extreme}} dangers {{inherent}} with no man's land, specialized tools and methods were implemented to make the process quieter and more effective. Pickets, or metal posts, were originally used {{to hold up the}} wire and were hammered in by <b>a</b> <b>muffled</b> mallet. However, this still produced noise, rendering the sappers targets. Therefore, screw pickets or 'cork-screws' were produced. These looped steel posts had a drill-like end, allowing it to be twisted into the ground noiselessly and the wire then wrapped around it.|$|E

A southern rock song, [...] "Make You Move" [...] features a heavy kick drum and grunge-influenced chorus, while the vocals are distorted during the bridge and take on <b>a</b> <b>muffled</b> effect.

500|$|John Calvert of The Quietus {{described}} [...] "Thinkin Bout You" [...] as a [...] "slow-release torch song {{the colour}} of caramel and bathed in low voltage lighting, a buzzing but soothing synth cycle and muffled beats evoke touching and kissing in a velveteen womb. Poised, considered, classy and moving, this is uniquely Frank Ocean." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{stated that the}} track [...] "couldn’t be any less auspicious as an opening song, {{little more than a}} delicate, yearning falsetto vocal over vaporous keyboards and <b>a</b> <b>muffled</b> rhythm track." [...] Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen described the song as [...] "woozy", featuring Ocean's [...] "falsetto rippling over murmuring electronic percussion". She stated that [...] "it's a bisexual black bohemian New Orleanian-turned-Angeleno's avant-R torch ballad. And, of course, it's just a love song – an anthem for anyone, anywhere, who's found love, and lost it." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on November 18, 2009, [...] "Pee" [...] was watched by 2.87 million overall households, {{according to the}} Nielsen ratings, making it the most watched cable show of the night. It beat the second highest-ranked cable show, Bravo's Top Chef, by about 600,000 households. The episode received generally mixed reviews. If Magazine writer Carl Cortez, who was critical {{of the second half}} of season thirteen, said [...] "Pee" [...] ranked {{as one of the best}} episodes of the season, and said it included several [...] "classic South Park moments". Cortez called it a [...] "wonderfully twisted spoof" [...] of disaster films and called the script [...] "pretty biting stuff ... without being wholly offensive". Ramsey Isler of IGN said the emergency staff subplot working on a cure was not [...] "quite perfect parody". But he praised Kyle in the ending scene, as well as the way South Park found a new, literal twist on [...] "toilet humor" [...] by featuring rivers and tsunamis of pee. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said that the episode was overly offensive, rather than an ironic commentary on racism. Although O'Neal said previous South Park episodes like [...] "With Apologies to Jesse Jackson" [...] were effective, [...] "Pee" [...] and its references to minority park attendees and the Italian waterpark owner [...] "came off less like ironic racism and more as good, old-fashioned, butter-your-cornbread-with-it racism". [...] An airing on August 4th, 2017 featured <b>a</b> <b>muffled</b> version of the song.|$|E

500|$|... "Make Your Move" [...] {{received}} positive critical reception {{upon its}} release. Andree Farias of Allmusic selected the song as a 'Track pick' from Move. Chris Carpenter of Christian Broadcasting Network regarded it as [...] "a foot-thumping rocker that will fuel any commute or long car ride", C. E'Jon Moore of The Christian Manifesto praised the song as [...] "a rock solid, in-your-face number". Moor {{also stated that}} the song is [...] "a testament to Third Day’s versatility as a Christian band. They pull no punches about their faith, but they also create music that is accessible to most people who like rock & roll". Andrew Greer of Christianity Today commented that [...] " [...] uses a distorted vocal bridge and grungy half-time chorus groove to depict evangelism from a non-believer's perspective", while Glen McCarty of Crosswalk.com stated the song [...] "is propelled by a thudding kick drum" [...] while also regarding it as [...] "tightly-constructed". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel commented that [...] "Mac Powell’s smoky vocals take on <b>a</b> <b>muffled</b> effect that is both modern and vintage at the same time". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout opined that [...] "'Make Your Move' has that edgy, gutsy rock attitude that [...] "You Make Me Mad" [...] had on Conspiracy No. 5" [...] and also described the song's bassline as [...] "delicious". Brian Mansfield of USA Today listed [...] "Make Your Move" [...] as a download pick from Move. [...] "Make Your Move" [...] spent ten weeks on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart, peaking at number forty-three. It also peaked at number twelve on the Billboard Christian CHR chart and spent eighteen weeks on that chart.

Although the same temperature of calcination, the prolonged heating in <b>a</b> <b>muffle</b> furnace showed only copper ferrite phase (Fig.  2).
