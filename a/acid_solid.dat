40|$|Abstract — Biodiesels are {{biofuels}} {{made from}} renewable {{sources such as}} vegetable oils originating from plants and animal fats. Transesterification reaction is carried out by reacting triglycerides in oil/fat with an alcohol in presence of a catalyst. Important process variables are reaction temperature, time, reactant concentration and the catalyst. Catalysts can be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Homogeneous catalysts are liquid phase ionic acid and base, enzymes, and non-ionic organic base compounds. Heterogeneous catalysts are acid and base type. Examples of acid heterogeneous catalysts are ion-exchange resins, tungstated and sulphated zirconia, metal complexes and zeolite. Base heterogeneous catalysts consist of metal oxides in pure form or over support, zeolites, clays and non-oxides. Paper gives a brief introduction of catalytic transesterification process and a detailed review of solid basic catalysts.

Pristine acetic acid deposited at 123 K (on a copper support) appears as an amorphous solid, which undergoes an irreversible phase transformation to a more structurally ordered (polycrystalline) form upon annealing to 153 K. Acetic acid is found to adsorb on NCI and PCI films initially through hydrogen bonding between CdO and dangling OH (of ice), followed by the formation of multilayers at 123 K. Thermal evolution studies of a low exposure of acetic acid on the ultrathin NCI and PCI films show that acetic acid undergoes coevaporation with water likely as an acetic acid hydrate at 155 K, which continues until the entire ice film has been exhausted at 165 K.
