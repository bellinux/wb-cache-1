30|$|In this paper, we expand this related literature. Specifically, we {{connect it}} to the Central Place Theory (CPT). CPT states that human {{settlements}} emerge as a hierarchical system of centers of various sizes. The few larger centers provide <b>a</b> higher <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services, which have a larger range, which in turn causes people {{to be willing to}} travel longer distances to acquire them [4]. In this paper, we provide empirical evidences of this very decision-making process happening among customers in a retail scenario: customers decide to ignore the closest shop to their location if it is unable to satisfy their complex needs. The shop type has a great influence over customer movements. Larger shops, that can provide a more differentiated offer of products, attract more customers, whether they are the closest or not.|$|R

Instead, {{he concludes that}} they link rural communities to <b>a</b> transcendent <b>order</b> and ancient institutions: They do not shy away from expressing their true beliefs, and if they supported slavery they would probably say so. They merely believe in the social hierarchies. In those southern communities, they say, social roles were crucial to happiness and ordered sociability. [...] "Aristotle recognized that a well-ordered society protected <b>an</b> ascending <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> through the institutionalization of rank", Fleming and co-author Paul Gottfried wrote in their book The Conservative Movement.

On a larger scale, the paleocons contrast the virtues of the republic with the corruptions of empire. The empire throws its weight around in the world; the republic minds its own business.|$|R
30|$|This work {{is part of}} the {{literature}} effort of creating models of human mobility. In particular, we focus on the mobility of customers in a market environment. How do customers decide when and where to shop? What are the most important factors influencing these choices? This research literature is very prolific and it is touched from a number of approaches. We depart from classical marketing analysis [9 – 11] and the classic data mining community [12 – 14], to embrace the more systemic view, putting together the social physics approach with the classical Central Place Theory developed in the 1930 s [4]. We do so by collecting a large amount of data about the overall behavior of the retail population as a whole system and empirically validate the CPT prediction. Namely, we focus on the idea that shops providing <b>a</b> higher <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services, which have a larger range, cause people to be willing to travel longer distances to visit them.|$|R

On this basis, Löw is conducting empirical research into how spatial constructions change in and through electronic networks. Other focuses of research are “space, power, and social differentiation” and ethnographic urban studies.|$|R

40|$|Theatre and {{censorship}} are two cultural phenomens {{that during}} the age of Risorgimento acquire an ideological significance if you compare the two together.

But {{in the first half}} of the nineteenth century, the Italian theatre does not represent only a «sociability» check point; Opera and Melodrama were artistic forms capable of circulating the ideals of the Risorgimento. The importance that authorities attributed to censorship to check the public’s demonstrations that often accompanied theatrical performances was understandable. After the italian unification it attempted to reaffirm a censorship model inclined to entrust the theatre a social and educational role to control the people, that recalled more in content than in form, the intent of the divided government to entrust at shows and at architectural structures, where they were hosted, the task of contributing to popular education and public order...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Image/video matting {{is one of}} the key {{operations}} in many image/video editing applications. Although previous methods can generate high-quality matting results, their high computational cost in processing high-resolution image and video data often limits their usability. In this paper, we present a unified acceleration method for closed-form image and video matting using a hierarchical data structure, which achieves an excellent compromise between quality and speed. We first apply Gaussian KD-tree to adaptively cluster the input high-dimensional image and video feature space into a low-dimensional feature space. Then, we solve the affinity-weighted Laplacian alpha matting in the reduced feature space. The final matting results are derived using detail-aware alpha interpolation. Our algorithm can be fully parallelized by exploiting advanced graphics hardware, which can further accelerate the matting computation. Our method accelerates existing methods by at least <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> magnitude with <b>good</b> quality, and also greatly reduces the memory consumption. This acceleration strategy is also extended to support other affinity-based matting approaches, which makes it a more general accelerating framework for a variety of matting methods. Finally, we apply the presented method to accelerate image and video dehazing, and image shadow detection and removal. Index Terms—Gaussian KD-tree, matting, dehazing, accel-eration, GP...|$|R
40|$|Using a van der Waals density {{functional}} (vdW-DF) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004) ], we perform {{ab initio}} calculations for the adsorption energy of benzene (Bz) on Cu(111) {{as a function}} of lateral position and height. We find that the vdW-DF inclusion of nonlocal correlations (responsible for dispersive interactions) changes the relative stability of eight binding-position options and increases the binding energy by over <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> magnitude, achieving <b>good</b> agreement with experiment. The admolecules can move almost freely along a honeycomb web of "corridors" passing between fcc and hcp hollow sites via bridge sites. Our diffusion barriers (for dilute and two condensed adsorbate phases) are consistent with experimental observations. Further vdW-DF calculations suggest that the more compact (hexagonal) Bz-overlayer phase, with lattice constant a = 6. 74 Å, is due to direct Bz-Bz vdW attraction, which extends to 8 Å. We attribute the second, sparser hexagonal Bz phase, with a = 10. 24 Å, to indirect electronic interactions mediated by the metallic surface state on Cu(111). To support this claim, we use a formal Harris-functional approach to evaluate nonperturbationally the asymptotic form of this indirect interaction. Thus, we can account well for benzene self-organization on Cu(111). Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, submitted for publication Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. B.

Let us now suppose him putting on his three-cornered gold-laced hat, grasping his cane, with a head inlaid of ebony and mother-of-pearl, and setting forth, through the crooked streets of Boston, on various errands, suggested by the advertisements of the day. Thus he communes with himself: I must be mindful, says he, to call at Captain Scut's, in Creek Lane, and examine his rich velvet, whether it be fit for my apparel on Election-day,--that I may wear a stately aspect in presence of the governor and my brethren of the council. I will look in, also, at the shop of Michael Cario, the jeweller: he has silver buckles of a new fashion; and mine have lasted me some half-score years. My fair daughter Miriam shall have an apron of gold brocade, and a velvet mask,--though {{it would be a}} pity the wench should hide her comely visage; and also a French cap, from Robert Jenkins's, {{on the north side of}} the town-house. He hath beads, too, and ear-rings, and necklaces, of all sorts; these are but vanities, nevertheless, they would please the silly maiden well. My dame desireth another female in the kitchen; wherefore, I must inspect the lot of Irish lasses, for sale by Samuel Waldo, aboard the schooner Endeavor; as also the likely negro wench, at Captain Bulfinch's. It were not amiss that I took my daughter Miriam to see the royal waxwork, near the town-dock, that she may learn to honor our most gracious King and Queen, and their royal progeny, even in their waxen images; not that I would approve of image-worship. The camel, too, that strange beast from Africa, with two great humps, to be seen near the Common; methinks I would fain go thither, and see how the old patriarchs were wont to ride.

By that time, the auction will have commenced at the Royal Exchange, in King Street.
