5|$|A {{proposed}} {{part of the}} regeneration is {{an extension}} of the London Underground to serve the area. Although the site is close to Battersea Park and Queenstown Road stations, it appears to be considered that trains from these stations to Victoria and Waterloo respectively are already heavily loaded. The proposed 2-mile tunnelled extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea. The proposed extension would cost at least £500 million in 2008 terms before inflation <b>and</b> <b>optimism</b> bias (extra contingency amounts) and would be part funded by REO and, possibly, other significant land owners in the Nine Elms area. The 2010 planning consent for the site includes a phased contribution of approximately £200 million to the Underground extension, which adds another financial hurdle to the many difficulties in developing the site.|$|E
40|$|Our model {{wants to}} explain how {{overconfidence}} <b>and</b> over <b>optimism</b> lead entrepreneurs to overinvest in their companies, underestimating risks and overestimating expected returns. The entrepreneur has to choose which part of her wealth to invest in her private company and which one in the stock market. Overconfidence <b>and</b> over <b>optimism</b> are parameters in our model, and they bias the entrepreneur’s portfolio allocation. With a simulation analysis, we calculate overconfidence <b>and</b> over <b>optimism</b> levels implicit in the entrepreneurs’ observable portfolio, instead of using proxies or indirect measures. Our explicit measure of entrepreneurial under-diversification {{could be used in}} empirical analyses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} {{what kinds of}} studying profiles could be identified in terms of achievement strategies (<b>optimism,</b> task avoidance) <b>and</b> experienced challenge-competence balance, and whether such profiles are related to students’ academic engagement or disengagement. The participants (n= 785) were Finnish undergraduate students from University of Helsinki (teacher education, chemistry, theology, law) and Aalto university (engineering). Three profiles were identified by K-means cluster analysis: pessimistic, bored and optimistic. Pessimistic expressed the highest task avoidance <b>and</b> lowest <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> competence. Optimistic reported the lowest task avoidance <b>and</b> highest <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> competence. Bored experienced the lowest challenge as compared to both pessimistic and optimistic. ANOVAs revealed that optimistic expressed the highest engagement, whereas pessimistic were the most disengaged. Bored students’ problem appeared to be lack of interest rather than any other study problems...|$|R

5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in <b>and</b> <b>optimism</b> about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive biases lead {{entrepreneurs}} to overinvest {{in their}} own companies, over exposing themselves to idiosyncratic risk. Our novel theoretical model explains entrepreneurial under-diversification by measuring the amount of potential bias in entrepreneurs' portfolio allocations brought about by overconfidence <b>and</b> over <b>optimism.</b> Simulation analyses based on our model allow us calculating the implicit levels of overconfidence <b>and</b> over <b>optimism</b> from observable portfolio choices. Finally, using a unique dataset including cross-regional data on Italian entrepreneurs and a structural equation modeling approach, we test the effect of overconfidence <b>and</b> over <b>optimism</b> on entrepreneurs' portfolio allocations. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, we find {{a positive relationship between}} overconfidence and entrepreneur investments {{in their own}} companies. On the other hand, the role of over optimism seems to be negligible...|$|R

40|$|Psychosocial {{resources}} such as <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> social resources are associated with adaptation, age-related changes and life satisfaction (LS) maintenance. The relationship between <b>optimism,</b> social resources <b>and</b> LS is unclear as this issue has not been addressed by many studies. The present study analyzes the direct and indirect effect of optimism on LS in older people among older people with and without restrictions due to illness. The indirect effect was tested using a multiple mediation model of network size, emotional, instrumental and affectionate support, subjective evaluation of social relations and satisfaction with family life for each group while controlling for variables {{that have been found}} {{to have an impact on}} LS (age, self-rated health and the number of illnesses). The sample comprised 406 community-dwelling older adults (M = 74. 88, SD = 6. 75) from urban areas in Granada, southern Spain. Health status was modestly related to LS while <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> social relations variables were positively and strongly associated with LS. Among the proposed mediators network size, tangible support and satisfaction with family life mediated the relationship between <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> LS in the group of people without restrictions due to illness, while for the participants who reported restrictions due to illness only network size and satisfaction with family life mediated the relation between <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> LS. <b>Optimism</b> <b>and</b> social resources are important factors that are linked to well-being in old age. Network size, tangible support and satisfaction with family life partially explain the relationship between <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> LS...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: There is {{evidence}} that positive personality characteristics such as <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> self-esteem are important for health. Less is known about possible determinants of positive personality characteristics. We therefore tested the relationship of <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> self-esteem with insomnia symptoms and sleep duration. Method: Sleep parameters, <b>optimism,</b> <b>and</b> self-esteem were assessed by self-report in a community-based sample of 1805 adults aged between 30 and 84 years in the United States. Moderation {{of the relation between}} sleep and positive characteristics by gender and age as well as potential confounding of the association by depressive disorder was tested. Results: Individuals with insomnia symptoms scored lower on <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> self-esteem largely independent of age and sex, and controlling for symptoms of depression and sleep duration. Short sleep duration (> 6 h) was related to lower <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> self-esteem when compared to individuals sleeping 7 - 8 hours controlling depressive symptoms. Long sleep duration (< 9 h) was also related to low <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> self-esteem independent of age and sex. Conclusion: Good and sufficient sleep is associated with positive personality characteristics. This relationship is independent of the association between poor sleep and depression...|$|R
25|$|With another World War looming, 1939 was the {{beginning}} of a difficult period, not just for Pinchon and other artists, but for the vast majority of the world's nations. Pinchon was deeply saddened by the human folly that would lead to such a turn of events. Neither he nor anyone else could have imagined the human loss and destruction that would be unleashed on Rouen. Yet despite the carnage that followed, hope <b>and</b> <b>optimism</b> had not entirely vanished. The 30th Salon des artistes rouennais went ahead as scheduled, with its opening on 19 May 1940; however, due to the gravity of the situation, it was closed two days later. The first bombardment of the city began on June 5, followed by a mass exodus. On June 8 at 10:00p.m. the first German tanks rolled in on la route de Neufchatel, very close to the Pinchon residence.|$|E
25|$|The Tripartite {{model of}} {{subjective}} well-being (SWB) {{is a theory}} developed by Diener which describes how people experience {{the quality of their}} lives and includes both emotional reactions and cognitive judgments. Psychologists have defined happiness as a combination of life satisfaction and the relative frequency of positive and negative affect. SWB therefore encompasses moods and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life. Concepts encompassed by SWB include positive and negative affect, happiness, and life satisfaction. Positive psychology is particularly concerned with the study of SWB. SWB tends to be stable over time and is strongly related to personality traits. There is evidence that health and SWB may mutually influence each other, as good health tends to be associated with greater happiness, and {{a number of studies have}} found that positive emotions <b>and</b> <b>optimism</b> can have a beneficial influence on health.|$|E
25|$|Frontman Justin Pierre {{composed}} the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, growing older, {{and learning to}} live in the moment. The reflective tone includes subjects such as procrastination, relationship miscommunication, <b>and</b> <b>optimism,</b> but also personal struggles such as the death of loved ones. Many songs on Go were developed over years at a time, and several date to the band's first few studio albums. Musically, the album retains the band's pop-rock, Moog-based sound, with a heavier emphasis on electronic experimentation. Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008. Discussions with label founder Brett Gurewitz led the band to re-sign with Epitaph, who co-released Go alongside the band's own label, The Boombox Generation. It is the final album by the band to feature long-time drummer Tony Thaxton before he announced his departure on March, 20th, 2013.|$|E
40|$|Traits of <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> cynical hostility are {{features}} of personality that could influence {{the risk of}} falls and fractures by influencing risk-taking behaviors, health behaviors, or inflammation. To test the hypothesis that personality influences falls and fracture risk, we studied 87, 342 women enrolled in WHI-OS.

25|$|Players {{participate}} in a shared universe, {{with the ability to}} exchange planet information with other players, though the game is also fully playable offline; this is enabled by the procedural generation system that assures players find the same planet with the same features, lifeforms, and other aspects once given the planet coordinates, requiring no further data to be stored or retrieved from game servers. Nearly all elements of the game are procedurally generated, including star systems, planets and their ecosystems, flora, fauna and their behavioural patterns, artificial structures, and alien factions and their spacecraft. The founder of Hello Games, Sean Murray, had wanted to create a game that captured the sense of exploration <b>and</b> <b>optimism</b> of science fiction writings and art of the 1970s and 1980s with No Man's Sky. The title was developed over three years by a small team at Hello Games with promotional and publishing help from Sony Interactive Entertainment. The British band 65daysofstatic assisted in developing the game's music, with sound designer Paul Weir developing systems to procedurally generate the soundtrack.|$|E
25|$|Samasyā (Hindi: समस्या, meaning Difficulty): This canto, a soliloquy by Aṣṭāvakra in his mother's womb, {{deals with}} the notion of Samasyā or a difficulty. The canto is replete with pathos (Karuṇa Rasa), heroism (Vīra Rasa) <b>and</b> <b>optimism.</b> In the first 30 verses, various metaphors are painted for difficulty, which is {{universal}} and extremely powerful. Faith in God and determined action are the ways {{to get out of a}} difficulty, and Aṣṭāvakra is resolute that he will get out of his predicament too. In verses 61 to 82, the real nature of the Ātman (Self), without beginning and end, without birth and death, and beyond mortal difficulties is presented, according to the poet's philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita. Aṣṭāvakra then tells Kahola about his (Kahola's) imminent repentance, and that he is determined intent to live the life of a disabled. He requests his father not to curse anybody in future, and the canto ends with optimistic prophesies by Aṣṭāvakra that the curse of his father is a blessing in disguise for the disabled of the world, as Aṣṭāvakra will be their role model.|$|E
40|$|Using humour as {{a coping}} style is widely {{regarded}} as protective of mental health and well-being, <b>and</b> dispositional <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> self-efficacy have similar outcomes. This study compared the contribution of each of these attributes to well-being (as life satisfaction and psychological well-being) and mental health (as the absence of depression, anxiety, and stress). For the analyses, humour was measured by the Coping Humor Scale (CHS). A convenience sample of full-time employees (N= 362) were recruited from diverse occupations to complete an online survey. The results showed that there were significant correlations between the variables in the expected directions, such that greater levels of dispositional <b>optimism,</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> CHS were associated with greater levels of life satisfaction, psychological well-being and lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress. In the multiple regressions for each outcome, CHS was entered first <b>and</b> dispositional <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> self-efficacy as the second step. Interestingly, whilst the CHS was initially a significant predictor of all the outcomes, the addition of dispositional <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> self-efficacy mediated its effect. As such, greater dispositional <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> self-efficacy, rather than CHS, were the significant predictors of increased life satisfaction and psychological well-being and lower levels of depression, stress and anxiety. The exception to complete mediation was the significant relationship between CHS and depression which remained in addition to the other significant predictors. In this sample of working adults, when humour is measured as coping with problems, it appears {{to be part of the}} larger range of actions used by an individual with higher levels of <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> self-efficacy. However, humour remained an important coping strategy for individuals to alleviate any depressive symptoms that they may experience...|$|R
