5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E

25|$|Skybus charged extra {{fees for}} almost {{everything}} {{other than the}} ticket itself. This is common among European low-cost carriers, but was almost unheard of at the time among major US carriers.

The first two bags less than fifty pounds were $10 each online or $12 each <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> with each additional bag after two incurring a charge of $50 per bag. Overweight baggage, those weighing over fifty but under seventy-five pounds, was charged an extra $25, and all bags over seventy-five pounds were not accepted.

Customers connecting on Skybus flights in Columbus were required to collect any checked luggage, then re-check it in Columbus for the second flight. Even though Skybus did not through-check luggage, delayed luggage was a continuing problem for its outsourced ground crews.|$|E

That {{was part of the}} fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble." [...] About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, [...] "We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. John Richardson, the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it." ...|$|E

She applies for a job in a lawyer's office, but leaves when the man insults her.

She applies for work in a factory, but is rejected, owing to lack of experience. Finally, in desperation, she takes a place as maid in the home of Mrs. Gray. There Burg, the offensive lawyer, meets her, and in a spirit of revenge, denounces her as a thief. The mistress discharges her and Susan decides to end her life. Fortunately for Susan, Burg meets Jim Briggs, the rejected suitor, on the street and laughingly tells him how he brought about Susan's discharge. Jim knocks the wretch down and rushes to Mrs. Gray's residence. He arrives in time to dissuade Susan from her purpose, and all ends happily to the peal of wedding chimes." ...|$|E
