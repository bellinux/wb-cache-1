5|$|After Kerr {{resigned}} as Governor-General, he still sought a government position, reasoning {{that it had}} been his intent to remain for ten years as Governor-General. However, Fraser's attempt to appoint Kerr as ambassador to UNESCO (a position later held by Whitlam) provoked such public outcry that the nomination was withdrawn. The Kerrs spent the next several years living in Europe, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> died in Australia in 1991, his death was not announced until after he was buried.|$|E

He also kills Erc, and takes his head back to Tara, where Erc's sister Achall dies of grief for her brother.|$|E
5|$|Despite his fierce nature, Auerbach {{was popular}} among his players. He {{recalled}} that on his 75th birthday party, 45 {{of his former}} players showed up; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> turned 80, his perennial 1960s victim Wilt Chamberlain showed up, a gesture which Auerbach dearly appreciated.|$|E
5|$|Devastated, Darin {{becomes a}} recluse {{living in a}} trailer on the Big Sur coast in California. He finds himself {{out of step with}} {{changing}} music trends, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> tries to adapt by incorporating folk music and protest songs into his repertoire, he finds himself rejected by the audience that once embraced him. Undaunted, he stages a show, complete with a gospel choir, at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, and against all odds it is a huge success.|$|E

5|$|In John (18:1–11), Jesus {{does not}} pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as {{scarcely}} touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> does, {{the soldiers and}} officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.|$|E
5|$|In a naval {{battle the}} Athenians led by Pericles and nine other generals {{defeated}} {{the forces of}} Samos and imposed on the island an Athenian administration.

5|$|Innocent XII's age {{and health}} {{had been a}} topic of {{conversation}} among European courts and cardinals, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> became sick in November 1699 speculation as to the next conclave became more ernest. Despite this, France was the only great power {{to have a clear}} policy regarding the next papal conclave.

5|$|Night of January 16th was {{the last}} {{theatrical}} success for either Rand or Woods. Rand's next play, Ideal, went unsold, and a 1940 stage adaptation of We the Living flopped.
