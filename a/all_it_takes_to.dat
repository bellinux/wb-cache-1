He further commented, [...] "the message, it seems, is clear: There is might in masses, a freedom in unity and strength in conviction. And <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> harness any of it is will." [...] Montgomery also noticed that although the band's previous videos were more elaborate, [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] was [...] "no less of an epic undertaking".

In 2013, Kerrang! magazine included [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] among the best music videos by Thirty Seconds to Mars, noting that [...] "the band never shy away from a challenge, making full use of frontman Jared Leto's Hollywood experience and delivering huge, concept-based short films." ...|$|E

50|$|To Althea from prison, {{written by}} Richard Lovelace in 1642, {{was a result}} of Lovelace’s imprisonment. According to luminarium.org, that year, Richard Lovelace {{presented}} a petition to the British parliament that protested the Bishops Exclusion Bill. The bill prevented those heavily involved with the Churches of England to enact any temporal control. Lovelace on the other hand protested that the role of Anglican Bishops that were excluded be restored in Parliament. In the poem, Richard Lovelace continues his desire to protest by undermining the “justice system” of England. Lovelace touts that obeying the King and following England’s orders does not make him free. Similarly, Lovelace states that being in a jail does not mean he is imprisoned. Freedom and imprisonment stem from the body and soul. Lovelace’s writing is both significant and brave because he lived in a time where freedom of speech was far from guaranteed. A simple petition was <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> lead to his imprisonment.|$|R
