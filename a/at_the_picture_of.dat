5|$|The first {{project to}} {{describe}} {{the shape of the}} Milky Way and the position of the Sun was undertaken by William Herschel in 1785 by counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the Solar System close to the center. Using a refined approach, Kapteyn in 1920 arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a small (diameter about 15kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the center. A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloguing of globular clusters led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70kiloparsecs and the Sun far from the center. Both analyses failed {{to take into account the}} absorption of light by interstellar dust present in the galactic plane, but after Robert Julius Trumpler quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open clusters, the present picture of our host galaxy, the Milky Way, emerged.|$|E
25|$|In {{the present}} time, the four friends {{eventually}} lose touch with one another, as evident when Cynthia (Stockard Channing) is tearfully gazing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> {{the four of}} them on that graduation day. Now wealthy and living in a luxurious penthouse, she gives her maid her own Bulgari pearl necklace (matching the three she gave to her friends on graduation day), and has the maid mail letters to them. She later walks outside of the balcony of her penthouse in a floor length fur coat, a cigarette and a drink, and then commits suicide by jumping to her death after learning through the tabloids that her ex-husband Gil (whom Cynthia made wealthy through her connections, according to narrator Annie) married his much younger mistress the day before.|$|E
2500|$|The {{value of}} Wingate's Chindits has been disputed. Field Marshal William Slim argued that special forces in general had an overall {{negative}} effect on the prosecution of war by separating the best-trained and most committed troops from the main army. [...] However Sir Robert Thompson, a Chindit who went on to become one of [...] "world's leading expert on countering the Mao Tse-tung technique of rural guerrilla insurgency", wrote in his autobiography that [...] "Every time I look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> General Slim and his Corps Commanders being knighted by Lord Wavell as Viceroy on the field of battle after Imphal, I see the ghost of Wingate present. He was unquestionably one of the great men of [...] century".|$|E
5000|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> Hotel dei Duchi in Spoleto, Calder {{found some}} copies of old prints {{depicting}} Lombard dukes. Looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> duke Theodelap with his sharp-pointed crown, Calder said without hesitation: [...] "This {{is the name}} of the object" ...|$|R

60|$|She {{rose and}} paid her check. She did not glance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the bunnies in a basket. She passed out heavily, {{a woman of}} sterile sorrow.|$|E
6000|$|The Colonel asked Mr. George {{if he had}} {{had good}} sport? [...] "No," [...] says George, curtly. [...] "Have you?" [...] And then he looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> his father, which hung in the parlour.|$|E
50|$|Later, a distraught Nicki cleans out Stacy's {{locker and}} cries {{as she looks}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> them, remembering their {{friendship}} and guiltily wishing that she had acted sooner to have saved her. The film ends with Nicki and her boyfriend leaving a bouquet of roses on <b>the</b> sand <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lake in memory of Stacy.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Mrs. Puff-Pudgy, {{looking up}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a sad-faced prairie-dog; [...] "Mr. Puff-Pudgy {{made it all}} himself. He was very handy at such things. It's a shame he turned out so obstinate." ...|$|E
60|$|The man {{spoke in}} a low voice, but somehow his words had the quality of {{exciting}} the imagination. Bradley thrilled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> moral disintegration hinted at. The imaginative tragedy was brought very close to him.|$|E
60|$|He waited half an {{hour before}} she came into the boarding-house parlor. Fifty times he opened the book of {{photographs}} of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893, fifty times he looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the Court of Honor.|$|E

60|$|Jethro turned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> words, {{and came}} and stood looking over Wetherell's {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> mother and daughter. In the rosewood box was a brooch {{and a gold}} ring--Cynthia Ware's wedding ring--and two small slips of yellow paper. William Wetherell opened one of these, disclosing a little braid of brown hair. He folded the paper again and laid it in the locket, and handed that to Jethro.|$|R

60|$|Fordyce, {{looking up}} at her, was filled with astonishment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> grace and ease which she presented, as she leaned to take his hand. She shone, unmistakable {{mistress}} of the car, while Haney filled the rôle of trusted Irish coachman.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked again}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the bird. It perched cheerfully under a blue sky, with robust, jolly ivy leaves near. He was {{gathering}} his courage to depart. He looked down, but struggled {{hard not to}} take in the sight of his wife's face.|$|E
60|$|He {{studied it}} for a few minutes in {{thoughtful}} silence. He looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the Man who had taken the course being fawned upon by lovely women, while the man who had let this opportunity slip stood outside the group gazing with a wistful envy.|$|E
50|$|On {{the day of}} {{the divorce}} hearing, Mangalam, now the pop group’s manager, fields many calls to replace Harini with another girl. When Harini looks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> pretty girls vying to be the group’s new lead female vocal, a bout of jealousy strikes her. She gets angry and starts hitting Munna. As the two fight, they share a kiss and it is implied that they are back together.|$|R
5|$|Reyes' numerology {{theories}} {{do not go}} down well <b>at</b> <b>the</b> FBI, but {{the pattern}} of the killings, when viewed on a map, seem to line up as the number six (6). After looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims, Scully realizes that the pattern on the victims was not three circles, but instead, three sixes, the mark of the devil. Meanwhile, Wayno has several additional run-ins with the mysterious man, who continues to give cryptic advice.|$|R
2500|$|The final {{episode of}} Another World aired on June 25, 1999. The episode {{revolved}} around the wedding of Cass and Lila. In the show's final scene, Rachel and Carl happily embraced in the Cory living room, she remarked [...] "All's well that ends well," [...] and, after looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> all her loved ones, Rachel went upstairs with Carl. The final image was a still frame of Mac and the show faded to black.|$|R
60|$|They {{all became}} silent; with the impressibility {{of their age}} {{they were ready to}} burst into tears <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> {{finality}} she had conjured up, though all the day hitherto they had been rejoicing in the idea of a new place. Tess changed the subject.|$|E
6000|$|Helen {{started as}} she gazed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> {{the boy and}} the pony. The face was like, and yet unlike, that of the gaunt and hungry man whom she had first seen sitting upon the fallen fir. [...] "Yes," [...] she {{answered}} gravely; [...] "I know him. I met Mr. Thurston in British Columbia." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, very much," [...] {{and now for}} {{the first}} time she got her voice fairly above a whisper. She took the sheet down from the music-rest and looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the lithographed title. It was of a tiled roof lifted among {{cypresses}} and laurels with pigeons strutting on it and sailing over it.|$|E

50|$|Tony is {{fascinated with}} art, {{and goes to}} the club that his mom works at to draw <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ladies.

60|$|When Neangir had emptied his glass, {{his host}} opened the mother-of-pearl box {{and held it}} out to him. Neangir was beside himself with delight <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a young maiden more {{beautiful}} than anything he had ever dreamed of. He stood speechless before it, while his breast swelled with a feeling quite new to him.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, {{and he sat}} down, with {{a troubled}} glance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a {{handsome}} man, which hung over his table. It was Laurie's father, who had run away in his youth, and married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past, and {{she wished she had}} held her tongue.|$|E
60|$|Despite her sudden jealousy Viviette's {{eyes grew}} moist <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> her {{innocent}} Swithin {{going into the}} world without a friend or counsellor.

6000|$|They {{had already}} {{put him through}} the first stage. They had, three days ago, called on him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Grand Palaver and served him with a {{pamphlet}} on [...] "The Excavation of Mitylene" [...] {{as a sort of}} writ. Tomlinson and his wife had looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruins, and from the appearance of them they judged that Mitylene was in Mexico, and they said that it was a shame to see it in that state and that the United States ought to intervene.|$|R
60|$|It is {{from the}} great {{sympathetic}} center of the solar plexus that the child rejoices in the mother and in its own blissful centrality, its unison with the as yet unknown universe. Look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> Madonna and Child, and you will even see it. It is from this center that it draws all things unto itself, winningly, drawing love for the soul, and actively drawing in milk. The same center controls the great intake of love and of milk, of psychic and of physical nourishment.|$|R
