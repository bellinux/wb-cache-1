5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E

When Warren learns Blake is friends with Chris, he decides {{to put a stop}} to the situation. Warren threatens to kill Chris unless he stops {{spending}} time with Blake. Mason told TV Week that he thinks it is <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> Chris and Blake cannot continue their friendship because of Warren and his views. It soon becomes clear someone is spying on Chris, but whether it is Warren or someone else is not clear. Mason added something big would happen and it may not end well for Chris.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson County sheriff moved Dinning to Bowling Green and {{eventually}} to Louisville {{to prevent him from}} being lynched. Governor Bradley dispatched a squad of the state militia to protect him while his trial proceeded. Despite the fact that the case involved a black man killing a white man, most observers believed Dinning would be acquitted on grounds of self-defense. The jury, however, convicted Dinning of manslaughter and sentenced him to seven years of hard labor. Immediately, Bradley's office was flooded with requests for him to intervene on Dinning's behalf. The requests came from blacks and whites, some of them ex-Confederates. Dinning's attorney, Augustus E. Willson, formally requested a pardon, and Bradley issued it 10days after the conviction. Bradley opined that Dinning had acted reasonably under the circumstances and that it was <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that no members of the mob were charged. After being freed, Dinning relocated to Indiana and hired ex-Confederate Bennett H. Young to file a federal lawsuit against some members of the mob that had identified themselves during his trial. The trial was held in Louisville, and Dinning was awarded $50,000 in damages.|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} with church and cathedral officials, held on 11 June, reporters noted that three people had been shot within {{the city in the}} {{previous}} 72 hours. The attendees produced a letter by the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, on behalf of the Dean and Canons of Manchester Cathedral to Sony. It stated that they were currently seeking the advice of lawyers in the matter, and reserved their legal position in relation to the same. It demanded a substantial donation for the cathedral's work with youth in resisting the culture of gun crime and other forms of violence in our society. It further demanded the immediate withdrawal of the game, and that Sony not re-issue it without removing the section of the game containing the Cathedral interior. Govender described the use of images of the cathedral as virtual desecration. The letter stressed that they were in consultation with their lawyers and urged Sony to contact them so there can be a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter. Govender told reporters that the church officials had only been told of the content on 8 June 2007, and, after watching footage of gameplay posted on YouTube, said they were dismayed beyond belief and were shocked to see a place of worship being presented to youths as a place where guns may be fired, and that every year, they invite hundreds of teenagers to see the Cathedral and appreciate it as an alternative to violence. They added that it was <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to have a game like this undermining such important work. They also sought that Sony apologise unreservedly.|$|E

McBride scored his first goal since his injury against Everton at Craven Cottage on March 16, 2008, in a 1–0 victory for Fulham. The then-Fulham manager Chris Coleman commented it was such <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that McBride hadn't been 'discovered' earlier in his career, and played more in England.|$|E

25|$|In November 1991, Schweizer Illustrierte {{magazine}} {{published an}} article on black money held in secret accounts by Imelda Marcos and 14 other rulers of Third World countries. Citing McKinsey as a source, the article stated that Rajiv Gandhi held 2.5 billion Swiss francs in secret Indian accounts in Switzerland. Several leaders of opposition parties in India have raised the issue, citing the Schweizer Illustrierte article. In December 1991, Amal Datta raised {{the issue in the}} Indian Parliament; the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Shivraj Patil, expunged Rajiv Gandhi's name from the proceedings. In December 2011, Subramanian Swamy wrote to the director of the Central Bureau of Investigation, citing the article and asking him to take action on black money accounts of the Nehru-Gandhi family. On 29 December 2011, Ram Jethmalani made an indirect reference to the issue in the Rajya Sabha, calling it <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that one of India's former Prime Ministers was named by a Swiss magazine. This was met by uproar and a demand for withdrawal of the remark by the ruling Congress party members.|$|E
25|$|Habib Bourguiba {{was officially}} born on August 3, 1903, in Monastir to Ali Bourguiba (1850–1925) and Fattouma Khefacha (1861–1913). Being their eighth and last child, his birth was <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> {{to his mother}} and a worry to his father, who {{conceived}} him in an advanced age. Born into a modest family, the young Habib was raised in a female environment and was marked by gender inequality. Despite his financial conditions, Ali Bourguiba decided to invest his money in the education of his son and therefore, avoid him his fate of being enrolled in the army. Likewise, he sent his son to Tunis, circa 1907, to live with his brother M'hamed, in order to study in elementary school of Sadiki. Separated from his mother at 5, he lived in modest conditions in the capital city, and the Jellaz Affair made a deep impression on him. In 1913, he obtained his Certificat d'études primaires to the relief of his father, exempting him from military service and permitted him to pursue his secondary education in Sadiki. However, in the same year, he lost his mother at the age of 10, which marked his entire life.|$|E
25|$|It {{caused him}} to reflect. But there was no result. The {{justice of the peace}} was a stern man. On the trial he found fault with the scheme and {{required}} us to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.” The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” Then he said to the jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for this would be to put <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> upon charity and dishonor it.” He said it in open court, before everybody, and to me it did not seem very kind.|$|E
