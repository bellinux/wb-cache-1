40|$|Parallel {{correlated}} {{double sampling}} technique for pipelined <b>analogue-to-digital</b> <b>converters</b> load. The effective gain of the opamp now becomes (A 1 A 2) 2, where A 2 is the gain {{of the second}} stage. T. Musah, B. R. Gregoire, E. Naviasky and U. -K.

The new technique employs a lowgain two-stage opamp with the second stage made up of multiple gain stages in parallel. The superior noise performance of the proposed technique to correlated double sampling is shown. Introduction: In a switch-capacitor realisation of the multiplying digitalto-analogue converter (MDAC) used in algorithmic and pipeline <b>analogue-to-digital</b> <b>converters</b> (ADCs), the settling behaviour of the opamp determines the speed and accuracy of the ADC.

50|$|The {{idea was}} first {{described}} in 1964. In this, the 'ranging' {{was to be}} applied to the analogue signal before the <b>analogue-to-digital</b> <b>converter</b> (ADC) and after the digital-to-analogue converter (DAC). The application of this to broadcasting, in which the companding was to be done entirely digitally after the ADC and before the DAC, was described in a 1972 BBC Research Report.|$|E
50|$|In signal {{acquisition}} and audio, anti-aliasing is often done using an analogue anti-aliasing filter {{to remove the}} out-of-band component of the input signal prior to sampling with an <b>analogue-to-digital</b> <b>converter.</b> In digital photography, optical anti-aliasing filters are made of birefringent materials, and smooth the signal in the spatial optical domain. The anti-aliasing filter essentially blurs the image slightly {{in order to reduce}} the resolution to or below that achievable by the digital sensor (the larger the pixel pitch, the lower the achievable resolution at the sensor level).|$|E
50|$|Data was {{transmitted}} to Earth {{in real time}} {{at the end of}} each science observation. The camera read-out formed an image of 768&times;768 pixels, and the <b>analogue-to-digital</b> <b>converter</b> resulted in a dynamic range of 8 bits. The data was then {{transmitted to}} Earth via one of six transmitters on the spacecraft; four were S-band transmitters, placed at points around the spacecraft such that no matter what its attitude, one could transmit to the ground, and two were VHF transmitters, which could sustain a lower bandwidth, but consumed less power, and also transmitted in all directions. The VHF transmitters were used when the spacecraft was in the Earth's shadow and thus reliant on battery power instead of solar power.|$|E

I {{thought that if}} we took a sample of an instrument and had {{a look at the}} harmonics we could get an idea of how to synthesise it. We were already making interesting sounds but we were still a long way from getting it to sound like a real instrument, like a piano or a trumpet. So I hooked an <b>analogue-to-digital</b> <b>converter</b> up to the radio and sampled maybe a second of some piano piece. Then I wondered how it would sound if I played it back without doing anything. So I played it back at different pitches and it sounded remarkably like a piano, a real piano. This had never been done before. ... By todays standards it was a pretty awful piano sound, but {{at the time it was}} a million times more like a piano than anything any synthesiser had churned out. So I rapidly realised that we didnt have to bother with all the synthesis stuff. Just take the sounds, whack them in the memory and away you go." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} factors affect how precise a signal is, mainly the noise present in the {{original}} signal and the noise added by processing (see signal-to-noise ratio). Fundamental physical limits such as the shot noise in components limits the resolution of analogue signals. In digital electronics additional precision is obtained by using additional digits to represent the signal. The practical limit {{in the number of}} digits is determined by the performance of the <b>analogue-to-digital</b> <b>converter</b> (ADC), since digital operations can usually be performed without loss of precision. The ADC takes an analogue signal and changes it into a series of binary numbers. The ADC may be used in simple digital display devices, e. g., thermometers or light meters but it may also be used in digital sound recording and in data acquisition. However, a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC) is used to change a digital signal to an analogue signal. A DAC takes a series of binary numbers and converts it to an analogue signal. It is common to find a DAC in the gain-control system of an op-amp which in turn may be used to control digital amplifiers and filters.|$|E
