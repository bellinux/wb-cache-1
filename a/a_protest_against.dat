He deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball, much to Bradman's displeasure, in <b>a</b> <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> the one-sided nature of the contest.|$|E

5|$|Mirror's Edge {{takes place}} in a 'utopian' city where life is {{comfortable}} and crime almost non-existent. But the city's state of bliss is the achievement of a domineering and totalitarian military regime which monitors all communication, controls the media, spies on its citizens and has policies which include the outright prohibition of smoking and alcohol. The City also operates sham trials and runs on a sham democracy. Eighteen years before the events of the game, they had opened fire on <b>a</b> <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> their rule, killing many civilians.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 2006, over 600 people {{attended}} <b>a</b> <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> the high carbon emissions. It was coordinated by the Camp for Climate Action group.

Thirty-nine people were arrested after trying illegally to gain access to the plant.|$|E

5|$|After the war Helm {{identified}} with the Democratic Party, and {{he returned to the}} state senate in 1865. During his tenure he chaired the Committee on Federal Relations and fought against punitive and restrictive laws against ex-Confederates. On January 22, 1866 he presented to the state senate <b>a</b> <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> the actions of the United States Congress during the Civil War. It denounced the Reconstruction Amendments {{on the grounds that they}} granted powers to the federal government that were reserved for the states, and that they were passed while many southern states were not represented in Congress. He also decried the creation and operation of the Freedmen's Bureau. On January 29, 1867, Helm introduced legislation to organize a meeting in Louisville to rally support for President Andrew Johnson and his efforts to restore the Union.|$|E
5|$|Anniversaries of {{the most}} {{important}} events of Stephen's life have been officially celebrated since the 1870s, including in 1871 the defiant show of solidarity at Putna. This doubled as <b>a</b> <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> Austria-Hungary, which had annexed Bukovina; it was organized by Teodor V. Ștefanelli and was notably attended by poet Mihai Eminescu. Nationalist interpretations still prevailed, particularly after 1881, when Eminescu dedicated his poem Doina (written in the style of traditional Romanian song) to Stephen, calling upon him to leave his grave to again lead his people. His statue was ultimately raised in Iași in 1883.|$|E
5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This was more than <b>a</b> <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye {{was seen as a}} more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E

5|$|Before World War I, {{the city}} had a {{population}} that was 42% ethnic German, 41% Hungarian and 15% Slovak (1910 census). After World War I {{and the formation of}} Czechoslovakia on October 28, 1918, the city was incorporated into the new state despite its representatives' reluctance. The dominant Hungarian and German population tried to prevent annexation of the city to Czechoslovakia and declared it a free city. However, the Czechoslovak Legions occupied the city on January 1, 1919, and made it part of Czechoslovakia. The city became the seat of Slovakia's political organs and organizations and became Slovakia's capital on 4 February. On February 12, 1919 the German and Hungarian population started <b>a</b> <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> the Czechoslovak occupation, but the Czechoslovak Legions opened fire on the unarmed demonstrators.|$|E
5|$|Diderot, Mirabeau and Vergniaud briefly {{participated in}} the {{occupation}} of Constantinople {{after the end of}} the war and the latter two ships were sent to the Black Sea in early 1919 during the Southern Russia Intervention. Vergniauds crew mutinied after one of its members was killed when <b>a</b> <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> intervention in support of the Whites was bloodily suppressed and forced the return of the French ships supporting the Whites. Mirabeau ran aground in February 1919 off the coast of the Crimea and could not be refloated until some of her guns and armor were removed.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Pennsylvania law {{required}} that school students read Bible verses {{to start the}} day. The Abington School District added another requirement that the students read the Lord's Prayer. Several Unitarians in Abington, a suburb of Philadelphia, objected and held <b>a</b> <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> it. One of them, Ellery Schempp, contacted the American Civil Liberties Union about the issue. The ACLU and Schempp's parents believed the school prayer law violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The ACLU's lawyers saw Sawyer as the best choice to argue it, given his skill as a litigator and his success in the Deutch case. Sawyer agreed and filed suit in federal district court.|$|E
