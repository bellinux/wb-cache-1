40|$|Abstract—Routing packets into <b>a</b> {{wireless}} <b>mesh</b> <b>network</b> {{is different}} from routing packets out. Because, for routing packets out of <b>a</b> wireless <b>mesh</b> <b>network</b> only <b>a</b> single destination has to be maintained, the default route to the gateways. In contrast for routing packets into <b>a</b> wireless <b>mesh</b> <b>network,</b> <b>a</b> proper route has to be maintained for every single node in the mesh. In this paper, we compare three different methods for routing packets into <b>a</b> wireless <b>mesh</b> <b>network.</b> We show that a proactive field based routing outperforms all others {{with respect to the}} packet delivery ratio while wireless mesh gateway routing is the most scalable to the network size and still has a very high packet delivery ratio.
