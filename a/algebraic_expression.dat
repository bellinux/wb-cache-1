40|$|AbstractAlgebraic {{expressions}} and linear equations are {{a vital part}} of the secondary school mathematics. A substantial amount of research has shown that students have some difficulties recognizing the structure of both of these concepts. In this study, it is analyzing the students’ understanding of the differences and similarities between <b>algebraic</b> <b>expressions</b> and linear equations. For this purpose, six eighth grade students were interviewed and observed as they worked with various mathematical tasks relating to <b>algebraic</b> <b>expressions</b> and linear equations. The data collected in this study showed that these students simplified <b>algebraic</b> <b>expressions</b> and solved linear equations with one unknown, arriving at the correct result. But, they still had difficulties indicating a relation between <b>algebraic</b> <b>expressions</b> and linear equations...|$|R

25|$|An {{unresolved}} root, {{especially one}} using the radical symbol, {{is often referred}} to as a surd or a radical. Any expression containing a radical, whether it is a square root, a cube root, or a higher root, is called a radical expression, and if it contains no transcendental functions or transcendental numbers it is called an <b>algebraic</b> <b>expression.</b>|$|E

A large amount of research has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the real or complex solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see Root-finding algorithm) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations (see System of polynomial equations).|$|E

This Diploma Thesis deals with numerical and <b>algebraic</b> <b>expressions</b> in elementary school. The theoretical part {{deals with the}} framework educational programme for elementary education and grammar schools. It further mentions the propaedeutic of <b>algebraic</b> <b>expressions</b> at {{the first and second}} levels. It also introduces the most frequent mistakes done in calculating <b>algebraic</b> <b>expressions.</b> Meanings for the variable are stated as well. The last pre-chapter of the theoretical part is focused on statistics, which is further used for the experiment result evaluation. The experimental part first states the aims and methods of the research. Selected elementary schools taking part in the experiment are further introduced. An analysis of mathematics text books for the eighth grade (mainly chapters concerning the <b>algebraic</b> <b>expressions),</b> the selected schools use in their lessons, is also carried out. The experimental part also introduces the test presented to 128 pupils. Further pre-chapters are devoted to hypotheses and expected mistakes in single subtasks.
