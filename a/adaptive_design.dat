The researchers calculate that without any adaptive urban design, by 2100 the expansion of existing U.S. cities into regional megalopolises could raise near-surface temperatures between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius over large regions, [...] "a significant fraction of the 21st-century greenhouse gas-induced climate change simulated by global climate models." [...] Large-scale <b>adaptive</b> <b>design</b> could completely offset this increase, however. For example, the temperature increase in California was calculated to be as high as 1.31 degrees Celsius, but a 100% deployment of [...] "cool roofs" [...] would result in a temperature drop of 1.47 degrees Celsius—more than the increase.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to the expensive and lengthy process of developing a new medicine, the attrition rate in clinical research was on the rise, resulting in stagnation {{in the development of}} new compounds. As a consequence to this, the US Food and Drug Administration released a critical path initiative document in 2004, highlighting the need for developing innovative trial designs. One of the innovations suggested the use of <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> for clinical trials. Thus, post critical path initiative, there is a growing interest in using <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> for the development of pharmaceutical products. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> are expected to have great potential {{to reduce the number of}} patients and duration of trial and to have relatively less exposure to new drug. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> are not new in the sense that the task of interim analysis (IA) /review of the accumulated data used in <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> existed in the past too. However, such reviews/analyses of accumulated data were not necessarily planned at the stage of planning clinical trial and the methods used were not necessarily compliant with clinical trial process. The Bayesian approach commonly used in <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> was developed by Thomas Bayes in the 18 th century, about hundred years prior to the development of modern statistical methods by the father of modern statistics, Sir Ronald A. Fisher, but the complexity involved in Bayesian approach prevented its use in real life practice. The advances in the field of computer and information technology over the last three to four decades has changed the scenario and the Bayesian techniques are being used in <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> in {{addition to}} other sequential methods used in IA.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} two-stage <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> with interim treatment selection. It includes two articles entitled (1) Shrinkage estimation in two-stage <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> with midtrial treatment selection and (2) <b>Adaptive</b> seamless <b>designs</b> with interim treatment selection: {{a case study}} in oncology. Both articles are published in the journal Statistics in Medicine. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> for clinical trials allow interim data-driven design modifications while maintaining the rigor and validity of the statistical inference [1]. Design adaptations may include early stopping for efficacy, futility or safety, reassessment of the overall sample size, adjustments to the study population (e. g. restriction to a sub-population), changes to endpoints or hypothesis to be tested as well as dropping or adding treatment arms. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> have gained considerable popularity in recent years among clinical trialists because of their potential to improve efficiency in drug development. There are also ethical considerations that support the use of adaptive designs; for example, <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> can reduce the number of patients within the trial who are treated with non-effective treatments. Overall, <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> provide the same scientific rigor that is required in more traditional study designs while potentially utilizing fewer resources. However, while the increase in flexibility of <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> offers great opportunities, it also brings limitations and pitfalls which should be carefully assessed when <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> are intended to be used in confirmatory trials [2], [3]. In the traditional drug development process, a phase II study typically compares several treatments (e. g. different doses of a new compound) to a control. The objective of the study is to determine whether the development of the compound should be continued and, if so, which treatment(s) or dose(s) should be further investigated. The phase II study also provides initial estimates of treatment effect, which are used to power the subsequent phase III study. The phase III study is then conducted as a stand-alone confirmatory study, disregarding all data collected on the phase II study. One of the most appealing applications of <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> is to combine phase II and phase III studies of the traditional drug development process into a single seamless phase II/III confirmatory study (see [4] and [5] for comprehensive summaries). Bauer and Kieser [6] proposed two-stage <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> that allow the integration of the treatment selection and the confirmatory testing of efficacy for the selected treatments within a single study. An important feature of these designs {{is the fact that the}} treatment selection rule does not need to be pre-specified, which gives considerable flexibility to the inherently complex interim decision process. Hommel [7] extended Bauer and Kieser's work to allow design modifications which include interim changes to the primary endpoint as well as addition of experimental treatments. All these <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> (see also [8]) propose tests that control the family-wise type I error rate in the strong sense; that is, the probability that any treatment is erroneously declared significantly superior to the control is maintained below a pre-specified significance level under all possible configurations of effective and ineffective treatments. In the introduction of the dissertation, we discuss hypothesis testing and estimation in two-stage <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> with interim treatment selection, which serve as a summary of the topics developed in the two articles...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> are {{somewhat}} underused, despite prominence given to methodology in the statistical literature. Some concerns relates to robustness of <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> in decision making, acceptability of trial findings to change practice, anxiety about early stopping of trials {{and worry about}} wrong decision making. These issues could be linked to inadequate reporting of the conduct of such clinical trials. We assess the reporting of group sequential randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which {{are one of the}} most well-understood <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> in the confirmatory setting. Methods: We undertake a systematic review searching Ovid MEDLINE from 1 st January 2001 to 23 rd September 2014 and including parallel group confirmatory group sequential RCTs that were prospectively designed using the Frequentist approach. Eligible trials are screened for completeness in reporting against the CONSORT 2010 checklist with some proposed modifications to capture issues such as statistical bias correction following early stopping. Descriptive statistics aided with forest plots on CONSORT compliance are presented. Discussion: Reporting of the conduct of <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> is an area which has not been fully explored. Hence, the findings from this study can enlighten us on the adequacy in reporting of well-understood group sequential RCTs as a class of <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> and on ways to address some of the cited concerns.

40|$|Prior {{work has}} shown that certain types of <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> can always be {{dominated}} by a suitably chosen, standard, group sequential design. This applies to <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> with rules for modifying the total sample size. A natural question is whether analogous results hold for other types of <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs.</b> We focus on <b>adaptive</b> enrichment <b>designs,</b> which involve preplanned rules for modifying enrollment criteria based on accrued data in a randomized trial. Such designs often involve multiple hypotheses, e. g., one for the total population and one for a predefined subpopulation, such as those with high disease severity at baseline. We fix the total sample size, and consider overall power, defined as the probability of rejecting at least one false null hypothesis. We present <b>adaptive</b> enrichment <b>designs</b> whose overall power at two alternatives cannot simultaneously be matched by any standard design. In some scenarios {{there is a substantial}} gap between the overall power achieved by these <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> and that of any standard design. We also prove that such gains in overall power come at a cost. To attain overall power above what is achievable by certain standard designs, it is necessary to increase power to reject some hypotheses and reduce power to reject others. We conclude by showing the class of <b>adaptive</b> enrichment <b>designs</b> allows certain power tradeoffs that are not available when restricting to standard designs.

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been given in recent years to <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> of clinical trials as ethical alternatives when the traditional randomization becomes ethically infeasible.

Under regularity conditions, the logarithm of likelihood ratio statistic 2 ln[lambda] for dependent data is shown to be asymptotically chi-square distributed, providing a foundation for asymptotic analysis of adaptive clinical trials with k treatments.

40|$|Methods {{allowing}} unplanned {{adaptations to}} {{the sample size}} based on the interim estimate of treatment effect do not base inference on the minimal sufficient statistic and suffer losses in efficiency when compared to group sequential designs [1, 2, 3]. However, when adaptive sampling plans are completely pre-specified {{at the design stage}} of the trial, investigators can proceed with frequentist inference based on the minimal sufficient statistic at the analysis stage. In the context of two general settings where different optimality criteria govern the choice of clinical trial design, we quantify the relative costs and benefits of a variety of fixed sample, group sequential, and pre-specified <b>adaptive</b> <b>designs</b> with respect to standard operating characteristics.

In addition, we describe optimal rules for modifying the sample size, providing efficient adaptation boundaries on a variety of scales for the interim test statistic for adaptation analyses occurring at several different stages of the trial.
