25|$|Subjective evaluations: Traditional {{performance}} appraisals {{are often}} {{based upon a}} manager's or supervisor's perceptions of an employee's performance and employees are evaluated subjectively rather than objectively.

Reviews should instead be based on data-supported, measurable behaviors and results within the performers control.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{cleanroom}} {{was invented}} by American physicist Willis Whitfield. <b>As</b> <b>employee</b> of the Sandia National Laboratories, Whitfield created the initial plans for the cleanroom in 1960.

Whitfield designed his cleanroom with a constant, highly filtered air flow to flush out impurities. Within {{a few years of}} its invention in the 1960s, Whitfield's modern cleanroom had generated more than 50 billion USD in sales worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Counterproductive work {{behavior}} (CWB) can {{be defined}} <b>as</b> <b>employee</b> behavior that goes against the goals of an organization. These behaviors can be intentional or unintentional and result {{from a wide range}} of underlying causes and motivations. Some CWBs have instrumental motivations (e.g., theft). It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of counterproductive behaviors (Fox and Spector, 1999). For instance, an employee who sabotages another employee's work may do so because of lax supervision (environment) and underlying psychopathology (person) that work in concert to result in the counterproductive behavior. There is evidence that an emotional response (e.g., anger) to job stress (e.g., unfair treatment) can motivate CWBs.|$|E

25|$|Productive {{behavior}} is defined <b>as</b> <b>employee</b> behavior that contributes positively {{to the goals}} and objectives of an organization. When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during {{which he or she}} may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee. I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or task performance, including in-role and extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they do what they were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.|$|E
500|$|SmarTrip and CharmCard have {{different}} qualifications for inter-system usage, e.g. using CharmCard on non-MTA providers, and using SmarTrip on MTA. Passes and non-cash loads (such <b>as</b> <b>employee</b> transit benefits) are stored {{on the card}} in a separate [...] "purse" [...] from cash loads. Purse benefits can only be used on the issuing system for that benefit, so a day pass issued by MTA on either a CharmCard or SmarTrip will only be valid on MTA, and a WMATA-issued monthly pass will not be valid on MTA {{even if it was}} loaded on a CharmCard. This does mean it is possible to have identical or different passes (like a monthly pass from one and a day pass from the other) from both WMATA and MTA simultaneously loaded on the same card. Monthly transit benefits provided by an employer will only be valid for whichever system the employer is registered with, so an employer who is registered to provide transit benefits with WMATA will only grant benefits usable on WMATA and Washington, DC-area transit providers, even if the benefits are loaded on a CharmCard. Cash loaded on either card is valid on both WMATA and MTA vehicles. This also means purse funds cannot be used for cash equivalents, so a person who is authorized for a monthly bus pass in employee benefits cannot use that benefit to pay for rail travel or a day pass.|$|E

Manges' {{operation}} grew to become a working ranch, later the Elbo Dude Ranch, which featured a racetrack and rodeo grounds. [...] The perceived blight of the Elbo development, so close to the mountains, led Struthers Burt and other local citizens to consider strategies for land preservation in the valley in the 1920s. The Elbo was acquired by the Park Service in 1956, and after some time <b>as</b> <b>employee</b> lodging, was gradually demolished to allow the site to return to its natural state. The Manges Cabin is the only remnant.|$|E
