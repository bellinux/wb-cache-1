5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off <b>a</b> <b>borrowed</b> skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|Lee spent $50,000 in {{personal}} savings {{to demonstrate the}} cables at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Chicago in 1979, using <b>a</b> <b>borrowed</b> portion of someone else's exhibit area. Lee received a positive response at the event and founded Monster, Inc. (formerly known as Monster Cable Products) later that year. Lee received an order from a Canadian distributor for 30,000 cables. The distributor wouldn't pay until the products were shipped, so Lee took out a $250,000 bank loan {{to pay for the}} production of the cables. According to Lee, he started the company without business experience or a strategy.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} (1–3 in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Ndhir) {{cardinal}} numerals have native Berber and borrowed Arabic forms. All higher cardinals are borrowed from Arabic, {{consistent with the}} linguistic universals that the numbers 1–3 {{are much more likely}} to be retained, and that <b>a</b> <b>borrowed</b> number generally implies that numbers greater than it are also borrowed. The retention of one is also motivated by the fact that Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.|$|E

5|$|After {{traveling}} to New York {{to perform the}} first seven episodes, the four men decided to broadcast from Los Angeles instead. NBC {{did not have a}} studio on the West Coast, so for the next thirteen weeks, between January 16 and April 24, 1933, the show was transmitted from <b>a</b> <b>borrowed</b> empty soundstage at RKO Radio Pictures. Folding chairs were brought in for the audience of around thirty or forty people – coming from vaudeville, Groucho and Chico preferred to perform to a crowd – and were quickly cleared {{out at the end of}} each performance so that the stage would be ready for any filming the following day. The last four episodes of the show were performed back at WJZ in New York.|$|E

After a long day, Small Alison, Christian and John settle into sleeping bags. Small Alison wakes up and catches Bruce sneaking out. Bruce sings a lullaby ("Pony Girl"). He reassures his daughter that he's just {{going out for a}} paper, but he leaves to go cruising. Medium Alison is angered by a noncommittal letter from Bruce, responding to her coming out. At a luncheonette with her father, Small Alison notices a butch delivery woman and feels an inexplicable kinship with her ("Ring of Keys").|$|E
5|$|Monster {{was founded}} in 1979 by Noel Lee as Monster Cable Products. Lee, an audiophile and engineer, was experimenting with {{different}} copper qualities, wire constructs and winding methods of audio cables in his family's garage and comparing them while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. He became convinced that audio cables could be engineered to improve audio quality by conducting electricity more efficiently. Using <b>a</b> <b>borrowed</b> portion of somebody's booth at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, he did demonstrations of his cables in comparison to standard wires. After a positive reception at CES, he quit his job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and started Monster Cable Products with $250,000 in bank financing. Monster's first cables were manufactured by Lee by hand and sold door-to-door.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 7November 1974, the children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was bludgeoned {{to death in the}} {{basement}} of the Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation, Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove <b>a</b> <b>borrowed</b> Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, East Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and vanished without trace. The car was found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found at the crime scene. A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued a few days later, and in his absence the inquest into Rivett's death named him as her murderer, the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court did so.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to {{only be a}} one-year project, Cirque du Soleil was scheduled to perform in 11 towns in Quebec {{over the course of}} 13 weeks running concurrent with the third La Fête Foraine. The first shows were riddled with difficulty, starting {{with the collapse of the}} big top after the increased weight of rainwater caused the central mast to snap. Working with <b>a</b> <b>borrowed</b> tent, Laliberté then had to contend with difficulties with the European performers. They were so unhappy with the Quebec circus's inexperience that they had, at one point, sent a letter to the media complaining about how they were being treated.|$|E
5|$|Xinhua News Agency {{published}} an article on 17 January 2016 stating that an individual {{by the name of}} Gui Minhai had been detained relating to a fatal traffic accident in December 2003 in which a schoolgirl died. Xinhua alleged that Gui Minhai (桂敏海), with a different but identical-sounding middle character with respect to Gui Minhai the publisher, had fled abroad under the guise of a tourist in November 2004 using <b>a</b> <b>borrowed</b> identity card following the court case; his stated age was 46 years in 2005 – a discrepancy of five years compared with the details in Gui's Swedish passport. The two discrepancies created doubts {{that there may have been}} a case of mistaken identity. Xinhua claimed that Gui gave himself up to public security officials in October 2015.|$|E

5|$|Booth {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for New South Wales against Queensland in the 195455 Sheffield Shield. He made a duck {{in the first}} innings before adding 19 in the second. New South Wales won, but Booth was dropped when the Test players returned from international duty. Booth was recalled a month later for a match against Len Hutton's English cricket team at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Arthur Morris and Bill Watson had to withdraw at late notice and Booth was asked to play, having already started his day's work as a teacher at Hurlstone Agricultural College. He caught a train and arrived at the ground {{more than half an}} hour after the start of play, by which time New South Wales had collapsed to 3/12. New South Wales fell further to 5/26 before Booth came in with <b>a</b> <b>borrowed</b> cap and bat to join Peter Philpott. They put on an 83-run partnership, and Booth eventually finished the innings unbeaten on 74 as the hosts folded for 172. Booth made a duck in the second innings and took his maiden first-class wicket as New South Wales defeated Hutton's men. It was only the tourists' second loss for the campaign, and the last match in Booth's debut season.|$|E
5|$|While Stephen and {{his army}} besieged Lincoln Castle {{at the start}} of 1141, Robert of Gloucester and Ranulf of Chester {{advanced}} on the King's position with a somewhat larger force. When the news reached Stephen, he held a council to decide whether to give battle or to withdraw and gather additional soldiers: Stephen decided to fight, resulting in the battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141. The King commanded the centre of his army, with Alan of Brittany on his right and William of Aumale on his left. Robert and Ranulf's forces had superiority in cavalry and Stephen dismounted many of his own knights to form a solid infantry block; he joined them himself, fighting on foot in the battle. Stephen was not a gifted public speaker, and delegated the pre-battle speech to Baldwin of Clare, who delivered a rousing declaration. After an initial success in which William's forces destroyed the Angevins' Welsh infantry, the battle went badly for Stephen. Robert and Ranulf's cavalry encircled Stephen's centre, and the king found himself surrounded by the enemy army. Many of Stephen's supporters, including Waleran de Beaumont and William of Ypres, fled from the field at this point but Stephen fought on, defending himself first with his sword and then, when that broke, with <b>a</b> <b>borrowed</b> battle axe. Finally, he was overwhelmed by Robert's men and taken away from the field in custody.|$|E
