This examined {{what sort of}} system {{would be needed to}} provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|Lag {{errors are}} caused {{by the fact that}} any changes in the static or dynamic {{pressure}} outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down the tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges. Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> steady level flight.|$|E
5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} the subject of extensive scientific inquiry, and the scientific community has concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer and that breast cancer should not be <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> women who are considering having an abortion. This consensus is supported by major medical bodies, including the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the German Cancer Research Center, and the Canadian Cancer Society.|$|E

5|$|With {{forest fires}} {{continuing}} to burn in neighboring Indonesia, heavy smog was <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the event.

Race organisers, however, did not speculate whether the Grand Prix was also under threat of cancellation. It was later reported that the smog had lifted and that the race could go ahead without any restrictions.|$|E
5|$|For another episode for {{the series}} filmed in New York City he {{was asked by the}} NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel {{performances}} had become <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the police. This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a noose around his neck which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show. Clips from the show also became the most watched YouTube magic clips {{in the history of the}} site, with more than 15 million views.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the {{historic}} {{status of the}} barges was <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the Port Authority of Bridgeport Harbor, as the sunken ships interfered with a billion-dollar redevelopment project. Over the years, the barges had deteriorated so that a salvage operation would likely result in them breaking apart. No action had been taken by 2003, but a report noted that prior to any activity of the Berkshire No. 7, the Federal Transit Administration and/or the City of Bridgeport should document the barge with photos and a technical description. Specifics regarding the documentation based on the activity would be archived at the State Historic Preservation Office and the Mystic Seaport Museum.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{key points}} {{stressed}} in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. Gawain was written {{around the time of}} the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E
5|$|Pregame {{media and}} fan {{interest}} surrounding the game focused largely on Louisville's top-ranked offense and Virginia Tech's first-ranked scoring defense. Other major points of media coverage included the two teams' quarterbacks: Louisville's Hunter Cantwell, who replaced starter Brian Brohm after Brohm suffered a season-ending knee injury; and Virginia Tech's Marcus Vick, brother of National Football League star Michael Vick. Also <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> Louisville was {{the health of}} star running back Michael Bush, who missed two games in November due to an injury. On a wider note, there was also interest in the conference-level showdown between a new Big East team (Louisville) and a team that left the Big East for the ACC after the 2003 season (Virginia Tech). For Virginia Tech, {{there was also the}} hope of overcoming the disappointment of a season that saw the Hokies ranked third in the country and in the hunt for the national championship before failing to even win the Atlantic Coast Conference and missing a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game.|$|E
5|$|References to interpreters {{indicate}} the continuing use of local languages other than Greek and Latin, particularly in Egypt, where Coptic predominated, and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube. Roman jurists also show <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> local languages such as Punic, Gaulish, and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding {{and application of}} laws and oaths. In the province of Africa, Libyco-Berber and Punic were used in inscriptions and for legends on coins {{during the time of}} Tiberius (1st century AD). Libyco-Berber and Punic inscriptions appear on public buildings into the 2nd century, some bilingual with Latin. In Syria, Palmyrene soldiers even used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions, in a striking exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military.|$|E

5|$|Chicago's {{top four}} {{receiver}}s, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, Marquess Wilson and Kevin White, were not active {{for the game}} in Cincinnati. During the game, Perry, Clausen, cornerback Tracy Porter, wide receiver John Chiles and linebacker Jon Bostic also suffered injuries. Penalties were <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the Bears, who committed 12 for 117 yards; the offense also struggled on converting third downs, with only two of eleven successful. On defense, the Bears allowed the Bengals to score three unanswered touchdowns: {{in the first quarter}} with Andy Dalton's one-yard run, and in the second with AJ McCarron's touchdown pass to Marvin Jones and Jeremy Hill's one-yard run. It would not be until the final six seconds of the half that the Bears scored, with Gould's 34-yard field goal. The first-team offense left the game during the third quarter, with all but one drive having ended in a punt, and on four of those drives, the unit failed to record a first down. Halfway through the final quarter, the Bears were able to make the score 21–10 after Ify Umodu blocked Kevin Huber's punt and returned it for an eight-yard touchdown.|$|E
