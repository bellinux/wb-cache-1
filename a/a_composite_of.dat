5|$|The {{character}} of Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> accountant Stern, factory manager Abraham Bankier, and Göth's personal secretary, Mietek Pemper. The character serves as Schindler's alter ego and conscience. Kingsley {{is best known}} for his Academy Award-winning performance as Gandhi in the 1982 biographical film.|$|E
5|$|Orcadian {{folklore}} had {{a strong}} Scandinavian influence, {{and it may be}} that the nuckelavee is <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> a water horse from Celtic mythology and a creature imported by the Norsemen. As with similar malevolent entities such as the kelpie, it possibly offered an explanation for incidents that islanders in ancient times could not otherwise understand.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{made the}} film {{as a tribute to}} his father, Lou Stone, a {{stockbroker}} during the Great Depression. The character of Gekko is said to be <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> several people, including Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, Michael Ovitz, Michael Milken, and Stone himself. The character of Sir Lawrence Wildman, meanwhile, was modeled on the prominent British financier and corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith. Originally, the studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested; Stone, meanwhile, wanted Richard Gere, but Gere passed on the role.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Charter of 1841 was {{amended to}} include the University Council in 1874. The Council is <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> the Board of Trustees, {{senators}} and {{an equal number of}} elected graduates. It serves as both an advisory and an ambassadorial body to the university as a whole and is responsible for the election of the chancellor. Although it is not directly involved in operations, the Council may bring to the Senate or Board of Trustees any matter that it believes affects Queen's well-being. The Council meets once per year, typically in May.|$|E
5|$|The character's origins lie of the {{accounts}} of Kings Duff and Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth appears to be <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> two separate and distinct personages in Holinshed's work: Donwald's nagging, murderous wife {{in the account of}} King Duff and Macbeth's ambitious wife Gruoch of Scotland in the account of King Duncan.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} engine propelling {{the carousel}} was a belt-driven mechanism, {{but after the}} initial restoration it was exchanged for a fluid drive provided by the Kissell Brothers Amusement Rides company of Cincinnati, Ohio, who suggested the platform for the carousel be improved. To provide crowd control, a pavilion was built over the carousel and a ticket booth was installed. Neither was based on any extant buildings, but each was <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> several other structures. The animals are removed {{one at a time}} from the carousel for routine maintenance and refurbishment, which is carried out in the museum's own shops.|$|E

5|$|The visage of the Indian which dominates Fraser's obverse {{design was}} <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> several Native Americans. Breen noted (before {{the advent of}} the Sacagawea dollar) that Fraser's design was the second and last US coin design to feature a {{realistic}} portrait of an Indian, after Bela Pratt's 1908 design for the half eagle and quarter eagle.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> Perrault's male heroes, however, {{indicates}} {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|One of Meddings' first tasks was {{to shoot}} stock {{footage of the}} Thunderbird {{machines}} and the series' main locations, Tracy Island and Creighton-Ward Mansion. The finished island model was <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> {{more than a dozen}} smaller sets that could be detached from the whole and filmed separately. The architecture of the mansion was based on that of Stourhead House, located on the Stourhead Estate in Wiltshire. In the absence of head designer Reg Hill, who was serving as associate producer, Meddings was further tasked with designing the Thunderbird fleet and FAB 1. Scale models for the six main vehicles were built by a contractor, Master Models of Middlesex. Models and puppet sets combined, more than 200 versions of the Thunderbird machines were created for the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Henry Dion {{appears to be}} <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> several real life serial killers. His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during {{this seems to be}} based on Milwaukee-based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically. The habit of photographing victims, and the notion of killing women to use them as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order to use them as mannequins for his photography. The use of an overbearing matriarchal figure as a stressor harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper cut their mother's vocal folds from their throats after killing them.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} adapted as the 1993 movie Schindler's List by Steven Spielberg. After {{acquiring}} the rights in 1983, Spielberg {{felt he was}} not ready emotionally or professionally to tackle the project, and he offered the rights to several other directors. After he read a script for the project prepared by Steven Zaillian for Martin Scorsese, he decided to trade him Cape Fear {{for the opportunity to}} do the Schindler biography. In the film, the character of Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> Stern, Bankier, and Pemper. Liam Neeson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Schindler in the film, which won seven Oscars, including Best Picture.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{skeleton}} in Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze, which it obtained from France in 1833, but was mislabelled as a cassowary until correctly identified by Italian zoologist Enrico Hillyer Giglioli in 1900. Several elements of this skeleton are missing, and some have been replaced with wooden copies. Its right metatarsus was damaged during life and had healed incorrectly. It {{was thought to be}} a male, but is now known to be <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> two individuals. A fourth specimen was thought to be kept in the Liverpool Museum, but it may simply be a juvenile mainland emu. Apart from the King Island emu specimens brought to France, a few are also known to have been brought to mainland Australia in 1803, but their fate is unknown.|$|E

5|$|An {{open and}} spacious ground floor {{respected}} the same traditional layout exemplified in Besakana and other Merina homes, including {{the presence of}} hearth stones in their customary corner. Following traditional construction practices, the roof three stories above was supported by an enormous andry (central pillar) that was given the name Volamihitsy ("Genuine Silver"). According to popular legend, this was made of a single rosewood tree trunk transported from the eastern rain forests. Recent archaeological excavations of the site during reconstruction have since disproved this account as the pillar {{was found to be}} <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> fitted rosewood pieces rather than a single solid post. According to custom, the north-eastern corner pillar was the first to be erected. Its length necessitated the use of a pulley designed by Jean Laborde, the principal architect, to haul the trunk into place. When an accident occurred during the operation, the queen designated a Malagasy carpenter to manufacture a crane to complete the task. Thousands of the queen's subjects were forced to labour on the building's construction in lieu of paying cash taxes pursuant to a tradition called fanampoana. One historic source claimed that 25,000 subjects participated in the raising of the building's corner posts alone. The harsh working conditions were said to have been the cause of many deaths, although precise figures are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
5|$|Gilmore had {{suspected}} that C. fragilis and C. agilis were the same, but Ostrom {{was able to}} demonstrate this synonymy. This greatly expanded the known material pertaining to C. fragilis, and Ostrom was able to demonstrate that Ornitholestes was quite different from Coelurus. At the time, Dale Russell had proposed that C. agilis was a species of Elaphrosaurus based on the incomplete information then published; Ostrom was also able to demonstrate {{that this was not}} the case. Additionally, he showed that one of the three vertebrae Marsh had illustrated for C. fragilis was actually <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> two vertebrae, one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to Coelurus but to another, unnamed small theropod. This unnamed genus would not be the last small theropod from the Morrison Formation to be confused with Coelurus; a later discovery (1995) of a partial skeleton in Wyoming was first thought to be a new larger specimen of Coelurus, but further study showed it belonged to a different but related genus, Tanycolagreus.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1877, {{the first of}} many related species from the region described until the 1910s. In 1918, Edward Alphonso Goldman consolidated most into the single species Oryzomys couesi and in 1960 Raymond Hall united this taxon with its United States relative, the marsh rice rat (O.palustris), into a single widespread species; subsequently, many related, localized species retained by Goldman were also included in this taxon. After studies of the contact zone in Texas, where O.couesi and the marsh rice rat meet, were published in 1979 and underscored the distinctness of the two, they were again regarded as separate. Since then, some of the peripheral forms of the group, such as Oryzomys antillarum from Jamaica and Oryzomys peninsulae from the Baja California Peninsula, have been reinstated as species. Nevertheless, O.couesi as currently constituted is likely <b>a</b> <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> several species; a 2010 study, using DNA sequence data, found evidence to recognize separate species from the Pacific and eastern sides of the distribution of O.couesi and two additional species from Panama and Costa Rica. Generally, Oryzomys couesi is common and of no conservation concern, and it is even considered a plague species in places, but some populations are threatened.|$|E
