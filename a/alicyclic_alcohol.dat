40|$|The {{thiamine}} diphosphate (ThDP) dependent flavoenzyme cyclohexane- 1, 2 - dione hydrolase (CDH) (EC 3. 7. 1. 11) catalyses a key step {{of a novel}} anaerobic degradation pathway for <b>alicyclic</b> <b>alcohols</b> by converting cyclohexane- 1, 2 -dione (CDO) to 6 -oxohexanoate and further to adipate using NAD + as electron acceptor. To gain insights into the molecular basis of these reactions CDH from denitrifying anaerobe Azoarcus sp. strain 22 Lin was structurally characterized at 1. 26 Å resolution. Notably, the active site funnel is rearranged in an unprecedented manner providing the structural basis for the specific binding and cleavage of an alicyclic compound. Crucial features include a decreased and displaced funnel entrance, a semicircularly shaped loop segment preceding the C-terminal arm and the attachment of the C-terminal arm to other subunits of the CDH tetramer. Its structural scaffold and the ThDP activation is related to that observed for {{other members of the}} ThDP enzyme family. The selective binding of the competitive inhibitor 2 -methyl- 2, 4 -pentane-diol (MPD) to the open funnel of CDH reveals an asymmetry of the two active sites found also in the dimer of several other ThDP dependent enzymes.

Stabilities of these complexes under FD conditions are compared with their thermodynamic stabilities in solution. Differences in these stabilities are attributed to the lack of solvation of ions under FD conditions. A marked anion effect is also observed in FD spectra. This effect is correlated with the recombination energy of the released cation and anion in the gaseous state. Part II. Acid phthalates from isomeric <b>alicyclic</b> <b>alcohols</b> have been studied by field desorption (FD) and electron impact (EI) mass spectrometry. Isomeric acid phthalates gave identical FD spectra and EI spectra. The use of these methods for distinguishing stereoisomers of this type thus proved to be unsuccessful. However, the field ionization (FI) spectra of cis- and trans- 4 -t-butylcyclohexyl 9 -fluorenylmethyl carbonate show distinguishing features. The trans-isomer undergoes a rearrangement reaction which involves mainly the transfer of the benzylic hydrogen to carbonyl oxygen, whereas the cis-isomer transfers either the benzylic hydrogen or a readily available hydrogen from the 2 -position in the cyclohexyl ring. This divided pathway gives rise to an additional ion for the cis-isomer (m/z 138) which is the major qualitative difference in the spectra. The EI spectra for both isomers are simple and closely related to each other. Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 42 - 08, Section: B, page: 3262. Thesis (Ph. D.)
