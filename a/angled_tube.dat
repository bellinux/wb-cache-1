50|$|The {{critical}} angles in bicycle geometry are {{the head}} angle (the {{angle of the}} head tube), and the seat <b>tube</b> <b>angle</b> (the angle of the seat <b>tube).</b> These <b>angles</b> are measured from the horizontal, and drastically affect the rider position and performance characteristics of the bicycle. Mountain bike geometry will often feature a seat <b>tube</b> <b>angle</b> around 73 degrees, with a head <b>tube</b> <b>angle</b> of anywhere from 60-73 degrees. The intended application of the bike affects its geometry very heavily. In general, steeper angles (closer to 90 degrees from the horizontal) are more efficient for pedaling up hills and make for sharper handling. Slacker angles (leaning farther from the vertical) are preferred for high speeds and downhill stability.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} 2 D-braided SiC/SiC composite tubes depends strongly on the braiding <b>angle.</b> <b>Tubes</b> {{of three different}} braiding angles (30 °, 45 °, 60 °) have been observed during in situ tensile tests using synchrotron X-ray tomography. In order to detect the slightly open cracks from heterogeneous microstructures, various image processing techniques have been used and developed. Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) allows the 3 D displacement field within the material under loading to be estimated. The crack networks are extracted by a DVC-based image subtraction. The detected cracks are first classified into two groups according to their orientations, and then are characterized in qualitative and quantitative ways.

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} and pressure drop analysis of conical coil heat exchanger with various tube diameters, fluid flow rates, and cone angles {{is presented in}} this paper. Fifteen coils of cone angles 180 ° (horizontal spiral), 135 °, 90 °, 45 °, and 0 ° (vertical helical) are fabricated and analysed with, same average coil diameter, and tube length, with three different tube diameters. The experimentation is carried out with hot and cold water of flow rate 10 to 100 L per hour (Reynolds range 500 to 5000), and 30 to 90 L per hour, respectively. The temperatures and pressure drop across the heat exchanger are recorded at different mass flow rates of cold and hot fluid. The various parameters: {{heat transfer}} coefficient, Nusselt number, effectiveness, and friction factor, are estimated using the temperature, mass flow rate, and pressure drop across the heat exchanger. The analysis indicates that, Nusselt number and friction factor are function of flow rate, <b>tube</b> diameter, cone <b>angle,</b> and curvature ratio. Increase in tube side flow rate increases Nusselt number, whereas it reduces with increase in shell side flow rate. Increase in cone <b>angle</b> and <b>tube</b> diameter, reduces Nusselt number. The effects of cone <b>angle,</b> <b>tube</b> diameter, and fluid flow rates on heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics are detailed in this paper. The empirical correlations are proposed {{to bring out the}} physics of the thermal aspects of the conical coil heat exchangers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effect of process {{parameters}} on the peak load and the energy absorption of the expansion of thin walled tubes using a die. The energy absorption and peak load during the expansion process were calculated for various punch angles (α) and with different expansion ratios (rp/ro) at different temperatures (T) by finite element analysis where rp is the punch outer radius and ro is the tube inner radius. The effect of these input parameters on the response parameters peak load, energy absorption and local buckling have been critically analyzed using Taguchi method. It is observed that the peak load and energy absorption of the expansion tube is influenced by expansion ratio (rp/ro), punch <b>angle</b> followed by <b>tube</b> temperature. The energy absorption of the expanded tube increases as the rp/ro ratio increases and also larger punch angle improves the energy absorption. Whereas the minimum expansion ratio (rp/ro) decreases the peak load at higher temperature and medium punch angle.
