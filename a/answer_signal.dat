50|$|The {{following}} code piece {{demonstrates a}} server, which receives a query signal (message), contacts a database process {{to obtain the}} necessary data and finally sends an <b>answer</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{systems may}} not {{cut through the}} audio path {{until there is a}} {{positive}} indication that the called party answered the call—there may not be an audio connection until the <b>answer</b> <b>signal</b> is sent.|$|E
60|$|An <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> came {{fluttering}} back. The captain {{opened his}} book and read it.|$|R
6000|$|... "A shot {{might bring}} an <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> from Dick," [...] went on Tom suddenly. [...] "What fools we have been, {{not to think}} of that before!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then an <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> {{came back}} from some {{brushwood}} {{on the top of}} a distant hill--the answer being similar to the signal itself, showing the message was seen and understood.|$|R
5000|$|In {{telecommunication}} {{an attempted}} call is termed a seizure or total calls. The answer-seizure ratio {{is defined as}} 100 times the ratio of answered calls, i.e. the number of seizures resulting in an <b>answer</b> <b>signal,</b> divided {{by the total number}} of seizures: ...|$|E
50|$|Females contact male polka-dot wasp moths {{by means}} of {{ultrasonic}} signals. On the branch, the sound travels, and then the male follows the sound to his new mate. When he reaches her, he emits an <b>answering</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{was just}} in time! Filled with {{happiness}} the mucker ran {{to the point of}} the promontory and stripping off his shirt waved it high above his head, the while he shouted {{at the top of his}} lungs; but the vessels kept on their course, giving no <b>answering</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} Maud watched their {{movements}} from the loop, with eyes streaming with tears. She saw Robert pause, and look back, again and again; and, once more, she thrust out the handkerchief. It was plain, however, {{he did not}} see it; for he turned and proceeded, without any <b>answering</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
60|$|Loud {{and clear}} were both the signals, but {{four and a}} half miles of {{distance}} and a fresh gale neutralised their influence. The look-out on the pier did not observe them. In less than five minutes the gun and rocket were fired again. Still no <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> came from Ramsgate.|$|R
6000|$|The third gun thundered {{forth and}} shook the {{floating}} light from stem to stern, but the rocket struck the rigging and made a low wavering flight. Another was therefore sent up, but it had scarcely cut its bright line across the sky when the <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> was observed--a rocket from Ramsgate pier! ...|$|R
60|$|With greater caution Jonathan {{advanced}} once more. Not {{far beyond}} the rock he found Wetzel's trail. The afternoon was drawing to a close. He could not travel much farther, yet he kept on, hoping to overtake his comrade before darkness set in. From time to time he whistled; but got no <b>answering</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
60|$|Loud {{and clear}} were both our signals, but {{four and a}} half miles of {{distance}} and a fresh gale neutralised their influence on that dark and dismal night. The lookout did not see them. In a few minutes the gun and rocket were fired again. Still no <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> came from Ramsgate.|$|R
60|$|Jim's {{excitement}} was {{so great}} that he did not hear the old sailor's words. When he emerged from the galley the spirit was sending up a blue flame which illumined the entire after-part of the brig; but the stranger had vanished in the gloom to starboard, and strain his eyes as he might it was impossible to see any <b>answering</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
60|$|When {{the tracks}} of the horses were nearly hidden by the {{gathering}} dusk, Jonathan decided to halt for the night. He whistled one more note, louder and clearer, and awaited the result with strained ears. The deep silence of the wilderness prevailed, suddenly to be broken by a faint, far-away, melancholy call of the hermit-thrush. It was the <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> the borderman had hoped to hear.|$|R
50|$|In 1943, the War Department, {{along with}} the War Relocation Authority (WRA) created a bureaucratic means of testing the loyalty of all adults and teens in the WRA camps. The first form was aimed at draft-age Nisei males and the second form at all other residents. The last two questions, numbers 27 and 28 - where affirmative <b>answers</b> <b>signaled</b> unwavering loyalty to the U.S. - created {{confusion}} and resentment.|$|R
60|$|The mate's fears {{seemed to}} be well grounded, for no <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> was seen {{to rise from the}} land, towards which every eye was anxiously strained. One hour passed, then another, and another, but still no help came. Then the tide began to rise, and with it, of course, the danger to increase. All this time rockets had been sent up at intervals, and tar-barrels had been kept burning.|$|R
60|$|The more {{experienced}} shook their heads; but, not discouraged, the burgher {{raised his voice}} with a power that was sustained by the imminency of the peril. He was joined by the seamen, and even Ludlow lent his aid, until all were hoarse with the fruitless efforts. Men were evidently aloft, and in some numbers, searching the ocean with their eyes, but still no <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> came from the vessel.|$|R
60|$|From {{the nature}} of the work before us our party had to keep {{to the top of the}} hills. We had not only to keep {{observation}} on the flying party whom we followed, and to prevent them making discovery of us, but we had to be always in a position to receive and <b>answer</b> <b>signals</b> made to us from the Castle, or sent to us from other eminences.|$|R
60|$|Frank {{noticed that}} one of the loungers had thrust his foot against the post, but the agent, seeming to lose his temper, slammed the door on it. The man withdrew it with an exclamation, and the agent turned toward the {{instrument}} which was now clicking rapidly. He tapped an <b>answering</b> <b>signal,</b> and then wrote upon a strip of paper which he handed Mr. Oliver. The latter read the message and handed it to the boys.|$|R
60|$|Two {{submarines}} had <b>answered</b> his <b>signal,</b> {{instead of}} one, {{and the last}} had crept up to attack {{him while he was}} sinking her consort.|$|R
25|$|In early 1800, Régénérée left Rochefort with Africaine {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} to Alexandria. At the Action of 19 February 1801, HMS Phoebe, under Captain Robert Barlow, captured Africaine east of Gibraltar. However, Régénérée managed to complete her mission, sailing into Alexandria on 2 March, having eluded the British blockade. The day {{before she had}} passed through the British fleet <b>answering</b> <b>signals</b> and without arousing any suspicion, until at last she hoisted the French flag as she headed into the harbor.|$|R
60|$|And so they started, {{cruising}} {{slowly up}} the coast and firing an occasional shot from the gun. Often the vessel was brought to a stop, and always there were anxious eyes scanning the shore for an <b>answering</b> <b>signal.</b> Late in the afternoon they caught sight {{of a number of}} Band-lu warriors; but when the vessel approached the shore and the natives realized that human beings stood upon the back of the strange monster of the sea, they fled in terror before Bradley could come within hailing distance.|$|R
60|$|Every eye was upturned now to {{the mast}} for the <b>answering</b> <b>signals.</b> To the {{universal}} surprise, none were hoisted. The captain stood upon the bridge with his glass focussed upon the raider. He gave no orders, only the black smoke was beginning to belch now from the funnels, and little pieces of smut and burning coal blew down the deck. Jocelyn Thew, who was standing a little apart, frowned to himself. He had seen Crawshay and the captain {{come out of the}} latter's cabin together.|$|R
6000|$|His heart stood still. [...] "Great God! What {{could have}} caused that bell to ring?" [...] It could not ring; it was a {{physical}} impossibility unless somebody were handling the sister instrument, and at four o'clock in the morning, who could be there, and except one, who would know its working? With a bound he was by the aerophone and had given the <b>answering</b> <b>signal.</b> Then instantly, {{as though she were}} standing at his side in the room, for this machine does not blur the voice or heighten its tone, he heard Stella speaking.|$|R
6000|$|Well did {{the youth}} {{know what to}} do in the circumstances, for many a time had he talked it over with the men of the {{coastguard}} in former days. On receiving an <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> from the shore he began to haul on the rocket-line. The men in charge had fastened to it a block, or pulley, with two tails to it; a line was rove through this block. The instant the block reached his hands Aspel sprang with it to the stump of the foremast, and looking round cried, [...] "Who'll lend a--" ...|$|R
60|$|No {{disappointment}} now; <b>answering</b> <b>signals</b> {{assured them}} of help; {{and in the}} rapture of that moment the happy women fell on Emil's neck, giving him his reward in tears and blessings as their grateful hearts overflowed. He always said that was the proudest moment of his life, as he stood there holding Mary in his arms; for the brave girl, who had kept up so long, broke down then, and clung to him half fainting; while her mother busied herself about the invalid, who seemed to feel the joyful stir, and gave an order, as if again {{on the deck of}} his lost ship.|$|R
6000|$|The signal-ball {{was fixed}} {{to a short}} staff on {{the summit of the}} lighthouse, and the rule was that it should be hoisted at a fixed hour every morning when all was well, and kept up until an <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> should be made from a signal-tower in Arbroath where the keepers' {{families}} dwelt, and where each keeper in succession spent a fortnight with his family, after a spell of six weeks on the rock. It was the duty of the keeper on shore to watch for the hoisting of the ball (the [...] "All's well" [...] signal) each morning on the lighthouse, and to reply to it with a similar ball on the signal-tower.|$|R
60|$|Two {{men were}} sent forward to reconnoitre the village, and {{returned}} with the report that {{it had already been}} occupied by a very strong force of French cavalry. Half an hour later two wreaths of smoke rose on the opposite hill. Sticks had been gathered in readiness, and the <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> was at once made. Two minutes later the smoke ceased to rise on either side. Terence now received the reports of the captains of the six companies, and found that fifteen men had been killed, and that his strength was thus reduced by fifty-eight. The men were now told that they could lie down, the companies keeping together so as to be ready for instant action.|$|R
50|$|The {{prowords}} {{listed below}} are for use when initiating and <b>answering</b> queries concerning <b>signal</b> strength and readability.|$|R
6000|$|I soon heard a {{clattering}} {{noise of}} {{feet in the}} courtyard, which I concluded to be Jan and Dorcas dancing a jig in their Cumberland wooden clogs. Under cover of this din, I endeavoured to <b>answer</b> Willie's <b>signal</b> by whistling, as loud as I could--- ...|$|R
60|$|Ayesha {{held up her}} hand, {{in which}} there was no weapon, and waved it forwards. A great cheer <b>answered</b> that <b>signal</b> to advance, {{and in the midst of}} it this frail, white-robed woman spoke to her horse, so that it plunged deep into the water.|$|R
60|$|Round about Farnham the hops were gloriously {{green in}} the sunshine, and the {{carriages}} drove through the richest, most beautiful country. Maria insisted upon taking her old seat. She thanked her dear aunt. It would {{not in the least}} incommode her now. She gazed, as she had done yesterday, {{in the face of the}} young knight riding by the carriage side. She looked for those <b>answering</b> <b>signals</b> which used to be lighted up in yonder two windows, and told that love was burning within. She smiled gently at him, to which token of regard he tried to answer with a sickly grin of recognition. Miserable youth! Those were not false teeth he saw when she smiled. He thought they were, and they tore and lacerated him.|$|R
60|$|She {{followed}} her assistants through the gate, {{and lifted her}} hand to one of them. Laban <b>answered</b> to her <b>signal.</b>|$|R
60|$|No pen can {{describe}} the turning of the leaves--the insurrection of the tree-people against the waning year. A little maple began it, flaming blood-red {{of a sudden}} where he stood against the dark green of a pine-belt. Next morning there was an <b>answering</b> <b>signal</b> from the swamp where the sumacs grow. Three days later, the hill-sides {{as far as the}} eye could range were afire, and the roads paved, with crimson and gold. Then a wet wind blew, and ruined all the uniforms of that gorgeous army; and the oaks, who had held themselves in reserve, buckled on their dull and bronzed cuirasses and stood it out stiffly to the last blown leaf, till nothing remained but pencil-shading of bare boughs, and one could see into the most private heart of the woods.|$|R
