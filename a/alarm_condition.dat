50|$|An {{important}} part of most SCADA implementations is alarm handling. The system monitors whether certain <b>alarm</b> <b>conditions</b> are satisfied, to determine when an alarm event has occurred. Once an alarm event has been detected, one or more actions are taken (such as the activation {{of one or more}} alarm indicators, and perhaps the generation of email or text messages so that management or remote SCADA operators are informed). In many cases, a SCADA operator may have to acknowledge the alarm event; this may deactivate some alarm indicators, whereas other indicators remain active until the <b>alarm</b> <b>conditions</b> are cleared.|$|R

This {{indicator}} is lit when an <b>alarm</b> <b>condition</b> {{exists in the}} system, initiated by smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinkler flow switches, manual pull stations, manual call points, or otherwise. Along with the indicator on the panel, notification appliances, such as horns and strobes, are also activated, signaling a need to evacuate to building occupants. In an <b>alarm</b> <b>condition,</b> the fire alarm panel indicates where the alarm originated. The alarm panel can be reset once the device which initiated the alarm is reset, such as returning the handle of a manual pull station to its normal position.|$|E

50|$|This system employs an {{electro-magnetic}} field disturbance principle {{based on}} two unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried about 10-15 cm deep and located at about 1 metre apart. The transmitter emits continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is received by the other cable. When the change in field strength weakens due {{to the presence of}} an object and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an <b>alarm</b> <b>condition</b> is generated. The system is unobtrusive when it has been installed correctly, however care must be taken to ensure the surrounding soil offers good drainage in order to reduce nuisance alarms.|$|E
50|$|This resets {{the panel}} after an <b>alarm</b> <b>condition.</b> All {{initiating}} devices are reset, and {{the panel is}} cleared of any alarm conditions. If an initiating device is still in alarm after the system is reset, such as a smoke detector continuing to sense smoke or a manual pull station still in an activated position, another alarm will be initiated, or in some cases, the panel will refuse to reset until all the alarms have been reset/cleared. A system reset is often required to clear supervisory conditions. A system reset does not usually clear trouble conditions. Most trouble conditions will clear automatically when conditions are returned to normal.|$|E

50|$|Modern alarm {{controls}} are solid-state devices, {{and do not}} use the relays that the older alarm panels used to go into alarm. They make use of relays to modulate the alarm notification device as needed. And they use a relay to seize the telephone line to communicate to the monitoring station. Most switching devices are N.C. (normally closed) circuits, so when the device is not in an <b>alarm</b> <b>condition,</b> the circuit is closed. Most alarm circuits (zones) are also set up to open or close on reading a certain resistance, usually between 1K and 5K ohms when inactive and double the value when active. This wiring system is called dual loop and allows for both alarm and anti-tamper detections to be incorporated into one circuit (anti-tamper occurs when the resistance level moves outside normal open/close values). This is the standard circuit in most modern systems.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{theory of}} framing {{suggests}} that the media {{have the ability to}} influence how the public thinks about issues (Nelson, Oxley & Clawson, 1997; Chong & Druckman, 2007), by influencing what definitions, causal attributions, moral evaluations, and treatment recommendation the public considers applicable to an issue (Entman, 1993; Tewksbury & Scheufele, 2009). The theory of framing has been supported in studies of media representations of a variety of social issues. With particular relevance to this thesis, framing studies have suggested that health news often portrays the essence of health issues as highly alarming, with few efficacious treatment or coping options (Chang, 2012). The social issue this thesis focuses on specifically is infertility. Study 1 : In Study 1, a content analysis is utilized to examine how Canadian print news frames infertility. One-hundred and fifty-seven Canadian print news articles that contained the key word “infertility” in the year 2012 were analyzed. Two independent coders read the articles, and coded each article using a predetermined coding strategy (Chang, 2012) for if/how infertility was framed with respect to: prevalence; need for alarm; severity; vulnerability; need for alertness; means of coping; causes; and possible solutions. Just over one-half of the articles employed alarm frames (n= 80), {{and the vast majority of}} these met the criteria for categorization as high alarm (96 %). The most commonly cited cause of infertility was delayed childbearing (41 % of articles) and the most frequently presented way to cope with infertility was in vitro fertilization (IVF; 46 % of articles). Infertility was most often constructed as a women’s issue. Study 2 : Study 2 build on Study 1 by examining the influence that high alarm framing strategies in the presentation of infertility have on news consumer reactions to, and knowledge of, infertility issues. One hundred and thirty-nine male and female undergraduate students were randomly assigned to read news articles focusing on infertility judged to employ either high alarm framing strategies (high <b>alarm</b> <b>condition,</b> n= 65) or low alarm framing strategies (low <b>alarm</b> <b>condition,</b> n= 66). Participants in each condition read the assigned news articles and subsequently completed a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included measures of: fear of infertility, perceived severity of infertility, perceived vulnerability to infertility, worry about infertility, prevention efficacy, coping efficacy, and knowledge about infertility. The participants in the high <b>alarm</b> <b>condition</b> evidenced higher levels of perceived vulnerability to infertility (p =. 04), and marginally higher levels of worry about infertility (p =. 075) than those in the low <b>alarm</b> <b>condition.</b> In contrast, participants in the low <b>alarm</b> <b>condition</b> relayed higher levels of infertility related knowledge than those in the high <b>alarm</b> <b>condition</b> (p=. 001). Discussion: Canadian print news portrays infertility as a serious, a prevalent, an alarming and predominantly a women’s disease, and presents IVF as the principal means of coping. This partial depiction of infertility may not be promoting informed reproductive decision-making. Print news portrayal of infertility using high alarm framing strategies may induce higher worry about infertility and heightened levels of perceived personal vulnerability to infertility, while neglecting to relay pertinent knowledge about infertility. Implications for the societal understanding of infertility and the potential repercussions for informed reproductive decision-making are discussed...|$|E

40|$|A cabin {{pressure}} altitude monitor and warning system provides a warning when a detected {{cabin pressure}} altitude has reached a predetermined level. The system is preferably embodied in a portable, pager-sized device that can be carried or worn by an individual.

The microprocessor is programmed to generate a warning or alarm if a {{cabin pressure altitude}} exceeding a predetermined threshold is detected. Preferably, the microprocessor generates {{two different types of}} warning or alarm outputs, a first early warning or alert when a first pressure altitude is exceeded. and a second more serious <b>alarm</b> <b>condition</b> when either a second. higher pressure altitude is exceeded, or when the first pressure altitude has been exceeded for a predetermined period of time. Multiple types of <b>alarm</b> <b>condition</b> indicators are preferably provided, including visual, audible and tactile.
