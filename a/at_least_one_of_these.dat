5|$|Holden {{claimed his}} first aerial victory while No.2 Squadron was still flying DH.5s, before it began {{converting}} to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s in December 1917. On 18 February 1918, he shared {{in one of}} the unit's first two victories in the S.E.5, helping send an Albatros down in a spin. He claimed another three aircraft shot down over the following month, giving him a total of five victories. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> took place during the Spring Offensive, on 22 March, when all available Allied aircraft were thrown into battle to stem the German advance.|$|E
5|$|More than 50specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex {{have been}} identified, {{some of which}} are nearly {{complete}} skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology and potential speed of Tyrannosaurus rex are a few subjects of debate. Its taxonomy is also controversial, as some scientists consider Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to be a second Tyrannosaurus species while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized with Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} {{a number of}} recurring character archetypes. Most famously, every game since Final FantasyII, including subsequent remakes of the original Final Fantasy, {{features a}} character named Cid. Cid's appearance, personality, goals, and role in the game (non-playable ally, party member, villain) vary dramatically. However, two characteristics many versions of Cid have in common are 1) being a scientist or engineer, and 2) being tied {{in some way to}} an airship the party eventually acquires. Every Cid has <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two traits.|$|E

5|$|Three main {{camouflage}} methods predominate in the oceans: transparency, reflection, and counterillumination. Transparency and reflectivity {{are most}} important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counterillumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres. Most animals of the open sea use <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> methods to camouflage themselves. Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by animals in many different groups. These methods of camouflage are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 1950, Monson {{became an}} LDS bishop at age 22, serving {{for five years}} in two wards. He had {{previously}} served as ward clerk, ward Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association superintendent. At the time, Monson's Salt Lake City ward contained over 1,000 people, including 85 widows whom he visited regularly, and he continued visiting to these widows after completing his service as bishop. He brought them gifts during the Christmas season, including poultry he had raised himself. Monson eventually spoke at the funerals {{of each of these}} women. Also during his time as bishop, 23 men from his ward served in the Korean War. He wrote weekly personal letters to each serviceman. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> men became fully involved with the church as a result of Monson's communication. During his service as bishop of the 6th-7th Ward, sacrament meeting attendance in the ward quadrupled.|$|E
5|$|The Ioviani and Herculiani legions and equites Dalmatae are not {{mentioned}} by the sources as under Julian, but {{as part of}} the Gaul comitatus of usurper Magnentius. They are likely to have been inherited by Julian. If all these units were present at Strasbourg, the infantry total is 1,500 short, or 3,500 if Severus commanded an extra 2,000 men. Probably the names of a number of auxilia regiments (and possibly a legion) are missing in our sources. If so, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> units {{is likely to be a}} sagittarii (archer) unit, as a comitatus would be incomplete without archer capacity. Overall, the most likely scenario is that Julian's force at Strasbourg consisted of 5-6 legiones and 10-14 auxilia of infantry and 6 vexillationes of cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epsteinâ€“Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
5|$|Mining in the creek's {{watershed}} {{began in}} 1844. A number of mining villages {{existed in the}} Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of board feet being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, deep mining of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. Strip mining operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, {{with some of the}} deep mines and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for surface mining. Treatment of the watershed began as early as 1998. Several projects devoted to improving the water quality of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> projects involves the use of biosolids to encourage vegetation growth.|$|E
5|$|How {{and when}} the Libellus {{eventually}} reached England is not clear. It is not known if the original letter ever reached Augustine, its intended recipient. Bede assumed that it had, though he is rather vague on specifics at this point. On the strength of Bede's word alone many later historians have claimed that the Libellus reached Augustine in a timely fashion; however, as mentioned above, recent scholarship has brought this assumption into serious question. In any event, some version of the letter {{seems to have been}} available in England by the late seventh century, for it was then that it was quoted by Theodore of Tarsus, Archbishop of Canterbury, in a series of judgments known today as the Paenitentiale Theodori. It is possible that Theodore found a copy of the Libellus already at Canterbury; however, given that no one in England previous to Theodore's archiepiscopacy seems to have known of the Libellus, it is equally plausible that the Libellus was one of the texts that Theodore brought with him from Italy when he arrived in Canterbury in 669. It is known that Theodore brought numerous books with him from Italy, and that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> books was a canon law collection very much like the one prepared at Bobbio some decades earlier (i.e. the Bobiensis). Elliot has speculated that Theodore introduced a Bobiensis-type collection to Canterbury {{in the second half of}} the seventh century, and thereby finally delivered the Libellus (as part of the Bobbiensis) to its originally intended destination. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that it was only shortly after Theodore's tenure at Canterbury that Anglo-Saxons begin to demonstrate knowledge of the Libellus.|$|E
