5|$|<b>Adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (the {{deficiency}} of glucocorticoids) occurs in about 5 in 10,000 {{in the general}} population. Diseases classified as primary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (including Addison's disease and genetic causes) directly affect the adrenal cortex. If a problem that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis arises outside the gland, it is a secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{secondary}} <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|A {{complication}} seen in untreated Addison's {{disease and}} other types of primary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> is the adrenal crisis, a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma. The management of adrenal crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections.|$|E
40|$|Auditory {{thresholds}} for sinusoidal tones {{were determined}} in eight patients with <b>adrenal</b> cortical <b>insufficiency</b> (four with Addison's disease and four with panhypopituitarism) and {{compared to those}} in normal volunteers. In <b>adrenal</b> cortical <b>insufficiency</b> (ACI) the auditory detection sensitivity is significantly more acute than that of normal subjects {{over most of the}} frequency range, but especially in the region of greatest hearing sensitivity of normal subjects, 1, 000 to 2, 000 cycles per second (cps) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} signs of <b>adrenal</b> cortical <b>insufficiency</b> (incidence, ca. 25 per million per year; prevalence, ca. 400 per million) are nonspecific, and misdiagnoses are therefore common. Glucocorticoid substitution therapy {{has been in}} use for 50 years but is not a wholly adequate treatment. Our understanding of this disease remains incomplete in many ways. Methods: We selectively searched the Medline database for publications on <b>adrenal</b> cortical <b>insufficiency,</b> with particular attention to studies from the year 2000 onward (search terms: "adrenal insufficiency" or "Addison's disease" or "hypopituitarism"). Results: Hydrocortisone substitution therapy is often given in doses of 10 - 25 mg/day, timed according to the circadian rhythm. Gastrointestinal and other, febrile infections account for 30 - 50...|$|R
40|$|Auditory {{detection}} thresholds for sinusoidal {{tones and}} various tests of auditory perception were determined in 12 patients with <b>adrenal</b> cortical <b>insufficiency</b> (seven with Addison's disease and five with panhypopituitarism) and {{compared to those}} in normal volunteers. In <b>adrenal</b> cortical <b>insufficiency</b> auditory detection sensitivity was significantly more acute than normal, and judgments of loudness and of the contralateral threshold shift were made at levels more than 20 db below those of normal subjects. Thus both the lower and the upper limits of the dynamic auditory range are significantly decreased in these patients. Speech discrimination ability of the patients was significantly impaired as was their difference limens, their alternate binaural loudness balances, {{and their ability to}} localize tones in space...|$|R
5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There {{may be other}} features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary {{apoplexy}} or pituitary tumor apoplexy is bleeding into or impaired {{blood supply}} of the pituitary gland {{at the base of}} the brain. This usually occurs in the presence of a tumor of the pituitary, although in 80% of cases this has not been diagnosed previously. The most common initial symptom is a sudden headache, often associated with a rapidly worsening visual field defect or double vision caused by compression of nerves surrounding the gland. This is followed in many cases by acute symptoms caused by lack of secretion of essential hormones, predominantly <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b>|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{biological}} {{roles of}} cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 11 (PDE 11) enzymes are poorly understood, {{in part due}} to the lack of selective inhibitors. To address the need for such compounds, we completed an ∼ 200, 000 compound high-throughput screen (HTS) for PDE 11 inhibitors using a yeast-based growth assay, and identified 4 potent and selective PDE 11 inhibitors. One compound, along with two structural analogs, elevates cAMP and cortisol levels in human adrenocortical cells, consistent with gene association studies that link PDE 11 activity to adrenal function. As such, these compounds can immediately serve as chemical tools to study PDE 11 function in cell culture, and as leads to develop therapeutics for the treatment of <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiencies.</b> Our results further validate this yeast-based HTS platform for the discovery of potent, selective, and biologically active PDE inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -year-old boy {{was treated}} for {{asthmatic}} symptoms with fluticasone inhalations. Due to a flattening growth curve Cushing's syndrome was suspected and the dosage of fluticasone was gradually decreased after which the boy became less active and his appetite decreased. Another patient, a 7 -year-old boy with asthma was also treated with fluticasone inhalations. For 6 months he felt tired, nauseous and had abdominal pain. A third patient, an 8 -year-old boy with asthma being treated with fluticasone inhalations {{was presented at the}} emergency department because he could not be roused; for the preceding few days he had been nauseous and pyrexic. Further laboratory tests showed that all three patients had <b>adrenal</b> cortex <b>insufficiency</b> (addisonism) due to exogenic glucocorticoids in the form of inhaled corticosteroids. This condition is difficult to recognize as its symptoms are aspecific and may resemble those that accompany inadequately treated asthma; furthermore, inhaled corticosteroids may mask the symptoms. On long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids accompanied by aspecific symptoms, the possibility of <b>adrenal</b> cortex <b>insufficiency</b> should be considered. In addition, it is important to prescribe the lowest possible dosage of inhaled corticosteroids...|$|R
40|$|Adrenal {{cortical}} {{response in}} acute medical illness {{has been studied}} by measuring the plasma 11 -hydroxycorticosteroid (11 -OHCS) concentration in 178 patients. Those with unbalanced diabetes, acute infections, and severe myocardial infarction had high levels. The results obtained suggest that in a patient with a severe infection and hypotension a plasma 11 -OHCS level of less than 15 μg. / 100 ml. indicates an inadequate adrenal cortical response, and one patient with septicaemia and temporary <b>adrenal</b> cortical <b>insufficiency</b> is described. Growth hormone levels were increased in patients with severe diabetic ketosis but not in those with hyperosmolar non-ketotic diabetic coma...|$|R
5|$|Treatment for acute <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{requires}} {{the administration of}} intravenous saline or dextrose solution; volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult. This {{is followed by the}} administration of hydrocortisone, which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol, intravenously or into a muscle. The drug dexamethasone has similar properties, but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce swelling in the brain around the area of hemorrhage. Some are well enough not to require immediate cortisol replacement; in this case, blood levels of cortisol are determined at 9:00AM (as cortisol levels vary over the day). A level below 550nmol/l indicates a need for replacement.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognized}} works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 {{with the publication of}} On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule, by the English physician Thomas Addison. In his monography, Addison described what the French physician George Trousseau would later name Addison's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and its related clinical manifestations. In 1894, English physiologists George Oliver and Edward Schafer studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their pressor effects. In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts from the adrenal cortex to treat Addison's disease. Edward Calvin Kendall, Philip Hench and Tadeusz Reichstein were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on the structure and effects of the adrenal hormones.|$|E
40|$|Hypopituitarism, {{a disease}} of varied etiologies, is a serious {{endocrine}} illness that requires early recognition and prompt treatment to avoid its severe deleterious effects. In adults it is often missed due to non-specific symptoms of growth hormone deficiency and hypogonadism or mild deficiencies of other pituitary hormones. In some it may present with acute onset of symptoms suggestive of acute <b>adrenal</b> (corticotropin) <b>insufficiency</b> or symptoms due to mass lesion in/or around pituitary. High index of suspicion is required to seek hypopituitarism in patients with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue and malaise. Treatment of isolated hormone deficiency, partial or panhypopituitarism, has gratifying results although they require lifelong treatment and follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Ikaros {{transcription}} {{factors are}} essential regulators of lymphopoiesis {{and the development}} of the immune system. We now show that Ikaros is expressed in hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells, where it binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene expression. Loss of Ikaros in vivo results in contraction of the pituitary corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels, and <b>adrenal</b> glucocorticoid <b>insufficiency.</b> While hemopoietic reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, the phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Given the established immunomodulatory properties of glucocorticoid hormones, these findings reveal a novel role for Ikaros in orchestrating immune-endocrine development and function...|$|R
40|$|The mode {{of action}} of the hormone of the adrenal cortex {{necessary}} for life {{has been the subject}} of much discussion. Among the promi-nent hypotheses for explaining the symptoms of <b>adrenal</b> cortical <b>insufficiency</b> are loss of sodium and chloride with accompanying changes in the distribution of body water (1, 2, 3); toxic effects of potassium (4, 5, 6, 7); disturbance in the dis-tribution of body water not clearly related to loss of sodium or retention of potassium (8); and disturbances in metabolism or carbohydrate (9). Since it seems, at present, bootless to attempt to relate the anomalies in carbohydrate metabolism to the disturbances in metabolism of water and electrolyte, this aspect of the function of th...|$|R
25|$|Critical illness-related {{corticosteroid}} insufficiency (CIRCI) {{is a form}} of <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in {{critically ill}} patients who have blood corticosteroid levels which are inadequate for the severe stress response they experience. Combined with decreased glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and tissue response to corticosteroids, this <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> constitutes a negative prognostic factor for intensive care patients.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to sepsis, distributive shock {{can be caused}} by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to conditions other than infection such as pancreatitis, burns or trauma. Other causes include, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), anaphylaxis (a sudden, severe allergic reaction), <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> reactions to drugs or toxins, heavy metal poisoning, hepatic (liver) insufficiency and damage to the central nervous system. Causes of <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> leading to distributive shock include acute worsening of chronic <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> destruction or removal of the adrenal glands, suppression of adrenal gland function due to exogenous steroids, hypopituitarism and metabolic failure of hormone production.|$|E

50|$|Some progestins, mainly certain 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives, have {{glucocorticoid}} activity. This can result, at sufficiently high dosages, in {{side effects}} such as symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, steroid diabetes, <b>adrenal</b> suppression and <b>insufficiency,</b> and neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety, and irritability. Progestins {{with the potential}} for clinically relevant glucocorticoid effects include the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate (another 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative), in contrast, possesses no such activity.|$|R
40|$|Scavenger {{receptor}} class B type I (SR-BI) is {{an important}} member of the scavenger receptor family of integral membrane glycoproteins. This review highlights studies in SR-BI knockout mice, which concern the role of SR-BI in cholesterol and steroid metabolism. SR-BI in hepatocytes is the sole molecule involved in selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein (HDL). SR-BI plays a physiological role in binding and uptake of native apolipoprotein B (apoB) -containing lipoproteins by hepatocytes, which identifies SR-BI as a multi-purpose player in lipid uptake from the blood circulation into hepatocytes in mice. In adrenocortical cells, SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of HDL-cholesteryl esters, which is efficiently coupled to the synthesis of glucocorticoids (i. e. corticosterone). SR-BI knockout mice suffer from <b>adrenal</b> glucocorticoid <b>insufficiency,</b> which suggests that functional SR-BI protein is necessary for optimal adrenal steroidogenesis in mice. SR-BI in macrophages plays a dual role in cholesterol metabolism as {{it is able to}} take up cholesterol associated with HDL and apoB-containing lipoproteins and can possibly facilitate cholesterol efflux to HDL. Absence of SR-BI is associated with thrombocytopenia and altered thrombosis susceptibility, which suggests a novel role for SR-BI in regulating platelet number and function in mice. Transgenic expression of cholesteryl ester transfer protein in humanized SR-BI knockout mice normalizes hepatic delivery of HDL-cholesteryl esters. However, other pathologies associated with SR-BI deficiency, i. e. increased atherosclerosis susceptibility, <b>adrenal</b> glucocorticoid <b>insufficiency,</b> and impaired platelet function are not normalized, which suggests an important role for SR-BI in cholesterol and steroid metabolism in man. In conclusion, generation of SR-BI knockout mice has significantly contributed to our knowledge of the physiological role of SR-BI. Studies using these mice have identified SR-BI as a multi-purpose player in cholesterol and steroid metabolism because it has distinct roles in reverse cholesterol transport, adrenal steroidogenesis, and platelet function...|$|R
40|$|<b>Adrenal</b> gland <b>insufficiency</b> – the {{clinical}} manifestation of deficient production or action of adrenal steroids – is a life-threatening disorder. Among many factors which can predispose to primary adrenal failure, an autoimmune adrenalitis and infectious agents {{play a major}} role.

40|$|Congenital {{isolated}} adrenocorticotrophin deficiency (IAD) {{is a rare}} {{but probably}} underestimated cause of neonatal death due to <b>adrenal</b> glucocorticoid <b>insufficiency.</b> The prevalence of this clinical entity is still unknown {{because of the small}} number of published cases in the literature.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a label-free, electrochemical immunosensing platform integrated into a low-cost microfluidic system for the sensitive, selective and accurate detection of cortisol, a steroid hormone co-related with many physiological disorders. Abnormal levels of cortisol is indicative of conditions such as Cushing’s syndrome, Addison’s disease, <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiencies</b> and more recently post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Electrochemical detection of immuno-complex formation is utilized for the sensitive detection of Cortisol using Anti-Cortisol antibodies immobilized on sensing electrodes. Electrochemical detection techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have been utilized for the characterization and sensing of the label-free detection of Cortisol. The utilization of nanomaterial’s as the immobilizing matrix for Anti-cortisol antibodies that leads to improved sensor response has been explored. A hybrid nano-composite of Polyanaline-Ag/AgO film has been fabricated onto Au substrate using electrophoretic deposition for the preparation of electrochemical immunosening of cortisol. Using a conventional 3 -electrode electrochemical cell, a linear sensing range of 1 pM to 1 µM at a sensitivity of 66 µA/M and detection limit of 0. 64 pg/mL has been demonstrated for detection of cortisol. Alternately, a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of dithiobis(succinimidylpropionte) (DTSP) has been fabricated for the modification of sensing electrode to immobilize with Anti-Cortisol antibodies. To increase the sensitivity at lower detection limit and to develop a point-of-care sensing platform, the DTSP-SAM has been fabricated on micromachined interdigitated microelectrodes (µIDE). Detection of cortisol is demonstrated at a sensitivity of 20. 7 µA/M and detection limit of 10 pg/mL for a linear sensing range of 10 pM to 200 nM using the µIDE’s. A simple, low-cost microfluidic system is designed using low-temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) technology for the integration of the electrochemical cortisol immunosensor and automation of the immunoassay. For the first time, the non-specific adsorption of analyte on LTCC has been characterized for microfluidic applications. The design, fabrication technique and fluidic characterization of the immunoassay are presented. The DTSP-SAM based electrochemical immunosensor on µIDE is integrated into the LTCC microfluidic system and cortisol detection is achieved in the microfluidic system in a fully automated assay.
