Nevertheless, it was an interracial marriage prohibition, not an interracial sex prohibition. Moreover, it was an <b>administrative</b> <b>act,</b> not a law. There was never any racial law about marriage in France, with the exception of French Louisiana. But some restricted rules were applied about heritage and nobility. In any case, nobles needed the King's authorization for their marriage.|$|E

60|$|With {{a war in}} prospect, and {{belonging}} to a regiment that had an unusual number of officers detailed on special duty away from the regiment, my hopes of being ordered to West Point as instructor vanished. At the time of which I now write, officers in the quartermaster's, commissary's and adjutant--general's departments were appointed from {{the line of the}} army, and did not vacate their regimental commissions until their regimental and staff commissions were for the same grades. Generally lieutenants were appointed to captaincies to fill vacancies in the staff corps. If they should reach a captaincy in the line before they arrived at a majority in the staff, they would elect which commission they would retain. In the 4th infantry, in 1844, at least six line officers were on duty in the staff, and therefore permanently detached from the regiment. Under these circumstances I gave up everything like a special course of reading, and only read thereafter for my own amusement, and not very much for that, until the war was over. I kept a horse and rode, and staid out of doors most of the time by day, and entirely recovered from the cough which I had carried from West Point, and from all indications of consumption. I have often thought that my life was saved, and my health restored, by exercise and exposure, enforced by an <b>administrative</b> <b>act,</b> and a war, both of which I disapproved.|$|E

Given that the legal documents assimilated to the <b>administrative</b> <b>acts</b> have a greater share in the public administration activity, it requires knowledge of its legal effects, in order to see whether there are fulfilled the above-mentioned law conditions or not, in order to use the action in the administrative contentious, when appropriate.
