As the complex is so big, shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the park via roads behind the parks.|$|E

However, they are not immune to their own glue. Some of the strands of the web are sticky, and others <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> <b>For</b> example, if a spider has chosen to wait along the outer edges of its web, it may spin a non-sticky prey or signal line to the web hub to monitor web movement. However, in the course of spinning sticky strands, spiders have to touch these sticky strands. They do this without sticking by using careful movements, dense hairs and nonstick coatings on their feet to prevent adhesion.|$|E

25|$|Once a Tongan has {{obtained}} a hereditary title, be it noble or matāpule, {{he will be}} named with that title and no longer with his baptised name. Such titles are usually for life, but the holder can be stripped of it when convicted of a serious crime, and he will then return to his original name. Some titles are equal to the family name, others <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> <b>For</b> example, when somewhere in history they were given away to another family if the original holder died without sons. In former times a woman could hold such a title, but nowadays only men. To distinguish successive holders of the same title, it is permisseable to add the original name between parenthesis. For example: Fielakepa (Siosaia Aleamotuʻa). No further prefixes such as The, Mr. or Sir are needed in addressing, although in writing often Hon (Honourable) is used. Tongans are still overawed by those of higher rank.|$|E
25|$|As the war intensified, the {{situation}} grew worse, and some prisoners remained in chains {{for months at}} a time, receiving little food or medical attention. Complaints about the conditions in the prison prompted an investigation by Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, who wrote President Abraham Lincoln in April 1864 that Lt. Col. John F. Marsh found the prison conditions to be unacceptable. The report detailed Marsh's first hand account of the prison, stating: The prison which is used for the detention of citizens, prisoners of war {{on their way to the}} North, and the United States soldiers awaiting trial and which is located in a large block of stores is represented as the filthiest place the inspector ever saw occupied by human beings. The whole management and government of the prison could not be worse! Discipline and order are unknown. Food sufficient but badly served. In a dark wet cellar I found twenty-eight prisoners chained to a wet floor, where they had been constantly confined, many of them for several months, one since November 16, 1863, and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> a moment released even to relieve the calls of nature. With a single exception these men have had no trial.In April 1864, an officer reported to War Secretary Edwin Stanton of the shockingly inhuman conditions that the prisoners were kept in, leading to Stanton dismissing Captain Williams from his post. However, General Grant intervened on Williams' behalf, and Williams was reinstated as prison commandant. After Williams returned to the prison, and after the removal of Hurlbut from command, Williams dissolved the extortion ring and resolved to clean up the prison. In July 1864, the prison was officially designated a U.S. Military Prison.|$|E
