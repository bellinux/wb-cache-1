5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that this bridge was used by George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under construction and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull helping their horses across. The bridge also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> not go through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E
5|$|In Han's wake, other {{cultural}} figures, like Ch'oe Sŭnghŭi and Sim Yŏng, were purged also. The regime faced {{a problem in}} Han's work being politically useful in nature but his name tarnished. His name began to be disconnected from his work, which was still widely disseminated. For the future, North Korean publishing <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> employ a policy of publishing collective works of creative teams and withhold names of individual authors, a practice that was observed particularly in the 1970s and started to wane only in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 1896, an American {{prospector}} named George Carmack, his Tagish wife Kate Carmack (Shaaw Tláa), {{her brother}} Skookum Jim (Keish), and their nephew Dawson Charlie (K̲áa Goox̱) were travelling {{south of the}} Klondike River. Following a suggestion from Robert Henderson, a Canadian prospector, they began looking for gold on Bonanza Creek, then called Rabbit Creek, one of the Klondike's tributaries. It is not clear who discovered the gold: George Carmack or Skookum Jim, but the group agreed to let George Carmack appear as the official discoverer because they feared that mining <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> be reluctant to recognize a claim made by an Indigenous Person.|$|E

5|$|The Jets {{had hoped}} to move into what was termed the West Side Stadium, {{to be built in}} Manhattan, after their 25-year lease at Giants Stadium expired. In 2005, it became clear that New York <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> not permit the stadium to be built. After the West Side failure, the Jets and Giants entered into a joint venture to build a new $1.6billion {{facility}} alongside Giants Stadium, which was torn down after the new venue was completed. The Jets' new home, MetLife Stadium, opened to the public in April 2010. The stadium took 34 months to construct, and can seat 82,500. The Jets hosted the Giants in {{the first game of the}} preseason on August 16, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The twenty {{health workers}} facing felony charges {{were found guilty}} and sentenced on 29 September 2011 by the {{military}} National Safety Court of First Instance. According to the International Federation for Human Rights, the trial lasted only a few minutes. Thirteen of the twenty received sentences of fifteen years' imprisonment, while five were sentenced to five years and two were sentenced to ten years. The sentences were {{a blow to the}} hopes of human rights groups lobbying on the health workers' behalf, which had predicted <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> ease their stance after releasing some defendants on bail.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, in April and May 1521, five Portuguese ships docked at Tuen Mun {{to begin}} trading, but {{were ordered to}} leave once {{officials}} came to the region to announce the emperor's death. The Portuguese refused this demand, so the Chinese sent a naval squadron to drive them out, sinking one ship, killing many, and taking the rest as prisoners (First Battle of Tamao). Two more Portuguese vessels arrived in June, were attacked by Chinese ships, but were able {{to fend off the}} Chinese attack. Three more Portuguese ships barely fended off another attack in September, the same month that Fernão Pires de Andrade and Tomé Pires arrived back at Canton. Ming <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> not permit Fernão and Pires to see the prisoners captured in the sea battles and made inventories of their goods and the goods captured from the Portuguese ships.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his return}} to Jableh, al-Qassam {{commenced}} a program of Islamic revival based on moral reforms which included the encouragement of maintaining regular salaah (prayer) and the sawm (fasting) during Ramadan as well as advocating an end to gambling and alcohol consumption. Al-Qassam's campaign highly influenced Jableh's residents who increasingly adopted his reforms. He developed amiable relations with the local Ottoman police who he would call upon to enforce Sharia law on rare cases of major violations. In some occasions, he would send disciples as vigilantes to intercept caravans transporting alcohol which would then be disposed of. Despite the support for Arab nationalism from some of his fellow alumni at al-Azhar and among Syrian notables, al-Qassam's loyalties most likely laid with the Ottoman Empire as {{his relationship with the}} <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> indicate. He was well-regarded among much of Jableh's population where he gained a reputation for piety, simple manners and good humor.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were moved to another {{side of the river}} for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{delays in}} {{finalising}} arrangements for Operation Trio {{were caused by}} disagreements regarding where it would commence, who would be in command, the involvement of Chetniks and NDH forces, {{how to deal with}} the demarcation line between the German and Italian zones of occupation, and what local <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> be put in place as localities were cleared of insurgents. The NDH contributed to the mutual suspicion between the Germans and Italians. The Italian demands prevailed, because they were committing larger forces to the operation. The decision was ultimately made to target all insurgents in eastern Bosnia between Sarajevo and the Drina. Throughout the preparation for Operation Trio, the Italians looked for opportunities to cross over the demarcation line and expand their sphere of influence into eastern Bosnia to take advantage of German weakness in the NDH. Bader's final orders for the operation granted several key Italian demands, including military control over civil affairs in the area of operations, fair treatment of the local population, and treating non-resisting Chetniks as prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|The Ustaše {{used the}} mysterious deaths {{of two of}} their local {{followers}} as a pretext for the killings. The victims were drawn from Gudovac and its surroundings on 28 April. Most were arrested under the guise that they were Serb rebels loyal to the ousted Yugoslav government. They were taken to a nearby field and collectively shot by a firing squad of up to 70 Ustaše guards. Five of the prisoners managed to survive the initial volley and crawled away to safety. The Ustaše forced Gudovac's surviving inhabitants to dig a mass grave for the victims and pour quicklime on the bodies to speed up decomposition. The following day, relatives {{of one of the}} victims informed the Germans of what had transpired. The Germans ordered a partial exhumation of the mass grave, and had 40 suspected perpetrators arrested. Mladen Lorković, a senior Ustaše official, used his influence to have the detained men released and promised German ambassador Siegfried Kasche that the Croatian <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> carry out a thorough investigation. No investigation took place.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{negotiations}} in the U.S. embassy, Chen did not request asylum in the United States or considered leaving China, but instead demanded to remain {{there as a}} free man. However, soon after leaving the embassy, Chen feared that Chinese <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> renege on their promises or take punitive actions against his family members. While in the hospital, Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him. Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving the embassy by threatening his family. U.S. negotiators stated that while in the embassy, Chen {{had been told by}} Chinese officials that if he sought asylum in the United States, his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong. However, they maintained that they had not heard of the threats from local officials that his family would be beaten, and that they had not communicated such a message to Chen. On 3 May, Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of the threats against his family after leaving the embassy, and at that point changed his mind about wishing to stay in China.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Diệm {{had been}} the Interior Minister of Vietnam, serving under Emperor Bảo Đại. However, he {{resigned}} {{after a few months}} because the French colonial <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> not give Vietnam any meaningful autonomy, and became a private citizen for the next decade. During World War II, Imperial Japan attacked Indochina and wrested control from France, but when they were defeated by the Allies in 1945, a power vacuum emerged. The communist-dominated Viet Minh of Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and fought for independence, while the French attempted to regain control of their colony, and created the State of Vietnam under Bảo Đại, which was an associated free state within the French Union. A staunch anti-communist nationalist, Diệm opposed both and attempted to create his own movement, with little success. With both the French and the communists hostile to him, Diệm felt unsafe and went into self-imposed exile in 1950, leaving Vietnam {{for the first time in}} his life. He did so as the communists had sentenced him to death in absentia, while the French refused to give him protection, claiming that they had no resources. Diệm spent most of the next four years in the United States and Europe enlisting support, particularly among fellow Catholic politicians in America and Vatican officials. Diệm's success with the latter group was helped by the fact that his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic cleric in Vietnam and had studied with high-ranking priests in Rome.|$|E

5|$|The Honduras Packet {{reached the}} Black River in November 1822. Bemused {{to find a}} country rather {{different}} from the Sketchs descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian <b>authorities</b> <b>would</b> soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, {{the captain of the}} Honduras Packet abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them if they just stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king or find another ship. Most of the emigrants found it impossible to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that there must have been some terrible misunderstanding.|$|E
