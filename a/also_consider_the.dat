5|$|Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> two to be {{a single}} species, with the {{differences}} in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America {{after a period of}} separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an enzyme that allows uptake of pigment in the diet. They have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the ruber rather than the albus taxon, and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.|$|E
5|$|Several {{researchers}} <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> {{connection between}} the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because {{there are very few}} tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{registering}} a domain, {{the user}} signs a declaration {{that they are}} not infringing on the rights of other parties and that the user will assume full responsibility for any consequences of use of the domain name. The registration process at Norid is fully automated and does not include any steps to ensure that the user has the rights to the name. Disputes regarding the right to a domain name are handled retrospectively, either through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee or court proceedings. Issues which could give the right to take over a domain name include infringements of the Trademarks Act and the Marketing Control Act. Trademark holders will also be awarded the domain if the registration was solely made to sell the domain to the trademark owner. The dispute bodies will <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> risk of confusion, based on the domain name itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the merchant navy we must <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> waterway network connected with rivers and canals, which was used to transport goods in a large area, the waterway network was highly developed {{in the north and}} nonexistent in the south.|$|E
25|$|Although the Khateek (butchers) are {{generally}} {{viewed as a}} higher caste than Bhangis, the latter refuse to offer cleaning services to Khateeks, believing that their profession renders them unclean.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{agricultural}} trade {{has grown in}} recent years, and now provides significant amounts of food, {{on a national level}} to major importing countries, as well as comfortable income to exporting ones. The international aspect of trade and security in terms of food implies the need to <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> effects of climate change on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|One can <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> winding {{number of}} the path {{with respect to the}} tangent of the path itself. As a path {{followed}} through time, this would be the winding number with respect to the origin of the velocity vector. In this case the example illustrated {{at the beginning of this}} article has a winding number of 3, because the small loop is counted.|$|E
25|$|Management {{regulations}} must <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> {{implications for}} stakeholders. Commercial fishermen rely on catches {{to provide for}} their families just as farmers rely on crops. Commercial fishing can be a traditional trade passed down from generation to generation. Most commercial fishing is based in towns built around the fishing industry; regulation changes can impact an entire town’s economy. Cuts in harvest quotas can have adverse effects on the ability of fishermen to compete with the tourism industry.|$|E

25|$|The above {{discussion}} compares line or corridor {{capacity and}} may therefore not be relevant for a networked PRT system, where several parallel lines (or parallel {{components of a}} grid) carry traffic. In addition, Muller estimated that while PRT may need more than one guideway to match the capacity of a conventional system, the capital cost of the multiple guideways may still be {{less than that of}} the single guideway conventional system. Thus comparisons of line capacity should <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> cost per line.|$|E
25|$|One must <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> type {{of field}} {{over which the}} vector space is defined. The most {{important}} case is the field of complex numbers. The other important cases are the field of real numbers, finite fields, and fields of p-adic numbers. In general, algebraically closed fields are easier to handle than non-algebraically closed ones. The characteristic of the field is also significant; many theorems for finite groups depend on the characteristic of the field not dividing {{the order of the}} group.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{very wide}} range of styles of modern swimsuits available, which vary as to body {{coverage}} and materials. The choice of style may depend on community standards of modesty, as well as current fashions, and personal preferences. The choice will <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> occasion, for example whether {{it is to be}} worn for a passive occasion such as sunbathing or for an activity such as surfing or competition. Swimwear for men usually exposes the chest, while suits for women usually cover at least the breasts.|$|E

25|$|Newton {{and others}} before Pierre-Simon Laplace worked {{the problem from}} the {{perspective}} of a static system (equilibrium theory), that provided an approximation that described the tides that would occur in a non-inertial ocean evenly covering the whole Earth. The tide-generating force (or its corresponding potential) is still relevant to tidal theory, but as an intermediate quantity (forcing function) rather than as a final result; theory must <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> Earth's accumulated dynamic tidal response to the applied forces, which response is influenced by ocean depth, the Earth's rotation, and other factors.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{companies}} in Australia have, since 1992, changed their {{attitude towards the}} local Aboriginal population. In 1992, the Australian government began to recognise the land rights of the Indigenous Australians, opening {{an opportunity for the}} latter to engage in negotiations with mining companies to press for compensation and for assistance in preserving cultural artifacts. However, some Aboriginals feel short-changed, given the enormous profits made from mining, and <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> financial benefits and employment opportunities as insufficient compensation for the destruction caused to their habitat.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to bioload/chemical considerations, aquarists <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> mutual compatibility of the fish. For instance, predatory fish {{are usually not}} kept with small, passive species, and territorial fish are often unsuitable tankmates for shoaling species. Furthermore, fish tend to fare better if given tanks conducive to their size. That is, large fish need large tanks and small fish can do well in smaller tanks. Lastly, the tank can become overcrowded without being overstocked. In other words, the aquarium can be suitable with regard to filtration capacity, oxygen load, and water, yet still be so crowded that the inhabitants are uncomfortable.|$|E

25|$|In {{deciding}} on {{what type of}} vine training system to use, growers will <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> climate conditions of the vineyard where the amount of sunlight, humidity and wind could have a large impact on the exact benefits the training system offers. For instance, while having a large spread out canopy (such as what the Geneva Double Curtain offers) can promote a favorable leaf to fruit ratio for photosynthesis, it offers very little wind protection. In places such as the Châteauneuf-du-Pape, strong prevailing winds such as le mistral can take the fruit right off the vine so a more condensed, protective vine training system is desirable for vineyards there.|$|E
25|$|Speculations as to {{the reasons}} for {{violence}} between settlements include vengeance, conflicts over land, poaching, demonstration of superiority, kidnapping slaves, and kidnapping women. Archaeologists <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> possibility that the violence occurred between LBK farmers and hunter-gatherers, both struggling for resources. This theory {{is supported by the}} discovery that various LBK fortifications bordering indigenously inhabited areas appear to have not been in use for very long. This evidence suggests that the LBK farmers defeated the much smaller populations of hunter-gatherers and no longer needed the protection of the fortifications. Another reason for violence, although less likely, is its use in “ritual cannibalism” in LBK culture.|$|E
25|$|The Missouri {{bellwether}} is {{a political}} phenomenon that notes {{that the state of}} Missouri voted for the winner in all but three U.S. Presidential election from 1904 to 2016 (the exceptions are 1956, 2008 and 2012). While states like Ohio, Iowa, Nevada, and New Mexico have been arguably stronger indicators of political trends in recent years, Missouri was a consistent swing state throughout the 20th century. Nevada has voted for the winner of every presidential election from United States presidential election, 1912 to the present, excluding United States presidential election, 1976 and United States presidential election, 2016, perhaps making it the new bellwether state. Prior to the 2008 elections, Lincoln County, Missouri was said to be the only bellwether county in a bellwether state. Missouri is also considered a bellwether of U.S. views on hot-button social issues such as stem cell research, gay rights, and school vouchers. Some economists <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> state a bellwether for economic trends such as consumer confidence and unemployment.|$|E
