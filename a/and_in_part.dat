5|$|Created in 1894 as {{a result}} of {{legislation}} requiring each parish to have its own council, the council presently consists of 13 members and is responsible for a variety aspects of parish life: the general upkeep and maintenance of two recreation grounds, the village green, War Memorial, Community Centre, parish allotments, <b>and</b> (<b>in</b> <b>part)</b> the churchyard. The council also funds floodlights to illuminate the church. A magazine, the Ditton Gazette, is published on a quarterly basis and is circulated among the households of the parish. In February 2006, the council was awarded Quality Parish Council status.|$|E
5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Following Toronto's first-round exit, McGrady {{became a}} free agent, signing a six-year, $67.5 million {{contract}} with the Orlando Magic. He elected to join the Magic {{in part because he}} disliked his secondary role playing behind Vince Carter, in part so that he could return home to Florida, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to play with their other newly acquired free agent, Grant Hill. Hill would go on to play in only 47 games total throughout his tenure with the team, forcing McGrady into a larger leadership and scoring role than anticipated.|$|E

Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> on the relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{from the}} Long Depression (1873–1896), Lyonnais silk {{production}} had become totally industrialized, and hand looms were rapidly disappearing. The 19th century saw the textile industry's progress caused by advances in chemistry. The synthesis of aniline {{was used to}} make mauveine (aniline purple) dye and the synthesis of quinine was used to make indigo dye. In 1884 Count Hilaire de Chardonnet invented artificial silk and in 1891 opened a factory dedicated {{to the production of}} artificial silk (viscose), which cost much less <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> replaced natural silk.|$|E
5|$|The Black Brunswicker (1860), by John Everett Millais was {{inspired}} {{in part by}} the exploits of the Brunswickers <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> by the contrasts of black broadcloth and pearl-white satin in a moment of tender conflict.|$|E
5|$|The SG-1000's launch did {{not prove}} to be successful. The three launch games, {{all of which were}} ported from Sega's VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name {{recognition}} of Famicom launch games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. However, the situation was quickly turned around. Thanks in part to the SG-1000's steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to a recall on Famicom units necessitated by a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000 units.|$|E

5|$|The college had a precipitous {{decline in}} {{enrollment}} and financial stability {{during and after}} the Great Depression, weathering the storm under five successive presidents. Its survival was {{due in part to the}} reorganization of the six-year preparatory program into a four-year junior college program <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to steep salary reductions. In 1943, Shimer president Albin C. Bro invited the Department of Education at the University of Chicago to evaluate the college community; its 77 recommendations became the basis for Shimer's transformation from a conservative finishing school to a nontraditional, co-educational four-year college.|$|E
5|$|The eastern ends of English cathedrals show {{a greater}} {{diversity}} {{than those of}} any other country.

5|$|A major {{planning}} {{issue was}} {{the need for a}} minicomputer at the station. NDRE argued that it was fully capable of delivering such a system, but NTNF instead wanted to minimize risk by buying the PDP-8 from Digital Equipment Corporation in the United States. However, NDRE was awarded the contract, in part because of NTNF's obligation to support Norwegian technology <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because NDRE agreed to purchase a suitable foreign computer if they could not successfully manufacture one themselves. A new minicomputer, SAM-2, was built at NDRE and completed in April 1967. It was the first computer built in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. SAM-2 was so successful that the developers established Norsk Data to commercialize the technology.|$|E

5|$|By 1944, {{by which}} time Norway was {{occupied}} by Germany {{as part of the}} Second World War, overhead wire had been installed on the Flåm Line. The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed, except for the transformers, which were at Per Kure. This was during the height of resistance sabotage, and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production chain and would be set to assemble aircraft engines. Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944, the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged. Reconstruction of them took considerable time, {{in part because of the}} general lack of materials, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because the head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944. In 1945, all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished.|$|E
5|$|By 1993, Romney {{had begun}} {{thinking}} about entering politics, partly based upon Ann's urging and partly {{to follow in}} his father's footsteps. He decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, who was seeking re-election for the sixth time. Political pundits viewed Kennedy as vulnerable that year– {{in part because of}} the unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because this was Kennedy's first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, in which the senator's reputation for character had suffered. Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994. In addition to his leave from Bain Capital, Romney also stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Exton {{submitted}} {{his report}} to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton {{that the report}} and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between {{the company and the}} fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, Madeleine (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.|$|E
