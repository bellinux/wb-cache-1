Owing to drama a child can gain the <b>apportunity</b> of practising and learning his life in games that he likes most. Today drama is scrutinized in four subtitles as creative, educational, psychodrama and sociodrama. The concepts about drama can be explained as creaticeness, metaksis, interraction, action, activity and empathy. Drama is the explanation of a sense or thought by motion, mimic, gesture and in words. In other words it is the animation of a situation or a subject using body language, reflecting by living, transforming into life. By using the body language consciously and effectively, it has an important function at dramatizing the events, getting students’ attention in education, concretizing abstract expressions, at stres accent and increasing the understandability of messages. Pantomime technic in drama method has a great importance at using the activities and human’s world consciously and animating the expressions and events.

This has much truth in MLM businesses since such firms count on its customers to transform social networks into marketing distribution <b>apportunities.</b> The major challenge confronting such organisations is to offer their customers with good reasons to invest in their company. To reach the desired outcome, a richer understanding on the customers’ end is highly demanded. However, in-depth research in this branch of direct selling has often been ignored due to various scepticisms, and scholarly articles related to this field are meagre. In this study, the Malaysian consumers’ perception towards MLM has been examined. Besides that, the determinants of customer equity of MLM businesses based in Malaysia have also been explored. The results of the survey are quite encouraging. Responses indicate that Malaysian consumers had a moderately positive view towards MLM. The findings of the research supports the proposition that various factors of customer personal profile (economic motive, social tie, past experience), marketing mix product, price, place, plan), organisational feature company standing, buyback protection, training, sales team behaviour) and industry characteristic (public image) are important predictors of customer equity that determine the MLM industry. However, different set of predictors are significant in different attainment of customer equity. So, partakers in the industry could strategies accordingly in the respective areas to maximise their customer equity...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{covers a}} variety of topics in {{programming}} language technology, with the main emphasis on static program analysis. A program analysis is an automatic method, a program, which anwers a specific question about programs. Examples of questions could be "Will this program crash?" and "Will a certain part of the program ever be executed?" Program analyses answering questions such as these can be used to improve the efficiency and security of programs. A program analysis can never be exact. This means that there will always be <b>apportunities</b> to develop new and increasingly precise methods for program analysis. However these analyses can easily become very resource hungry, taking {{a lot of time and}} memory to compute. This thesis develops methods for scalable program analysis. As programs grow larger and more complex program analyses should still yield precise enough answers and be feasible to compute. Our contributions include a new constraint-based program analysis method, Constraint Abstractions, specifically targeted towards computing solutions to precise program analyses. The key technical contribution is an O(n^ 3) algorithm for program analyses which uses polymorphism and subtyping. A concrete case study is described: a Usage analysis which answers the question "Is a particular value used at most once?" We also present a comprehensive experimental exploration of the vast design space for program analyses in order to determine how program analysis features interact and impact precision. Beside program analysis this thesis covers two other topics: program transformation and programing language design. A new technique is introduced for fusing functions, thereby removing any intermediate data structure and improving the speed of programs. Last we show how regular expressions can be seamlessly added to the pattern matching facility found in functional programming languages...|$|R

However, creative thinking {{in order to make}} renewal ang change in organization resulted in many obtacles, including in culture of regular and systematic big organization, where the creative person could not go on in this environment. This study purposed to find out the difference of creative thinking between monotonous-working and non-monotonous-working employess. Thinking creative is someone opinion concerned with new thing though fluency, flexibility, originality, and ability to elaborate an idea. The hypothesis stated that there were difference monotonous-working and non-monotonous-working employess. Those who work monotonous have low level of creative thinking, and those who work non-monotonous have high level of creative thinking. This research used non-experimental design. The dependent variable was to think creative and the independent variable was kind/characteristic of working (monotonous and non-monotonous-working). This study was conducted in PT. Telekomunikasi Indonesia, Tbk Kandatel Malang that had 311 employees with total sample covered 70 people who worked monotonous and non-monotonous. The sampling technique was purposive sampling. The instrument used creative thinking scale. Index of validity from this scale was 0. 188 – 0. 617. The analysis method was t-test. The result of analysis showed that t = 4. 556; p = 0. 000 meaning that there were very significant different of thinking creative between monotonous-working and non-monotonous-working employees. The average score of monotonous-working employees was 148. 26 and the non-monotonous-working employees were 142. 43. In other words, the monotonous-working employees had low creative thinking level and the non-monotonous-working employees had high level of creative thinking.

The materials were set {{as an effort to}} provide the non-existance of the English materials for An English Day Program. The materials were developed based on the students’ needs and chacacteristics. This {{research is}} categorized as a Research and Development (R&D). The steps in this study were conducting the needs analysis, developing the course grid, developing the first draft of the materials, implementing the first draft of the materials, evaluating the draft of the materials, revising the draft of the materials, and writing the final draft of the materials. The instruments used in this study were interview guidelines and questionnaires. The quantitative data from the questionnaires were analyzed by using central tendency measure. Meanwhile, the qualitative data from the interview were analyzed through interpretational analysis technique. An English Day program is held for the whole day, from the school start until it finishes. It will give children more time to learn, to practice and to do more activities in order to improve their skill in English. The developed English materials for An English Day program consist of five units. They are Little Indian, Funny Outbound, The Greedy Lion, Fashion Show and Miss Chef Makes a Fruit Salad. They were developed based on the children needs’ and chacacteristics. From the interviews result and the questionnsires result, it can be concluded that the materials are appropriate for the children. However there are some tasks and activities which are not appropriate. Thus, the inappropriate tasks are revised.

40|$|Many {{people say}} that DANEM, the scores of EBTANAS is very {{important}} as it is used {{by a lot of}} high schools and universities to assist institutions is the selection and placement of students. Being curious, the writer would like to find out whether the EBTANAS as a formal, large scale, "standardized" instrument has fulfilled the conditions of a test construction. Based on considerable skill needed in constructing multiple choice and essay test items, the validity of the 1986 - 1987 English EBTANAS as a measuring instrument of the student's achievement is questionable. This study, therefore, is undertaken to analyse and evaluate the validity of the English EBTANAS, through content analysis and item construction analysis. This analytical study will be limited to the 1956 - 1987 English EBTANAS for Senior High School, the content as the match the objectives, and item contruction based mainly on the guidelines or principles of constructing multiple choice and easy items. So far, there has always been an assumption that all English instructors are capable of constructing multiple tests and that these language tests are considered valid and reliable as measuring instrument. However having followed the systematic procedures of analysing content validity of EBTANAS, the following things were discovered: 1. The structure test did not have representative coverage of structural learning outcomes and content. Its sampling was inadequate in terms of learning outcomes, content, and size. 2. The vocabulary test did not have an adequate size of samples. 3. The reading comprehension test did not have adequate sampling. So it could be deduced that the 1986 - 1987 English EBTANAS was not based on a carefully planned table of specifications. Analysis of item construction revealed that to a great extent item construction did not meet the principles of constructing multiple choice and eassay test items All of these led to the following conclusions: 1. The 1986 - 1987 English EBTANAS had a low degree of validity. 2. Of the three subtests, the structure test was the least acceptable, followed by vocabulary test and reading comprehension test successively. Eventualy, the analyst recommends that. : 1. Seminars and workshops on language testing be held. 2. A language testing standardization project be set up at the Indonesian Ministry of Education. 3. An education staff member be given an <b>apportunity</b> to pursue further study in language testing. 4.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} concems {{youths in}} detention at residential group homes, their sexuality in general, their sexual health in particular. and their sex education. According to Swedish law, sex education {{is required in}} the Swedish public school system. The education must be perceived as relevant by youths and promotion rather than preventive-focused. Despite this legislative measure, Swedish research data on this youth population are scarce; available international research shows that youths in detention have poor sexual heal th. The aim is thus to gain knowledge about the sexual health among youths in detention at residential group homes, and to develop and present a sex education curriculum targeted to their special needs. A survey followed by an interview study seeks to assess knowledge of sexual health among these adolescents (papers I-III). Exposure to untoward sexual behaviors alongside sexual risk taking is found, concomitant to <b>apportunities</b> for these youths to experience healthy sexual encounters that may outweigh the risks. Furthermore, this group of detained adolescents are more risk taking and exposed to negative sexual experiences compared to their non-detained same aged peers. In focus group interviews, the sex education curriculum is presented to the detainees (paper IV). They consider the information relevant and share advice of how to furtherad just the material to thei r needs. The data are discussed {{from the perspective of}} social psychology, and the rationale behind the youths' risk taking is explored. The study pennits the voices of the youths be heard; it presents a nuanced portrait of the camplexity behind their sexual risk taking and elucidates the pereceived advantages of unsafe sex.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that martial arts can produce educational <b>apportunities</b> for youth. Therefore, some critical success factors {{have to be taken}} into account. One of these factors is considered as the type of guidance. Hoever in martial arts, {{there is a lack of}} research examining the role of the martial arts teacher. Therefore, a study was se up to analyse different teaching approaches used in martial arts and to develop a framework aiming to identify these teaching methods. A multiple instruments research design was set up, in which 20 teachers in aikido, karate or kick-/Thai boxing were involved. All of them were observed during a training session. Moreover, they were interviewed before and afterwards. The pre-interactive interview guide included questions regarding (a) the goal of teaching, (b) the didactical approaches, (c) the traditional aspects of martial arts, and (d) the probles encountered during training. During the post-interactive interview all subjects were asked to point out specific aspects of their teaching approach and to respond to an instrument specifically developed for this study, which consists of seven dimensions to identify different teaching approach (i. e. TAMA, Teaching Approach in Martial arts framework). Based on the total scores of TAMA, martial arts teachers were classified into three groups. Those with the lowest scores were classified as representatives of a traditional teaching approach, with medium scores as teachers using an educational sporting approach and with the highest scores as those using an efficiency approach. In short, teachers using a traditional teaching methods emphasised traditional aspects and pedagogically oriented aims. Martial arts teachers situated in the educational sporting group were still focused on the traditional aspects, but considered martial arts rather more as a sport. And finally, the focus of teachers using an efficiency approach was on competition and the development of performing skills. Differences are clearly identified in the teaching approach used by teachers of different martial arts (i. e. aikido teachers use a traditional approach while kick-/Thai boxing teachers show an efficiency approach), as well as within one martial art (i. e karate teachers use all three approaches). The development of TAMA was the first onset to identify different teaching approaches in martial arts. In order to generalise the results of the present study further research is recommended.

40|$|This MSc {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. The first part deals with the need for {{information}} from forest campartments selected for clear cutting, in connection with planning in an integrated forest- and sawmill enterprise. A review of literature is followed by a case stud y, where present conditions in a Swedish forest company are compared with current research in the area. The seeond part consists of a simulation stud y, which aims at camparing the accuracy of inventory estimates using different methods. The estimates are delivery forecasts, covering one month consumptian of timber in a large sawmill. The range of inventory designs includes systematic circular plot sampling as well as the use of register data in combination with a data base containing tree data. The results, i. e the forecasts and their standard errors, are presented separately for tree species, log type and diameter class. In many Swedish sawmill campanies of today, there is a trend in productian philosophies towards a greater adaption to customer demands. As a component in this process, the requirements on the flow of raw material will change. The right assortment, of the right quality, must be delivered at the exact right time. Due to the time span between harvest and delivery of timber from the forest, the mills will depend upon adequate forecasts. This implies controlied bucking to meet the demands from the mill, as well as improvment of existing models for predieting log yield from single forest stands. The stand data must allow flexible computerized bucking simulation, allowing adjustment to specific requirements at different points in time, generating prognoses for the distribution of logs into log classes after harves ting. Data used in the models can be collected through forest in ventory or by using stand register data. In the latter case, the diameter distribution must be constructed from the known stand charactaristics, by the use of mathematical models or by assignment from a data base with stem data. It might seem obvious that the information used in the models should be the best possible, but inventory actions are costly. The "total cost" of an inventory consists of two parts, one being the cost of performing the inventory and the other the expected loss, due to inoptimal decisions caused by erroneous data. The optimal solution is given by the minimization of the two components. Customer orientated production in a sawmill might entail great losses, due to lack of precision in prognoses regarding raw material, for products produced in close cooperation with important customers compared to standard products. Thus, different data acquisition policies should be used in stands containing different kinds of timber, to create prognoses adapted to the actual requirements in the industry. The integration between forest management and the sawmill industry, creating a customer oriented flow of raw material, is slowed down because of difficulties in expressing the demands on the raw material - the timber. In addition to this, the ability to forecast log yield is unsufficient, as well as the routines for follow-up between sawmills and forest departments. Large Swedish forest enterprices have the best prospects for overcoming these obstacles, due to large forest holdings as well as a modern sawmill industry. The use of information from forest stands harvested, for adapting the composition of the timber deliveries to the demands from the mills, will constitute a competitive edge for these companies. The development of systems such as computerized bucking control, information technology, including cordless communications, and positioning by satellite, creates the technical <b>apportunities</b> for tailoring the wood flow to customer requirements. Normally, when studying sampling methods for estimating log yield after clear cutting, the results are presented as total volumes of timber for pine and spruce. The results from the stud y indicate that the marginal benefit of sampling 25 sample plats, instead of 10, is small. The standard error of the estimate of total volumes is lowered by only l...|$|R

The increasing of this soybean demands for food material, {{was caused by the}} growths of population, and also by the growth of agroindustrial diversificat ion product that needs soybean material. Kediri is soybean produces area that has a big potention and <b>apportunity</b> to increasing soybean production. Kediri besides that soybean to increasing soybean produces, that’s also where area has a lot of industrial based of soybean material, example soya souce industrial and tofu industrial. The objectives of this research are (1) To analyze the fluctuation of soybean supply and demand for 1 year to know about the high season anf off season. (2) To indentification equilibrium, (3) To know {{about the rest of the}} supply to indentification there are excess supply and excess demand. The data that’s use in this research are (1) Secondary data are obtains from some instation, that are : Food Plant Official of Kabupaten Kediri, Statistik BPS, Kediri City Industrial, Trades, Mines, and coorperation Departement. (2) Primary data are obtains from 2 responden that use to be the sample. The data analysis method are cuantitative descriptive analysis, that use to get more detail images about soybean supply and demand. From the research, the result show, the amount of soybean supply has high season on June that is about 1652 kwintal. But the off season, the least supply on January that is about 57 kwintal. The highest demands is on July that is about 903. 50 kwintal. The least demand on March that is about 468. 70 kwintal. Excess demand conditions on October until Mey because of the lowest productivity and also the climate conditions that’s not supporting to plants soybean. Excess supply condition happens on June until September when eventhough the soybean demand has a high increasing but the soybean supplies is also harvest so there are not happens the soybean supply deficiency. The equilibrium condition is not happen during this research period, that’s because the supply and demand is indeterminate for every months. Implication of research result during a year, retail price of soybean in the market increasing until three times. Notes on early 2007 retail price of soybean around Rp. 3. 500 /kg, on November 2007 retail price of soybean increase Rp. 5. 450 /kg, then on December 2007 increase Rp. 6. 950 /kg. The top of price was on early 2008, retail price of soybean to be Rp. 8. 000 /kg. Suggestion: (1). Soybean producer always pay attention the market demand so that excess supply condition was not occured too long. (2) Soybean curd producer should be produced or bought a lot of soybean at the harvest.
