Until the introduction of the concept of flexible use of airspace, flexible airspace structures were 24 hours per day unavailable for commercial air transport. Flexible use of airspace concept provides a substantial level of dynamic airspace management by the usage of conditional routes. This paper analyses underutilization of resources, flexible airspace structures in the Pan-European airspace, especially in the south-eastern part of the traffic flows (East South Axis), reducing the efficiency of flight operations, as result of delegating the flexible structures to military users.

30|$|The {{vascular}} hypothesis establishes angiogenesis {{as a main}} {{driver of}} alveolarization and therefore a critical process for lung development [17]. The pulmonary capillary network grows along the buds of newly developing airways and developing canalicular and saccular <b>airspace</b> <b>structures.</b> As the <b>airspaces</b> grow larger in size, the capillary network expands through both sprouting and intussuscepted growth [17]. An impairment of angiogenesis indicated by fewer small vessels and their abnormal distribution, is mirrored by a disturbed alveolar structure [5]. The role of vascular development for alveolarization was further established in different animal studies, where, the inhibition of angiogenesis {{by the use of}} specific antibodies or in knock-out mice showed disabled VEGF expression or its down-stream signaling to result in disruption of the alveolarization process itself [17]. In keeping with these studies, the induction of angiogenesis protects or enhances alveolarization in animal models of BPD [21]. Reduced pulmonary expression of endothelial markers in the human lung after short term MV in contrast to reports of elevated endothelial markers after long term ventilation may indicate compensatory mechanisms or be the effect of fluctuating oxygen saturation levels in the developing lung undergoing MV and oxygen treatment [17].|$|R
40|$|Airport {{operation}} {{is a major}} source of community concerns due to aircraft noise emissions particularly in locations close to airports and aircraft flight tracks. The effects of aircraft noise on humans can cause hearing damage for people working at airports and speech and sleep interference which can develop into stress for nearby communities. As such, it becomes essential when locating and designing to expand airports to optimize flight paths in a way to reduce noise exposure to nearby communities. For this purpose, it is required to assess changes in noise levels resulting from new runway configurations, evaluate increased aircraft operation demand, new fleet mix, revised routings and <b>airspace</b> <b>structures,</b> alternative flight profiles, and modifications to other operational procedures. This paper presents a noise impact assessment for the proposed expansion at the Beirut International Airport, Lebanon.

One of these solutions came with the initiative of organizing airspace into functional blocks, according to traffic flows rather than to national borders. Such a project was not possible without common rules and procedures at European level. 1 The establishment of Functional Airspace blocks (FAB) shall enable optimum use of airspace taking into account air traffic flows. In the same way, FABs initiatives contain a new philosophy for design the airspace, the new <b>airspace</b> <b>structures</b> include application of Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA) concept, Free Route Airspace (FRA) blocks, night direct routes implementation, etc. Additionally, FAB blocks look for cooperation or fusion between Air Navigation Services providers (ANPs), all this with the goal of reduce air navigation services costs for users. Particularly, Free Route Airspace concept offers enormous benefits to airspace users, because permits to select the user-preferred trajectories with the optimal flight profile, enabling flights to operate outside a pre-defined route structure, resulting in shortest routes and big distances saving for airlines. Furthermore, free route blocks will significantly impact in ATC systems, changing the way for establish aircraft separation in these new <b>airspace</b> <b>structures.</b> For all these reasons, this thesis will study the functionality of the future Southwest Functional Airspace Block (SW FAB), specially the implementation of the Free Route Airspace concept, focused in the long term phase (2020) that includes Santiago-Asturias, Lisbon, Santa Maria Oceanic and Canarias airspaces in one free route airspace block. 2 Objectives 1. -Evaluate the Free Route Airspace block in the future Southwest Functional Airspace Block in terms of flight efficiency (fuel,CO 2,NM), ATC workload****. 2. -Study the interaction between Free Route Airspace and conventional airspace divided in sectors (flying with RNAV). 3. -Explore the future systems and procedures for traffic separation in Free route airspace. Methodology As was explained before, this thesis pretend to make an analysis of the free route airspace in the future SW FAB, for achieves this goal it will be necessary, firstly to explain the main concepts and background of: Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA), Functional Airspace Block (FAB) and Free Route Airspace (FRA), and others concepts.

40|$|A regular lattice {{combines}} two ideas: a repeating (or regular) <b>airspace</b> <b>structure</b> and {{layers of}} parallel tracks. A repeating or regular <b>airspace</b> <b>structure</b> has several advantages over an irregular structure. The skills or {{methods used to}} control traffic {{in one part of}} the structure are applicable throughout the structure. Regularity gives rise to multiple routes between two points with similar distances flown in each direction and at each flight level. Flow management can select routes which distribute traffic over a region. The same mechanism could be used to choose routes which avoid reserved areas. Since the possible routes between two points have similar properties, the selection of an alternative route has a small impact on flight time, contributing to the predictability of airline operations. Properties which apply to an element of the airspace apply wherever that element is repeated, so that reasoning about a small region of the airspace can immediately be scaled up to apply to a much larger region. Layers of parallel tracks eliminate crossing conflicts between aircraft which are flying straight and level. Together with measures to preserve the stability of traffic flows (sufficient spacing, speed regulation, or ASAS sequencing procedures), traffic may be separated into two easily identifiable populations: a "stable" population of cruising aircraft, which require low controller monitoring per aircraft, since there are no crossing conflicts between cruising aircraft, and a population of aircraft in "transition " to or from the stable state, which require greater monitoring.

40|$|Air traffic {{controller}} cognitive processes are a limiting factor in providing safe and efficient flow of traffic. Therefore, {{there has been}} work in understanding the factors that drive controllers decision-making processes. Prior work has identified that the <b>airspace</b> <b>structure,</b> defined by the reference elements, procedural elements and pattern elements of the traffic, is important for abstraction {{and management of the}} traffic. This work explores in more detail this relationship between <b>airspace</b> <b>structure</b> and air {{traffic controller}} management techniques. This work looks at the current National Airspace System (NAS) and identifies different types of high altitude sectors, based on metrics that are likely to correlate with tasks that controllers have to perform. Variations of structural patterns, such as flows and critical points were also observed. These patterns were then related to groupings by origins and destinations of the traffic. Deeper pilot-controller voice communication analysis indicated that groupings by flight plan received consistent and repeatable sequences of commands, which were identified as techniques. These repeated modifications generated patterns in the traffic, which were naturally associated with the standard flight plan groupings and their techniques. The identified relationship between flight plan groupings and management techniques helps to validate the grouping structure-base abstraction introduced by Histon and Hansman (2008). This motivates the adoption of a grouping-focused analysis of traffic structures on the investigation of how new technologies, procedures and concepts of operations will impact the way controllers manage the traffic. Consideration of such mutual effects between structure and controllers' cognitive processes should provide a better foundation for training and for engineering decisions that include a human-centered perspective. by Emilio Alverne Falcão de Albuquerque Filho.
