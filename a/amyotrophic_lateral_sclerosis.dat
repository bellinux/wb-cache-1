40|$|Introduction: <b>Amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>scleroses</b> (ALS) are {{neurodegenerative}} disorders primarily affecting the motor system. These incurable disorders are relentlessly progressive and typically limit survival to 2 - 5 years after disease onset. An improved knowledge about disease-causing genes, disease proteins and pathways has revealed considerable heterogeneity in ALS. Novel targeted therapies are being developed, but getting these beyond the BBB remains a challenge. Areas covered: The authors review the intracerebroventricular and intrathecal delivery of drugs {{for the treatment}} of ALS in preclinical and clinical studies. Expert opinion: Lack of BBB permeability should not hold back the development of promising treatments for ALS, as the available evidence suggest that direct intrathecal or intracerebroventricular administration of drug is a feasible delivery route in patients with ALS. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of ubiquitinated protein inclusions is {{a hallmark of}} <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>laterals</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (ALS), a rapidly progressing fatal neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. However, the exact cause of motor neuron death in ALS remains unclear. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a homeostatic mechanism, which is activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by unfolded or misfolded proteins within the ER lumen. The UPR activates three signalling pathways that lead to an up-regulation of protein chaperones and a block in general protein synthesis. However, chronic UPR activation promotes cell death via apoptosis. Here we review evidence from human patients and experimental models implicating ER-stress induced cell death in ALS. Recently, activation of all three UPR transduction pathways was shown in spinal cords of patients affected by ALS, including up-regulation of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an important ER chaperone, and activation of the ER stress-specific apoptotic factor caspase- 4. Similarly, expression of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1) proteins, which cause 20 % of familial ALS cases, leads to activation of the UPR in neuronal cell culture and transgenic mutant SOD 1 mice, which are the most widely accepted animal model of disease. Microsomal localisation and SNARE complex-regulated secretion of SOD 1 implies entry into the ER-Golgi secretory pathway, and we discuss the disruptive effects of mutant SOD 1 on the Golgi apparatus and general protein export. Importantly, the links between ER stress and other pathways implicated in ALS, including autophagy, oxidative stress and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, are becoming increasingly recognised, suggesting that ER stress is a central mechanism in disease. These observations suggest novel potential therapeutic targets for ALS. 21 page(s...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMitochondrial DNA {{instability}} {{disorders are}} responsible for a large clinical spectrum, among which <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> sclerosis-like symptoms and frontotemporal dementia are extremely rare. We report a large family with a late-onset phenotype including motor neuron disease, cognitive decline resembling frontotemporal dementia, cerebellar ataxia and myopathy. In all patients, muscle biopsy showed ragged-red and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibres with combined respiratory chain deficiency and abnormal assembly of complex V. The multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions found in skeletal muscle revealed a mitochondrial DNA instability disorder. Patient fibroblasts present with respiratory chain deficiency, mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, expression of matrix-targeted photoactivatable GFP showed that mitochondrial fusion was not inhibited in patient fibroblasts. Using whole-exome sequencing we identified a missense mutation (c. 176 C>T; p. Ser 59 Leu) in the CHCHD 10 gene that encodes a coiled-coil helix coiled-coil helix protein, whose function is unknown. We show that CHCHD 10 is a mitochondrial protein located in the intermembrane space and enriched at cristae junctions. Overexpression of a CHCHD 10 mutant allele in HeLa cells led to fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and ultrastructural major abnormalities including loss, disorganization and dilatation of cristae. The observation of a frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> phenotype in a mitochondrial disease led us to analyse CHCHD 10 in a cohort of 21 families with pathologically proven frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> We identified the same missense p.

5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and <b>Amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players.

5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, <b>Amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E
