40|$|Abstract. Narrow-line Seyfert 1 {{galaxies are}} {{generally}} {{found to be}} radio-quiet {{and there was only}} one radio-loud object known so far (PKS 0558 - 504). Here we present the results of a 50 ksec ASCA observation of the recently discovered second radioloud NLS 1 galaxy RGB J 0044 + 193. The X-ray data are complemented by radio observations and a new optical spectrum for this source. We find evidence for variable radio emission and an inverted radio spectrum of RGB J 0044 + 193. The optical continuum turned out to be extremely blue. This may either indicate additional line emission, for example from Fe I, or scattering of a blue intrinsic continuum. The X-ray spectrum shows a clear break around 1. 8 keV. Above this energy the spectrum is characterized by a power law with a photon index of Γ ≈ 2. 1.

40|$|Background Service {{provisioning}} in ad hoc networks {{is challenging}} given {{the difficulties of}} communicating over a wireless channel and the heterogeneity and mobility of devices. In order to optimize {{the performance of the}} network as a whole, it is necessary to continuously adapt the logical network topology to both external (e. g., wireless connectivity, mobility, churn) and internal (e. g., communication patterns, service demand) factors. Recent proposals [1, 2] advocate that nodes should dynamically choose which nodes in the network should provide application-level services to other nodes. The process of selecting an optimal service configuration, i. e., a set of nodes to host a service in light of a given service demand and network topology, is referred to as service placement. Service placement addresses the questions of how many instances of the same service should be available in the network and cooperate to process clients ’ service requests; where these service instances should be placed, i. e., which nodes are best suited for hosting them; and when to adapt the current service configuration. The main benefit of this approach is that the service configuration, i. e., the set of nodes to host a service, is adapted automatically at run-time. A good service configuration reduces overall network traffic and latency, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E
40|$|Term {{structure}} {{models are}} widely used to price interest-rate derivatives such as swaps and bonds with embedded options. This paper describes how a general one-factor model of the short-rate can be implemented as a recombining trinomial tree and calibrated to market prices of actively traded instruments such as caps and swap options. The general model encompasses most popular one-factor Markov models as special cases. The implementation and the calibration procedures are sufficiently general that they can select the functional form of the model that best fits the market prices. This allows the model to fit the prices of in- and out-ofthe-money options {{when there is a}} volatility skew. It also allows the model to work well very low interest-rate economies such as Japan where other models often fail. The General Hull-White Model and Super Calibration There are two major approaches to modeling the term structure of interest rates. One approach is to model the evolution of either forward rates or discount bond prices. This approach was first developed by Heath, Jarrow and Morton (HJM, 1992). In this paper they model the behavior of instantaneous forward rates. The method is both powerful (it contains many other term structure models as special cases) and easy to understand. It exactly fits the initial term structure of interest rates, it permits as complex a volatility structure as desired, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

In previous studies, the construction cost are estimated by statistical methods. Among the statistical methods, support vector regression (SVR) has attracted a lot of attentions because of the generalization ability {{in the field of}} cost estimation. However, despite the simplicity of the parameter to be adjusted, {{it is not easy to}} find optimal parameters. Therefore, to build an effective SVR model, SVR’s parameters must be set properly without additional data handling loads. So this study proposes a novel approach, known as genetic algorithm (GA), which searches SVR’s optimal parameters, then adopt the parameters to the SVR model for estimating cost in the early stage of apartment housing projects. The aim of this study is to propose a GA-SVR model and examine the feasibility in cost estimation by comparing with multiple regression analysis (MRA).

40|$|The {{representation}} {{theory of}} reductive groups, {{such as the}} group GLn of invert-ible complex matrices, is an important topic, with applications to number theory, al-gebraic geometry, mathematical physics, and quantum topology. One way to study this representation theory is through the geometric Satake correspondence (also known as geometric Langlands duality). This correspondence relates the geometry of spaces called affine Grassmannians with the representation theory of reductive groups. This correspondence was originally developed {{from the viewpoint of}} the geometric Langlands program, but it has many other interesting applications. For example, this correspondence can be used to construct knot homology theories in the framework of categorification. In these lectures, we will begin by explaining the representation theory of GLn, beginning with classification of irreducible representations.

However, in stented vessels, a reliable quantitative analysis of such relations has not been possible {{due to the lack of}} a suitable method for the accurate acquisition of blood flow. The objective of this work was to develop a method for the precise reconstruction of hemodynamics and quantification of wall shear stress in stented vessels. We have developed such a method that can be applied to vessels stented in or ex vivo and processed ex vivo. Here we stented the coronary arteries of ex vivo porcine hearts, performed vascular corrosion casting, acquired the vessel geometry using micro-computed tomography and reconstructed blood flow and shear stress using computational fluid dynamics. The method yields accurate local flow information through anatomic fidelity, capturing in detail the stent geometry, arterial tissue prolapse, radial and axial arterial deformation as well as strut malapposition.

Their history is a facet of phenol-formaldehyde chemishy which had its genesis {{in the nineteenth century}} laboratories of Adolph von Baeyer. Their structures were partially elucidated by Zinke and by Niederl in the 1940 's, but incomplete data concerning their synthesis and purification created troubling paradoxes. As a result of the research by groups in Mainz, Parma, and St Louis in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s the paradoxes have been resolved and a paradigm has been created that has elicited widespread and increasing attention to these compounds. The paradigm, which states that cyclic oligomers of various sizes are formed from the condensation of certain p-substituted phenols and formaldehyde, provides the guideline for easily obtaining p-rert-butylcalix[4], calix[6], and calix[l]arenes in a single step.
