5|$|The lack of {{a passing}} loop {{suitable}} for passenger trains on the Amlwch line meant that trains could only operate every two hours. Coordinating this limited timetable with the main line services through Gaerwen was difficult, and passengers could face <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> on occasions. To make the branch line workings more flexible, a passing loop was proposed for Llangwyllog in March 1914. The work was completed for the summer timetables. This required introducing a new working section, and Llangwyllog became a staff station. As the new section {{was in the middle}} of a line, a third type of staff was required (a C configuration); one of only a few sections on the LNWR that did not use a type A or B staff.|$|E

25|$|Tarmo is a Finnish steam-powered {{icebreaker}} {{preserved in}} the Maritime Museum of Finland in Kotka. Built in 1907 by Sir W.G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co Ltd in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, she was the third state-owned icebreaker of Finland and the last Finnish steam-powered icebreaker to remain in service. When Tarmo was decommissioned in 1970, {{a decision was made}} to preserve the vessel as a museum ship. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> in Helsinki, Tarmo was towed to Kotka and completely restored in the early 1990s.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, Shindo, then {{living with}} his brother in Onomichi, was {{inspired}} by a film called Bangaku No Isshō to want to start a career in films. He saved money by working in a bicycle shop and in 1934, with a letter of introduction from his brother to a policeman in Kyoto, he set off for Kyoto. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> he was able to get a job in the film developing department of Shinkō Kinema, which he joined because he was too short to join the lighting department. He was one of eleven workers in the developing department, but only three of them actually worked, the others being members of the company baseball team. At this time he learned that films were based on scripts because old scripts were used as toilet paper. He would take the scripts home to study them. His job involved drying 200-foot lengths of film on a roller three metres long and two metres high, and he learned the relationship between the pieces of film he was drying and the scripts he read.|$|E
25|$|Leeds {{has been}} {{identified}} {{as one of the most}} car-dependent cities in the UK. In one 2012 study of 31 European cities, Leeds-Bradford was rated as the seventh most grid-locked. Drivers spend an average of 80 hours in congestion. In 2010 ninety-six pedestrians were killed or seriously injured in road traffic accidents in Leeds. Measurements taken on some main roads in Leeds have revealed pollution levels over twice the legal limits. The main reason for these problems is the fact that unlike other cities in the UK similar in size to Leeds, such as Manchester and Sheffield, Leeds does not have a rapid transport system (such as the Manchester Metrolink or Sheffield Supertram) and therefore commuters tend to either drive or use buses, which can be delayed when the roads are congested. There were ideas for a Leeds Supertram since the 1990s, and £500million in funding was to be provided, however due to spiraling costs the plans were cancelled by the Transport Minister Alistair Darling in 2005, even though £40million had already been spent on the project. Hopes were renewed with the proposal for a £250million New Generation Transport Trolleybus service in 2007, however after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> and millions of pounds spent on inquiries, the plans were cancelled in May 2016 citing little value for money.|$|E
25|$|While Catherine {{used the}} {{third-party}} Gamebryo game engine, Persona 5 used a specially-created engine. Hashino {{believed that the}} new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> by fans for the game. The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries so as to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware. Character modelling in general was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine tuning. The characters were originally rendered realistically like in Catherine, but this felt wrong for the Persona series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them. They did something similar for the interface and menu design. In contrast to Persona 4, which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for Persona 5 enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used {{for members of the}} main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for standard event scenes and general gameplay. Persona 5 was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.|$|E

500|$|Christine A. Colón and Bonnie E. Field, two {{single women}} in their thirties, {{expressed}} their frustrations with the Ludys' book in Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Colón, an English professor at Wheaton College; and Field, a former English professor at Wayland Baptist University, criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that [...] "the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God" [...] and suggests that <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> results in an even greater reward, a concept that Colón and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states [...] "the more delay'd, delighted." [...] Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.|$|E
