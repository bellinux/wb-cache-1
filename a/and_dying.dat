40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a general approach {{and a system}} tool for concurrent metal stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development. After analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the metal stamping development process and the interaction level among part design <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design activities, the needs for concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design are explored in depth, and an activity model for concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development is presented. A framework is proposed to support concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development by providing computer aided environments for part, process <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design, advisory tools for part stampability evaluation and part cost estimation, as well as process <b>and</b> <b>die</b> evaluation, <b>and</b> knowledge bases incorporated in the advisory tools. According to the framework, a design support strategy for concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development is investigated to guide the coordination of design activities including material selection, part stampability evaluation, process planning <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design, as well as cost estimation. Based on the proposed approach and strategy, the system prototype has been developed employing the knowledge-based approach. The results of this research will facilitate the rationalization of stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development <b>and</b> thus reduce the cost of metal stamping development...|$|R

5|$|Cases of sick <b>and</b> <b>dying</b> {{trees of}} C.australis were first {{reported}} {{in the northern part}} of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Queen Mary instituted an {{austerity}} {{drive at}} the palace, where she rationed food, and visited wounded <b>and</b> <b>dying</b> servicemen in hospital, which caused her great emotional strain. After {{three years of}} war against Germany, and with anti-German feeling in Britain running high, the Russian Imperial Family, which had been deposed by a revolutionary government, was refused asylum, possibly {{in part because the}} Tsar's wife was German-born. News of the Tsar's abdication provided a boost to those in Britain who wished to replace their own monarchy with a republic. The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany and the abdication and exile of the Kaiser.|$|E
5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming <b>and</b> <b>dying</b> through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
