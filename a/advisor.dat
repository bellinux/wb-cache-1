40|$|International audienceScience <b>advisors</b> play a {{critical}} role in government policy making, yet these <b>advisors</b> are often equally attractive to regulated industry. Despite efforts to manage conflicts of interest among science <b>advisors,</b> allegations of conflict frequently plague advisory committee deliberations or outcomes. This article examines what we term the “shared pool” dilemma using data collected from 92 members of 11 US Food and Drug Administration advisory committees. The results suggested science <b>advisors</b> were generally positive about their experiences on advisory committees and viewed the committee process as impartial. Written comments suggested that <b>advisors</b> linked the neutrality of the process to the success of the FDA's conflict-of-interest procedures. Even so, the <b>advisors</b> acknowledged the challenges associated with recruiting disinterested qualified scientists to serve on advisory committees, reflecting the shared pool dilemma. Many <b>advisors</b> seemed more troubled about <b>advisors</b> participating when they lacked expertise than when they had minor conflicts of interest...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} how market competition {{contributes to the}} expression of overconfidence among those competing for influence. We find evidence that market competition exacerbates the tendency to express excessive confidence. This evidence comes from experiments in which <b>advisors</b> attempt to sell their advice. In the first, <b>advisors</b> must compete with other advice sellers. In the second, <b>advisors</b> and their customers are paired. <b>Advisors</b> are overconfident in both studies and it helps <b>advisors</b> sell their advice. However, competition between <b>advisors</b> in the market further exacerbates overconfidence. In a third study, we demonstrate that the market competition drives overconfidence even when <b>advisors</b> vary in quality. We also investigate the strategic expressions and interpretations of confidence by {{both sides in the}} exchange.

40|$|For {{millions}} of Americans, financial <b>advisors</b> are a trusted source of financial and retirement preparation information. This includes providing advice {{and information on}} Social Security benefits, {{a critical component of}} most Americans’ retirement finances. To gain greater insight into what financial <b>advisors</b> say to their clients about Social Security, an online survey of over 400 professional financial <b>advisors</b> was conducted in the Spring of 2011. The results reveal that a majority of <b>advisors</b> believe that they are responsible for educating their clients on the role Social Security will play in their retirement income. Moreover, <b>advisors</b> have the ability to influence their clients’ decisions about when to claim their Social Security retirement benefits. Three-quarters advise the majority of their clients on when to claim. In addition, the study finds that the Social Security Administration (SSA) is the leading and preferred source of information and education for financial <b>advisors</b> and their clients. Over half of <b>advisors</b> say it is a major source of Social Security-related information, more than any other source. However, <b>advisors</b> are critical of the job SSA does in educating <b>advisors</b> and the public, and are interested in additional resources from the Agency. Financial <b>advisors</b> also indicate that the financial services companies they work with could improve their communication and education efforts as it relates to Social Security. The research findings uncover a need for improved methods of educating and disseminating information to financial <b>advisors</b> and the public on Social Security. ...|$|R
