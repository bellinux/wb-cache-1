5|$|One <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{camera system}} {{is that it allows}} the game {{designers}} to use the language of film. Indeed, like filmmakers, they have the possibility to create a mood through camerawork and careful selection of shots. Games that use this kind of technique are often praised for their cinematic qualities.|$|E
5|$|One <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{design was}} that the diodes created light around the same {{frequency}} as the laser glass' output, {{as compared to the}} white light flashtubes where most of the energy in the flash was wasted as it was not near the active frequency of the laser glass. This change increased the energy efficiency to about 10%, a dramatic improvement.|$|E

5|$|Rome's {{preoccupation with}} its war against Carthage {{provided}} an opportunity for Philip V of Macedon to attempt to extend his power westward. According to the ancient Greek historian Polybius, {{an important factor in}} Philip's decision to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> opportunity was the influence of Demetrius of Pharos.|$|E
5|$|The F-1 draw, {{initially}} {{considered too}} steep for use, was also eventually opened when engineers laid down a new road. In {{the absence of}} any real progress opening the D-3 and E-3 draws, landing schedules were revised to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> route, and a company of tanks from the 745th tank battalion were able to reach the high ground by 20:00.|$|E
5|$|The Persians took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{civil war}} in the Byzantine empire by conquering {{frontier}} towns in Armenia and Upper Mesopotamia. Along the Euphrates, in 609, they conquered Mardin and Amida (Diyarbakır). Edessa, which some Christians are said to have believed would be defended by Jesus himself on behalf of King Abgar V of Edessa against all enemies, fell in 610.|$|E

50|$|<b>Advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> method, when applicable, {{are that}} no outside {{assistance}} or special equipment is required.|$|R
5|$|The <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> re-statement is {{that one}} can exploit theorems from linear algebra on {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent, {{simultaneously}} perpendicular vectors. This gives another way to calculate the maximum number of solutions and extend the theorem to higher-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|The major <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> method over {{addition}} of organometallic reagents to more typical acyl compounds {{is that it}} avoids the common problem of over-addition. For these latter reactions, two equivalents of the incoming group add to form an alcohol rather than a ketone or aldehyde. This occurs even if the equivalents of nucleophile are closely controlled.|$|E
5|$|To wear tefillin without {{reciting the}} blessings: This is the opinion of, among others, Jacob ben Asher, Moses of Coucy and David HaLevi Segal. The <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{compromise}} {{is that one}} avoids the transgressions of either not donning tefillin or making a blessing in vain.|$|E

5|$|An early {{version of}} the modern {{self-help}} book, the 18th-century British conduct book drew on many literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. There was {{an explosion in the}} number of conduct books published {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, and Wollstonecraft took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> burgeoning market when she published Thoughts. However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favourably reviewed, but only by one journal and it was reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular contemporary magazines, it was not republished until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Aratus took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> incident, {{and began}} {{plotting}} against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis {{had been sent}} to Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return. This was a sacrifice that the League was not willing to make, however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.|$|E
5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E

5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Jack and his rival Devon Banks (Will Arnett) both aspire {{to become the}} Chairman of GE. When about to {{announce}} that Jack will be his successor, Don Geiss (Rip Torn), the current Chairman of GE, slips into a diabetic coma. Taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> opportunity, Devon places his fiancee, Don's daughter, Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot) as the puppet GE Chairwoman.|$|E
5|$|Depression set {{in among}} members {{throughout}} the storm-battered community once the rebuilding process began. Fears of possible emigration stemming soon arose. Mayor Tai Herman feared that survivors would consider selling {{their homes and}} leave the Cook Islands altogether. Even Prime Minister Jim Marurai {{was reported to be}} left in shock by the scale of damage. The government enacted a three-month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with the disaster and maintain social integrity among victims. Through September, 265people took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> program.|$|E
5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E
30|$|The <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> method are the {{simplicity}} of the synthesis of reagent, its ease of recrystallization from water-ethanol solution, and stability in the crystalline state.|$|R

5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> to the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the total failure of the attack, Shlomo Shamir ordered the retreat at 11.30 am. But this {{occurred}} on open ground under a heavy sun and the soldiers had no water. Numerous men were killed or injured by Arab fire. It was only at 2 pm that the first injured men reached the transport they had left in the morning. However, the Arab Legion didn't take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> victory while, according to Benny Morris, it could easily have performed a counter-attack up to the Israeli headquarters located at Hulda.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} {{began to}} change this balance. New Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies {{in the event of}} war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> In the event of a war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E
