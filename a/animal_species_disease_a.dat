40|$|International audienceStaphylococcus aureus {{is a major}} human pathogen, a {{relevant}} pathogen in veterinary medicine, and {{a major cause of}} food poisoning. Epidemiological investigation tools are needed to establish surveillance of S. aureus strains in humans, animals and food. In this study, we investigated 145 S. aureus isolates recovered from various <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> <b>disease</b> conditions, food products and food poisoning events. Multiple Locus Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA), known to be highly efficient for the genotyping of human S. aureus isolates, was used and shown to be equally well suited for the typing of animal S. aureus isolates. MLVA was improved by using sixteen VNTR loci amplified in two multiplex PCRs and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis ensuring a high throughput and high discriminatory power. The isolates were assigned to twelve known clonal complexes (CCs) and -a few singletons. Half of the test collection belonged to four CCs (CC 9, CC 97, CC 133, CC 398) previously described as mostly associated with animals. The remaining eight CCs (CC 1, CC 5, CC 8, CC 15, CC 25, CC 30, CC 45, CC 51), representing 46 % of the animal isolates, are common in humans. Interestingly, isolates responsible for food poisoning show a CC distribution signature typical of human isolates and strikingly different from animal isolates, suggesting a predominantly human origin...|$|R
40|$|Regression {{models are}} the {{standard}} approaches used in infectious disease epidemiology, but have limited ability to represent causality or complexity. We explore Bayesian networks (BNs) {{as an alternative}} approach for modelling infectious disease transmission, using leptospirosis as an example. Data were obtained from a leptospirosis study in Fiji in 2013. We compared the performance of naive versus expert-structured BNs for modelling {{the relative importance of}} <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> in <b>disease</b> transmission in different ethnic groups and residential settings. For BNs of animal exposures at the individual/household level, R- 2 for predicted versus observed infection rates were 0. 59 for naive and 0. 75 - 0. 93 for structured models of ethnic groups; and 0. 54 for naive and 0. 93 - 1. 00 for structured models of residential settings. BNs provide a promising approach for modelling infectious disease transmission under complex scenarios. The relative importance of <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> varied between subgroups, with important implications for more targeted public health control strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Disease {{surveillance}} of animal populations {{has taken on}} renewed importance. The literature regarding disease surveillance systems, {{particularly with respect to}} animal diseases is summarised in section 1. Section 2 explores three potential sources of dairy cattle endemic <b>disease</b> data, with <b>a</b> view to utilising this data within the national disease surveillance system and as a model for gathering data from other <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> <b>Disease</b> records stored on farm computers were retrospectively sourced from forty dairy farmers, from paper records of their servicing veterinary practices and from laboratory records held by the practice for these same farmer's animals. In this way, the loss of data on recorded disease events from farmer to veterinarian to animal health laboratory could be quantified and characterised. Frequency and magnitude of veterinary activity on farms was also quantified, as an indicator of "coverage" of the dairy cattle population, with respect to <b>disease</b> surveillance capability. <b>As</b> expected farmers recorded the largest number of disease events (14. 6 per 1000 cow months at risk, the veterinary practitioners the next (5. 2 per 1000 cow months) and animal health laboratories the least (0. 58 per 1000 cow months). Twenty-five percent of farmers did not record any disease data. Of those farmers who did record diseases, 84 % of records were cases of lameness or mastitis. Farmers rarely recorded veterinary diagnoses. When lameness and mastitis were excluded, veterinary records gave the highest rate (3. 6 per 1000 cow months) and spectrum of diseases events recorded. Veterinary records had a high (22 %) percentage of undiagnosed or unspecified cases when compared to farmer records. Veterinary practices visited the farms on average 17. 8 times per year and handled on average 156 cows per 1000 cow months. The animal health laboratories made positive <b>disease</b> diagnoses at <b>a</b> rate of 0. 24 per 1000 cow months. Approximately half of these were milk samples for routine culture and sensitivity testing. Veterinary practice records offer valuable information for monitoring the temporal and spatial pattern of disease events on farms.

40|$|The word {{infection}} {{is a term}} which causes uncertainty among people. After all, {{it is not too}} long ago when people were dying in pandemics of plague, cholera or influenza. A human can be infected by viruses, bacteria, fungal organisms or parasites, many of which can infect several <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> <b>Diseases</b> transmissible from <b>animals</b> to humans are called zoonoses. For efficient surveillance of zoonoses the cooperation of both veterinary and hygienic services is required. Its aim is timely detection and elimination of infection sources. It is based primarily on pointed veterinary and hygienic-epidemiological surveillance. In this thesis, I focused on the importance of collaboration of veterinary and public health services in the prevention of infectious diseases. One of the objectives of this work is to compare the occurrence of selected human zoonosis diseases in South Bohemia in the years 2002 - 2010. The second objective is to compare the extent of anti-epidemic measures adopted by veterinary services and public health authorities. In this thesis, a qualitative-quantitative research was utilized. The research aimed to determine the importance of cooperation of public health authorities and veterinary services in the prevention of infectious diseases. The quantitative part of the survey was conducted through the method of secondary data analysis. In the qualitative part of the survey, a semi-structured interview was held {{with the head of the}} epidemiology department of the District Hygienic Station of České Budějovice and with the director of the Regional Veterinary Administration for the South Bohemian Region. On the basis of the results of the research and implemented interviews I came to this conclusion: 1) The co-operation during the transmission of infectious diseases is ensured sufficiently. 2) The range of anti-epidemic measures adopted in the veterinary field and in the field of public health is sufficient. This thesis can serve as an educational material for students studying Bachelor or Master Degree of public health protection, because as public health service employees they will deal with issues related to veterinary supervision in practice...|$|R

Immunologically normal infants shed virus for approximately 5 to 12 days after the onset of infection. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} rotavirus can produce a chronic infection in severely immunocompromised children, with virus shedding and intermittent diarrhea lasting from 6 weeks to 2 years (G. A. Losonsky, J. P. Johnson, J. A. Winkelstein, and R. H. Yolken, J. Clin. Invest. 76 : 2362 - 2367, 1985; F. T. Saulsbury, J. A. Winkelstein, and R. H. Yolken, J. Pediatr. 97 : 61 - 65, 1980). These findings point to an important role for the immune system in recovery from the disease. The study described here examined the outcome of murine rotavirus infection in mice with severe combined B- and T-cell immunodeficiency (SCID) and in immunologically normal seronegative BALB/c mice. Persistent rotavirus infection was established in all mice with SCID which had been inoculated orally as pups.

Brucella abortus Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), a protective Brucella antigen, was expressed in large amounts in O. anthropi strain 49237 by use of the broad-host-range plasmid pBBR 1 MCS. Neither O. anthropi strain 49237 nor the recombinant O. anthropi strain 49237 SOD, expressing B. abortus Cu,Zn SOD, provided protection against virulent Brucella infection in mice. Analysis of immune responses indicated that strains 49237 and 49237 SOD stimulated a mix of Th 1 and Th 2 type responses in the mice. After the immune response was switched to a Th 1 -biased response by addition of oligonucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs, both O. anthropi strain 49237 and the recombinant O. anthropi strain 49237 SOD induced protection in mice. However, the protection conferred by strain 49237 SOD was significantly better than that induced by the parental strain, 49237...|$|R
