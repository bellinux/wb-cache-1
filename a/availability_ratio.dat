40|$|The {{threat of}} rice {{endurance}} crisis is affecting Indonesia even more. Several opinions state {{that this particular}} problem occurs as the consequence of the significant increasing of rice consumption along with the high growth of inhabitant, while rice production’s capability is actually decreasing. It even worsen by the higher price of foodstuffs {{that leads to the}} groceries scarcity. As one of the biggest rice producer in Indonesia, The Province of Central Java has a responsibility to fulfill the demand of rice. However, that particular demand could only be a merely hope if The Province of Central Java can not even fulfill its own society’s demand of rice. Therefore, this research is being arranged to analyze the condition of Central Java’s rice endurance condition with focusing more on the rice availability in each region. This research is using rice <b>availability</b> <b>ratio</b> as the dependent variable, while the independent variables that being used are rice stock, harvest extent, average production, retail rice price, and number of rice consumption. The method being used is data panel analysis by comparing rice availability pattern in each region in Central Java. By the result of regression, it is known that the rice stock has an insignificant positive impact upon rice <b>availability</b> <b>ratio,</b> harvest extent, and average production. Rice price has an insignificant negative impact to rice <b>availability</b> <b>ratio,</b> while number of rice consumption has a significant negative impact on rice <b>availability</b> <b>ratio.</b> Based on the analysis result, it can be found that 22 regions have better rice availability ratio’s growth compared to region of Sukoharjo as the benchmark of this research, while the rest 12 regions have lower rice availability ratio’s growth compared to region of Sukoharjo...|$|E

Understanding their spatial distributions and impact factors can be, therefore, helpful to applying specific measures to modify the availability of macronutrients for agricultural and environmental management purposes. In this study, 636 topsoil samples (0 – 15 [*]cm) were collected from paddy fields in Shayang County, Central China, for measuring soil properties. Factors influencing macronutrient <b>availability</b> <b>ratios</b> were investigated, and total and available concentrations of macronutrients were mapped using geostatistical method.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the determinants of}} interethnic marriages among immigrants in the United States. The dependent variable is intermarriage across ethnic groups and {{the inclusion of the}} explanatory variables is justified by a simple rational choice economic model. A binomial logistic regression is estimated using data from the 1980 US Census, the last Census where post-migration marriages can be identified. Results show that the probability of intermarriage increases the longer a migrant resides in the U. S. and the younger the age at arrival. Both relationships can be attributable to the accumulation of US-specific human capital and an erosion of ethnic-specific human capital. Inter-ethnic marriages are more likely between individuals with similar education levels, providing evidence of positive assortative mating by education for immigrants. Construction of the <b>availability</b> <b>ratio</b> for potential spouses and group size are unique to this study, providing a more accurate measure of the marriage market by using data from several Censuses. Intermarriage is lower the greater the <b>availability</b> <b>ratio</b> and the larger the size of the group.

We use a stochastic model that captures both the <b>availability</b> <b>ratio</b> of links and the duration of link disruptions to represent intermittent connectivity. We compare the performance of end-to-end and hop-by-hop transport over an intermittently-connected path.

We propose the spaced hop-by-hop policy which is found to dominate (in terms of delivery ratio) the end-to-end policy over the whole parameter range and the basic hop-by-hop policy over most of the relevant range. 1...|$|E

40|$|Soil and benthic organisms may {{be exposed}} to {{contaminants}} via different routes: (pore) water, soil or sediment, and food. Depuration of the contaminant from the organisms may take place via the same routes and, additionally, via biotransformation, reproduction, etc. Whereas uptake from and depuration to water can be predicted well, predictions for soil or sediment are less accurate. One of the reasons may be the reduced bioavailability of the contaminant in the soil or sediment. In biomimetic approaches, such as solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) or measurements with C 18 -discs, the freely dissolved concentration in the (pore) water is determined.

This allowed calculating the <b>availability</b> <b>ratio</b> of the TM–SD structure, and the design formula was given. The Markov restoration equations for the TM–SD system with taking into account TM and SD failures were solved assuming the exponential behavior of these failures. The obtained expressions describe how such a system operates and allow substituting the TM–SD system with an equivalent element with two factor states. This result significantly simplifies the modeling problem for more complex systems. The legitimacy of using exponential distributions of random variables (error-free periods for TM and SD) was analyzed. The performed simulation modeling revealed that the hypothesis for an exponential behavior of error-free periods for TM as a whole (and SD as well) can be accepted even in the case when TM (or SD) consists of six nodes...|$|E

Data revealed that soil profiles are significantly contaminated. The ranges of enrichment factors for Cd (17 - 3570), Pb (1 - 2883), and Zn (2 - 309) are very broad with the higher EF in the topsoil of profile. VIFs of subhorizons are rarely above 1. In a few remaining cases with VIF > 1, the main factor explaining is soil type (especially, Colluvic Regosols, Luvisols, and, Cambisols with shale load). Cd, Pb and Zn ARs are strongly correlated with TOC {{and to a lesser extent}} with pHKCl. Pb and Zn ARs are influenced by soil type and land use only plays on Zn AR. The Cd availability is independent by these two factors. The contents of trace elements measured in soil profiles are very high especially in topsoil. Until now, the Cd, Pb, and Zn vertical distribution shows a low migration from topsoil up to depth. However, we must not minimize the hazard of a future potential transfer. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBuprenorphine {{abuse is}} common worldwide. Rates {{of abuse and}} {{diversion}} of three sublingual buprenorphine formulations (single ingredient tablets; naloxone combination tablets and film) were compared. Data {{were obtained from the}} Researched Abuse, Diversion, and Addiction-Related Surveillance (RADARS®) System Poison Center, Drug Diversion, Opioid Treatment (OTP), Survey of Key Informants' Patients (SKIP), and College Survey Programs through December 2012. To control for drug <b>availability,</b> event <b>ratios</b> (rates) were calculated quarterly, {{based on the number of}} patients filling prescriptions for each formulation (“unique recipients of a dispensed drug,” URDD) and averaged and compared using negative binomial regression. Abuse rates in the OTP, SKIP, and College Survey Programs were greatest for single ingredient tablets, and abuse rates in the Poison Center Program and illicit diversion rates were greatest for the combination tablets. Combination film rates were significantly less than rates for either tablet formulation in all programs. No geographic pattern could be discerned...|$|R

A separate computer technique {{has been developed}} to calculate the transport path length of detritus and nutrients {{from their point of}} origin in the marsh to the shoreline from Landsat data. A nutrient <b>availability</b> indicator, the <b>ratio</b> of production to transport path length, was derived for each marsh-identified Landsat cell. The use of a data base compatible with the Landsat format facilitated data handling and computations...|$|R
40|$|Since <b>availability</b> of {{constant}} <b>ratio</b> approximation for {{the theory of}} transition from free to ambipolar diffusion has been recently advocated, we have overall reexamined the transition theory early published. According to this, a general and a practical expressions on the diffusion-transition have been theoretically clearly rearranged. These expressions have been applied to radial flows of charged particles in the cylindrical positive column of a glow discharge and numerical calculations have been performed for all the rare gases at the temperature of 350 K. 自由拡散から両極性拡散への推移に対する定比近似理論の有用性が主張されている時期に鑑み, これまでに報告されている推移理論を全面的に再検討した。これに伴い, 拡散推移に関する一般的で, かつ実用的な表現式を, 理論的に明確に整えることができた。グロー放電円筒陽光柱の中での荷電粒子の半径方向の流れに, これらの表現式が適用され, 拡散推移特性の数値計算が, 温度３５０Kの全稀ガスについて行われた...|$|R
