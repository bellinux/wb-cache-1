You remember that she should probably be treated with an antibiotic, but when you suggest this, {{she says she does}} not want to expose her fetus to any drugs unless it is absolutely necessary.

40|$|PRE 2 : How to Web 2. 0 This {{session was}} quite {{interesting}} {{in that it}} went over many of todays web 2. 0 websites. The session itself could be considered introductory allowing people to view and play with web 2. 0 websites. It did not go into greater depth of why web 2. 0 could be considered beneficial to an institution or what the adoption rate is like or the technology behind web 2. 0. For this particular presentation I was disappointed at the content that was provided. CONFRENCE: I spent two full days at the conference attending as many workshops as time would allow. These workshops {{for the most part}} were fascinating and the most important thing I learned was that we, as an institution, are not alone in our goals. It was informative to see the many presentations as well as discuss with some of the presenters, the solutions that they have come up with in managing a transition of a rebrand or the implementation of a CMS like alfresco or both concurrently. Numerous ideas were shown by other institutions, which I feel, allowed us (Tim Terry’s group also attended) to bring home the best ideas. It also allowed us to learn of potential roadblocks that we may face that similar institutions have encountered in similar situations with a project like the university is implementing. I would love to do a presentation next year in regards to Google Analytics. There were very little presentations that actually delved into the marketing side of the web and ways in which an institution could increase the amount of traffic driven to there website. We have done this quite successfully and I feel {{that it would be a}} great opportunity to share out story off success, especially in regards to the online ad campaign from the School Of Business. POST 2 : Advanced CSS Workshop This workshop was great fun to attend and a good example in the future of how to present and involve th participants. We went over numerous technologies that can be implement-using CSS. Numerous ideas were shared as well as each participant receiving a cd with the files as well as the completed solutions that were shown. It allowed attendees to follow along and fix mistakes as they went. Overall it was a great presentation that was full of many real world ideas that we as an institution could implement to get us through the next major upgrade to our website. 1) 	PRE 2 : How to [...] .

But weeks or months go by <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> not found time to use these new tools. In this half-day workshop you will have the time (and guidance) to set up some of the most popular Web 2. 0 tools available including: Facebook, LinkedIn, Del. icio. us, Google Reader, Wordpress, and Zoho Wiki. We will also discuss best practices for using these tools for higher education Web development. Bring your wifi-enabled laptop. 2) 	POST 2 : Advanced CSS Workshop PRESENTER: Daniel M. Frommelt, University of Wisconsin - Platteville ABSTRACT: A hands-on opportunity to play with some advanced CSS concepts. Bring your laptops and an open mind. Weĺl cover many of the current hot design techniques: multi-column layout, faux-column layout, advanced image replacement techniques, advanced list manipulation, rounded corner boxes, son-of-suckerfish dropdowns, cross-column pull-outs, CSS hacks, and customized CSS for alternate devices. There will also be a discussion of emulators for alternate devices and a discussion about helpful tools for Web developers. Example files will be made available for the session that can be manipulated during the workshop. For those bringing laptops, please have a text editor and the current version of Firefox installed, as well as other browsers your institution may support. If you can not bring a laptop, you will be able to observe and work with the other participants. Final example files will be available on CD at the end of the workshop.

5000|$|Kluge is {{also one}} of the major German fiction writers of the late-20th century and an {{important}} social critic. His fictional works, which tend toward the short story form, are significant for their formal experimentation and insistently critical thematics. Constituting a form of analytical fiction, they utilize techniques of narrative disruption, mixed genres, interpolation of non-literary texts and documents, and perspectival shifts. The texts frequently employ a flat, ironic tone. One frequent effect approximates what Viktor Shklovsky and the Russian formalists identified as defamiliarization or ostranenie. In an interview with 032c magazine, Kluge described his point of view on writing with a quote by Georg Büchner: [...] "I've always wanted to see what my head looks like from above." [...] Kluge explains that when [...] "writing literary texts, you look—if you're going about it correctly—down to yourself, to your head from above. Then you no longer have a relationship with yourself. At the most, you have trust in yourself that a text will emerge from this <b>and</b> that <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the sovereignty <b>and</b> the strength to throw it away if it amounts to nothing."

If your Lordships {{think that it was}} not a positive order, which Mr. Hastings was bound to obey, you will acquit him of the breach of it. But it is a most singular thing, among all the astonishing circumstances of this case, that this man, who has heard from the beginning to the end of his trial breaches of the Company's orders constantly charged upon him,--(nay, I will venture to say, that there is not a single step that we have taken in this prosecution, or in observations upon evidence, in which we have not charged him with an avowed direct breach of the Company's order,--you have heard it ten times this day,--in his defence before the Commons he declares he did intentionally, in naming Mr. Markham, break the Company's orders,)--it is singular, I say, that this man should now pretend to be so sore upon this point. What is it now that makes him break through all the rules of common decency and common propriety, and show all the burnings of guilt, upon being accused of the breach of one of the innumerable orders which he has broken, of which he has avowed the breaking, and attempted to justify himself a thousand times in the Company's books for having broken? ...|$|R
40|$|Suppose <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I {{belong to}} the same {{linguistic}} community and express in our public behaviour just the same colour discriminations <b>and</b> comparisons. Could <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I <b>still</b> <b>have</b> inverted colour experiences? Some philosophers think so. 1 In recent years, those who have doubted this have often appealed to the various &quot;asymmetries &quot; between colours as we perceive them. The argument has been roughly this: The relevant inversion requires that our colour experiences could differ with respect to their intrinsic qualities while having the same structure or form. But a close consideration of colours as we see them shows that this is not possible. For example, orange is perceived as a mix of yellow and red but red is not perceived as a mix of any two colours. A significantly darkened blue still looks blue while a significantly darkened yellow does not look yellow. Again, red is generally perceived as a warm colour while green is perceived as a cool colour. Because of these and many other differences, the intrinsic qualities of our experiences could not differ systematically while having the same structure. 2 However, the existence of such asymmetries is not the only difficulty for the view that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I could be spectrum inverted while expressing the same colour discriminations and comparisons. Nor, I think, is it the main difficulty. I shall argue that the main difficulty is instead to give a satisfactory account of what <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I would believe and say on such a scenario. This problem is independent of any consideration regarding asymmetries. And as far as I am aware, nobody has to this day made plausible that it can be solved. In section 1, I specify the scenario I will consider. In section 2, I present an argument for its impossibility. In section 3, I consider some recent accounts of spectrum inversion. I try to illustrate, here, that contemporary defenders of th...|$|R
