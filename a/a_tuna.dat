25|$|In a 2001 study, the {{movements}} of Atlantic bluefin tuna from an area off North Carolina were studied {{with the help of}} special popup tags. When attached to <b>a</b> <b>tuna,</b> these tags monitored {{the movements}} of the tuna for about a year, then freed themselves, and floated to the surface where they transmitted their information to a satellite. The study found that the tuna had four different migration patterns. One group confined itself to the western Atlantic for a year. Another group also stayed mainly in the western Atlantic, but migrated to the Gulf of Mexico for spawning. A third group moved across the Atlantic Ocean and back again. The fourth group crossed to the eastern Atlantic and then moved into the Mediterranean Sea for spawning. The study indicates that, while there is some differentiation by spawning areas, there is essentially only one population of Atlantic bluefin tuna, intermixing groups that between them use all of the north Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

However, additional content {{was removed from the}} NES version to make it suitable for a younger audience, and to conform with Nintendo's policies. Jaleco USA president Howie Rubin warned Crockford about content to which Nintendo might object, such as the word [...] "kill".

60|$|Presently he sounded, and I {{began to}} work. I was fresh, eager, strong, and I meant to whip him quickly. Working {{on a big}} tuna is no joke. It is a man's job. <b>A</b> <b>tuna</b> fights on his side, with head down, and he never stops. If the angler rests the tuna will not only rest, too, but he will take more and more line. The method is a long, slow lift or pump of rod--then lower the rod quickly and wind the reel. When the tuna is raised so high he will refuse to come any higher, {{and then there is}} a deadlock.

60|$|Every {{season for}} the five years that I have been visiting Avalon there has been <b>a</b> run of <b>tuna.</b> But the average weight was from sixty to ninety-five pounds. Until this season only a very few big tuna had been taken. The {{prestige}} of the Tuna Club, the bragging of the old members, the gossip of the boatmen--all tend to make a fisherman feel small until he has landed a big one. Come to think of it, considering {{the years of the}} Tuna Club fame, not so very many anglers have captured <b>a</b> blue-button <b>tuna.</b> I vowed I did not care in particular about it, but whenever we ran across <b>a</b> school of <b>tuna</b> I acted like a boy.|$|R
60|$|I did so. Smash! The water {{seemed to}} curl white and smoke. <b>A</b> <b>tuna</b> had my bait. I jerked. I felt him. He threw the hook. Half the bait {{remained}} upon it. Smash! A great boil and splash! Another tuna had that. I tried to jerk. But both kite and tuna pulling made my effort feeble. This one also {{threw out the}} hook. It {{came out with a}} small piece of mangled red flying-fish still hanging to it. Instinctively I jumped that remains of my bait over the surface. Smash! The third tuna cleaned the hook.|$|E
60|$|Before I was ready, {{before we}} {{expected}} anything, {{before we got}} near these leaders, a brilliant, hissing, white splash {{burst out of the}} sea, and <b>a</b> <b>tuna</b> of magnificent proportions shot broadside along and above the surface, sending the spray aloft, and he hit that bait with incredible swiftness, raising a twenty-foot-square, furious splash as he hooked himself. I sat spellbound. I heard my line whistling off the reel. But I saw only that swift-descending kite. So swiftly did the tuna sound that the kite shot down {{as if it had been}} dropping lead. My line broke and my rod almost leaped out of my hands.|$|E
60|$|I was {{not sure}} the fish tired quickly, for I was so excited I had no thought of time, {{but it did not}} seem very long before I had him within fifty yards, {{sweeping}} in wide half-circles back of the boat. Occasionally I saw a broad, bright-green flash. When I was sure he was slowing up I put on the other drag and drew him closer. Then in the clear water we saw a strange, wild, graceful fish, the like of which we had never beheld. He was long, slender, yet singularly round and muscular. His color appeared to be blue, green, silver crossed by bars. His tail was big like that of <b>a</b> <b>tuna,</b> and his head sharper, more wolfish than a barracuda. He had a long, low, straight dorsal fin. We watched him swimming slowly to and fro beside the boat, and we speculated upon his species. But all I could decide was that I had a rare specimen for my collection.|$|E

At Seabright we used to launch a Seabright skiff in the gray gloom of early morning and shoot the surf, and return shoreward in the {{afternoon}} to ride a great swell clear till it broke on the sand. When I think of Sam I think of tuna--those torpedoes of the ocean. I have caught many tuna with Sam, and hooked big ones, but these giants are still roving the blue deeps. Once I hooked <b>a</b> <b>tuna</b> off Sandy Hook, out in the channel, and as I was playing him the Lusitania bore down the channel. Like a mountain she loomed over us. I felt like an atom looking up and up. Passengers waved down to us as the tuna bent my rod. The great ship passed on in a seething roar--passed on to her tragic fate. We rode the heavy swells she lifted--and my tuna got away.|$|E
6000|$|It took me {{five seasons}} at Catalina {{to catch a}} big tuna, and the event was so thrilling that I had to write to my {{fisherman}} friends about it. The result of my effusions seem rather dubious. Robert H. Davis, editor of Munsey's, replies in this wise: [...] "If you went out with a mosquito-net to catch a mess of minnows your story would read like Roman gladiators seining the Tigris for whales." [...] Now, I am {{at a loss to}} know how to take that compliment. Davis goes on to say more, and he also quotes me: [...] "You say 'the hard, diving fight of <b>a</b> <b>tuna</b> liberates the brute instinct in a man.' Well, Zane, it also liberates the qualities of a liar!" [...] Davis does not love the sweet, soft scent that breathes from off the sea. Once on the Jersey coast I went tuna-fishing with him.

6000|$|A {{word about}} Avalon boatmen. They are a fine body of men. I have heard them maligned. Certainly they have petty rivalries and jealousies, {{but this is}} not their fault. They fish all the seasons around and have been there for years. Boatmen at Long Key and other Florida resorts--at Tampico, Aransas Pass--are not in the same class with the Avalon men. They want to please and to excel, and to number you among their patrons for the future. And the boats--nowhere are there such splendid boats. Captain Danielson's boat had utterly spoiled me for fishing out of any other. He had it built, and the ideas of its {{construction}} were a product of fifteen years' study. It is thirty-eight feet long, and wide, with roomy, shaded cockpit and cabin, and comfortable revolving chairs to fish from. These chairs have moving sockets into which you can jam the butt of your rod; and the backs can be removed in a flash. Then you can haul at a fish! The boat lies deep, with heavy ballast in the stern. It has a keel all the way, and an enormous rudder. Both are constructed so your line can slip under the boat without fouling. It is equipped with sail and a powerful engine. Danielson can turn this boat, going at full speed, in its own length! Consider the merit of this when <b>a</b> <b>tuna</b> strikes, or a swordfish starts for the open sea. How many tarpon, barracuda, amberjack, and tuna I have lost on the Atlantic seaboard just because the boat could not be turned in time! ...|$|E

5000|$|During the Bimini trips, Hemingway perfected fishing {{techniques}} for tuna. He {{was the first}} person to land <b>a</b> giant <b>tuna</b> unmutilated. Known as [...] "apple-coring", it had been common for sharks to attack fish as they tired and were near to the boat. His technique involved applying constant pressure, [...] "pump and reel", to the fish wherein previous techniques allowed the fish to run in an effort to tire it. He would attempt to boat the fish as soon as possible. He experimented with using a skiff whereby he would transfer to the smaller boat with the intent of having the fish pull the boat and then tire. He also discovered marlin had a defense mechanism in their swords and noses that made them unattractive to sharks but that <b>tuna</b> lacked such <b>a</b> defense. He found <b>a</b> <b>tuna's</b> primary defense against the sharks was speed and as the fish tired they became easy targets. He carried a Thompson sub-machine gun which he used to shoot the sharks as the tuna tired and neared the boat.|$|R
