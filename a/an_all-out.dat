5|$|Adams {{has left}} behind a mixed legacy. Most historians applaud him for {{avoiding}} <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts is almost always condemned.|$|E
5|$|On {{this day}} the Luftwaffe {{embarked}} on <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> attack against London. Around 1,500 aircraft {{took part in}} the air battles which lasted until dusk. The action was the climax of the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|After Thiệu's resignation, the South Vietnamese {{military}} situation increasingly declined. On the 26th, the North Vietnamese launched <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> {{attack to}} take Biên Hòa and the sprawling logistical complex at Long Binh {{from the south}} and southeast. Three days later, the port city of Vũng Tàu was under assault and the pressure against the Cu Chi front was intense.|$|E

5|$|After a brief stay in Hong Kong, {{where she}} met the disaffected KMT leader Li Jishen, Hu was in Shanghai when the Japanese {{launched}} <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> attack on the city in August 1937, {{at the beginning of}} the eight-year-long Second Sino-Japanese War. In September, she organized the Shanghai Labor Women's War Service Corps to support the 18th Army of the KMT. The women tended wounded soldiers and helped harvest rice near the battlefront at night.|$|E
5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This {{was to be a}} radical {{departure}} from the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, everything was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes would be sent to attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{came to a}} head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas ordered <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> {{attack on}} Ryan. The battle left many dead, and the few sane {{survivors}} barricaded themselves away. What once was a beautiful utopia had fallen into a crumbling dystopia. Some of the events described above are revisited and expanded upon in the downloadable expansion , which takes place in Rapture during the latter months of 1958 and leads up to Atlas' assault on Ryan's forces.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to developing a}} suitable barrier, the SAM Laboratories also had {{to assist in the}} design of a gaseous separation plant, which became known as K-25. Libby helped with the engineers from Kellex to produce a workable design for a pilot plant. Libby conducted a series of tests that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 full-scale production plant in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Ursúa was now {{convinced}} that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully, {{and he began}} to organise <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> assault on Nojpetén. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.|$|E
5|$|On 22July 1944, Montgomery {{elected to}} use the Anglo-Canadian forces south of Caen in <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> {{offensive}} aimed at breaking the German defensive cordon keeping his forces bottled up in Normandy. To meet Montgomery's objectives, General Simonds was ordered to design a large breakout assault, codenamed Operation Spring. The attack was planned in three tightly timed phases of advance, pitting two Canadian and two British divisions against three German SS-Panzer divisions, which would be launched in conjunction with an American offensive, Operation Cobra, scheduled to take place on 25July 1944.|$|E

5|$|Star Wars: Rogue Squadron {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Star Wars galaxy, where a war is fought between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. The game's first fifteen levels occur six months after the Battle of Yavinas {{depicted}} in A New Hopeand before the events of The Empire Strikes Back. As the Empire gathers strength for <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> assault on the rebel forces, Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles form Rogue Squadron, a group comprising twelve of the most skilled X-wing pilots from the Rebel Alliance.|$|E
5|$|The Advisory Committee on Uranium was the {{beginning}} of the US government's effort to develop an atomic bomb, but it did not vigorously pursue the development of a weapon. It was superseded by the National Defense Research Committee in 1940, and then the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1941. The Frisch–Peierls memorandum and the British Maud Reports eventually prompted Roosevelt to authorize a full-scale development effort in January 1942. The work of fission research was taken over by the United States Army Corps of Engineers's Manhattan District in June 1942, which directed <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> bomb development program known as the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} {{of nuclear weapons}} arose from scientific and political developments of the 1930s. The decade saw many new discoveries {{about the nature of}} atoms, including the existence of nuclear fission. The concurrent rise of fascist governments in Europe led to a fear of a German nuclear weapon project, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. When their calculations showed that nuclear weapons were theoretically feasible, the British and United States governments supported <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> effort to build them.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Overy {{had argued}} about the {{importance}} of the memo by the fact that it was written personally by Hitler, who hardly ever wrote anything down. The [...] "Four-Year Plan Memorandum" [...] predicated <b>an</b> imminent <b>all-out,</b> apocalyptic struggle between [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism" [...] and German National Socialism, which necessitated a total effort at rearmament regardless of the economic costs.|$|R
50|$|Since 2007, ROOD {{has been}} organising actions for the {{improvement}} of the education system. The main focus of these actions was against the '1040 hour norm' (a norm that forces schools to give an unrealistic high amount of lessons, creating a huge amount of 'free hours' for students). This 1040 norm caused <b>a</b> spontaneous <b>all-out</b> strike among secondary school students.|$|R
50|$|This {{final season}} of Spartacus began airing January 25, 2013 and {{concluded}} April 12, 2013. This season follows the final struggle between Spartacus and Marcus Licinius Crassus. Crassus pursues Spartacus as {{he struggles to}} feed his ever growing army of former slaves. Spartacus wins several victories against Crassus' forces and continues to frustrate the Romans. The series culminates in <b>a</b> direct <b>all-out</b> battle between Spartacus and Crassus.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} effort initially concentrated on a gun-type fission weapon using plutonium called Thin Man. In April 1944, the Los Alamos Laboratory {{determined that the}} rate of spontaneous fission in plutonium bred in a nuclear reactor was too great due to the presence of plutonium-240 and would cause a predetonation, a nuclear chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. Oppenheimer then reorganized the laboratory and orchestrated <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> and ultimately successful effort on an alternative design proposed by John von Neumann, an implosion-type nuclear weapon, which was called Fat Man. A variant of the gun-type design known as Little Boy was developed using uranium-235.|$|E
5|$|This turn {{of events}} {{convinced}} Martín de Ursúa that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully, {{and he began to}} organise <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> assault on Nojpetén. The enlistment of previously authorised reinforcements was now urgent, but was hindered when 70 of 100 soldiers mutinied and never reached García's camp. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.|$|E
5|$|This, {{and other}} {{successful}} hit-and-run raids by American carriers in the South Pacific, showed {{that they were}} still a threat, although seemingly reluctant to be drawn into <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> battle. Yamamoto reasoned that another air attack on the main U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor would induce all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers. However, considering the increased strength of American land-based air power on the Hawaiian Islands since the December 7 attack the previous year, he judged that it was now too risky to attack Pearl Harbor directly.|$|E
25|$|What {{followed}} {{was the beginning}} of a rivalry which became legendary. In the first conflict between the two, both Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen were very cautious, only committing themselves to indecisive skirmishes. Over the years, there would eventually be a total number of five such engagements at the famous site of Kawanakajima (1553–1564), though only the fourth would prove to be <b>a</b> serious, <b>all-out</b> battle between the two.|$|R

5|$|Though Brigham fully {{expected}} <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> attack on Fort Blue Mounds following the incidents, it never came. The only violence that befell {{the occupants of}} the fort was that perpetrated on those who left its confines on June 6 and June 20. Dodge left a detachment at the fort for a time but after the June 20 attack the fort was never again a target during the Black Hawk War. Until {{the end of the}} war, Fort Blue Mounds served primarily as a supply center for the militia as they continued their pursuit of Black Hawk across Wisconsin.|$|E

The Beast turns and pummels Sing until he is rescued by the Landlords and taken back to Pig Sty Alley. The Beast kills Sum for disrupting his fight, and then orders <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> assault on Pig Sty Alley.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of siege the Dutch had re-opened the sea lanes. Charles now faced a {{difficult}} choice: {{if he tried to}} sue for peace, the conditions would have been worse than the previous peace. The other option was <b>an</b> <b>all-out</b> attack on Copenhagen, hoping that conquering the city would end the war. The number of Swedish attackers are somewhat uncertain, roughly 8,000 men, comprising 4,500 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 sailors and a few hundred gunners. The king planned the attack meticulously, but neglected to uphold adequate secrecy; the Danes were soon fully aware of the details of the Swedish attack plan thanks to a number of deserters and spies able to move between the encampments. The Danes had 6,000 trained soldiers, and an additional 5,000 men and women from the city had also taken up weapons, bringing the number of defenders to 11,000.|$|E
