On 29 January 1865, while working on the proofs of the dictionary, she went into labour; the baby—Mayson Moss—was born that day.

5|$|The {{national}} anthem is frequently played at sign-ons and sign-offs of TV {{and radio stations}} in Singapore, but that use of the anthem has declined somewhat {{by the emergence of}} 24-hour TV channels and radio stations. Media Corporation of Singapore's Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel NewsAsia, for example, played the anthem just before 6:00 am daily to signal the start of their respective channel's broadcast day; while all of its owned radio stations begin their day by playing the <b>abridged</b> <b>version</b> of the anthem (consisting of the first six bars) at exactly 6:00 am, except Malay station Warna 94.2FM which plays it at 5:00 am as a way of protecting the protocol from reaching the Islamic Azan Subuh (which occurs between around 5:25 and 5:58 am).|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{published}} by Ellis and White in November 1876, although the date appeared on the imprint as 1877. They issued a second edition in 1877 and a third in 1880. The book was brought out again in 1887 by Reeves and Turner, and in 1896 by Longman. In 1898, two years after Morris's death, a revised text {{was published}} by the Kelmscott Press in an edition limited to 160 paper copies and 6 vellum copies, with wood cuts by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. In 1910 Longman issued an edition in which some passages were replaced with prose summaries by Winifred Turner and Helen Scott. In 1911 the same firm reprinted the original version as volume 12 of The Collected Works of William Morris, with an introduction by May Morris; {{in the absence of}} a critical edition this is the one generally cited by scholars. In recent years Sigurd the Volsung has been frequently reprinted, sometimes in the Turner and Scott <b>abridged</b> <b>version.</b>|$|E

5|$|All the composer's {{major works}} {{and many of}} the minor ones have been recorded. There have been {{numerous}} complete LP and CD sets of the nine symphonies, beginning with Boult's Decca cycle of the 1950s, most of which was recorded in the composer's presence. Although rarely staged, the operas have fared well on disc. The earliest recording of a Vaughan Williams opera was Hugh the Drover, in an <b>abridged</b> <b>version</b> conducted by Sargent in 1924. Since the 1960s there have been stereophonic recordings of Hugh the Drover, Sir John in Love, Riders to the Sea, The Poisoned Kiss, and The Pilgrim's Progress. Most of the orchestral recordings have been by British orchestras and conductors, but notable non-British conductors who have made recordings of Vaughan Williams's works include Herbert von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein, Leopold Stokowski, and, most frequently, André Previn, who conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the first complete stereo cycle of the symphonies, recorded between 1967 and 1972. Among the British conductors most closely associated with Vaughan Williams's music on disc and in concert in the generations after Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli are Vernon Handley, Richard Hickox, Sir Mark Elder and Sir Andrew Davis. Record companies with extensive lists of Vaughan Williams recordings include EMI, Decca, Chandos, Hyperion and Naxos.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale musical {{works such}} as operas may last sev-eral hours and {{typically}} involve {{a huge number of}} mu-sicians. For such compositions, one often finds differ-ent arrangements and <b>abridged</b> <b>versions</b> (often lasting less than an hour), which can also be performed by smaller en-sembles. <b>Abridged</b> <b>versions</b> still convey the flavor of the musical work containing the most important excerpts and melodies. In this paper, we consider the task of automati-cally segmenting an audio recording of a given version into semantically meaningful parts. Following previous work, the general strategy is to transfer a reference segmentation of the original complete work to the given version. Our main contribution is to show how this can be accomplished when dealing with strongly <b>abridged</b> <b>versions.</b> To this end, opposed to previously suggested segment-level matching procedures, we adapt a frame-level matching approach for transferring the reference segment information to the un-known version. Considering the opera “Der Freischütz ” as an example scenario, we discuss how to balance out flex-ibility and robustness properties of our proposed frame-level segmentation procedure. 1...|$|R
