Material and method: The retrospective study investigated the data of 244 patients admitted in our department and treated with percutaneous nephrostomy for obstructive renal failure during January 2005 – December 2007. Demographical data, investigation, operation notes, indication, biological parameters trends (creatinine, haematocrit, haemoglobin, kaliemia, <b>alkaline</b> <b>reserve),</b> complications and hospital stay were recorded. The biological parameter trends (creatinine, haematocrit, haemoglobin, kaliemia, <b>alkaline</b> <b>reserve)</b> was analysed.

Results: The median preoperative/discharge values of creatinine were 8. 29 mg%(1. 6 - 26. 3 mg%) comparing to 3. 63 mg% (0. 64 - 13 mg%). A return to normal renal function at the discharge time was noted in 23 patients (9. 7 %). Hyperpotasemia (K> 5. 1 mEq/l) on admission was found in 134 patients (54. 9 %).

40|$|International audienceDeveloping a {{methodology}} allowing the simultaneous deacidification and strengthening of paper is {{of a great}} interest for restoration and conservation purposes. To achieve this goal, a conservation treatment based on the random copolymerization of a tri-alkoxysilane with a di-alkoxysilane was developed, the latter creating linear segments inside the 3 D-network. This leads to the formation of a flexible copolymer network associated to paper and imparts its mechanical strengthening. For the purpose of deacidification the alkoxysilanes chosen also contain one amine function. The molar proportions of tri- and di- alkoxysilanes can be modified to adjust rigidity or flexibility to the system, which enables the treatment to be adapted to papers of various composition and states of degradation. Two application methods, immersion and spray, can be used at ambient temperature and pressure. In a previous study, the development of the treatments was carried out on pure cotton cellulose paper [1]. However, most papers, in particular newsprint paper, are made of mixed fibers from different pulping processes and often contain additives such as fillers and sizing. Papers containing various proportions of mechanical and chemical wood pulp and additives were therefore chosen and artificially aged in order to better simulate a natural degradation state. Different treatments were then applied and the main physicochemical properties of treated papers were studied (double fold resistance, zero-span tensile strength, <b>alkaline</b> <b>reserve).</b> The results showed that deacidification and <b>alkaline</b> <b>reserve</b> deposition were satisfactory and that efficient strengthening of the papers was achieved to various extents, depending on the copolymers used, their proportion and the type of paper. The stability of the treatments with time was evaluated using artificial aging, following which the most adequate treatment was applied to a degraded newsprint paper (1922) and its properties measured.

The Gellan gum method can be used also for deacidification as well as for reductive bleaching pourposes. Different analyses were carried out to assess the suitability and the effectiveness of cleaning treatments of paper artifacts. Some of these were conducted by water immersion, some others by cellulose ethers contact or by Gellan gum rigid gels contact. In particular, colourimetric analysis was performed to quantify colour modification. Microscopy investigations (including SEM) were employed to observe the structural modification possibly occurred on the paper surface. In order to compare the effectiveness of chemical stabilisation treatments, pH and <b>alkaline</b> <b>reserve</b> measurements were performed. During the experiment, modern paper samples and original artifacts - considered "expendable" - are used. Based on the acquired experience, results on three cases of studies are also presented.

40|$|The outline {{which has}} been given of the {{relative}} toxicity of Gréhant's anesthetic in normal animals, in animals that were nephropathic from uranium and protected against the anesthetic by an alkaline solution, and in those animals which were unprotected by such a solution, furnishes {{the basis for the}} following summary. The kidney of the normal dog is relatively non-susceptible to the toxic action of Gréhant's anesthetic. The kidneys have failed to show any change in their histological structure during the period of anesthesia. These animals have remained diuretic during the period of anesthesia and have responded to diuretics such as theobromine, pituitrin, and solutions of urea and sodium chloride. Normal animals anesthetized with Gréhant's mixture for 1 ½ hours usually show {{at the end of the}} experiment either no change, or only a slight variation from the normal, in the hydrogen ion content of the blood, the <b>alkali</b> <b>reserve</b> of the blood, and in the tension of carbon dioxide. In several normal dogs which were over 4 years of age, by the end of an anesthesia of such a duration the animals have shown a reduction in the <b>alkali</b> <b>reserve</b> of the blood and also a decrease from the normal in the carbon dioxide tension of alveolar air. From this observation it would appear that even in a normal animal Gréhant's anesthetic tends to induce an acid intoxication, and as was the case with normal animals which were being intoxicated by uranium, such an intoxication is more readily induced in an old animal than in a young one. The nephropathic animals which have been anesthetized by Gréhant's anesthetic and in which an attempt has been made to protect these animals against the toxic effect of the anesthetic by the use of asolution of sodium carbonate fall into two clear-cut groups. Those animals of the series not over 1 ½ years old have shown at the end of the uranium intoxication and prior to the use of the anesthetic a less severe acid intoxication than have the animals of the series which were over 1 ½ years old. In this younger group of animals the intravenous injection of a 3 per cent solution of sodium carbonate immediately before the animals were anesthetized has succeeded in protecting these animals against the toxic action of the anesthetic. During the following 1 ½ hours of anesthetization these animals have not developed a severe grade of acid intoxication, and in several of the animals at the end of the experiment the <b>alkali</b> <b>reserve</b> of the blood was in excess of what it was at the end of the uranium intoxication and before an anesthetic was administered. Animals of this protected group have remained diuretic throughout the experiment and have shown an active diuresis from pituitrin, theobromine, and solutions of urea and sodium chloride. The kidneys of such animals have shown histologically a normal vascular tissue, a convoluted tubule epithelium which gave the appearance of being hyperactive, and only occasionally were tubules encountered which showed signs of an early epithelial degeneration. The nephropathic animals of the series in which a solution of sodium carbonate failed to afford any protection against Gréhant's anesthetic were animals over 1 ½ years old in which the uranium intoxication had resulted in a severer grade of add intoxication than in the younger animals. When these older animals were given intravenously the carbonate solution and were anesthetized, it was found impossible to increase the <b>alkali</b> <b>reserve</b> of the blood to the same extent as was possible in the younger animals. Furthermore, the alkaline solution during the period of anesthesia is rapidly used up so that by the termination of these experiments the animals may have an <b>alkali</b> <b>reserve</b> of the blood which may be even lower than was the <b>alkali</b> <b>reserve</b> before the use of the carbonate. These animals have remained completely anuric throughout the experiments and have shown no diuretic effect from those diuretics which in the animals that were successfully protected by the carbonate induced free diuresis. The kidneys of these anuric animals show no degenerative changes in the glomerular vessels. The capillaries are not distended with blood as has been the case with the diuretic group. The epithelium of the convoluted tubules is acutely swollen. The swelling has frequently taken place to such an extent that the lumen of the tubules has become obliterated. The nephropathic animals of the series which served as control animals and which were given a solution of sodium chloride equimolecular with the carbonate solution, following Gréhant's anesthetic became completely anuric. The sodium chloride solution furnished no protection against the anesthetic. The animals of all ages became anuric and unresponsive to the diuretic substances which have been used during this study. With the establishment of a state of anuria in these control animals the hydrogen ion content of the blood has increased, the <b>alkali</b> <b>reserve</b> of the blood has been rapidly depleted, and associated with this change the carbon dioxide tension has been reduced. The rapidity with which these changes develop and the degree of acid intoxication which is induced is more marked in these animals than in any of the other series. The kidneys of the control animals show the severest grade of degeneration of any of the nephropathic animals. The epithelium of the convoluted tubules is not only severely swollen but the cells frequently show necrosis.

A marked increase in nitrogen excretion in the urine (Hall and Whipple (2)) and a fall in the <b>alkaline</b> <b>reserve</b> of the blood (Denis and Martin (3)) were noted after radiation. Radiation of the abdomen of laboratory animals other than dogs (cats, rabbits~ rats and mice) produced the same effects (4). The onset of diarrhea and of othe...|$|R
40|$|Four ruminal {{cannulated}} Texel wethers {{were used}} to study {{the long-term effects of}} an acidotic diet on ruminal parameters and blood acid-base status. The short-term events around feeding and the recovery of the animals were followed after this nutritional disturbance. Sheep were limit-fed consecutively a control diet H (100 % hay) (one week), an acidotic diet W (60 % wheat + 40 % hay) (2 weeks), and again the control diet (2 weeks). Mean, minimum and maximum ruminal pH were lower, and the time and area under pH 6. 0 were higher (P 0. 05). All ruminal parameters, except for ammonia, recovered to initial levels during the H diet redistribution (P < 0. 05) while blood parameters decreased (pH, P < 0. 05; bicarbonates (HCO 3 –), total CO 2 content (TCO 2), base excess in whole blood (Beb) and in extra cellular fluid (Beecf), P < 0. 01). This decrease, initiated during the distribution of the acidotic diet, suggests a mobilization of body <b>alkaline</b> <b>reserves</b> and a longer recovery time in blood than in the rumen. We observed a non-lactic but butyric latent acidosis, linked to Entodiniomorph proliferation, suggesting an intermediate stage before the onset of acute lactic acidosis...|$|R
40|$|Blood pH, {{carbon dioxide}} and oxygen partial pressures, bicarbonate, total carbon dioxide, base excess, {{standard}} bicarbonate and oxygen saturation concentrations were measured by blood gas analyses {{in a study of}} assessment of the acid-base status in young calves. Venous blood samples were taken from 80 healthy female Holstein calves, from four to 30 days of age. The calves were divided in two groups based on the interval between the morning milk feeding and the blood sample collection (up to 30 minutes or over two hours). Greater <b>alkali</b> <b>reserve</b> and higher carbon dioxide pressure values were observed later than 2 h after milk feeding, supporting the influence of the diet on the acid-base balance of calves during the milk feeding phase...|$|R

This report has its main object in showing the results of investigations into the relativity between Kupriferrocyanid Kolloid Reaktion and Zambrini-Watanabe Reaction. As the results of experiments on 88 cases, I obtained the following corelation formulas of Kupriferrocyanid Kolloid Reaction for the colour number of Zambrini-Watanabe Reaction (Z), saliva pH and Van Slyke-Cullens blood <b>Alkali</b> <b>Reserve</b> V (Vol%) : Z= 13. 70 - 1. 87 N pH= 7. 94 - 0. 374 N V=(14. 25 + C) - 4. 67 N, where N=(4 /x) ^ x denotes the volume of titration, N represents the degree of fatigue measured by the N-scale of Kupriferrocyanid Kolloid Reaktion respectively.

40|$|Lake Orta (N. Italy) was {{severely}} polluted from 1927 by an effluent from a rayon factory, which discharged great amounts of ammonium nitrogen and copper into the lake. In the mid nineteen fifties, some plating factories also started dumping chromium and aluminum. As {{a result of}} ammonium oxidation, the lake became very acid and the concentration of metals in the waters reached very high values. Phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish disappeared suddenly from the lake which was by 1930 classified as “sterile”. Later on, about the fifties, a small population of Cyclops abyssorum re-colonised the lake together with some rotifers, in particular Hexarthra fennica. In mid eighties following the introduction of anti-pollution legislation, ammonium loads were greatly reduced and Daphnia obtusa was recorded. The lake waters however were still very acid, prompting the proposal of the Istituto Italiano di Idrobiologia to lime the lake with calcium carbonate to neutralise the excess acidity and reconstruct the <b>alkaline</b> <b>reserve.</b> This was done successfully from May 1989 to June 1990. pH values began to rise {{and in the same}} time the metal concentrations decreased, so that at present the lake waters are almost “normal”. In the meantime, due to the increased pH values, D. obtusa was replaced by D. longispina and, as toxic metal concentrations became lower, Megacyclops viridis, Bosmina longirostris, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Keratella quadrata, Asplanchna priodonta. and other Brachionidae species appeared. Diaptomidae are still absent, except for some specimens of Arctodiaptomus wierzejskii...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{lamination}} is {{a widely}} used method to consolidate fragile documents. Previous studies have presented a new method of lamination that allows the consolidation of documents before undertaking aqueous treatments. In this method a thin Japanese paper coated with an acrylic resin is applied on the fragile document {{by means of a}} heated press. In this work we optimised the preparation of the lamination sheets as well as the working procedures, {{and we were able to}} establish that our laboratory-made specimens are chemically stable, easily reversible and permeable to aqueous solutions. The latest property is of particular importance, since it allows a subsequent aqueous deacidification even for fragile documents. The laminated paper documents were further analysed by means of colorimetry and FTIR spectroscopy before and after accelerated ageing as well as by determination of the <b>alkali</b> <b>reserve</b> left on the coated paper, in order to compare our lamination method with other commercially available lamination sheets...|$|R
