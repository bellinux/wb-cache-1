5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E

5|$|His {{conception}} of 'marvellous reality' {{revolves around the}} natural fantastic qualities of Latin America and the Caribbean, {{as opposed to the}} overly forced and cliché efforts by European surrealists to portray magical occurrences. The result was the presentation of impossible or fantastic events described <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> completely usual and natural, such as the metamorphoses of Mackandal and Ti Noel. These events, however, often represent the beliefs of other characters in the novel. For a more detailed account of the differences between magic realism and Carpentier's real maravilloso, see the page on magic realism.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, {{which have the}} same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E
5|$|McCoy led the Longhorns, {{who were}} ranked number {{four in the}} {{pre-season}} Associated Press Poll and Coaches Poll, to a 21–13 victory over unranked Arkansas State in the season opener. McCoy threw two touchdown passes and two interceptions. He also made two quick-kick punts when the Longhorns lined up <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> attempting to convert on fourth down. He averaged thirty yards per kick and both kicks were downed inside the opponent's twenty yard-line. In the second game, McCoy led the Longhorns to a 34–13 victory over #19-ranked TCU.|$|E

5|$|Rehabilitation is {{available}} to some confiscated slow lorises. Organizations such as the International Animal Rescue (IAR) run sanctuaries that offer lifelong care to slow lorises that have had their teeth removed, while also providing education and awareness programs to local people to help end domestic trade. By collaborating with authorities, healthy slow lorises are released back into the wild. However, identification is critical because authorities still manage all slow lorises <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> from one species, resulting in species being released into the wrong locations and increasing confusion in taxonomy and conservation.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore trees {{produce their}} flowers in hanging {{branched}} clusters known as panicles that contain {{a variety of}} different flower types. Most are morphologically bisexual, with both male and female organs, but function <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unisexual. Some are both morphologically and functionally male, others morphologically bisexual but function as males, and still others are morphologically bisexual but function as females. All of the flower types can produce pollen, but the pollen from functionally female flowers does not germinate. All flowers produce nectar, the functionally female flowers producing it in greater volume and with a higher sugar content.|$|E

Allen argued that lynching photographers were more than passive spectators. They positioned and lit the corpses <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> game birds, he wrote, and the postcards became {{an important part of}} the act, emphasizing its political nature.|$|E
5000|$|A false {{dichotomy}} is {{an informal}} fallacy {{consisting of a}} supposed dichotomy which fails {{one or both of}} the conditions: it is not jointly exhaustive and/or not mutually exclusive.

5|$|While the Myrmica ant colony can {{identify}} {{each other through}} chemical signaling, social ranks are partially determined by sound acoustics. Therefore, once the P. rebeli begin to mimic {{the sound of the}} queen ant, the worker ants begin to treat the P. rebeli {{as if it were the}} queen ant. On the other hand, the queen ant treats the P. rebeli larvae and pupae <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> rivals, as she is the only one in the colony that recognizes that the P. rebeli larvae is not ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} in 1947, García Márquez {{stayed in}} Bogotá to study {{law at the}} Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where he had a special dedication to reading. La metamorfosis by Franz Kafka «in the false translation of Jorge Luis Borges» was a work that especially inspired him. He was excited {{with the idea of}} writing, not traditional literature, but a style similar to his grandfather's stories, in which «they inserted extraordinary events and anomalies <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> simply an aspect of everyday life». His desire to be a writer grew. A little later, he published his first, La tercera resignación, which appeared in the September 13th, 1947 edition of the newspaper El Espectador.|$|E

5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, {{they are free to}} move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is found}} in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf {{butterfly}} and autumn leaf are remarkable imitations of leaves. As caterpillars, many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks or branches. Others have deimatic behaviours, such as rearing up and waving their front ends which are marked with eyespots <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> snakes. Some papilionid caterpillars such as the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes) resemble bird droppings. Some caterpillars have hairs and bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations. Some species are myrmecophiles, forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection. Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous. Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their eggs from parasitoidal wasps.|$|E
