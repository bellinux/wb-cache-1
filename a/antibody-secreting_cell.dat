The conjugates induced Pn 12 F-specific <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cells</b> in peripheral blood with numbers and isotype distribution similar to those induced by Pnu-Imune, with immunoglobulin A (IgA) as the predominant isotype.

40|$|The {{time-dependent}} {{increase in}} the average affinity of serum antibody after immunization (1), {{is said to be}} a result of antigen-driven selection of those antibody-forming cell precursors having the highest affinity antigen receptors (2). This interpretation infers that the specificity and affinity of antigen-binding receptors on antibody-forming cell precursors are directly correlated to the serum antibody produced by progeny antibodysecreting cells. It has been found that changes in the affinity of serum antibody with time after immunization reflect changes in the population of antibody-secreting cells. By determining the concentration of antigen required to inhibit individual plaque-forming cells (PFC) assayed at various times after immunization, a time-dependent avidity increase at the <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cell</b> level is seen and is comparable to the increase in affinity found in serum antibody (3). Thus, a good correlation between the (intrinsic) affinity of serum antibody and the avidity of the <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cell</b> products has been established.

Because of this restriction, most blood circulating rotavirus-specific B cells are hypothesized to originate in Peyer's patches and should express the intestinal homing receptor α 4 β 7. To test this hypothesis in humans, {{we used a}} flow cytometry assay that identifies antigen-activated (IgD−) B cells (CD 19 +) that express surface rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin. With this assay we could detect rotavirus-specific B cells in both children and adults with an acute rotavirus (RV) infection. Staining with an anti-α 4 β 7 monoclonal antibody, we could determine that B cells that express rotavirus-specific surface immunoglobulin predominantly express α 4 β 7. The response of rotavirus-specific <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cells</b> in the peripheral blood of children and adults with acute rotavirus infection was also studied by ELISPOT. The <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cells</b> of children were mainly of the IgM isotype, while the <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cells</b> of adults were predominantly of the IgA and IgG isotype. α 4 β 7 + and α 4 β 7 − subsets of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} were purified using paramagnetic beads and then tested in the ELISPOT assay.

Four of 34 volunteers experienced transient fevers, and three reported diarrhea during the first 3 days of the study. Half of the volunteers mounted a positive serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) response to S. flexneri lipopolysaccharide. All {{but one of the}} volunteers excreted the vaccine in their stools for 1 to 33 days, and this excretion was often intermittent. Data from the community-based study were supplemented with an inpatient trial in which three volunteers received 103 and nine received 104 CFU. All volunteers who received 103 CFU excreted SC 602 and had an IgA <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cell</b> response. Two of these had a serum IgA response. Six of the nine volunteers who received 104 CFU excreted SC 602. One vaccinee had a transient fever and two met the definition of diarrhea.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{evaluated}} {{the capacity of}} an oral multivalent enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) vaccine (MEV) to induce mucosal immunological memory. MEV consists of four inactivated E. coli strains over-expressing the major colonization factors (CFs) CFA/I, CS 3, CS 5 and CS 6 and the LTB-related toxoid LCTBA. Memory responses were analyzed by comparing the magnitudes and kinetics of intestine-derived <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cell</b> responses to a single dose of MEV in three groups of adult Swedish volunteers (n= 16 – 19 subjects per group) in a Phase I trial: non-immunized controls (I) and subjects who in a previous Phase I trial 13 – 23 months earlier had received two biweekly doses of MEV (II) or MEV+double mutant LT (dmLT) adjuvant (III). Responses against CFs and LTB were analyzed in antibodies in lymphocyte secretions (ALS) of blood mononuclear cells collected before (day 0) and 4 / 5 and 7 days after immunization. Specific circulating memory B cells present {{at the time of}} the single dose vaccination were also studied to determine if such cells may reflect mucosal memory. Considerably higher and significantly more frequent IgA ALS responses against all CFs and LTB were induced by the single vaccine dose in the previously immunized than in non-immunized volunteers. Furthermore, peak IgA ALS responses against all antigens were observed on days 4 / 5 in most of the previously immunized subjects whereas only a few previously non-vaccinated individuals responded before day 7. Priming with adjuvant did not influence memory responses. Circulating vaccine specific IgA memory B cells were not detected, whereas anti-toxin IgG memory B cells were identified 13 – 23 months after priming vaccination. We conclude that MEV induces functional mucosal immunological memory which remains at least 1 – 2 years. Furthermore, our results support that analysis of <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cell</b> responses after booster vaccination may be a useful approach to evaluate longstanding mucosal immunological memory in humans.

TT-specific <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cells</b> were found concomitantly with cells secreting RF, mainly of the IgM isotype. Elevated levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC) containing IgG and C 3 were observed shortly before the appearance of both TT-specific <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cells</b> and IgM RF-secreting cells. Thus, after booster immunization with TT, two major subpopulations of immunoglobulin-secreting cells appear concomitantly in the peripheral circulation: a population of cells secreting TT-specific antibody and a population of cells secreting IgM RF.

Overall, the route of infection had little effect on the MBC frequency in each anatomical location. Interestingly, after both routes of infection there was a trend towards preferential MBC accumulation in the mediastinal lymph node. Intravaginal challenge of mice primed by footpad or intranasal infection generated similar secondary IgG responses. Our findings indicate that the widespread dispersion of MBCs to lymphoid tissues throughout the body is largely independent of the route of infection, but may be influenced by tissue-specific factors...|$|E

There was heterogeneity within the memory pools, because IgM-bearing memory cells were sensitive to BLyS depletion whereas IgG-bearing memory cells were not, although both were more resistant than naïve cells.

Yet, human recipients of kidney transplants with normal function usually exhibit {{little or no}} antibody specific for the transplant donor during the early weeks and months after transplantation. Indeed, the absence of antidonor antibodies is taken to reflect effective immunosuppressive therapy and to predict a favorable outcome. Whether the absence of donor‐specific antibodies reflects absence of a B cell response to the donor, tolerance to the donor or immunity masked by binding of donor‐specific antibodies to the graft is not known. To distinguish between these possibilities, we devised a novel ELISPOT, using cultured donor, recipient and third‐party fibroblasts as targets. We enumerated donor‐specific <b>antibody‐secreting</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the blood of}} nine renal allograft recipients with normal kidney function before and after transplantation.

The responses were directed against the donor HLA‐class I antigens. The increase in frequency of donor‐specific <b>antibody‐secreting</b> <b>cells</b> after renal transplantation indicates that B cells respond specifically to the transplant donor more often than previously thought.

Serologic response to CS 6 was low in all regimens (0 to 27 %). CS 6 -immunogloublin A (IgA) <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cell</b> (ASC) responses ranged from 36 to 86 %, with the highest level in the three-dose adjuvanted regimen; however, the magnitude was low. As expected, serologic and ASC LT responses were limited to adjuvanted regimens, {{with the exception of}} fecal IgA, which appeared to be nonspecific to LT administration. Further modifications to the delivery strategy and CS 6 and adjuvant dose optimization will be needed before conducting further clinical trials with this epidemiologically important class of ETEC...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{distribution}} of specific antibodies and <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cells</b> in the intestine after oral and rectal immunizations corresponds to the vascularization and lymph drainage patterns of the gut. Oral immunizations induce antibody responses along {{the parts of the}} intestine connected to the superior mesenteric vessels and lymph ducts, whereas rectal immunizations induce antibody responses along the parts of the intestine associated with the inferior mesenteric vessels and ducts...|$|R
5000|$|The ELISPOT {{method was}} {{developed}} by Cecil Czerkinsky’s group in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1983, {{for the purpose of}} detecting antigen-specific <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cells</b> (ASC) in a B cell ELISPOT assay, which was a modification of a traditional sandwich [...] ELISA immunoassay. The ELISPOT assay has since been more widely adopted for the identification and enumeration of cytokine-producing cells at the single cell level, but is still used for detection of ASC.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{originally}} {{treated as}} separate proteins, cloning technology demonstrated that GPI is {{almost identical to}} the protein neuroleukin. [...] Neuroleukin is a neurotrophic factor for spinal and sensory neurons. It is found in large amounts in muscle, brain, heart, and kidneys. Neuroleukin also acts as a lymphokine secreted by T cells stimulated by lectin. It induces immunoglobulin secretion in B cells {{as part of a}} response that activates <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
