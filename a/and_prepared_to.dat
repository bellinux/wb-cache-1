5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus learnt that Galba {{had been}} murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by {{one side or the}} other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
5|$|The 930 men of Puller's {{battalion}} marched {{west from}} the Lunga perimeter {{early on the}} morning of 23 September. Later that morning, Puller's troops chased away two Japanese patrols that were reconnoitering the Marine Lunga defenses. Puller's battalion then camped for the night <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> climb Mount Austen the next day.|$|E
5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, behind their lines. Theoretically the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of supply and communication was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation was compounded by bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick turned back <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> do battle.|$|E

5|$|With {{stability}} at last {{achieved in}} the west, Alexios now {{had a chance to}} begin solving his severe economic difficulties and the disintegration of the empire's traditional defences. In order to reestablish the army, Alexios began to build a new force on the basis of feudal grants (próniai) <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> advance against the Seljuks, who had conquered Asia Minor and were now established at Nicaea.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, Reshef {{focused on}} clearing the Tirtur Road. He left {{a battalion of}} around 30 tanks between the junction and {{the western part of}} the Chinese Farm, <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> attack with two armored battalions provided by Sharon. He concentrated on the section of the Tirtur Road defended by an Egyptian battalion forming the left flank of the 16th Infantry Brigade. One of Reshef's battalions attacked from the north-east, the other from the west. The Egyptian battalion managed to halt the advance, aided by fire from tanks and anti-tank weapons on the slopes of Missouri, a hill north-west of the Chinese Farm, causing Reshef to break off his attack.|$|E
5|$|As {{a part of}} an army-wide reorganization, the division's brigade {{headquarters}} were disbanded {{in favor}} of regimental commands. The division was instead based around three infantry regiments; the 101st, 104th, and the 328th. Also assigned to the division were the 101st, 102nd, 180th, and 263rd Field Artillery Battalions, the 39th Signal Company, the 726th Ordnance Company, the 26th Quartermaster Company, the 26th Reconnaissance Troop, the 101st Engineer Combat Battalion, and the 114th Medical Battalion. In August 1943 Major General Willard Stewart Paul took command of the division, which he would lead {{through the rest of}} the war. Before deploying overseas to the European Theater of Operations (ETO), the 26th ID trained at Camp Campbell, Kentucky <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> depart for the Western Front in late August 1944.|$|E

5|$|At 09:00 Sefik {{and his two}} battalions were {{approaching}} Kavak Tepe, and made contact with his 2nd Battalion that had conducted a fighting withdrawal, and {{an hour and a}} half later the regiment was deployed to stop the ANZACs advancing any further. Around 10:00 Kemal arrived at Scrubby Knoll and steadied some retreating troops, pushing them back into a defensive position. As they arrived, the 57th Infantry Regiment were given their orders <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> counter-attack. Scrubby Knoll, known to the Turks as Kemalyeri (Kemal's Place), now became the site of the Turkish headquarters for the remainder of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} {{due to the}} {{bad weather}} and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike their American counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises. This experience would be telling in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the invading army's entry into Laconia, Sparta was only lightly defended. The {{majority}} of the Spartan army had accompanied Areus on campaign in Crete, where the Lacedaimonians were supporting the polis of Gortyn. As such, Sparta must have seemed like an easy target to Pyrrhus. Arriving outside Sparta in the evening, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack immediately {{to take advantage of the}} dearth of defenders. Pyrrhus decided against launching an immediate offensive as he feared the destruction that would be wrought by his Gallic soldiers if they were to enter the city at night. Anticipating no resistance, Pyrrhus order his army to make camp <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> enter Sparta in the morning.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1790, Habsburg Austria {{ended its}} {{war with the}} Ottoman Empire <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> {{suppress}} the Brabant revolutionaries. The new Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold II, a liberal like his predecessor, proposed an amnesty for the rebels. After a Statist army was overcome at the Battle of Falmagne, the territory was quickly overrun by Imperial forces, and the revolution was defeated by December. The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived, however, and the territory was soon overrun by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May 1799, the Austrians had wrested {{control of}} parts of Switzerland from the French as forces {{under the command of}} Hotze and Count Heinrich von Bellegarde pushed them out of the Grisons. After {{defeating}} Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's 25,000-man Army of the Danube at the battles of Ostrach and Stockach, the main Austrian army, under command of Archduke Charles, crossed the Rhine at the Swiss town of Schaffhausen <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> unite with the armies of Hotze and Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, on the plains surrounding Zürich.|$|E
5|$|Báthory's {{position}} {{was at first}} extremely difficult, as there was still some opposition to his election. Emperor Maximilian, insisting on his earlier election, fostered internal opposition <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> enforce his claim by military action. At first {{the representatives of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania refused to recognize Báthory as Grand Duke, and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury, hold Sejm conventions in both Lithuania and Poland, and reserve the highest governmental official offices in Lithuania for Lithuanians. He accepted the conditions. In June Báthory was recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Duke of Ruthenia and Samogitia.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the arrival}} of the {{relieving}} force, Pyrrhus lifted the siege <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> winter in Laconia. However, he was approached by an Argive citizen who requested his assistance in overthrowing the government of Argos. Seeking {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity, Antigonus took his army to Argos, being harried along the way by the Spartans. Whilst attempting to seize Argos by night, Pyrrhus was set upon by his Argive opponents as well as the Spartans and Antigonus' Macedonians. In the ensuing mêlée, Pyrrhus was slain. His death prompted the capitulation of his army and the reestablishment of a Macedonian hegemony over Greece.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} before Cleveland's 1885 inauguration, President Arthur opened four million acres of Winnebago and Crow Creek Indian lands in the Dakota Territory to white {{settlement}} by executive order. Tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> take possession of them. Cleveland believed Arthur's order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes, and rescinded it on April 17 of that year, ordering the settlers out of the territory. Cleveland sent in eighteen companies of Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General Philip Sheridan, at the time Commanding General of the U. S. Army, to investigate the matter.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November the commandos gave {{control of}} Flushing to the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> move by sea {{to support the}} rest of the brigade at Westkapelle. Before they could disembark, weather {{conditions}} deteriorated and they were forced to march around the coast to reach brigade headquarters at Zoutelande. Lack of supplies curtailed their involvement in the battle for the next two days. Supplies eventually caught up with them and on 6 November they prepared to continue. By now intelligence from Dutch residents and prisoners had revealed that the remaining Germans were holed up in the wooded area between Domburg and Vrouwenpolder.|$|E

5|$|On State's {{first play}} after the punt, fullback Mal Crite {{ran for a}} 40-yard gain, pushing State's offense to the Tech 46-yard line with just over four minutes left. State pushed forward another seven yards, but failed to gain another first down <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> punt the ball back to Tech with 3:14 {{remaining}} in the game. Rather than punt the ball, however, State punter Kelly Hollodick instead received the snap on fourth down and ran for a first down. Because State retained possession, {{it was able to}} continue to run down the clock after the fake punt. Tech stopped the clock once by calling a timeout and prevented State from gaining another first down. With 2:01 remaining in the game, State punted the ball into Tech's end zone for a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Playtex Products {{continued}} to erode Tampax's' market share throughout the late 20th century. The two companies had divided the market almost evenly {{by the late}} 1990s. Both makers increased profits primarily by reducing the tampon count per box, <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> enter emerging markets, particularly in Asia, where many women still used homemade pads. In 1997 Procter & Gamble (P), makers of Always sanitary napkins and pantiliners, bought Tambrands for $1.25 billion, its largest acquisition up to that point, returning to the tampon sector almost two decades after pulling Rely from the market over Toxic Shock Syndrome concerns.|$|E
5|$|Texas fair {{caught the}} punt at their 14-yard line. On {{the first play}} after the kick, a run up the middle was stopped {{for the loss of}} a yard. Williams then gained two yards, and Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass. Texas went three-and-out {{for the first time in}} the second quarter <b>and</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> punt. Bryan Still fielded the kick at the Tech 40-yard line and returned it 60 yards to the end zone for Virginia Tech's first points of the game. The subsequent extra point was good, and with 2:34 remaining in the first half, Tech cut Texas' lead to 107.|$|E
