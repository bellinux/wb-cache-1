25|$|Consolidation is {{a process}} by which soils {{decrease}} in volume. It occurs when stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly, therefore reducing volume. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The time required to squeeze {{the water out of}} a thick deposit of clayey soil layer might be years. For a layer of sand, the water may be squeezed out in <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds.</b> A building foundation or construction of a new embankment will cause the soil below to consolidate and this will cause settlement which in turn may cause distress to the building or embankment. Karl Terzaghi developed the theory of consolidation which enables prediction of the amount of settlement and the time required for the settlement to occur. Soils are tested with an oedometer test to determine their compression index and coefficient of consolidation.|$|E

25|$|Supporters {{of hunting}} {{maintain}} that when foxes or other prey (such as coyotes {{in the western}} USA) are hunted, the quarry are either killed relatively quickly (instantly or in <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds)</b> or escapes uninjured. Similarly, {{they say that the}} animal rarely endures hours of torment and pursuit by hounds, and research by Oxford University shows that the fox is normally killed after an average of 17minutes of chase. They further argue that, while hunting with hounds may cause suffering, controlling fox numbers by other means is even more cruel. Depending on the skill of the shooter, the type of firearm used, the availability of good shooting positions and luck, shooting foxes can cause either an instant kill, or lengthy periods of agony for wounded animals which can die of the trauma within hours, or of secondary infection over a period of days or weeks. Research from wildlife hospitals, however, indicates that {{it is not uncommon for}} foxes with minor shot wounds to survive. Hunt supporters further say that it is a matter of humanity to kill foxes rather than allow them to suffer malnourishment and mange.|$|E
25|$|Geometric matching/ shape {{complementarity}} methods {{describe the}} protein and ligand {{as a set}} of features that make them dockable. These features may include molecular surface / complementary surface descriptors. In this case, the receptor’s molecular surface is described in terms of its solvent-accessible surface area and the ligand’s molecular surface is described in terms of its matching surface description. The complementarity between the two surfaces amounts to the shape matching description that may help finding the complementary pose of docking the target and the ligand molecules. Another approach is to describe the hydrophobic features of the protein using turns in the main-chain atoms. Yet another approach is to use a Fourier shape descriptor technique. Whereas the shape complementarity based approaches are typically fast and robust, they cannot usually model the movements or dynamic changes in the ligand/ protein conformations accurately, although recent developments allow these methods to investigate ligand flexibility. Shape complementarity methods can quickly scan through several thousand ligands in <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds</b> and actually figure out whether they can bind at the protein’s active site, and are usually scalable to even protein-protein interactions. They are also much more amenable to pharmacophore based approaches, since they use geometric descriptions of the ligands to find optimal binding.|$|E

500|$|All {{species of}} sundew {{are able to}} move their tentacles in {{response}} to contact with edible prey. The tentacles are extremely sensitive and will bend {{toward the center of}} the leaf to bring the insect into contact with as many stalked glands as possible.
