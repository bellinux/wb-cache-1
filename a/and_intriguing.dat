5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers <b>and</b> <b>intriguing</b> antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Maurice Ewing utilizing the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's research vessel Atlantis and an array of instruments, confirmed the existence of a rise in the central Atlantic Ocean, and found that the floor of the seabed beneath the layer of sediments consisted of basalt, not the granite which is the main constituent of continents. They also found that the oceanic crust was much thinner than continental crust. All these new findings raised important <b>and</b> <b>intriguing</b> questions.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{the drama}} was also {{enormously}} popular, from the Queen and Court {{down to the}} commonest of the common people; indeed, the odd polarity of the theatre audience in this period, with the High and the Low favoring the drama, {{and the middle class}} generally more hostile with the growth of Puritan sentiments, is a surprising <b>and</b> <b>intriguing</b> phenomenon. Theatres proliferated, especially (though not exclusively) in neighborhoods outside the city's walls and the Corporation's control in Shoreditch to the north, or the Bankside and Paris Garden in Southwark, on the southern bank of the River Thames: the Curtain, the Rose, the Swan, the Fortune, the Globe, the Blackfrairs a famous roster.|$|E

25|$|The loss of Bolingbroke's great speeches was regretted by William Pitt {{more than}} that of the missing books of Livy and Tacitus. By the early 20th century, the {{writings}} and career of Bolingbroke would make a weaker impression than they made on contemporaries. He was thought by the author in his biography in A Short Biographical Dictionary of English (1910) to be a man of brilliant and versatile talents, but selfish, insincere <b>and</b> <b>intriguing,</b> defects of character which arguably led to his political ruin; and his writings were described as glittering, artificial and lacking philosophical merit. Philip Chesney Yorke, his biographer in the Encyclopaedia Britannica 11th Edition, commented that his abilities were exercised upon ephemeral objects, and not inspired by lasting or universal ideas.|$|E

500|$|Sigtrygg was of Norse and Irish ancestry. He was {{a son of}} Olaf Cuarán (also called Kváran), King of York and of Dublin, and Gormflaith ingen Murchada. Gormflaith was the {{daughter}} of the King of Leinster, Murchad mac Finn, and the sister of his successor, King Máel Mórda of Leinster. She had previously been married to the King of Meath and High King of Ireland, Máel Sechnaill — the first of her three husbands. [...] She was a beautiful, powerful <b>and</b> <b>intriguing</b> Irish woman, who according to the 13th-century Icelandic Njál's saga, was [...] "the fairest of all women, and best gifted in everything that was not in her own power, but it was the talk of men that she did all things ill over which she had any power". Sigtrygg's paternal half-brother was Glúniairn, [...] "Iron-knee", who ruled as King of Dublin from 980–989.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} more positive. The New Statesmans Robert Potts found the stories [...] "entertaining <b>and</b> <b>intriguing</b> for readers {{familiar}} with their background {{and with the}} genre", {{and for the most}} part charmingly innocent, [...] "especially when compared with the reality of boarding-school life". [...] The evocation of adolescent homoeroticism was deliberate and playful rather than pornographic. In a similar vein, Richard Canning in The Independent found the Willow Gables fiction vibrant, well-constructed and entertaining, and praised Larkin's [...] "sly Sapphic spin". In a more recent analysis Terry Castle, writing in the journal Daedalus, disagrees profoundly with the notion expressed by Adam Kirsch in The Times Literary Supplement, that the publication of the Coleman works was damaging to Larkin's reputation. On the contrary, argues Castle, [...] "the Brunette phase speaks volumes about the paradoxical process by which Philip Larkin became 'Larkinesque'—modern English poetry's reigning bard of erotic frustration and depressive (if verse-enabling) self-deprecation".|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN gave [...] "Walkabout" [...] a 9.5/10, stating that [...] "Terry O'Quinn puts in an {{exceptional}} performance", and commenting that showing Locke, who [...] "seemed like a confident and resourceful {{man with a}} mysterious <b>and</b> <b>intriguing</b> past", to be a [...] "shell {{of a human being}} that is trying desperately to find his place in the world" [...] was [...] "a perfect juxtaposition of the differences between Locke off and on the island". He also praised the supporting stories, claiming that [...] "Matthew Fox does a great job of playing the uneasy leader" [...] as Jack Shephard and that the Shannon-Charlie storyline [...] "does supply a little comic relief". Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it described the revelation that Locke was a paraplegic as being [...] "one of the show's signature moments", and commented that the episode [...] "cemented the show as 'Must-See TV'" [...] and was [...] "a five-star effort." ...|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{the test}} audience, {{television}} critics generally reacted positively to the pilot, viewing it as original and innovative, USA Today critic Tom Green summarized {{the show as}} a [...] "crisply funny blend of stand-up routines interwoven with more traditional sitcom stuff". Eric Mink of St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote he thought the show was unusual <b>and</b> <b>intriguing,</b> yet [...] "quite funny". Joe Stein of the San Diego Evening Tribune commented [...] "Not all standup comedians fit into a sitcom format, but Seinfeld does". A more negative response came from a The Fresno Bee critic, that stated [...] "I liked the concept, but Seinfeld 's jokes were so dull that you hoped the standup stuff would fly by so you could {{get back to the}} story". Though the critic praised Alexander's acting he commented that his performance was not enough to keep the show [...] "from being just another piece of summer drivel offered up by a major commercial network".|$|E
500|$|On the PlayStation 2, Soul Reaver 2 {{respectively}} {{received an}} aggregate score of 80.71% and 80/100 from rating websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Various reviewers held its storytelling, visuals and sound in high regard, but described its gameplay as dull and unsatisfying. Doug Perry of IGN praised the game's dark atmosphere <b>and</b> <b>intriguing</b> story, {{but said that}} it can become tiresome and drag on. He thought the [...] "haughtiness" [...] and drama of the dialogue, particularly between Raziel and Kain, was often overdone, and noted that its gameplay was near identical to that of its predecessor but with less replay value. Perry enjoyed the new puzzles involving the elemental powers of the Reaver for being more complex and diverse than the block puzzles of Soul Reaver, and praised the combat system. He gave the game a score of 9.0, but in his later review for Defiance, he revised his opinion, saying this rating was [...] "way too high" [...] and [...] "that game told a great story, but just didn't deserve that score".|$|E
500|$|Shekhar of Oneindia Entertainment {{gave the}} film 4 out of 5 stars, stating [...] "Manam {{is a perfect}} family {{entertainer}} and it is director Vikram Kumar's unique script that makes the movie a brilliant experiment. The movie is high on entertainment quotient and it is treat to see ANR, Nagarjuna and Naga Chaitanya together on screen". Rajasekhar S of Cinemalead also gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and called it [...] "classy and brilliant", stating [...] "Vikram K Kumar has packed the movie {{in such a way}} that the audience never get bored. Especially the last 20 minutes of the movie, towards the climax brings us to the edge of the seat". IndiaGlitz gave the film 4 out of 5 stars as well, and called the film a [...] "complete entertainer that is more than a love story" [...] and stated, [...] "The film packs everything that the trailer promised, plus the not-quite-unknown formula of Past Life Regression. Although we have seen many PLR stories in the past, 'Manam' is special because of its sublime <b>and</b> <b>intriguing</b> nature." ...|$|E

[...] Like the other reviewers, he praised its controls. He also lauded its [...] "hilarious storyline, strong characters <b>and</b> ... <b>intriguing</b> setting", but complained about graphical slowdowns. Nick Clarkson of Amiga Computing cited the game's graphics as [...] "flawless", noting that [...] "the characters are superbly animated and the backdrops simply ooze atmosphere." [...] He highly praised its sound effects and music, and believed that its controls [...] "couldn't be simpler". The staff of Amiga Action wrote that the [...] "attention to detail and the finely tuned gameplay cannot be faulted."

500|$|During {{the early}} months of 1944, Robey {{returned}} to the role of Falstaff when he appeared in the film version of Henry V, produced by Eagle-Lion Films. [...] The American film critic Bosley Crowther had mixed opinions of the film. Writing in The New York Times in 1946, he thought that it showcased [...] "a fine group of British film craftsmen and actors", who contributed to [...] "a stunningly brilliant <b>and</b> <b>intriguing</b> screen spectacle". Despite that, he considered the film's additional screenplay poor and called Falstaff's deathbed scene [...] "non-essential and just a bit grotesque." [...] Late in 1944, he appeared in Burnley in a show entitled Vive Paree alongside Janice Hart and Frank O'Brian. In 1945, Robey starred in two minor film roles, as [...] "Old Sam" [...] in The Trojan Brothers, a short comedy film in which two actors experience various problems as a pantomime horse, and as [...] "Vogel" [...] in the musical romance Waltz Time. He spent 1947 touring England, while the following spring he undertook a provincial tour of Frederick Bowyer's fairy play The Windmill Man, which he also co-produced with his wife.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Millheiser of DVD Talk agreed. Of the series, Millheiser {{called it}} a [...] "great show," [...] with [...] "plotlines that are fast-paced and {{gripping}} throughout", adding, [...] "It lacks the slick, candy-coated escapism and romanticism of Alias, or the white-knuckled, thrill-a-minute intensity of 24. [...] is its own beast altogether: a smart, thrilling series that pulls no punches and maintains a consistent level of quality and intelligence throughout its running time." [...] Bryan Byun of DVD Verdict had an issue with the storylines, stating, [...] "At times it takes {{the entire length of}} an episode to figure out precisely what's going on. While that frenetic pace makes for challenging viewing, it might prevent the show from reaching a broader audience." [...] However, Byun thought the first series was a [...] "solid, gripping entertainment that pulls few punches. While it's a little talkier and more reliant on suspense and mystery than trigger-happy American action shows, [...] should please any fan of cloak-and-dagger antics." [...] Michael Mackenzie of The Digital Fix rated the series eight out of ten, stating that although Spooks [...] "may not be perfect", [...] "it is an imaginative <b>and</b> <b>intriguing</b> series." ...|$|E
