5|$|Shankly {{changed the}} team kit for their 1964-65 European Cup second round tie versus R.S.C. Anderlecht. He felt {{the players in}} the new all-red would appear more intimidating than in the {{previous}} red shirts, white shorts and white socks. Liverpool lost in the semi-final to Internazionale. Shankly felt the referee biased allowing questionable Italian goals. In the 1965 FA Cup Final Hunt put Liverpool <b>ahead</b> <b>in</b> extra time. Leeds United's Billy Bremner equalised.

5|$|All but 4 of the {{scheduled}} 120 games were played.

Initially the ABL postponed the series, leaving a {{decision as to whether}} the games would be rescheduled to a later time. Just prior to the final round of scheduled games, it was announced that the games would go <b>ahead</b> <b>in</b> the form of two doubleheaders, but that only games that would affect the playoffs would be played.

5|$|At the 2000 U.S. Championships, Lysacek won the Junior {{title at}} the age of fourteen. He placed fifth in the short program and first in the free skate, placing first overall. He was the first male skater since Terry Kubicka to win {{back-to-back}} Novice and Junior Men's titles in the United States. The win on the junior level was unusual in that Lysacek moved from third to first overall while sitting backstage, because he won through a tiebreak in the 6.0 ordinal system. Lysacek was tied with Parker Pennington in second place ordinals and had one more first place ordinal, giving him the win in the free skate in the Total Ordinals of Majority tiebreaker, which pushed him <b>ahead</b> <b>in</b> overall factored placements, allowing him to win the title overall. Following the U.S. Championships, he was assigned to the 2000 Gardena Spring Trophy in Urtijëi where he won the silver medal on the junior level.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Palace were Cardiff's {{opponents in}} the semi-final which was played over two-legs. The first leg was played at Palace's home ground Selhurst Park.

Neither side scored again and the match ended 1–0. The second leg at the Cardiff City Stadium started well for Cardiff when they went <b>ahead</b> <b>in</b> the seventh minute after an own-goal from Palace defender Gardner, which {{levelled}} the aggregate score at 1–1. Palace were reduced to ten men in the second half when Paddy McCarthy was sent-off. Despite their numerical advantage Cardiff were unable to a second goal during the 90 minutes and extra-time and the tie went to a penalty shoot-out.

Arusei was the third across the line half a minute later, while Feyse Tadese, Joyce Chepkirui, Meseret Mengistu and Fate Tola took places 4–7 around one minute behind the winner. It was Arusei's clear third place which proved {{the difference between the}} top African teams, as Kenya won the team gold by a margin of 34 seconds over Ethiopia. A strong final phase saw Zhu Xiaolin take eighth place for the hosts, which was the best non-African individual performance that year. Japan's Yoshimi Ozaki and Ryoko Kizaki were immediately behind her, failing to get a top eight finish but yet again leading the country to the team bronze with a buffer of over six minutes between them and Australia.|$|E
