60|$|He stopped <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It {{was like}} being at an aquarium.|$|E
60|$|Now Umslopogaas {{started as}} one starts who is wounded by a spear, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|His {{whole face}} {{suddenly}} became alive, {{and for the}} first time he stood erect <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If you haven't got {{anything}} {{better to do}} than come in here <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> I wish you would go somewhere else <b>and</b> <b>stare.</b> I can tell you it isn't any joke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I understand. I won't be {{so silly}} as to {{pretend not to}} know what you mean. I {{suspected}} this at Cannes, when you used to stand <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> without speaking a word, but with whole volumes in your eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Captain Ogbourne!' she exclaimed, with an {{emphasis}} of playful fear. 'How can such a comrade of my youth behave to me as you do? Don't speak so, <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so! Is this really {{all you have to}} say? I see I ought not to have come. 'Twas thoughtlessly done.' ...|$|R
60|$|He held me by {{the collar}} <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so, that I began to think his first idea about cutting my throat had revived.|$|E
60|$|All {{the company}} turned <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> even Goza {{lifted his head}} and stared, but I sat still and {{contemplated}} the beauties of the night.|$|E
60|$|The {{wonder and}} consternation with which Joe {{stopped on the}} {{threshold}} of his bite <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> were too evident to escape my sister's observation.|$|E
6000|$|... "The long moss hangs perpetually; [...] Gray scalps of buried years; [...] Blue crabs steal out <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> [...] <b>And</b> seem {{to gauge}} my fears; [...] I start {{to hear the}} eel swim by; [...] I shudder when the crane [...] Strikes at his prey; I turn to fly, [...] At drops of sudden rain.|$|R
60|$|I {{think there}} are too many trees. They seem to crowd round <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I feel as if they nudged one another when I'm not looking. I can feel them {{standing}} there. And they won't let me get on about the baby this morning. Just their cussedness. I felt they encouraged me like a harem of wonderful silent wives, yesterday.|$|R
60|$|He thought, {{his hands}} hanging over his knees. He {{peered through the}} glass <b>and</b> then <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|At length, after a {{great deal}} of {{shouting}} and shaking, he succeeded in rousing his drunken companion, who staggered up <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in an imbecile manner.|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} timorous before; {{but at this}} he seemed to lose the power of speech a moment, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in a perfect enthusiasm of fear.|$|E
60|$|However, {{the door}} of the house was open, and inside was a man {{sweeping}} the sanded floor. When he saw me, he stopped his work <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Stroeve {{was silent}} again, <b>and</b> he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with his mouth}} open and his round blue eyes {{starting}} out of his head.|$|R
60|$|I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Gip, <b>and</b> Gip <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{there were}} our distortions in the magic mirrors, looking very rum, and grave, and quiet...|$|R
60|$|Now when Umslopogaas {{heard these}} words he started {{like a child}} at a {{rustling}} in the dark <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|Aunt Janet, who was {{kneading}} her bread, turned {{round and}} lifted floury hands. Felicity and Cecily, {{who were just}} entering the kitchen, rosy from slumber, stopped still <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I was so {{overwhelmed}} with grief {{and love and}} pity that a groan escaped me almost before I was aware of it. She broke off short, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in haughtiness.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} in earth or heaven to respect my curses or weeping. In the midst of it {{a man who had}} been {{trimming}} the opposite hedge appeared <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Vincent Cawdor," [...] she continued, [...] "came in alone. He {{looked just}} as {{objectionable}} as ever, <b>and</b> he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> till I nearly threw my wine glass at him." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{finishing}} the food I resumed work again, {{but not as}} cheerfully as at first: I began {{to feel a little}} stiff and tired, and the immense quantity of mold adhering to my boots made it heavy walking; moreover, the novelty had now worn off. The horses also did not work as smoothly as at the commencement: they seemed to have something on their minds, for {{at the end of every}} furrow they would turn <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in the most exasperating manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "The officer stood <b>and</b> {{steadily}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'I declare,' he said, 'you do {{not look}} like a crazy man. At what time did this Water-devil begin to take you in tow?' ...|$|R
60|$|As I re-entered {{the cave}} with my burden Nuflo sat up <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a frightened {{look in his}} eyes. Throwing my cloak down, I placed the girl on it and briefly related what had happened.|$|E
60|$|For once {{in my life}} I made a sensation. Every {{woman in}} that room stopped sewing <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Most of them, I saw, didn't believe me, but Wilhelmina did. Her pretty face lighted up with interest.|$|E
60|$|I had not {{lifted my}} veil when I first {{spoke to the}} woman, which was {{at the moment of}} our going in. The boy {{staggered}} up instantly <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a remarkable expression of surprise and terror.|$|E
6000|$|A VOICE: Over Ilsenstein; The owl {{was awake}} in the white moonshine; I saw her at rest in her downy nest, <b>And</b> she <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with her broad, bright eyne. [...] 165 ...|$|R
60|$|He lay on {{his back}} <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> his eyes had a glassy stare. Then he roused himself by an effort, and raised himself upon his elbow.|$|R
60|$|Betteredge <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> in dead silence. He {{closed the}} book with great deliberation; he locked it up again in the {{cupboard}} with extraordinary care; he wheeled round, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>me</b> once more. Then he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we'll follow," [...] says Nick, {{beginning}} to pace again. Suddenly, at a {{cry from the}} widow, he stopped <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> a light in his eye like a point of steel. His hand slipped to his waist.|$|E
6000|$|He {{tried to}} meet my gaze. [...] "No!" [...] he said suddenly, and turning went {{bounding}} away from me through the undergrowth. Then he turned <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again. His eyes shone brightly out of the dusk under the trees.|$|E
6000|$|She knit {{her brows}} <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as though she}} would {{penetrate}} the black cloth that hid my face. At last she shrugged her shoulders, and letting her arms fall to her side {{in a gesture of}} helplessness and resignation-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guessed as {{much when}} I saw {{you talking to}} her. She is a true English lady, heaven bless her! I took the liberty of looking at her painting; <b>and</b> she <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if I had bitten her." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Hans awoke, <b>and</b> sitting up, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{through the}} bright flame which I had {{recently}} fed with dry wood.|$|R
60|$|My pretty, little, startled Dora! Her only {{association}} with the word was a yellow face and a nightcap, or a pair of crutches, or a wooden leg, or a dog with a decanter-stand in his mouth, or something of that kind; <b>and</b> she <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with the most delightful wonder.|$|R
