40|$|Accurate data on {{microwave}} and millimeter-wave properties of potential planetary <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituents</b> {{is critical for}} the proper interpretation of radio occultation measurements, and of radio astronomical observations of both continuum and spectral line emissions. Such data is also needed to correct for atmospheric effects on radar studies of surface reflectivity. Since the refractive and absorptive properties of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituents</b> often vary drastically from theoretically predicted profiles, especially under the extreme conditions characteristic of the planetary atmosphere, laboratory measurements under simulated planetary conditions are required. The instrumentation and techniques used for laboratory measurement of the refractivity and absorptivity of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituents</b> at wavelengths longward of 1 mm, under simulated planetary conditions (temperature, pressure, and broadening gases) are reviewed. Techniques for measuring both gases and condensates are considered. Also reviewed are the relative accuracies of the various techniques.

40|$|An {{infrared}} {{spectroscopic data}} base is described for such planetary studies as (1) {{the detection of}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituents,</b> (2) {{the establishment of the}} column abundances of known <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituents,</b> and (3) the determination of the thermal properties of planetary atmospheres. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Titan and Triton are discussed with reference to middle- and far-IR data, the chemical and thermal properties of their atmospheres, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituents</b> and absolute reflectivities, or albedos. Attention is also given to infrared spectroscopic studies of satellite and asteroid surfaces. It is noted that the most abundant surface materials are condensed volatiles and silicate minerals. Water ice has been detected on many surfaces and on the rings of Saturn; CH- 4 has been found on Pluto, and CO 2 has been identified as a component of the polar caps on Mars. It is concluded that some asteroid surfaces are mineralogically compatible with the relatively unevolved low-temperature remnant of nebular condensation, while others are composed of high-temperature silicates spectrally identical to the products of magmatic differentiation...|$|R

These experiments are performed in controlled environments that allow for the individual evaluation of specific chemical reactions or the assessment of properties of a particular <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituent.</b> Types of analysis that are of interest includes both those on gas-phase reactions, as well as heterogeneous reactions that are relevant to the formation and growth of aerosols. Also of high importance is the study of atmospheric photochemistry which quantifies how the rate in which molecules are split apart by sunlight and what resulting products are. In addition, thermodynamic data such as Henry's law coefficients can also be obtained.|$|E
50|$|Carbon-14 is not {{the only}} isotope that can be {{produced}} by energetic particles. Beryllium-10 (10Be) is also formed from nitrogen and oxygen, and deposited in polar ice. However, 10Be deposition can be strongly related to local weather and shows extreme geographic variability; it is also more difficult to assign dates. Nevertheless, a 10Be increase during the 770s was found in an ice core from the Antarctic, though the signal was less striking because of the lower time resolution (several years); another smaller increase was seen in Greenland. When data from two sites in North Greenland and one in the West Antarctic, all taken with a one-year resolution, were compared they all showed a strong signal: the time profile also matched well with the 14C results (within the uncertainty of dating for the 10Be data). Chlorine-36 (36Cl) can be produced from argon and deposited in polar ice; because argon is a minor <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituent</b> the abundance is low. The same ice cores which showed 10Be also provided increases of 36Cl, though with a resolution of five years a detailed match was impossible.|$|E

Relatively small changes in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituents</b> are computed for regional areas within 1000 km of the exhaust trail (i. e. less than 10 % decreases in column ozone), and even smaller changes are computed on a global scale (i. e., less than 0. 03 % decreases in total global ozone depletion) ...|$|R

50|$|Very {{little was}} known about the upper {{atmosphere}} {{in the years immediately}} following the World War. The lapse rate in the troposphere was well known from balloon and aircraft ascents. The stratosphere had been discovered by Teisserenc de Bort in 1899, and the tropopause located at an altitude of 10 or 12 km. It was thought that each <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituent</b> was then distributed independently according to its molecular weight, so that eventually, above about 100 km, the lighter gases, hydrogen and helium, would predominate. This was the basis for von der Borne's explanation of the return of sound to the ground. This explanation was attacked on the ground that the very low atmospheric pressure at high levels would remove most of the energy from the sound wave. Erwin Schrödinger showed that this was not the case, since the amplitude of motion would increase to maintain the energy of the wave, although there would be absorption, as predicted by Rayleigh. However, the altitude required was much too high to transmit sound without excessive attenuation, and so there was still a difficulty.|$|E
40|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Mercury, {{like that of}} the moon, is maintained in an extremely tenuous minimum state by weak solar wind accretion and radioactive decay processes, and depleted by strong removal mechanisms.

The use of theoretically derived microwave absorption properties for such <b>atmospheric</b> <b>constituents,</b> or laboratory measurements of such properties under environmental conditions which are significantly different than those of the planetary atmosphere being studied, often leads to significant misinterpretation of available opacity data.

Coupling losses into the diode and matching of the IF output limit are observed to limit noise temperature. The technique is evaluated by calculating spectra with assumed temperature and constituent profiles.
