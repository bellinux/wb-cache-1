5|$|An {{example of}} a {{non-agricultural}} calendar is the Tzolk'in calendar of the Maya civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, which is a cycle of 260 days.

5|$|Greek mythology is {{the body}} of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, {{concerning}} their gods and heroes, {{the nature of the}} world, and the origins and significance of their own cult <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> practices.

Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.|$|E

5|$|Hillforts in Scotland are earthworks, {{sometimes}} with wooden or stone enclosures, built on higher ground, which usually include a significant settlement, built within the modern boundaries of Scotland. They were first {{studied in the}} eighteenth century and the first serious field research was undertaken in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century there were large numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites, with an emphasis on establishing a chronology of the forts. Forts have been classified by type and their military <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> functions have been debated.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy {{has been identified as}} being closer to the history of astronomy or to cultural history, insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars <b>and</b> <b>ritual.</b> The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|Kinberg's wife Alice was {{a strong}} feminist, and during the 1980s {{he and his wife}} {{supported}} a number of changes to the liturgy <b>and</b> <b>ritual.</b> These included allowing women to read from the Torah and lead the prayers, and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example, using gender-neutral terms and pronouns for God, and adding references to the Biblical matriarchs in prayers like the Amidah, which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarchs. While most congregation members approved of these changes, a minority resisted them.|$|E

The report narrows down on two case studies, one where field work was conducted through personal interviews and participant and observatory work on the Jaipur Elephant Festival, India, the other a historical analysis {{of a series of}} Hindu-political processions during the 90 s throughout India. The cases emphasize the different meanings and consequences of processions <b>and</b> <b>rituals,</b> where one proves to be an invented tradition, where the other proves to be advocating violence, while identity creation in both cases is an important aspect of the processions...|$|R
5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture <b>and</b> <b>ritual.</b> Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis {{makes it easy to}} spot the navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E
5|$|Sallekhana {{differs from}} {{other forms of}} ritual deaths {{recognized}} in Jainism as appropriate. The other situations consider ritual death to be better for a mendicant than breaking his or her Five Great vows (Mahavrata). For example, celibacy {{is one of the}} Five vows, <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> death is considered better than being raped or seduced or if the mendicant community would be defamed. A ritual death under these circumstances by consuming poison is believed to be better and allows for an auspicious rebirth.|$|E

5|$|The {{groups of}} {{settlers}} began building {{the first known}} permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9,500 years ago, and the first villages around 6,000 years ago. The well-preserved village of Skara Brae on the mainland of Orkney dates from this period. Neolithic habitation, burial <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> sites are particularly common and well preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.|$|E
5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E
5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, Demeter was searching for her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept <b>and</b> <b>ritual.</b>|$|E

50|$|Not all {{students}} of mythology think ritual emerged from myth or myth emerged from ritual: some allow myths <b>and</b> <b>rituals</b> {{a greater degree}} of freedom from one another.

5|$|In antiquity, {{symbolism}} involving sheep {{cropped up}} in religions {{in the ancient}} Near East, the Mideast, and the Mediterranean area: Çatalhöyük, ancient Egyptian religion, the Cana'anite and Phoenician tradition, Judaism, Greek religion, and others. Religious symbolism <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> involving sheep began {{with some of the}} first known faiths: Skulls of rams (along with bulls) occupied central placement in shrines at the Çatalhöyük settlement in 8,000 BCE. In Ancient Egyptian religion, the ram was the symbol of several gods: Khnum, Heryshaf and Amun (in his incarnation as a god of fertility). Other deities occasionally shown with ram features include the goddess Ishtar, the Phoenician god Baal-Hamon, and the Babylonian god Ea-Oannes. In Madagascar, sheep were not eaten as they were believed to be incarnations of the souls of ancestors.|$|E

After arriving in North India, Indiana Jones is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a Thuggee cult practicing child slavery, black magic <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> human sacrifice in honor of the goddess Kali.|$|E
5|$|One famous {{site where}} {{historical}} records {{have been used}} to interpret sites is Chichen Itza. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the Mayans and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet Venus. This interest is attested to by the Dresden codex which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky. These cycles would have been of astrological <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> significance as Venus was associated with Quetzalcoatl or Xolotl. Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and probably some other Mesoamerican sites.|$|E

5|$|The Dresden Codex {{contains}} accurate astronomical tables, {{which are}} recognized by {{students of the}} codex for its detailed Venus tables and lunar tables. The lunar series has intervals correlating with eclipses, while the Venus tables correlate with {{the movements of the}} planet Venus. The codex also contains astrological tables <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> schedules. The religious references show in a cycle of a 260-day ritual calendar the important Maya royal events. The codex also includes information on the Maya new-year ceremony tradition. The rain god Chaac is represented 134 times.|$|E
5|$|The Lingbao School {{began in}} around 400 CE when the Lingbao scriptures were {{revealed}} to Ge Chaofu, the grandnephew of Ge Hong. Ge Chaofu {{claimed that the}} scriptures came {{to him in a}} line of transmission going back to Ge Hong's great-uncle, Ge Xuan (164-244). Ge Chaofu transmitted the scriptures to two of his disciples, and the scriptures quickly gained immense popularity. In 471, Lu Xiujing (406-477) compiled a catalogue of all the Lingbao texts, and also was responsible for reorganizing and standardizing Lingbao ritual. This organization of texts <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> provided a solid foundation on which the Lingbao School prospered in the subsequent centuries. During the Tang Dynasty, the influence of the Lingbao School declined and another school of Daoism, the Shangqing School, became prominent. Borrowing many Lingbao practices, it was well accepted by the aristocracy and established an influence in court.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{separate}} {{definitions of the}} term Wicca {{that have been used}} in Paganism and Pagan studies since circa 1980. The first developed in England during the 1960s. Broad and inclusive, it covers most, if not all, forms of modern Pagan Witchcraft, especially if they share sufficient theological beliefs <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> practices to be considered denominations within a common religious movement. In contrast, the second developed in the United States during the late 1970s. It refers specifically to the Gardnerian tradition of Witchcraft and those descended from it with little variation, namely Alexandrian and Algard Witchcraft, which are together known as British Traditional Wicca.|$|E
