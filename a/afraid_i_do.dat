60|$|BROADBENT [goodhumoredly]. Well, yes, I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> you know.|$|E
60|$|THE WOMAN [shaking her head] I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand. I {{said nothing}} about a butterfly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so?" [...] the Bishop said. [...] "I {{do not have}} much faith in politics. In fact, I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} politics." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and him too. Why did {{you come}} so mysteriously, and, I must say, unbecomingly? <b>I</b> am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> wrong in not informing you of my intention.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a very foolish {{thing when}} I {{showed her the}} {{poisoning}} story. Has it helped the wily old creature to look into my inmost thoughts? ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Rylands started guiltily. She made {{a miserable}} feint of looking {{in her lap}} and on the table. [...] "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> Jane, if <b>I</b> didn't bring it in HERE." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> harm with it too," [...] he returned. [...] "It's only a little, {{but little}} {{as it has}} been, I can no longer meet the {{responsibility}} it brings." ...|$|E
6000|$|PROF. D. I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> The niece of {{a friend}} of mine was there, and left it, much distressed and {{confused}} by the agnostic opinions that were freely broached there. How did your grand- daughter come to choose it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Merton, 'I am not <b>afraid.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not care}} {{too much for}} [...] "that garden in her face," [...] for your cherry-ripe sort of young person. If a {{typewriter}} is necessary I can bear with her as well as another.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{very wrong}} to come against ma's will," [...] she said miserably, [...] "but I COULDN'T wait. I {{wanted to see}} the picture as soon as you did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{there was}} one night, <b>I</b> am <b>afraid,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not stand by a little fellow that they bullied about his prayers. Perhaps {{he would have gone}} on, if I had helped him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Millar, <b>I</b> am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> make {{a mistake}} this morning--it has just dawned on me. I am almost sure that I called at Mrs. Grant's and invited her and her family instead of the Smithsons. And she said they would come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not quite}} {{understand}} you,' said Fairford; 'and {{if you have}} anything to say to me in private, my dear provost, you had better come quickly out with it, for the Laird of Summertrees must finish his letter in a minute or two.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} more about them than Mysie does. Aunt Jane heard this morning that she must go down there to-morrow to meet the health-man {{and see what he}} says; but she won't take any of us because of the {{diphtheria}} and the scarlet fever being about.' ...|$|E
6000|$|My dear Sirs--I am {{this morning}} making a general {{clearance}} of all lent Books--all--I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not return all--I must fog your memories about them--however with many thanks {{here are the}} remainder--which I am afraid are not worth so much now as they were six months ago--I mean the fashions may have changed-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't sympathize. Of course not; {{but when}} it {{receives}} its full weight from the printer's bands, {{you will see that}} it will tell. That bit about the weak tea fumes I thought of afterwards, and <b>I</b> am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not read it well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Was it very dreadful? He {{was there}} with an {{unlawful}} purpose, and I saw his eyes grow wicked and his hand tighten just as you sprang at him. Still, I was almost glad when the pistol did not go off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Bob, [...] "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> most of it. There {{was another}} fellow that helped some {{and played the}} guitar. It was pretty bad," [...] he added, with a side glance at Cynthia, [...] "but it was meant for a compliment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} have had her abandon the poor thing, would you? For the rest, God saved them both, so it does not much matter exactly how, as {{everything}} has turned out for the best. Won't you come in and have some supper, Mr.--Ishmael--I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know the rest of your name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Iris {{will not}} {{hesitate}} at any sacrifice of herself to please Lord Harry. She {{will give him}} her money when he wants it. If he tells her to alter her opinion of my husband, she will obey him. He can shake her confidence in me, whenever he pleases; and he has very likely done it already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not deserve}} your sympathy," [...] he said. [...] "Jacinta's {{mother died when}} she was eight years old, but ever since she came home from school in England Jacinta has taken care of me. In fact, I almost think it is Jacinta who feels the responsibility. I am getting a little old, and now and then my {{business}} enterprises worry me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! You hadn't a pistol, and it was, no doubt, {{the only}} thing you could find," [...] she said. [...] "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not even {{remember}} to thank you, but to tell the truth I was too badly frightened to think of anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> mean it. But {{bear with}} me for a few moments longer and you shall know all. It's a long story. Will you walk on, and--take my arm? You do not shrink from me, Miss Nott. Thank you. I {{scarcely}} deserve the kindness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> put on {{too much}} acid," [...] she said. [...] "I was so afraid of not burning it enough; {{but it does not}} matter, it does not pain me nearly so much since I put on that ointment; it will soon get well." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am so {{glad that}} Roads has got in. I had almost as soon have it in the Portfolio as the Saturday; the P. is so nicely printed and I am gourmet in type. I don't know how {{to thank you for}} your continual {{kindness}} to me; and I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not even feel grateful enough--you have let your kindnesses come on me so easily.--Yours sincerely, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I do," [...] I admitted. [...] "I have wasted {{a good deal}} of time the last few years. I have made up my mind {{definitely}} now, though, that I will get something to do. Ralph--that's my brother--wants me to stand for Parliament for the division of Norfolk, where we live, and has offered to pay all my expenses, but I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not fancy myself as a politician." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, I {{am glad to}} say," [...] the man answered. [...] "Till I {{got into}} the town I {{did not know where}} or what the job was; but from what every one is talking about at the place where I put up my horse, I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know now, and a {{shocking}} bad affair it seems; although if what I hear of it be true, I can't make head or tail of what they were up to. Two of the men were at least too old hands to have gone on in the way they did. There is something beyond what one sees." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> Mr. Devine," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I couldn't see {{how to get}} {{the work}} done more cheaply without taking the risk of the flume {{settling}} a little by and by. That would, of course, have started it leaking. What do you think of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} be <b>afraid.</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>do</b> nothing {{elsewhere}} that <b>I</b> would not <b>do</b> here, and nothing anywhere without telling you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did not {{understand}} enough about her before, and mixed her up with the ordinary class of business girls. I had rather have her a member {{for the sake of}} example; but if not, she would be a valuable associate. Could not you explain this to her without hurting her feelings, as <b>I</b> am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> Gill? <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not understand}} enough about her when I spoke to her before.' ...|$|R
6000|$|These words often puzzle {{and pain}} really good people, because {{they seem to}} put the hardest duty first. It seems, at times, so much more easy to love one's {{neighbour}} than to love God. And strange as it may seem, that is partly true. St. John tells us so--'He that loves not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?' Therefore many good people, who really do love God, are unhappy at times because {{they feel that they}} do not love him enough. They say in their hearts--'I wish to do right, and I try to do it: but I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not do it from love to God.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} much. He {{is a very}} {{distinguished}} literary man, but his work has generally been critical or philosophical,--every one will be {{surprised to hear that}} he has written a play. You will find that there will be quite a stir about it. The reason why we have no plays nowadays which can possibly be classed as literature, is because the wrong class of man is writing for the stage. Smith and Francis and all these men have fine dramatic instincts, but they are not scholars. Their dialogue is mostly beneath contempt; there is a dash of conventionality in their best work. Now, Matravers is a writer of an altogether different type." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{good news}} indeed, Jeanne," [...] Harry said, when the girl told him of the conversation. [...] "That does seem {{a way out of}} our difficulties. I felt sure you would be able to manage it, sooner or later, among the poor people you have been so good to. Hurry it on as much as you can, Jeanne. I feel that our {{position}} is getting more and more dangerous. I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not play my part sufficiently well. I am not forward enough in their violent councils. I cannot bring myself to vote for proposals for massacre when there is any division among them. I fear that some have suspicions. I have been asked questions lately as to why I am staying here, and why I have come. I have been thinking for the last few days whether it would not be better for us to make our way down to the mouth of the river and try and bribe some fishermen in the villages there who would not have that feeling against me that the men here have, to take us to sea, or if that could not be managed, to get on board some little fishing-boat at night and sail off by ourselves in the hopes of being picked up by an English cruiser." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And that's {{the worst}} of it," [...] replied the man of letters, [...] "for I'm horribly <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> mean to be rude to you. When I {{looked up and saw}} you up there {{something}} surged up in me that was in all the revolutions of history. Oh, there was admiration in it too! Perhaps there was idolatry in all the iconoclasts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>do</b> not know. <b>I</b> {{hope there}} was. But to be guarded {{at such a}} time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every {{assistance}} in my power, <b>I</b> am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not do so much as <b>I</b> might have <b>done!</b> But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>do</b> that; but, between ourselves, I {{have let}} Ferguson slip away, {{and he is}} to divide what he gets with me." ...|$|R
