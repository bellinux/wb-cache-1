40|$|Our study {{investigated}} how bird species richness and abundance {{was related to}} livestock grazing on salt, and brackish marshes, {{with an emphasis on}} songbirds, and shorebirds. Survey areas with a high percentage cover of tall vegetation were assumed to have experienced lower livestock grazing intensities than survey areas with a low percentage cover of tall vegetation. This relationship was verified for the tall grass Elytrigia atherica. The species richness, and abundance of birds was related to the percentage cover of tall vegetation on the survey areas. We found that total bird species richness was positively related to the percentage cover of tall vegetation. We also found that all of the investigated species, except Pied Avocet (<b>Recurvirostra</b> <b>avosetta),</b> showed a positive relation to the percentage cover of tall vegetation up to a specific percentage of cover. The abundance of investigated songbird species increased up to an intermediate percentage cover of tall vegetation, and decreased at higher percentage cover of tall vegetation, suggesting that moderate grazing of marshes may maximize the abundance of the investigated songbirds. Abundances of Common Redshank (Tringa totanus) and Eurasian Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) were positively related to the percentage cover of tall vegetation on salt marshes, but negatively related to the percentage cover of tall vegetation on brackish marshes. With intermediate livestock grazing species number, and abundance of most breeding birds can be maintained in coastal marshes. However, specific goals for management should be set before applying a grazing regime to a marsh...|$|R

Four generalist species occupying three different habitats were examined during the breeding season. Habitats: Brackish Water-saltwater (saltpans), brackish water-freshwater (ricefields anti some saltpans) and terrestrial environment (steppes). Species: Avocet (<b>Recurvirostra</b> <b>avosetta),</b> Black-winged Stilt (Himantopus himantopus), Kentish Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) anti Cattle Egret (Bulbucus ibis).

40|$|Coastal {{ecosystems}} are undergoing unprecedented rates of environmental change. Many {{of these changes}} are anthropogenically-driven and linked to long-term, climate-related phenomena. This thesis focusses on ecological change in soft sediment intertidal habitats. One of the largest harbours in Europe, Poole Harbour, {{is used as a}} case study. It contains a variety of important habitats including intertidal mudflat and non-tidal saline lagoon. The two main themes of the thesis are 1) assessing the physical and ecological factors that determine benthic invertebrate abundance, distribution and community structure, which is examined at the scale of the whole harbour, and at the scale of individual habitats: an intertidal mudflat and a saline lagoon; and 2) predicting the response of an overwintering shorebird population, the pied avocet (<b>Recurvirostra</b> <b>avosetta),</b> to future environmental changes, such as sea-level rise and habitat loss. This is achieved by development of an individual-based model (IBM) and consideration of the species’ unique foraging behaviour. This study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} factors structuring soft sediment benthic communities, including the use of data from fine-scale hydrodynamic models. It offers a unique comparison of the spatial and temporal variables driving community structure of a saline lagoon and an intertidal mudflat. It also provides insight into the foraging ecology of the pied avocet at a level of detail that has not previously been considered, including a comparison of foraging behaviour in a tidal and non-tidal habitat, the importance of social foraging, and the novel application of an IBM to this species...|$|R
40|$|I {{studied the}} {{breeding}} biology of pied avocets <b>Recurvirostra</b> <b>avosetta</b> in natural habitats (alkaline lakes), and in semi-natural sites (dry fishpond, reconstructed wetlands) in Hungary to relate habitat selection patterns to {{spatial and temporal}} variation in breeding success. Colonies were initiated earlier in semi-natural sites than in natural habitats, and earlier on islands than on the mainland. Hatching success was higher on islands than on the mainland, in semi-natural sites than in natural habitats, in colonies of at least 15 pairs than in smaller colonies, and for nests initiated earlier than later within a colony. Fledging success was higher in the wet years (1999 - 2000) than in the dry year (1998), decreased strongly by season in both habitats and increased with average daily temperature {{in the first week}} post-hatch in 1999 - 2000. Most pairs hatching young in semi-natural sites attempted to lead their chicks to feeding areas in natural habitats, whereas no such movement occurred in the opposite direction. Chick mortality due to predation was high during brood movements and only 23 % of the pairs moving their young produced fledglings, compared to 43 % for pairs remaining in semi-natural sites and 68 % for pairs hatching and rearing young in natural habitats (total n= 192 broods). These results suggest that semi-natural sites were more suitable for nesting, whereas natural habitats were more suitable for chick-rearing. The opposing trends in habitat-related breeding success between nesting and chick-rearing suggest sub-optimal habitat selection by Pied Avocets due to an incorrect assessment of the potential for successful reproduction of semi-natural sites, which may thus function as ecological traps...|$|R
40|$|When {{reproductive}} success is constant in one breeding phase, different tactics that increase variation in {{reproductive success}} among individuals may evolve in other phases. For instance, in shorebirds, which {{usually have a}} limited clutch size of four eggs, variation in reproductive tactics among individuals is expected either before egg-laying (e. g. diverse mating systems) or after hatching of the young (e. g. diverse parental care). In this paper, I studied the pied avocet (<b>Recurvirostra</b> <b>avosetta),</b> a shorebird with a modal clutch size of four eggs, to test whether post-hatch chick adoption as an alternative tactic {{can be linked to}} increased variation in annual reproductive success. When predation was high, naturally adopting pairs produced more filial fledglings than did pairs not adopting chicks and not losing chicks to adoption. The number of filial fledglings increased with the number of adopted young, possibly through diluting the chances of predation on filial young. Experimental chick addition did not lead to more fledged young due to low brood integrity as shown by the frequent loss of chicks from some experimental broods. When predation was low, larger broods occupied feeding territories with higher prey abundance than smaller broods, possibly due to their dominance over smaller ones. Pairs that lost chicks to adoption (donors) fledged as many filial young in their broods as did non-adopters/non-donors, whereas the total number of donors' filial fledglings, including those raised in adopting broods, approached that of adopters. These findings show, for the first time, that post-hatch alternative reproductive tactics can lead to variation in annual reproductive success and to higher success for some pairs even in species where past adaptations limit variation in reproductive success in a certain phase of reproduction...|$|R
40|$|For several tens of years, Sacalin Island {{has been}} {{regarded}} as the classic example of a new biotope forming in the easternmost part of the Danube, resulted as an interaction between {{the river and the}} Black Sea, host to specific flora and fauna; presently, the island tends to become a maritime levee, gradually joining the mainland and Holinca levee. Therefore, the area is losing its physical and geographical features as a new formed territory, including its unique characteristic as an optimal site for the establishment of waterbird colonies. A similar process of islet forming has been recently taking place in the east part of Musura Gulf, between Stambulul Vechi - Starâi Stambul (Ukraine) and Sulina (Romania) branches. The Ukrainian name of the site is Novaia Zemlia – New Land, and the country borders have already been marked. The new formed islets host a rich and diverse ornithological fauna, dueto their location and spatial orientation. On the Romanian side of the site, the reappearance of Sandwich Tern (Sternasandvicensis) colonies, represented by a great number of pairs, as well as Common Terns (Sterna hirundo), has been noted. Also, the site hosts the largest Caspian Gull (Larus cachinnans) colony in the country; the breeding of the Avocet (<b>Recurvirostra</b> <b>avosetta)</b> and of the Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) has been documented. The observations performed up to present lead us to conclude that this new formed land is a model for the evolution of river-maritime sandbanks as a result of sedimentation; it is also of a major ornithological importance for the roosting, feeding and nesting ofboth sedentary and migratory species. Further monitoring is imperative in order to designate the site as a core area andresearch based on transboundary cooperation is required...|$|R
40|$|Traits {{strongly}} related to fitness, such as offspring number, are expected to show intraspecific variation among individuals. However, offspring number is invariant in several reptiles, birds, and mammals. Most shorebirds (210 + species), for example, have an invariant clutch size of four eggs, which is unexpected in such an ecologically, behaviourally and socially diverse group. The incubation-limitation hypothesis (ILH) suggests that shorebird clutch size {{is limited by the}} inability of adults to incubate clutches larger than four eggs. Several recent studies reported no overall costs of incubating experimentally enlarged clutches and concluded no support for the traditional ILH. However, most studies have not measured all potential costs, and none has quantified costs beyond egg hatching. We conducted a clutch-enlargement experiment and measured potential costs both during incubation and chick rearing in pied avocets (<b>Recurvirostra</b> <b>avosetta</b> L.). Hatching was more asynchronous and egg hatchability was marginally lower in enlarged clutches than in controls. Nonetheless, more young hatched from enlarged clutches (mean: 4. 2 +/- 0. 17 SE) than from controls (3. 4 +/- 0. 09), and the two groups did not differ in incubation period, complete or partial clutch failure, or hatchling body size, apparently refuting the ILH. However, pairs incubating enlarged clutches occupied poorer feeding territories during chick rearing, experienced higher chick mortality, and eventually raised fewer young to independence (mean adjusted for season: 0. 7 +/- 0. 16 SE juveniles) than did control pairs (1. 2 +/- 0. 13). Chick survival was primarily associated with prey availability, and predation risks were not higher in larger broods. Our results provide evidence that incubating unusually large clutches can affect post-hatching performance and lead to lower annual reproductive success in shorebirds. This study, therefore, supports the ILH and points to the importance of monitoring reproductive success beyond the hatching of the chicks...|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} of breeding birds on the salt marshes along the Frisian coast (NFB) {{has been studied}} for over more than 20 years. Within this period many factors have changed, affecting both vegetation and bird densities. One {{of these is the}} restoration of salt marsh habitat by managed or 'accidental' realignment of dykes. In this paper we evaluate the development of the breeding bird community on NFB and focus on four different parts that were restored to salt marsh in 2001, 1992 and 1990 and 1975 respectively. Since 1991, 60 species of breeding birds have been recorded on NFB, mostly colonial species and meadow birds. Both on the salt marsh area and in the summer polders (separated from the salt marsh by a low dyke and flooded only during exceptionally high tides), the number of breeding bird species has increased. A crash of colonial species (mainly Black-headed Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Pied Avocet <b>Recurvirostra</b> <b>avosetta)</b> after 2000 is assumed to be mainly driven by increased predation (presumably by Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes). Today, highest densities of breeding birds occur in the summer polders. The de-embanked salt marshes generally show declining densities of primary meadow birds, towards densities that are typical of salt marshes. With the restoration into salt marsh, the risk of inundation of nests and drowning of fledglings has increased, reinforced by an increased frequency of storm surges during the breeding season. Also vegetation has changed, to a large extent in interaction with grazing. Although the confounding effects of ditching, predation, local grazing management and regional food availability are relevant when considering the observed trends, a negative effect of restoration on primary meadow birds was nonetheless detected. The strong decrease of colonial species however is not associated with the restoration of salt marsh habitat and has occurred nearly simultaneously in salt marshes along the neighbouring Groningen coast...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a mythical and {{empirical}} history of British {{interactions with the}} countryside in the mid-twentieth century, through {{a case study of}} the Suffolk coast. From early in the twentieth century aeroplane flight focussed attention on Britain’s status as an island, an effect compounded by the post-WWII shrinking of the empire. Late-modernist literature translated the end of empire into a resurgent concept of national culture, and this thesis examines a similar process of mediation in scientific, natural historical and military discourses. I show how from the 1930 s onwards, island myths were mobilised in a variety of very localised sites, which acted as both metaphor and metonym. The thesis weaves together two usually unconnected styles of enquiry: institutional and networked histories; and histories of lived experiences and historical consciousness. In a geographical reappraisal of the early history of radar, I show how island myths were used to establish authority for the sites, Orfordness and Bawdsey Manor. I examine how the sites were simultaneously made to extend into the surrounding space and coordinate a national defence system. I then investigate the development of practices of representation and display in radar, and relate them to broader trends, especially concerning ideas of surveillance. Adding to the militarised landscapes of radar, I investigate changing conceptions of wartime Suffolk, as isolated places and spaces of simulation appeared all over the country. Militarisation also {{played an important role in}} the post-war recolonisation of Britain, via Suffolk, by the avocet (<b>Recurvirostra</b> <b>avosetta).</b> I use this episode to trace ties between the landscape and local and national identity in cultures of nature conservation and natural history. Finally, I bring literary representations of Suffolk into the picture. Using popular guidebooks, topographical studies and histories, I investigate the changing relation between the space of ‘secluded’ Suffolk and the historical consciousness associated with it. I use three case studies of literary treatments to examine the gradual incorporation of military Suffolk into countryside writing. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Ketenisse polder is {{a former}} {{intertidal}} brackish marsh (30 ha) situated in the mesohaline part of the Schelde Estuary. In the 19 th century its central part was embanked as a polder. In the mid 1980 ’s the area was raised above intertidal level when it {{was used as a}} dumping site for the excavated soil from the Liefkenshoek tunnel. In 2002 the area was restored, it was levelled with a weak slope below mean high water level, creating the optimal starting conditions for the development of intertidal mudflats and marshes. Geomorphological changes, sediment characteristics and colonisation by phytobenthos, vegetation, zoobenthos, water birds and breeding birds at the restored site are monitored. The monitoring results of the first year after tidal restoration are presented. Sedimentation as well as erosion between 0 and 30 cm was observed in the first year. Local changes in stream current patterns caused erosion on parts of the former mudflats; sheltered depressions filled up relatively fast. Median grain size showed large variation. Organic carbon content of the sediment varied between 0. 5 and 15 % and was closely related to sediment medium grain size. Chlorophyll a concentrations were negatively correlated with median grain size and tended to increase from the low water line to the shore. They were comparable to nearby intertidal areas and displayed similar seasonal variability with a maximum in spring. The large surface covered wtith Vaucheria was indicator of initiated succession towards tidal marsh. Scirpus maritimus and transitional vegetations to Chenopodiaceae-vegetations established with increasing altitude. The Chenopodiaceae -vegetations were relicts of earlier vegetations before the tidal restoration, and will probably disappear. The macrobenthos community was dominated by Oligochaetes, which were present in 73 % of all samples and attained an average density of about 40 * 103 ind. m- 2. Other macrobenthos species found were nematods, copepods and Corophium. On the sheltered sampling stations macrobenthic densities were high compared to those on nearby intertidal areas. In the first season, 15 breeding bird species were recorded, the most common species being the Pied Avocet (<b>Recurvirostra</b> <b>avosetta).</b> The most common waterbirds were Common Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna), Greylag Goose (Anser anser), Pied Avocet (Recurvirostra avoset) and Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), typical species for the mesohaline part of the estuary.

It is determined that the histological structure of the wall of the esophagus of the studied species of waders is universal, and the relief of mucosa is folded; stratified squamous epithelium of the mucous membrane has an insignificant degree of hornification. A large number of esophagus glands is observed in the lamina propria of the mucosa; these glands secrete mucus which facilitates the movement of food along the esophagus. The muscular coat is well-developed and formed by longitudinal and circular layers of smooth muscle tissue. It is found that characteristics of histological structure of the stomach wall of the waders species under analysis are presupposed by the following functions: 1) glandular stomach wall provides secretion of digestive enzymes through active secretory activity of glands of deep complex; 2) secretion (mucus) of simple tubular glands is excreted to the surface of glandular stomach performing the protective function; 3) the wall of the muscular stomach provides mechanical treatment of food through well-developed muscle layer and solid layer of the cuticle. It is established that the waders’ intestine is shortened, that is compensated by the complication of the relief of intestinal mucosa by plates that form complex mazes and anastomoses, several times increasing the absorbing surface of the intestine. The plates are covered with a single layer of prismatic bordered epithelium which includes Goblet cells, the number of which increases in the caudal direction of intestines. It is found out that the particular feature of the histological structure of the examined wall of the waders’ small intestine is multi-layer location of crypts in the mucosa. A large number of cambial cells with figures of mitosis were noticed in the crypt, which indicated the intensive processes of proliferation of intestinal enterocytes. These features in the structure of the wall of the small intestine are considered as adaptations to distant migrations and are connected with waders’ intense nutrition on migration stops. For the first time Meckel diverticulum has been found in waders and its histological structure has been described. It is established that waders’ Meckel diverticulum is a lymphoid-epithelial organ and it serves as the immune system of waders’ digestive tract. It is stated that the wall of waders’ rectum has wrinkles that contribute to its stretching; mucous membrane has the plate relief, it is lined with a single layer of epithelium bordered with many Goblet cells. It is revealed that different parts of the investigated waders’ cecum have uneven development of histological structures and the presence of lymphoid tissue clusters in the lamina propria mucosa indicates the functional belonging of the cecum to the immune defense system of waders’ digestive tract; the presence of mainly bordered enterocytes in the surface epithelium indicates its osmo-regulatory functio...|$|R
