5|$|Only about 3% of {{the total}} {{installed}} base of <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> are provided with AC drives. However, {{it is estimated that}} drive technology is adopted in as many as 30-40% of all newly installed motors.|$|E
5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.|$|E

50|$|The {{other popular}} motor to {{consider}} when building a BugE is an <b>AC</b> <b>motor.</b> There are two main classifications for AC motors: induction and synchronous. The most popular <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> for electric vehicles is the 3-phase induction <b>motor.</b> The <b>AC</b> <b>motor</b> still uses a DC power source so, instead of the controller {{that would be used}} with a DC drive system, an inverter is needed. This can increase the overall price in comparison with the DC motor system.|$|R

25|$|Early diesel–electric {{locomotives}} in the United States used {{direct current}} (DC) traction motors, but alternating current (<b>AC)</b> <b>motors</b> came into widespread {{use in the}} 1990s, starting with the Electro-Motive SD70MAC in 1993 and followed by the General Electric's AC4400CW in 1994 and AC6000CW in 1995.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of robots use electric motors, often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> in industrial robots and CNC machines. These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the NXEA franchise, Angel Trains {{opted to}} use off-lease Class 317/7 unit 317722 as a {{test-bed}} unit and engaged Bombardier Transportation to rebuild it as a pre-series unit with new traction equipment. The DC motors, traction electronics and thyristors were removed, though the original transformer remained in place. The original bogies were modified to accept new <b>AC</b> <b>motors,</b> and 3-phase converters fitted. Regenerative braking was also fitted. Because <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> are more reliable than DC ones and require significantly less maintenance, this should potentially bring significant cost savings. The work has the potential to extend the life of the Class 317 by up to 20 years. Angel Trains and Bombardier will evaluate the performance of the unit compared to a conventional Class 317.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the first}} power {{stations}} supplied direct current, {{the distribution of}} alternating current soon became the most favored option. The main advantages of AC were {{that it could be}} transformed to high voltage to reduce transmission losses and that <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> could easily run at constant speeds.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{variable}} speed <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> became available at reasonable prices. These motors allow the adjustment of the rotating speed via a potentiometer {{mounted on a}} control panel near the motor. They typically support rotation rates from about 1–12Hz. These motors remained the preferred solution until the 1990s, and are still in use.|$|E
25|$|A servo {{amplifier}} indicates an integrated feedback loop to actively control the output at some desired level. A DC servo indicates use at frequencies down to DC levels, where the rapid fluctuations of an audio or RF signal do not occur. These {{are often used}} in mechanical actuators, or devices such as DC motors that must maintain a constant speed or torque. An AC servo amp. can do this for some <b>AC</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|E

The trams would keep their original exterior design, but the outer structure would be aluminium rather than teak as it is more durable. The benches on the lower deck would be replaced with single seats as well as a more modern look. Digital broadcasts would be placed inside trams to inform passengers of the next station, and LED lighting will be installed. <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> and a new eddy current emergency braking system would be installed.|$|E

Shelby remained influential with Ford manufactured cars, including the Daytona Coupe, GT40, the Mustang-based Shelby GT350 and Shelby GT500. After parting with Ford, Shelby moved on to help develop performance cars with divisions of the two other Big 3 American companies, Dodge, and Oldsmobile.|$|E
25|$|Otso was {{the first}} {{icebreaker}} {{in the world to}} utilize cycloconverters and alternating current (AC) propulsion motors. Although electrical propulsion had already been used in Finnish icebreakers for almost five decades due to its flexibility and good torque characteristics at low propeller speeds, the older vessels had direct current (DC) propulsion motors which were very heavy and bulky at such power levels. Although it would have been possible to use two smaller DC motors in tandem, recent advances in drive and control technology as well as excellent experiences from a prototype installation on board the Finnish research vessel Aranda were in favor of the new type of propulsion system. As a result, Otso was fitted with two Kymi-Strömberg synchronous <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> rated at 7,500kW. The maximum power is available at propeller speeds ranging from 115 to 220rpm to both directions and at lower speeds the propulsion motors are capable of providing 130% of the rated torque to prevent the four-bladed stainless steel propellers from jamming in severe ice conditions. The bollard pull of Otso is 160tons.|$|E

25|$|Union Rotorua {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / {{electric}} machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an AC generator to provide a maximum designed continuous rating of 18822kW for a motor propeller speed of 200rpm. The turbine speed of 4670rpm was reduced to 1500rpm for the generator by a reduction gearbox. The generator output 6.6kV 3-phase at 50Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous <b>A.C.</b> <b>motors,</b> arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotorua has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision {{was made in the}} interests of maneuverability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger turning moment arm. In normal running configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge. The speed of the gas turbine was controlled by a solid state control and safety system integrated with the propulsion controls.|$|E
25|$|Huddersfield is a {{manufacturing}} town, despite the university being the largest employer. Historically the town produced woollen textiles. This area of business, {{along with the}} chemical and engineering industries that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was {{the basis of the}} town's nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of woollen products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making alternating current electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just £300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest's sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of <b>AC</b> <b>motors</b> in the world, and had a turnover of £4,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas's Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley. Other local manufacturers are Cummins Turbo Technologies, founded in 1952 as Holset by Messrs. Holmes and Croset. (turbochargers), David Brown Gear systems (industrial gearing), Huddersfield Fine Worsteds (textiles), Taylor & Lodge (textiles), C & J Antich (textiles), Syngenta AG (agro-chemicals), Pennine Radio Limited (electronics transformers and sheet metalworking) and a large number of niche manufacturers, such as Dual Seal Glass (maker of spandrel glass panels) and Ellis Furniture (producer of kitchen and bathroom furniture). Huddersfield is home to Andrew Jones Pies, a regional award-winning pie-maker, where a worker was killed in a gas explosion on 10 April 2009. and Mamas and Papas – a manufacturer and retailer of prams, pushchairs and related items.|$|E
