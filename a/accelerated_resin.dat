30|$|To obtain {{high-strength}} {{phenol formaldehyde}} (PF) resin-impregnated compressed wood at low pressing pressure, {{the effects of}} resin content, preheating temperature, pressing temperature, and pressing speed on the compressive deformation of oven-dried low molecular weight PF resin-impregnated wood was investigated. With an increase of PF resin content, the Young’s modulus of the cell wall perpendicular to the fiber direction decreases, and collapse-initiating pressure decreases linearly with the Young’s modulus. This indicates that the occurrence of cell wall collapse is strain-dependent. By increasing preheating temperatures, the collapse-initiating pressure increases {{due to the increment}} of the Young’s modulus of the cell wall. An increase in pressing temperature results in the thermal softening of the cell wall and causes collapse at a lower pressure. The wood is compressed effectively despite <b>accelerated</b> <b>resin</b> curing. The pressing speed significantly affects the viscoelastic deformation of the cell wall and the wood is well deformed with decreasing pressing speed, although the differences in density and mechanical properties are relatively small after a pressure-holding period of 30 [*]min. In all the parameters examined in this study, the Young’s modulus and bending strength increase with increasing density.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} a study of two-step plywood adhesives made with varying amounts of phenol, 1, 3, 5 xylenol, resorcin, and formaldehyde. Each resin was evaluated by using it as the adhesive in making plywood. The plywood was then tested for shear strength and wood failure after a four hour boil. Procedures are given for making and testing various straight phenolic resins and resins modified with 1, 3, 5 xylenol or resorcin, or comibinations of both of these <b>accelerating</b> <b>resins.</b> The straight phenolic resins gave boil-proof bonds, but the curing cycle was too long. Those phenolics modified with 1, 3, 5 xylenol gave relatively short cures, but large quantities of this modifier were necessary. Modification of phenolic resins with resorcin gave very rapid cures, but the pot life of these resins was too short. The best compromise was obtained {{with a combination of}} 1, 3, 5 xylenol and resorcin as modifying agents for the phenolic. Some of these three-component resin adhesives had sufficient pot life and produced boil-proof bonds during short curing cycles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Traditional {{insulating}} {{materials used in}} low-voltage machines cannot normally withstand steam because of the simultaneus presence of high temperature and humidity. In order to find a steam-resistant insulation system that includes magnet wire, groundwall and phase insulations and impregnating <b>resin,</b> <b>accelerated</b> aging tests were carried out applying small-scale models. Eight different insulation systems were constructed on these models, and seven different wire insulations were tested. The specimens were immersed in hot, pressurized water, which influenced the material instead of steam. Suitable materials for {{each part of the}} insulation system of a low-voltage, random-wound machine were found. Taking into account the thermal conductivities of each insulating material, the heat transfer of the machine was calculated for all the tested insulation systems...|$|R
40|$|Esthetics and {{durability}} of materials used to fabricate artificial eyes {{has been an}} important issue since artificial eyes are essential to restore esthetics and function, protect the remaining tissues and help with patients' psychological therapy. However, these materials are submitted to degrading effects of environmental agents on the physical properties of the acrylic resin. Objective: This study assessed the color stability of acrylic resins used to fabricate sclera in three basic shades (N 1, N 2 and N 3) when subjected to accelerated aging, mechanical and chemical polishing. Material and Methods: Specimens of each resin were fabricated and submitted to mechanical and chemical polishing. Chromatic analysis was performed before and after accelerated aging through ultraviolet reflection spectrophotometry. Results: All specimens revealed color alteration following polishing and <b>accelerated</b> aging. The <b>resins</b> presented statistically significant chromatic alteration (p< 0. 01) between the periods of 252 and 1008 h. Conclusions: Both polishing methods presented {{no significant difference between the}} values of color derivatives of resins...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Four cation-exchange resins (Dowex 50 wx 2, Amberlyst 36, Purolite CT 482 and Purolite CT 275 DR) were {{investigated}} as catalysts in the esterification of oleic acid (OA) with trimethylolpropane (TMP). All four <b>resins</b> <b>accelerated</b> the reaction kinetics. The {{results showed that}} in a solvent-free system, the gel-type resin Dowex 50 wx 2 must be pre-swollen prior the reaction to achieve high catalytic performance. Contrary, the macro-reticular Amberlyst 36, Purolite CT 482 and Purolite CT 275 DR do not need any pre-treatment to be active. The latter {{is due to the}} high crosslinking degree of these resins. Recyclability tests showed that the resins slightly lose their activity after the first use but retain stable activity during the further uses. The activity decay of the recycled resins is referred to the partial blocking of the active sites by the co-produced water. Additional studies confirmed the high stability of the chosen resins toward leaching in polar medium. Overall, both high stability and possibility of reusing through still high catalytic activity make the resins attractive candidates as heterogeneous catalysts for such complex industrial process...|$|R
40|$|Externally Bonded Reinforcement (EBR) {{technique}} {{has been widely}} used for flexural strengthening of concrete structures by using carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP). EBR technique offers several structural advantages when the CFRP material is prestressed. This paper presents an experimental and numerical study on reinforced (RC) slabs strengthened in flexure with prestressed CFRP strips as a structural strengthening system. The strips are applied as an externally bonded reinforcement (EBR) and anchored with either a mechanical or a gradient anchorage. The former foresees metallic anchorage plates fixed to the concrete substrate, while the latter {{is based on an}} <b>accelerated</b> epoxy <b>resin</b> curing followed by a segment-wise prestress force decrease at the strip ends. Both anchorage systems, in combination with different CFRP strip geometries, were subjected to static loading tests. It could be demonstrated that the composite strip’s performance is better exploited when prestressing is used, with slightly higher overall load carrying capacities for mechanical anchorages than for the gradient anchorage. The performed investigations by means of a cross-section analysis supported the experimental observation that in case a mechanical anchorage is used, progressive strip debonding changes the fully bonded configuration to an unbonded end-anchored system. The inclusion of defined debonding criteria for both the anchorage zones and free length between the anchorage regions allowed to precisely capture the ultimate loading forces.

40|$|Acrylic resins {{have been}} widely used due to their {{acceptable}} esthetics and desirable characteristics such as easy handling, good thermal conductivity, low permeability to oral fluids and color stability. Flexible resins were introduced on the market {{as an alternative to the}} use of conventional acrylic resins in the construction of complete and partial removable dentures. Although these resins present advantages in terms of esthetics and comfort, studies assessing chromatic and microhardness alterations of these materials are still scarce in the related literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the chromatic and microhardness alterations of two commercial brands of flexible resins in comparison to the conventional resin Triplex when submitted to <b>accelerated</b> aging. The <b>resins</b> were manipulated according to manufacturers' instructions and inserted into a silicone matrix to obtain 21 specimens divided into 3 groups: Triplex, Ppflex and Valplast. Triplex presented the highest microhardness value (p < 0. 05) for all the aging periods, which was significantly different from that of the other resins, followed by the values of Valplast and Ppflex. Comparison between the flexible resins (Ppflex and Valplast) revealed a statistically significant difference (p < 0. 05) as regards color. The flexible resin Ppflex and the conventional resin Triplex presented no statistically significant difference (p < 0. 05) as regards aging. The accelerated aging significantly increased the microhardness values of the resins, with the highest values being observed for Triplex. Valplast presented the greatest chromatic alteration after accelerated aging...|$|R
40|$|Phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin {{is a high}} {{performance}} adhesive, but has not been widely developed due to its slow curing rate and high curing temperature. To accelerate the curing rate and to lower the curing temperature of PF resin, four types of metal-mediated catalysts were employed in the synthesis of PF resin; namely, barium hydroxide (Ba(OH) 2), sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3), lithium hydroxide (LiOH), and zinc acetate ((CH 3 COO) 2 Zn). The cure-acceleration effects of these catalysts on the properties of PF resins were measured, and the chemical structures of the PF <b>resins</b> <b>accelerated</b> with the catalysts were investigated by using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and quantitative liquid carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13 C NMR). The {{results showed that the}} accelerated efficiency of these catalysts to PF resin could be ordered in the following sequence: Na 2 CO 3 > (CH 3 COO) 2 Zn > Ba(OH) 2 > LiOH. The catalysts (CH 3 COO) 2 Zn and Na 2 CO 3 increased the reaction activity of the phenol ortho position and the condensation reaction of ortho methylol. The accelerating mechanism of (CH 3 COO) 2 Zn on PF resin is probably different from that of Na 2 CO 3, which can be confirmed by the differences in the differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curve and thermogravimetric (TG) data. Compared to the Na 2 CO 3 -accelerated PF resin, the (CH 3 COO) 2 Zn-accelerated PF resin showed different peaks in the DTG curve and higher weight residues. In the synthesis process, the catalyst (CH 3 COO) 2 Zn may form chelating compounds (containing a metal-ligand bond), which can promote the linkage of formaldehyde to the phenolic hydroxyl ortho position...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this program is to develop low temperature curing technologies for UF and PF resins. This will be accomplished by: • Identifying the rate limiting UF and PF curing reactions for current market resins; • Developing new catalysts to accelerate curing reactions at reduced press temperatures and times. In summary, these new curing technologies will improve the strength properties of the composite wood products and minimize the detrimental effects of wood extractives on the final product while significantly reducing energy costs for wood composites. This study {{is related to the}} <b>accelerated</b> curing of <b>resins</b> for wood composites such as medium density fiberboard (MDF), particle board (PB) and oriented strandboard (OSB). The latter is frequently manufactured with a phenol-formaldehyde resin whereas ureaformaldehyde (UF) resins are usually used in for the former two grades of composite wood products. One of the reasons that hinder wider use of these resins in the manufacturing of wood composites is the slow curing speed as well as inferior bondability of UF resin. The fast curing of UP and PF resins has been identified as an attractive process development that would allow wood to be bonded at higher moisture contents and at lower press temperatures that currently employed. Several differing additives have been developed to enhance cure rates of PF resins including the use of organic esters, lactones and organic carbonates. A model compound study by Conner, Lorenz and Hirth (2002) employed 2 - and 4 -hydroxymethylphenol with organic esters to examine the chemical basis for the reported enhanced reactivity. Their studies suggested that the enhance curing in the presence of esters could be due to enhanced quinone methide formation or enhanced intermolecular SN 2 reactions. In either case the esters do not function as true catalysts as they are consumed in the reaction and were not found to be incorporated in the polymerized resin product. An alternative approach to accelerated PF curing can be accomplished with the addition amines or amides. The later functionality undergoes base catalyzed hydrolysis yielding the corresponding carboxyl ate and free amine which rapidly reacts with the phenolic methylol groups facilitating polymerization and curing of the PF resin (Pizzi, 1997) ...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges of the forestry sector and the global wood industries is the need to address and overcome declining raw material supplies, to fully utilize available resources, and to take advantage of innovations in wood processing. A growing number of timber producers are facing raw material shortages and some wood processors are now operating below 50 percent of capacity. This problem is expected to worsen in the next several years. A method to produce particleboard from hardwood sawmill residue has been investigated at RMIT University, Australia. This work has proven that a particleboard made in laboratory has acceptable mechanical properties and density profiles in accordance to the Australian Standard. However, this board product required a high resin consumption, and a higher board density, inhibiting ready acceptance by the industry. The Ph. D research project presented here addressed this gap in knowledge and examined ways of optimising the new particleboard product. A feasibility and a cost benefit analysis was done to examine the elements of improvement needed. The research then focussed on examining the potential of optimising the board process parameters by using mixes of softwood and hardwood residue. Four series of experiments were carried out for this investigation. During the first and second series, it was revealed that mixes of hardwood and softwood would not improve board properties as expected. Analysis of the underlying reasons revealed that the observed reduction in strength is a result of over curing of hardwood particles when used in the surface layers. It was found that the acidic property of hardwood <b>accelerates</b> the UF <b>resin</b> curing which lead to uneven degree of curing throughout the board. The best configuration of hardwood and softwood throughout the board was found to be with softwood in the surface and hardwood in the core. After obtaining adequate hardwood/softwood configuration throughout the board, using the theory of experimental design, an experimental study was conducted to examine the effect of other processing parameters on the board properties. A process model was developed to predict board properties as a function of processing variables. A final optimised board which complies with the required properties of the AS/NZS standards and utilising up to 45 % hardwood residue was developed through the research program. Outcomes would lead to a reduction of the demand for custom flaked hardwood used in particleboard by replacing them up to 45 % by saw mill waste...|$|R
