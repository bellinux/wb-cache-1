5|$|Margaret Roberts {{attended}} Huntingtower Road Primary School and won {{a scholarship}} to Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School. Her school reports showed hard work and continual improvement; her extracurricular activities included the piano, field hockey, poetry recitals, swimming and walking. She was head girl in 1942–43. In her upper sixth year she applied for a scholarship to study chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, a women's college at the time, but she was initially rejected and was offered a place only after <b>another</b> <b>candidate</b> withdrew.|$|E
5|$|After the Netherlands {{qualified}} for the final {{for the first time}} in nine years at the , media interest was high over who would succeed Anouk as the Dutch representative at Eurovision in 2014. One of the artists tipped early on as a possible candidate was DJ Armin van Buuren, who announced in June 2013 that he was open to participating at the contest as long as AVROTROS gave him full artistic freedom and abandoned plans for a national final to select the entry. Shirma Rouse, one of the backing singers for Anouk at the 2013 contest, was <b>another</b> <b>candidate</b> mentioned after being promoted by Anouk at several events in 2013.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} July 2012, Libor Michálek {{accepted}} the Czech Pirate, Green, and Christian Democrat Party senatorial nominations for District 26. The Pirate Party was his primary affiliation due to its transparency and accountability platforms. His personal 12-point platform prioritized direct democracy, fair political party competition, and anti-corruption oversight efforts alongside social welfare reforms. In the October 2012 elections, he won 24.3 percent {{of the first round}} vote and 74.4 percent of the first-past-the-post runoff, giving him the seat. <b>Another</b> <b>candidate,</b> Karel Berka, challenged the decision, but the Czech Supreme Administrative Court found the claims unfounded. He was the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to national office, the 81-seat Czech Senate. His senatorial term is 2012–2018.|$|E

5|$|Burchard du Puiset (died 1196) was {{a medieval}} Anglo-Norman clergyman and {{treasurer}} of the diocese of York. Either the nephew or son of Hugh du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, Burchard held a number of offices in the dioceses of York and Durham before being appointed treasurer by King Richard I of England in 1189. His appointment was opposed by the newly appointed Archbishop Geoffrey, {{which led to a}} long dispute between Geoffrey and Burchard that was not resolved until the mid 1190s. After the death of Hugh du Puiset, Burchard was a candidate for the Hugh's old bishopric, but lost out in the end to <b>another</b> <b>candidate.</b> Burchard died in 1196.|$|E
5|$|Cordray ran for Ohio's 15th congressional {{district}} in the 1992 U.S. House of Representatives elections, and won the Democratic nomination over Bill Buckel by an 18,7315,329 (7822%) margin, following the withdrawal of <b>another</b> <b>candidate,</b> Dave Sommer. Cordray's platform included federal spending cuts, term limits for Congress and a line-item veto for the president. When Pryce announced that she would vote to support abortion rights, Linda S. Reidelbach entered the race as an independent. Thus, the general election was a three-way affair, with Pryce taking a plurality of 110,390 votes (44.1%), Cordray taking 94,907 votes (37.9%) and Linda Reidelbach taking 44,906 votes (17.9%).|$|E
5|$|In 1873 Reitz {{was asked}} to {{represent}} the district of Beaufort West in the Cape Parliament. The day he took his seat, 30 May, his father, who was the representative for Swellendam, announced his retirement from the Assembly. As so many of Reitz's activities up to that point, his parliamentary career was short-lived. Only two months later, President Johannes Brand of the Orange Free State offered Reitz the position of chairman of the newly formed Appellate Court of the Orange Free State, {{despite the fact that}} Reitz was not fully qualified (inter alia too young). Reitz refused the offer for this reason, but when <b>another</b> <b>candidate</b> also refused, Brand insisted on the nomination of Reitz, and convinced the Volksraad to appoint him.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2010, {{he accused}} Altschuler of {{stealing}} <b>another</b> <b>candidate's</b> press releases, pointing to identical releases from Altschuler and Doug Hoffman, a <b>candidate</b> in for <b>another</b> New York congressional seat {{who uses the}} same consultant on some issues. [...] That month he also accused rival Chris Cox of using his father-in-law to-be, Catsimatidis, for [...] "dirty tricks".|$|R

5|$|Keeping {{his promise}} to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone {{appointed}} him to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk, however, considered seeking {{a position in the}} California State Assembly. The district was weighted heavily in his favor, as much of it was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk's sympathizers voted. In the previous race for supervisor, Milk received more votes than the currently seated assemblyman. However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that <b>another</b> <b>candidate</b> should run—Art Agnos. Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were allowed to run a campaign while performing their duties.|$|E
5|$|PSA-NCAM {{appears as}} <b>another</b> <b>candidate.</b> Mice lacking NCAM show a {{dramatically}} size-reduced OB and {{an accumulation of}} migrating precursors along the RMS. It is possible that lack of NCAM results in agitation of neuron–glia interactions, and modifications in these interactions might in turn {{be responsible for the}} inhibition of migration in the RMS. It has been demonstrated that a cross talk exists between neurons and glial cells and data in favor of an active role of PSA–NCAM in this process has been presented. The lack of PSA–NCAM on the surface of migrating precursors might alter the proliferative properties of this glial cell population, a scenario that appears reminiscent of astrogliosis occurring in neurodegenerative diseases even before any signs of neuronal damage.|$|E
5|$|Pope Gregory XIII {{appointed}} Báthory cardinal {{during his}} visit to Rome in 1584. A year later, he was installed as coadjutor bishop of Warmia. He was in Rome again when Stephen Báthory died in 1586. Andrew was one of the candidates to succeed him in Poland and Lithuania, but Jan Zamoyski, the Chancellor of Poland, convinced him to support <b>another</b> <b>candidate,</b> Sigismund Vasa, and to demonstrate the Báthorys' claim to the crown only through nominating his minor cousin, Sigismund Báthory, Prince of Transylvania. After Sigismund Vasa was elected king in 1587, Báthory convinced his cousin's advisors to send reinforcements to Poland to fight against Maximilian of Habsburg, who also claimed the throne. Báthory became Prince-Bishop of Warmia after the death of Bishop Marcin Kromer in 1589.|$|E

5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had different ideas. Nichols was seen as too closely identified with the wartime Manhattan Project; he had opinions at variance with the commissioners on whether the Director of Military Applications was a staff or a line position; {{and he had a}} strong disagreement with the commissioners over the vexing issue of which agency should hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided to find <b>another</b> <b>candidate.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} {{who was the first}} choice for the role of the itinerant prostitute, Suzy. By some accounts, Rodgers and Hammerstein attempted to get Julie Andrews, only to find that she had just signed a two-year contract to appear in a musical by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, tentatively titled My Lady Liza. Andrews's role, as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, would launch her to stardom. <b>Another</b> <b>candidate</b> was Janet Leigh, whom Rodgers admired greatly, but the actress proved to be unavailable. The producers settled on Judy Tyler, auditioned after Rodgers spotted her on television while watching The Howdy Doody Show, in which she appeared as Princess Summerfall Winterspring.|$|E
5|$|After {{realising}} {{that the}} Báthorys had little chance {{to seize the}} throne, Zamoyski decided to support <b>another</b> <b>candidate,</b> Sigismund Vasa. On Zamoyski's advice, the fourteen-year-old Sigismund Báthory was officially presented as the sole candidate from the family (which demonstrated {{the existence of the}} Báthorys' claim to the throne), but Andrew cooperated with Zamoyski on behalf of Sigismund Vasa. Sigismund Vasa was elected king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania on 19 August 1587. However, his opponents proclaimed Maximilian of Habsburg the ruler of the Commonwealth. Maximilian laid siege to Kraków and pillaged Miechów. Andrew persuaded Sigismund Báthory's advisors to send Transylvanian reinforcements to fight the invaders. Andrew was chosen to receive Sigismund Vasa in Kraków. He also attended the new king's coronation on 27 December 1587. The Sejm (or general assembly) granted citizenship to both Andrew and Balthasar Báthory.|$|E

5|$|By noon, the Lithuanians {{received}} a reply from Moscow stating that Raštikis {{was not a}} suitable candidate for Prime Minister. The selection of <b>another</b> <b>candidate</b> would be supervised by Molotov's deputy Vladimir Dekanozov. Merkys continued to act as Prime Minister. Smetona, who continued to disagree {{with the majority of}} his government, decided to leave the country in protest and appointed Merkys as acting President. By late evening on June 15, Smetona and Minister of Defense Kazys Musteikis reached Kybartai and crossed the border into Germany, where they were granted temporary asylum. The Lithuanian guards did not allow them to pass; thus, Smetona had to wade across the shallow Liepona rivulet. Smetona′s departure worked to the Soviets′ advantage; its indignity opened him to ridicule {{and they were able to}} exploit the sentiments against him without fearing that he would be seen as a martyr. By fleeing, Smetona escaped the fate of Latvian President Kārlis Ulmanis and Estonian President Konstantin Päts, who were manipulated by the Soviets and later arrested. Under the Lithuanian constitution, Merkys became acting president.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{ran for the}} Whig {{nomination}} for Illinois's 7th district of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1843, but was defeated by John J. Hardin. However, Lincoln won support for the principle of rotation, whereby Hardin would retire after only one term {{to allow for the}} nomination of <b>another</b> <b>candidate.</b> Lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846. Lincoln was indeed elected to the House of Representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{is known}} for {{borrowing}} plots and characters from other stories, but the source of A Midsummer Night's Dream has proved difficult to trace. There is no clear parallel to its plot {{in the literature of}} his time. However, many of its characters' names and relationships are borrowed from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Philostrate is no exception. His name is the pseudonym adopted by Arcite upon covertly returning to Athens in The Knight's Tale to work for Theseus. (A Knight's Tale was dramatised nearly twenty years later by Shakespeare and Fletcher as The Two Noble Kinsmen.) Chaucer himself took the name Philostrate from Boccaccio's poem Il Filostrato, a story about Troilus and Criseyde. Because Chaucer's Arcite adopts this identity to become a servant at Theseus' court, {{it is possible that the}} Midsummer Night's Dream character is meant to be the same person in a continuation of the story. However, the two characters have little else in common. <b>Another</b> <b>candidate</b> for the source of Philostrate's character is Philostratus the Elder, the author of Comus, a play which has similarities to Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
