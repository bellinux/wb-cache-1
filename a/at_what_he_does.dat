500|$|During an interview, Tempah {{commented on}} his second album: [...] "I always {{like to work with}} {{different}} people on each project I do, just so you get a different sound and angle. I will be working with some of the same people I did for the first album, {{you know what they say}} ‘if it ain't broke then don’t try and fix it’." [...] Tempah hoped to collaborate with other artists: [...] "I really want to collaborate with Toronto's very own Drake. I think he's amazing <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd really like to work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months. In interviews, other artists announced that they were working on his album such as Labrinth, Dizzee Rascal, Big Sean and Emeli Sandé. Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy. Chase & Status were on additional production duties for [...] "Mosh Pit". They had previously worked with Tinie on their album No More Idols for the single [...] "Hitz". Tempah's vocals from the song are also sampled on the hidden track [...] "5 Minutes".|$|E
2500|$|Henry Winkler said [...] "You've got {{incredible}} judges, Simon {{speaks the}} truth, I always agree with him. And Ryan {{is really good}} <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> but Fantasia," [...] he smiles, [...] "there's something in her that is bigger than anything. We voted for her about 250 times!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for the DVD Talk, Paul Mavis {{positively}} {{reacted to the}} episode. He said [...] "'Dunces & Dragons' puts a new spin on the old A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court theme and it's fun {{to see how the}} show's writers have adapted the characters from the show into this medieval setting." [...] He added [...] "This episode is also good because it shows an abnormally self-confident SpongeBob. I can't fathom (get it?) why fans of the show wouldn't like these new episodes, because they certainly haven't lost their silliness ... or their occasional edge ... Fans of SpongeBob SquarePants will find something to love in this set, if for no other reason, because it brings back many familiar supporting characters and features SpongeBob <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> best: making us laugh." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{stared in}} amazement <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Catching {{up a long}} rope he wound it round the body of my dead comrade, and he tied a cloth round his mouth so as to almost cover his face.|$|R
5000|$|Robinson's move {{helped to}} unify the party and shake his image as a lone wolf. [...] After the vote, Robinson met with about 200 of his supporters, who were shocked, and in some cases, outraged <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then Sir Launcelot catched another spear, {{great and}} strong, from the esquire who {{followed}} him, and before ever that spear broke he overthrew sixteen knights therewith. Wherefore all who beheld him were amazed and terrified <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mitchell," [...] I said, [...] "one moment. How {{much time}} he gains {{who does not}} look to see what his {{neighbour}} says or does, but only <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> himself, to make it just and holy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Fred {{gives me}} his honor {{that he has}} never {{borrowed}} money on the pretence of any understanding about his uncle's land. He is not a liar. I don't want to make him better than he is. I have blown him up well--nobody can say I wink <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> But he is not a liar. And I should have thought--but I may be wrong--that there was no religion to hinder a man from believing the best of a young fellow, when you don't know worse. It seems to me it would be a poor sort of religion to put a spoke in his wheel by refusing to say you don't believe such harm of him as you've got no good reason to believe." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{hearing of}} Hawthorne's death, Alan Bennett {{described}} {{him in his}} diary, [...] "Courteous, grand, {{a man of the}} world and superb <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> with his technique never so obvious as to become familiar as, say, Olivier's did or Alec Guinness's." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kaye {{said in a}} 1954 interview, [...] "Whatever {{she wants}} to be she will be without {{interference}} from her mother nor from me." [...] When she was very young, Dena did not like seeing her father perform because she did not understand that people were supposed to laugh <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4 stars with its review by Alex Henderson stating, [...] "Harris {{was always a}} {{follower}} rather than a leader. But again, he's great <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> and on Bull's Eye, Harris excels... Die-hard bop enthusiasts can't go wrong with Bull's Eye".|$|E

5000|$|Dean died {{ten days}} before his 96th {{birthday}} in an Alexandria hospital. His former Shreveport Times colleague, Wiley W. Hilburn, said that the newspaper office [...] "sort of revolved around Pap. He had a big desk, light table, {{in the middle of}} the newsroom. He was a really likable guy. ... He was really good <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> and we all grew to rely on him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sillitoe wrote many {{novels and}} several volumes of poems. His autobiography, Life Without Armour, which was {{critically}} acclaimed on publication in 1995, offers {{a view of}} his squalid childhood. In an interview Sillitoe claimed, [...] "A writer, if he manages {{to earn a living}} <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>doing,</b> even if it's a very poor living, acquires some of the attributes of the old-fashioned gentleman (if I can be so silly)." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You leave Martin alone, Ruth. <b>He</b> knows <b>what's</b> {{best for}} himself. Look <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> already. <b>He</b> {{makes me sick}} sometimes, sick and ashamed of myself. He knows more now about the world, and life, and man's place, and all the rest, than Arthur, or Norman, or I, or you, too, for that matter, {{and in spite of}} all our Latin, and French, and Saxon, and culture." ...|$|R
5000|$|J.R. Bourne as Chris Argent (recurring seasons 1-5; main season 6): Allison's {{father is}} a born and raised {{werewolf}} hunter who is highly effective <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> He later comes around to see Scott as a vital protector of Beacon Hills and dedicates himself to supporting his cause.|$|E
5000|$|Snaptrap (spelled [...] "Snap Trap" [...] in comics, {{and known}} as Turtler in Japan) {{is the team}} leader. He rules the other Seacons through fear of force rather than any sort of {{inspirational}} leadership qualities. He is, however, very good <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> - brutally and efficiently taking apart Autobots. He transforms into a turtle.|$|E
5000|$|Leaders {{reject a}} {{utilitarian}} approach to virtue. The leader's motive in striving for virtue {{is not simply}} to become good <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> Rather, it is to realize himself fully {{as a human being}} in doing what he does well. Effectiveness is not the aim of self-improvement; it is merely one of its manifold (happy) results. Excellence comes first, effectiveness second.|$|E

5000|$|As Marc thanked Betty {{for saving}} him, Betty gets {{a call that}} there will be an {{emergency}} meeting in seven minutes. But thanks to Marc throwing away her clothes while they were in costume, Betty blames Marc for trying to ridicule her and make her look like a joke and as a cab came by, Betty in costume got in and told Marc not to come along. Marc felt embarrassed <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
60|$|Vane {{gazed down}} at her, and {{afterward}} wondered <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> but she looked so forlorn and desolate, and the pretty face {{was so close to}} his. Stooping swiftly, he kissed her, and had a thrilling fancy that she did not recoil; then the cars lurched forward and he swung himself down. They slid past him, clanking, while he stood and gazed after them. Turning around, he was by no means pleased to see that Nairn was regarding him with quiet amusement.|$|R
50|$|Legion {{tells the}} story of Stephen Leeds, better known as 'Legion', a man whose unique mental {{condition}} allows him to generate multitude of personae. He is a brilliant problem solver, rich and quite good <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> helped by his hallucinations. However, he would rather be left alone, and that means no researchers or psychologists who {{want to get to the}} bottom of his abilities.|$|E
50|$|Seok-jin is cold {{to those}} who have not yet earned their place, which is exactly how he acts toward the fresh, young Min-joo. He's skilled <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> and knows it, but he {{attributes}} it to his passion for the industry and the hard work that got him there. He comes from a humble background and even has a daughter from a previously loving relationship.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{negative}} review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "This Brit {{is good enough}} <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> to make you wonder why he bothers. With Norah Jones putting young-person-with-old-ideas shtick in the bank, the commercial logic we get. But beyond a cross-generational reach achievable in any genre and a swinging musicality he negotiates with too much heavy breathing, what's the artistic payoff?" ...|$|E
50|$|Mozetich {{believed}} that returning to tonality {{would be an}} experiment for him. He liked to look <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> as ‘post-modernism’, and this made him look at tonality in new ways. He ignored tradition, like Schoenberg, Stockhausen, and Ligeti did. Instead of acknowledging the world of modernism, Mozetich {{wanted to go back}} to tradition and see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could express. This experiment resulted in works such as El Dorado (1981). This work is an interesting mixture of minimalistic Gatling gun rhythms, lyrical melodies, sensuous scoring, and late-romantic textbook harmonies.|$|R

5000|$|In a 2013 {{profile in}} The New Yorker, writer Adam Green said, [...] "Robbins, {{who lives in}} Las Vegas, is a {{peculiar}} variety-arts hybrid, known in the trade as a theatrical pickpocket. Among his peers, he is widely considered {{the best in the}} world <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> which is taking things from people's jackets, pants, purses, wrists, fingers, and necks, then returning them in amusing and mind-boggling ways." ...|$|E
