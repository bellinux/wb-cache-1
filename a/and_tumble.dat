5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} displays involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E
5|$|The {{brooding}} anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life as {{a female}} and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a hermaphrodite, the eggs are routinely self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. Here they develop and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E

25|$|In an {{era when}} {{lacrosse}} was notably rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> and players wore no padding, all the while swinging wooden sticks, Lalonde was one never to back down from the toughness aspect of the game. His favourite tactic was to crowd his check and bull his way through opposition. Along with all his goals, the intensely competitive Lalonde also amassed 45 penalties and 356 penalty minutes during his career on the West Coast.|$|E
25|$|Zone 2: Peristome and trap entrance. This zone is {{composed}} mainly of the peristome, which produces copious amounts of nectar, luring insect prey to land or crawl onto the perilous footing surrounding the pitcher trap. This zone {{also includes the}} waxy upper portion of the pitcher tube. Footing on this zone is especially treacherous, as the waxy deposits on surface of this zone cause unwary insects to lose their footing <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> into the pitcher depths.|$|E
25|$|Étienne Cabet {{was born}} in Dijon, France in 1788 to a middle-class family of artisans. Cabet {{attended}} a Roman Catholic secondary school and continued his education, ultimately earning a Doctorate of Law degree in 1812. Cabet was not inclined towards jurisprudence, however, preferring the rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> of politics and journalism. Following the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815, Cabet became active {{in the struggle against}} conservative theocratic monarchism, participating in political groups which espoused a constitutional and republican form of government under monarchical leadership.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, it {{established}} {{a system of}} control and dominance for the major leagues over the independents. There would not be another Ban Johnson-like rebellion {{from the ranks of}} leagues with smaller cities. Selling player contracts was rapidly becoming a staple business of the independent leagues. During the rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> years of the American-National struggle, player contracts were violated at the independents as well: Players that the team had developed would sign deals with the National or American leagues without any form of compensation to the indy club.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Berenberg {{was named}} {{the manager of the}} {{correspondence}} department of the Socialist Party's Rand School of Social Science, which was in charge of conducting correspondence courses with adults around the country interested in taking courses in the social sciences. He remained in this position until 1921, working after that date as a teacher on site at the Rand School, conducting classes in English, History, and various topics related to Socialism. Berenberg remained an employee of the Rand School continuously until his firing early in 1936, an action resulting from Berenberg's factional affiliation in the rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> internal Socialist Party politics of the day.|$|E
25|$|The Graphic Novel Gilmore By the Sea by Ed Cameron {{describes}} 1980s Nye Beach as a rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> neighborhood. But by {{the twenty-first}} century, Nye Beach {{was on its}} way to becoming a self-conscious community with its own merchant organization, modern architecture and community cultural events. In 2007 the multimillion-dollar Archway Place with upscale shopping at ground level and costly condos on its second and third floors was constructed on the former site of Cozy Corner Confectionery (a 1920s grocery). Similar projects followed. The densely commercial Coast Street was refurbished with retro paving stones and custom curbs. Two cement archways were constructed over the approach to the Turnaround and behind the Visual Arts Center.|$|E

25|$|Football {{was adopted}} {{by a number of}} public schools as a way of {{encouraging}} competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making {{it difficult for them to}} adopt rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> running games.|$|E
25|$|Abdur Rouf Choudhury's novel Natun Diganta (three volumes: {{published}} in 1991, 1992, 1993 and complete collection in 2005 by Pathak Shamabesh) is a quality {{work of art}} by any standard and most successful writing on pre- Bangladesh Liberation War. Choudhury most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel Natun Diganta (New Horizon) (vols. 1-3). Reason and humanity – these are its two eternal pillars. The essence of Choudhury's thought is a complete faith in the efficiency of these two immeasurable forces. Its most striking characteristic is its insistent association of work, precept and practice. It appeals not to controversial tests, not to any appearance of sweet reasonableness but to trials in the rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> of life, and it will accept no other judgment. Natun Diganta gives warning against: 1) dogma, mysticism, ceremonial, hypnotism, the binding {{of the mind and}} will by oaths, and other inventions of external authority in religion and politics, 2) participation in violence, individual or social, and organisation's dependence on violence, 3) exploitation, luxury and material property, 4) self-degradation and 5) devotion to self-sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the events}} of the two books, quite a bit has happened. Lorena, lover of Gus McCrae, has left Clara and married Pea Eye Parker, of the former Hat Creek Outfit. They have several children, and own a farm in the Texas Panhandle. Pea Eye is {{thoroughly}} devoted to Lorena, and Lorena has learned to reciprocate and become almost equally attached to Pea Eye. Lorena teaches in a nearby schoolhouse. The cattle ranch (set up by the Hat Creek outfit in Montana) has collapsed. Newt is dead, fallen on by the Hell Bitch. Call has finally admitted to himself that Newt was his son. July Johnson is dead, and Clara lives alone. Call has gone back to being a Ranger and a gun-for-hire. Trains have greatly expanded the reach of civilization and have pushed back the frontier. The American West is no longer rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> and Captain Woodrow F. Call has become a relic, albeit a greatly respected one. Nineteen-year-old Joey Garza and his deadly German rifle (capable of killing a man at a distance of half a mile) are not about to let law and order close the book on the Wild West just yet.|$|E

25|$|Gudas was {{thrust into}} a top-4 role on defense for the season, with Eric Brewer being {{moved to a}} more {{manageable}} 3rd pair role. Gudas continued to play his physical game that he had become known for in his first full NHL season. His rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> in-your-face game also landed Gudas in trouble at a few points during the season. The biggest incident involved Panthers forward Scottie Upshall squirting Gudas {{with a bottle of}} water from after he had fallen in front of the Panthers bench. Gudas would retaliate by smashing his stick on the Panthers in frustration. He would be ejected from the game for his actions, though the Lightning would still go onto to win the game despite being down a defensemen {{for the remainder of the}} game. Gudas also received a match penalty against the Dallas Stars on 5 March 2014. Though it was announced by Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman that there would not be any additional discipline from the league. Gudas finished his first full NHL season by playing three games in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the Tampa Bay Lightning in a 4 sweep by the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E
25|$|The {{nearby town}} of Coulson {{appeared}} a far more likely site. Coulson was a rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> town where arguments were often followed by gunplay. Liver-Eating Johnston was a lawman in Coulson. Perhaps the most famous person {{to be buried in}} Coulsons Boothill cemetery is Muggins Taylor, the scout who carried the news of Custer's Last Stand to the world. Most buried here were said to have died with their boots on. The town of Coulson had been situated on the Yellowstone River, which made it ideal for the commerce that steamboats brought up the river. However, when the Montana & Minnesota Land Company oversaw the development of potential railroad land, they ignored Coulson, and platted the new town of Billings just a couple of miles to the Northwest. Coulson quickly faded away; most of her residents were absorbed into Billings. Yet for a short time the two towns co-existed: a trolley even ran between the two. But ultimately there was no future for Coulson as Billings grew. Though it stood {{on the banks of the}} Yellowstone River only a couple of miles from the heart of present-day Downtown Billings, the city of Billings never built on the land where Coulson once stood. Today Coulson Park sits along the banks of the Yellowstone where the valley's first town once stood.|$|E
