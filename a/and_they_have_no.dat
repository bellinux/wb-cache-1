25|$|Christ's {{ministers in}} the church are {{stewards}} in the household of God and shepherds of his flock. Some are called and ordained to this occupation as presbyters or deacons. Presbyters have a principal and directing part in these great duties but they hold no priesthood differing in kind from that which is common to all the Lord's people <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> exclusive title to the preaching of the gospel or the care of souls. These ministries are shared with them by others to whom also the Spirit divides his gifts severally as he wills.|$|E
25|$|Marsupial moles {{spend most}} of their time underground, coming to the surface only occasionally, {{probably}} mostly after rains. They are blind, their eyes having become reduced to vestigial lenses under the skin, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> external ears, just a pair of tiny holes hidden under thick hair. The head is cone-shaped, with a leathery shield over the muzzle, the body is tubular, and the tail is a short, bald stub. They are between 12 and 16cm long, weigh 40 to 60grams, and are uniformly covered in fairly short, very fine pale cream to white hair with an iridescent golden sheen. Their pouch has evolved to face backwards so it does not fill with sand, and contains just two teats, so the animal cannot bear more than two young at a time.|$|E

500|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the [...] "external" [...] cardinalate was revived during the Great Western Schism, but in another form and for other reasons. Popes from the rival obediences gave the cardinalitial dignities to the churchmen serving European monarchs (Crown-cardinals) without calling them to the Roman Curia, in order to assure {{the support of the}} monarchs. These cardinals continued to reside in their countries. Additionally, the curial cardinals in 13th century started to cumulate a great number of the benefices, {{from the time of the}} Schism including also the episcopal sees. After the Council of Trent (1545–1563), the cardinals occupying external bishoprics were generally obliged to reside in them. Today, the majority of the cardinals are simultaneously diocesan archbishops or bishops, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> real jurisdiction over their titular churches at Rome.|$|E

They have large vibrissae around the gape, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> tail, only a small pygostyle. The common name of this bird comes from black spots on its feathers. They use their powerful legs and claws for defence against predators like stoats or ferrets. Kiwis are flightless birds, and hence lack hollow bones, lack a keel to which wing muscles anchor, and have tiny wings. This species also has a low body temperature compared to other birds.

2500|$|The extra {{terms in}} the force F′ are the [...] "fictitious" [...] forces for this frame, whose causes are {{external}} to the system in the frame. The first extra term is the Coriolis force, the second the centrifugal force, and the third the Euler force. These terms all have these properties: they vanish when Ω = 0; that is, they are zero for an inertial frame (which, of course, does not rotate); they take on a different magnitude and direction in every rotating frame, depending upon its particular value of Ω; they are ubiquitous in the rotating frame (affect every particle, regardless of circumstance); <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> apparent source in identifiable physical sources, in particular, matter. Also, fictitious forces do not drop off with distance (unlike, for example, nuclear forces or electrical forces). For example, the centrifugal force that appears to emanate from the axis of rotation in a rotating frame increases with distance from the axis.|$|E
