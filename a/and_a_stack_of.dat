500|$|Dickerson visits another funeral, and befriends a mourner, Tina, {{by pretending}} {{to have been}} a {{childhood}} friend of the deceased. They visit a nearby lake to reminisce, but she feels something is wrong. Dickerson apologises and leaves; however, Tina is soon attacked from behind. Her body is found with the words [...] "stop looking" [...] carved into her stomach, and Black believes there may be a message somewhere on the first victim's body. He asks fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to look for it; Watts is also able to find fingerprints on Tina's hair clip that identify Dickerson—a paroled convict. They track him down to the halfway home, although Connor secretly helps him to escape to a nearby scrapyard. In Dickerson's room, a hidden cache of souvenirs is found, along with a journal <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> letters marked [...] "return to sender".|$|E

2500|$|Since RFID tags can be {{read through}} an item, {{there is no need}} to open a book cover or DVD case to scan an item, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> books {{can be read}} simultaneously. [...] Book tags can be read while books are in motion on a {{conveyor}} belt, which reduces staff time. This can all be done by the borrowers themselves, reducing the need for library staff assistance. With portable readers, inventories could be done on a whole shelf of materials within seconds.|$|E
2500|$|To {{make the}} {{proteins}} accessible to antibody detection, they are moved {{from within the}} gel onto a membrane made of nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). [...] The primary method for transferring the proteins is called electroblotting and uses an electric current to pull proteins from the gel into the PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane. [...] The proteins move from within the gel onto the membrane while maintaining the organization they had within the gel. An older method of transfer involves placing a membrane {{on top of the}} gel, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> filter papers on top of that. The entire stack is placed in a buffer solution which moves up the paper by capillary action, bringing the proteins with it. In practice this method is not used as it takes too much time; electroblotting is preferred. As a result of either [...] "blotting" [...] process, the proteins are exposed on a thin surface layer for detection (see below). Both varieties of membrane are chosen for their non-specific protein binding properties (i.e. binds all proteins equally well). Protein binding is based upon hydrophobic interactions, as well as charged interactions between the membrane and protein. Nitrocellulose membranes are cheaper than PVDF, but are far more fragile and do not stand up well to repeated probings.|$|E
