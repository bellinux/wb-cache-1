The raising of the flag said to the crew the following: [...] "The fate of Imperial Japan hangs on this one battle; all hands will exert themselves <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> best."

Duplicates also had to be made, for Maya Stojan and Wen's two stunt doubles. She explained that she [...] "decided to do a wrap dress so that [...] could easily dance. It already had a slit sort of built into it, so that gave her freedom of movement. [...] goal is always {{to make sure that}} the actors are comfortable in their costumes, that they can move freely <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> stunts, and that nothing is too restrictive. And that they also look amazing at the same time." [...] The dress also [...] "needed long sleeves so that [...] could have pads on underneath the dress for when she was fighting. And then of course she's got the crazy fight where she's fighting herself...she needed serious freedom of movement in that dress, so we built panels that had stretch, and put them in several areas on her arms and her sides, so that it moved with her as she punched...herself." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Britain went to war, {{as before}} in World War I, {{previously}} forbidden job opportunities opened up for women. Women were {{called into the}} factories to create the weapons that were used on the battlefield. Women took on the responsibility of managing the home and became the heroines of the home front. [...] According to Carruthers, this industrial employment of women significantly raised women’s self-esteem as it allowed them {{to carry out their}} full potential <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> part in the war. During the war, women’s normative roles of “house wife” transformed into a patriotic duty. [...] As Carruther’s put it, the housewife has become a heroine in the defeat of Hitler (235).|$|E
2500|$|Alan Burton {{writes that}} [...] "Ultimately, though, [...] Tell England extols the British class system: if modern war is unpleasant, young gentlemen, forged {{in the public}} schools, can {{nonetheless}} be counted upon to make the ultimate sacrifice <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> duty." [...] Burton also quotes W.D. Routt who describes Tell England as [...] "a compounded act of disinheritance" [...] of Australia's part in World War I, but who also notes the [...] "multiple expositions" [...] of the film, [...] "artistic, committed, sexy, evil". Routt justifies these descriptions {{with reference to the}} film's ambiguity about the morality of the war, and its supposedly improper sexual subtexts. In other words, concludes Burton, we should not dismiss all such early [...] "Great War" [...] films as simple and naive.|$|E

Liz gets the chance to be on camera as host of Dealbreakers, but the pilot is a failure. Despite their frustrations and occasional rivalries, however, the show often reveals that the two women appreciate their friendship <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> best to be supportive of the other's careers. [...] When the phrase [...] "That's a deal breaker, ladies" [...] is coined by Jenna thanks to Liz's writing, Jenna surrenders the spotlight with a surprisingly short sulking period. [...] She later encourages Liz to write a book and take on a talk show gig based on the catch phrase (though the talk show is very short-lived).|$|E

2500|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} women were forced into {{industry}} jobs between 1940-1943. As surveyed by the Ministry of Labour, {{the percentage of women}} in industrial jobs went from 19.75 per cent to 27 per cent from 1938-1945. It was very difficult for women to spend their days in factories, and then come home to their domestic chores and care-giving, and as a result, many women were unable to hold their jobs in the workplace. Britain underwent a labour shortage where an estimated 1.5 million people were needed for the armed forces, and an additional 775,000 for munitions and other services in 1942. It was during this ‘labour famine’ that propaganda aimed to induce people to join the labour force <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> bit in the war. Women were the target audience in the various forms of propaganda because they were paid substantially less than men. It was of no concern whether women were filling the same jobs that men previously held. Even if women were replacing jobs with the same skill level as a man, they were still paid significantly less due to their gender. [...] In the engineering industry alone, the number of skilled and semi-skilled female workers increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent from 1940-1942. [...] According to Gazeley, even though women were paid less than men, it is clear that women engaging in war work and taking on jobs preserved by men reduced industrial segregation.|$|E
2500|$|At 11:30p.m. on April 5, 1934, before {{reaching}} Penang, Sato was found missing by his compatriot Jiro Yamagishi. The {{last time he}} was seen was at 8:30p.m. when he had dinner in his cabin. [...] He left two suicide notes, one to his Japanese tennis teammates expressing doubts that {{he would be able to}} help the team in the upcoming contest. He begged them to forgive him <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> best to prevail in the match. He promised he would be with his colleagues in spirit. [...] The other note was addressed to the ship's captain, apologizing for the inconveniences that his actions might cause. A search for him continued for seven more hours and the vessel hovered in the strait. Wireless messages were sent to nearby ships. Later further evidence was found which confirmed the suicide theory. Two iron davit-winding handles and a training skip-rope were missing, which Sato probably used to tie weights on himself to make sure he would drown. After discovery of the new evidence, the ship sent out a radio message stating that [...] "Japan's finest tennis player and national hero was believed to have committed suicide by throwing himself overboard". On April 6, a prayer was ministered by his friends who assembled on the deck of the ship. An altar was built on board with photographs and racquets of Sato around it. [...] Also a traditional Japanese [...] "cake offering" [...] ceremony was held. [...] It was speculated that the pressure on him came from the growing prestige of the Japanese Empire and from the Japanese Lawn Tennis Association who refused to allow the exhausted Sato to have a break from tennis and skip the 1934 season. He became depressed and concerned about his abilities.|$|E
2500|$|... 1616 – Prince Drian-Ramaka, {{having been}} renamed [...] "Dom André de Souza" [...] (Sahavandra?) by the Jesuits, {{returned}} to Anosy in April, together with 8 [...] "white companions," [...] 3 of them Jesuit missionaries whose {{task was to}} develop a mission at Tranovato by working in collaboration with [...] "Dom Andre" [...] and his Raondriana father. While his parents were very happy when they found out their son, who had been forcibly taken from them two years earlier, was not only alive and aboard a ship in Ranofotsy bay, the Jesuits refused to let [...] "Dom Andre" [...] go to shore until his father provided two additional relatives as temporary hostages. While King Chambanga was enraged over this, he did eventually yield to this demand. These temporary hostages were chained up on the ship and then the Jesuits indicated they would take Drian-Ramaka back on board as well unless his father provided them with another son (preferably two), who would also be taken to Goa for studies. However, Chambanga refused to give up any of his sons to the Jesuits, including Drian-Ramaka. Furthermore, he told the Jesuit missionaries [...] "he felt the Portuguese had the custom of sending some missionaries first to lands they desired and following later to take possession" [...] of them (Larson, 2007). This in turn enraged the Jesuits and the ship's company, who plotted to mercilessly battle the king and his followers, only giving up on this plan when they realized in so doing they {{would not be able to}} do any missionary work in Anosy. Eventually the Jesuits worked out an agreement with Chambanga that in exchange for [...] "just" [...] taking one of what had been two temporary Antanosy hostages to Goa for education, they would be allowed to live <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> missionary work in Anosy. Two of the missionaries settled at Tranovato (for a 1656 map of this community drawn by Flacourt, see.). However, when members of this new, Portuguese community identified the ombiasa as God's enemies, in return the ombiasa threatened to poison them. When the Portuguese openly began searching for gold and silver in the Anosy area, this confirmed King Chambanga's fears that they were involved in much more than just sharing their religion with his people. Soon after this the Portuguese living at Tranovato became ill due to fevers and by the end of the year, very frustrated with how this vazaha endeavor was working out, Chambanga forbid his people to provide anything to the Portuguese in an attempt to starve them into leaving Anosy.|$|E
