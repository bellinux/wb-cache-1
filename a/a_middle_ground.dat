Cane has noted that there are three views. The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E

An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory. It was published by Columbia University Press as the second book in their series Critical Perspectives on Animals, edited by Gary Francione and Gary Steiner. Critics {{from a variety of}} backgrounds responded positively to the book, focussing on how Cochrane had found <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> between traditional animal rights philosophy and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ground.</b> Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner sought {{increased}} {{integration with}} other Latin American countries. He revived {{and tried to}} strengthen the Mercosur trade bloc and improved relations with Brazil, but without automatically aligning with that country, the regional power of South America. The president tried to keep <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> between Brazil and Venezuela, since he considered the Brazilian Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva too conservative, and the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez too anti-American. Kirchner worked with centre-left presidents Lula and Chilean Ricardo Lagos and the left-wing rulers Chávez, Fidel Castro from Cuba and Evo Morales from Bolivia. He established a political alliance with Chávez's government, and by 2008, Argentinian exports to Venezuela were quadruple what they were in 2002. A bilateral military commission was established with Venezuela, through which some technological exchange took place.|$|E

He discussed {{the manner in which}} Thomas perceived emotions as a strict dichotomy between positive and negative without <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ground.</b> Thomas interpreted from the video that it was all right to feel happy while simultaneously acknowledging that a sad event had occurred.

However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy {{of the quality of}} their units over the quantity. The insectoid Zerg possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies.

25|$|Broad Church {{indicates}} <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ground.</b> These parishes are {{the most}} common within The Episcopal Church. However, unlike the Anglican Church in England, most Episcopal 'broad church' parishes make use of a catholic liturgy that includes eucharistic vestments, chant and a high view of the sacraments, even if the liturgy is not as solemn or lacks some of the other accoutrements typical of Anglo-Catholic parishes. This is because the Episcopal Church teaches, through its Book of Common Prayer, a theologically high view of the Church and its sacraments, even if not all parishes carry this out liturgically.|$|E
25|$|Coleridge {{spent much}} of his time working on {{pamphlets}} and lecturing, especially on topics of political reform. He spoke often on liberal ideas and condemned practices such as slavery and movement within the British Parliament to expand sedition laws. When he spoke on religion, he emphasized Unitarianism and how it was <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> between the problems of Anglicanism and the problems of atheism. His religio-political views were influenced by the images found in the works of Spenser, Milton, and Bunyan, and his ideas were similar to those expounded by Priestley and David Harley. He especially disapproved notions of the Trinity and of Christian mysteries early on and instead substituted redemption without need for dogma. By 1805, he would change his views and become more Orthodox.|$|E
