5|$|Between 1772 and 1779, Espejo {{provoked}} the colonial <b>authorities,</b> <b>who</b> regarded him as responsible for several satirical and mocking posters. These posters {{were attached to}} the doors of churches and other buildings, and their anonymous author tended to attack the colonial authorities, the clergy or any other subject he deemed convenient. Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.|$|E

5|$|These dates {{correspond}} {{with the end}} of the Battle of Konigsberg, which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison. A few years later, Brusov publicly voiced a contrary opinion; this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet <b>authorities,</b> <b>who</b> did not want to be seen as responsible for the loss of the Amber Room.|$|E

As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the <b>authorities,</b> <b>who</b> by then had taken special notice of Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 800 {{students}} from both Platte Canyon High School {{and the nearby}} Fitzsimmons Middle School were rapidly evacuated. Morrison's demands were unknown, although police confirmed that his primary concern was a request {{for the police to}} back away. All students, except the hostages, were safely evacuated by 12:10 p.m. and by 3:00 p.m. all had been taken to Deer Creek Elementary School.

5|$|Being {{located just}} inside the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf <b>authorities</b> <b>who</b> own the plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France. Its production was tolerated and even encouraged by the <b>authorities,</b> <b>who</b> often used Gazette de Leyde and other similar publications for their own ends, when wishing to publicize information {{that could not be}} released via the official channels. The paper also gave voice to institutions like the Parliament of France that were finding it difficult to publish in the official French newspaper, the Gazette de France.|$|E

5|$|In December 1928 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez. Crowley was {{deported}} from France by the <b>authorities,</b> <b>who</b> disliked {{his reputation}} and feared {{that he was}} a German agent. So that she could join him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929. Now based in London, Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel Moonchild and book of short stories The Stratagem. Mandrake went into liquidation in November 1930, before the entirety of Crowley's Confessions could be published. Mandrake's owner P.R.

Returning to Paris, Heliade continued to publish works on political and cultural issues, including an analysis of the European situation after the Peace Treaty of 1856 and an 1858 essay on the Bible.

He was prevented from doing so by English <b>authorities,</b> <b>who</b> then proceeded to expel him from England.
