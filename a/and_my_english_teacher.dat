5000|$|McCray {{attended}} {{elementary school}} at the original Harriet Tubman Elementary School in Baltimore one year before it was demolished in 1967. During that year, he began 1st grade at the newly constructed experimental school, City Springs Elementary School which was located directly in the community where his family lived, Perkins Homes Projects and continued through 1972. During this time, John was recognized for his artistic abilities and encouraged to draw and paint at every opportunity. “Once in the 2nd grade I had to stay after school for repeatedly drawing on my desk. I mean every desk in every class. I couldn't help it. I was a straight A-Student and loved learning but always found myself looking at elaborately drawn compositions on my desk when the school bell rang after every class. I remember one night I had to stay after school to clean every desk in all my classes <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>English</b> <b>teacher,</b> Miss Johnson, showed up at our project apartment. I thought, 'Oh, my God. This lady walked {{all the way down}} here through the hood? I'm in trouble. My mother's going to kill me'. Once there, she simply presented me a sketch pad and charcoal pencils, said to my mother that he is a gifted artist and should never have to wash away his artistry. My mother just gave me a knowing nod of approval and I've been drawing ever since”. In addition, his mother encouraged him to join the Salvation Army Boy's Club of America which was located five miles away from the projects to experience a more diverse area of the city, Highlandtown. There, he became very active in art, Native American Studies, football and lacrosse. At the age of 11, he painted his 1st mural which featured all of his newfound interests. In addition, through the Boy's Club, he was asked to do a portrait of Mayor William Donald Schaefer which was later presented to the city's office. When he was 12, his parent's marriage fell apart and his mother moved the family to a community closer to Highlandtown, Butcher's Hill. “That decision to move changed my life's path,” McCray later said, “because all of my close friends in the projects ended up in prison, on drugs or dead. Whenever I could, I'd just stay in my room and draw to seek sanctuary from the streets below. Everybody had to know how to defend themselves down there...some were better at it. I never lost a fight. Because I was really good at street fighting and said to be smarter than other kids, I was already being recruited by older people {{to be a part of}} the criminal element that played a role in the demise of all the friends that I had. I don't know if I could have escaped it. My friends were all descent kids who had dreams and aspirations just like me. I never believed there was anything that overwhelmingly more special about me that would have ensured my survival.” Amirajadid 03:56, 24 January 2011 (UTC) ...|$|E

40|$|While {{perceptions}} that {{the roles of}} teacher and teacher educator as an oppositional binary are being challenged, sustaining and incorporating both professional identities has presented challenges. This paper presents a narrative account of my professional identity journey, including {{a description of a}} partnership that enabled boundaries to be spanned between a school and university and the teacher and teacher educator roles. As an <b>English</b> curriculum pre-service <b>teacher</b> educator, I have tried to maintain <b>my</b> connection to <b>English</b> classroom teaching, however, an absence from the classroom of eleven years left me vulnerable to the criticism that teacher educators lack relevant classroom practice. To retain <b>my</b> <b>English</b> <b>teacher</b> identity I sought partnerships to balance the theory-practice nexus. I returned to an English classroom, interacting with secondary students and pre-service teachers, working with former graduates as colleagues in enriching professional learning experiences. This paper proposes that new modes of professional collaboration, involving communities of practice, are needed to bring together schools and universities as sites of learning, but that changed attitudes are necessary within all areas of the profession to achieve this. The paper concludes with a discussion of perceived barriers threatening the sustainability of collaborative models of teacher education...|$|R

On it he {{is accompanied by}} his regular trio of Michael Hawkins, bass and Neal Smith, drums. Additional artists on this session include Russell Malone, guitar and Steven Kroon, percussion. It includes jazz interpretations of some well-known pop numbers of the past half-century, including [...] "If", the early 1970s soft-rock ballad by Bread. [...] "This song has been with me ever since the sixth grade," [...] Chestnut recalled, [...] "I had to play it for <b>my</b> <b>English</b> <b>teacher's</b> wedding. I've played it in many and various contexts. I actually played it in a Top 40 band when I was just out of school. A lot of time has passed, but then recently I just started thinking about it again." [...] Chestnut's own [...] "Mason-Dixon line" [...] {{is one of the}} album's high points, a joyful bebop number. Chestnut continually tours with his trio, playing live at jazz festivals around the world as well as clubs and concert halls. His leadership and prowess as a soloist has also led him to be a first call for the piano chair in many big bands including the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, Dizzy Gillespie Big Band, and Carnegie Hall Jazz Orchestra. Chestnut is currently represented by Addeo Music International (AMI).|$|R
