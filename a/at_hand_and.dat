5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Subject matter. First, the {{justiciability}} of {{an issue}} depends on the subject matter <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> not the source of decision-making power. This was the principle stated in GCHQ and reiterated in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Where the executive has the best access to available materials, its views should be decisive or at least highly persuasive. It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines {{that there may be}} matters of fact not in the public domain which may be known only to the executive. Where sensitive facts are concerned, Singapore's adversarial system is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial. Furthermore, not all pertinent facts might be presented before the court.|$|E

The cloud obscured Point Misenum near <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E

5|$|Tool use in orangutans was {{observed}} by primatologist Birutė Galdikas in ex-captive populations. In addition, evidence of sophisticated tool manufacture and {{use in the}} wild was reported from a population of orangutans in Suaq Balimbing (Pongo abelii) in 1996. These orangutans developed a tool kit for use in foraging that consisted of both insect-extraction tools {{for use in the}} hollows of trees and seed-extraction tools for harvesting seeds from hard-husked fruit. The orangutans adjusted their tools according {{to the nature of the}} task <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> preference was given to oral tool use. This preference was also found in an experimental study of captive orangutans (P. pygmaeus).|$|E
5|$|The public stage ban 1642–60 {{imposed by}} the Puritan regime {{represents}} a long and sharp break in dramatic tradition, but was still never completely successful in suppressing the ideologically hateful make-believe of play-acting. Performances in grand private houses were not unusual, and could have quite elaborate sets, {{as can be seen}} from the extant drawings for the original performance of Davenant's opera The Siege of Rhodes (1656) at his home Rutland House. This was public theatre in all but name, as Davenant charged 5 shillings for admission. Some professional actors also managed to scrape a living and evade the authorities in stealth acting companies in London, such as that of Michael Mohun at the Red Bull Theatre. Professional writers from the previous era were growing middle-aged, biding their time, and hoping for the monarchy to be restored. By the later 1650s, it was becoming obvious that that time was <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> William Davenant, for example, stepped up his theatrical activities.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{attention}} on memory recall has surprising results. It {{seems that the}} only time attention largely affects memory is during the encoding phase. During this phase, performing a parallel task can severely impair retrieval success.

25|$|A further {{breakthrough}} occurred {{upon the}} advent of modern ("ab initio") electronic structure calculations whereby the relevant parameters characterising JT systems can be reliably determined from first principles. Thus one could go beyond studies of model systems that explore the effect of parameter variations on the PES and vibronic energy levels; one could also go on beyond fitting these parameters to experimental data without clear knowledge {{about the significance of}} the fit. Instead, well-founded theoretical investigations became possible which greatly improved the insight into the phenomena <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> into the details of the underlying mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|The {{hardships of}} the Trail were many. Casualties caused by American airstrikes were low, {{accounting}} for only 2% of total losses. More dangerous enemies included malaria, foot infections {{and a variety}} of other maladies. Total losses to disease are estimated at around 10 to 20%. Sick soldiers were left to recuperate at various way-stations. Transit time could take months, and sometimes entire units were disrupted and disbanded. Recruits were generally given an optimistic picture of conditions in the south, with claims that victory was close <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> that they would be welcomed as liberators by their oppressed southern brethren. They were often quickly disabused of such notions as they encountered sullen peasants and withering US firepower.|$|E

Midway through the first season, the Beaumont voice-over introduction was discarded in favor of a brief scene extracted from the episode <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and,</b> {{at the end of the}} first season, the teaser was entirely discarded, moving immediately to the title and credits. In seasons five and six, significant crew are listed in an extension of the opening credits after a commercial break.|$|E
25|$|However it was {{essential}} that servants were close <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> so they were given their own specific floors, usually the lowest and the highest. These floors were often, as at Belton, distinguished by a different fenestration from the rooms of the employers in between. Hence at Belton can be seen the small windows of the semi-basement containing the kitchens, pantries and servants' dining halls. Above are the large windows lighting the principal rooms, while {{right at the top}} of the house are again the small windows of the servants’ bedrooms. These rooms which were entirely in main block of the house, and constituted distinct servants' quarters, were to be the forerunner of the service wing.|$|E
