5|$|The {{administration}} of charitable trusts is covered {{primarily by the}} Charities Act 1993 and the Charities Act 2006, and is widely divided between four groups; the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> England and Wales, the trustees, the Charity Commission and the Official Custodian for Charities.|$|E
5|$|Under section 14 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, a {{bill which}} has been {{approved}} by the Northern Ireland Assembly is presented to the Queen by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for royal assent after a four-week waiting period during which the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> Northern Ireland may refer the bill to the Supreme Court. Assent is given by means of letters patent in the following form set out in the Northern Ireland (Royal Assent to Bills) Order 1999.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} in Charlottesville, Scalia entered public service in 1971. President Richard Nixon {{appointed}} him {{general counsel for the}} Office of Telecommunications Policy, where one of his principal assignments was to formulate federal policy for the growth of cable television. From 1972 to 1974, he was chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, a small independent agency that sought to improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy. In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as Assistant <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> the Office of Legal Counsel. After Nixon's resignation, the nomination was continued by President Gerald Ford, and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.|$|E

5|$|Breyer {{served as}} a law clerk to Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg during the 1964 term (list), and served briefly as a fact-checker for the Warren Commission. He was a special {{assistant}} to the United States Assistant <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> Antitrust from 1965 to 1967 and an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973. Breyer was a special counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary from 1974 to 1975 and served as chief counsel of the committee from 1979 to 1980. He worked closely with the chairman of the committee, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to pass the Airline Deregulation Act that closed the Civil Aeronautics Board.|$|E
5|$|Browning, Gyles' attorney, cited a case {{which had}} also {{appeared}} before Hardwicke, that of Read v Hodges. In that case, a publisher attempted {{to circumvent the}} rights of the author of Czar Peter the Great by including all three volumes in one and cutting several pages. Hardwicke rejected the argument, however, declaring that the former case had been decided merely on a motion, and that he had given his decision and statements without the thought he would have given a normal hearing. Hardwicke further took contention with the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> England and Wales' assertion that the Statute of Anne provided a publishing monopoly, instead interpreting the act as one meant to promote public education and the public good.|$|E
5|$|Hastings first rose to {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of the Case of the Hooded Man in 1912, and became noted for his skill at cross-examinations. After his success in Gruban v Booth in 1917, his practice steadily grew, and in 1919 he became a King's Counsel (KC). Following various successes as a KC in cases such as Sievier v Wootton and Russell v Russell, his practice was put on hold in 1922 when he was returned as the Labour Member of Parliament for Wallsend. Hastings was appointed <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> England and Wales in 1924, by the first Labour government, and knighted. His authorisation of the prosecution of J. R. Campbell in what became known as the Campbell Case, however, led to the fall of the government after less than a year in power.|$|E

5|$|In 1808, when Congressman Benjamin Parke {{resigned}} from office, Harrison ordered {{a special election}} to fill the vacancy. Jennings entered the race against Harrison's candidate, Thomas Randolph, the <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> <b>for</b> the territory, and John Johnson, a Vincennes native who {{had the support of}} the antislavery group. Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into the territory unless the majority of his constituents agreed, while Johnson remained silent on the issue. Jennings, an antislavery candidate from the eastern portion of the territory, rode from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery. Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph's aristocratic tendencies, ties to Harrison's territorial government, and the issue of slavery in the territory. Jennings found his greatest support among the growing Quaker community {{in the eastern part of}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} incumbents, Sir Walter Mildmay, member for Peterborough from 1553 to 1554, subsequently became Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1559 to 1589. Later, in the nineteenth century, William Elliot, Whig member from 1802 {{until his death in}} 1819, was Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland between 1806 and 1807; the Hon. William Lamb (later the 2nd Viscount Melbourne), Whig member from 1816 to 1819, became Home Secretary in 1830 then Prime Minister from 1834 to 1841; and Sir James Scarlett (later the 1st Baron Abinger), Whig member from 1819 to 1830, was, from 1827, <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> England and Wales.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} to Parliament in 1805 for Gatton, a rotten borough, and became Solicitor General for England and Wales in 1812 and <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> England and Wales a year later. Although not happy in Parliament, having been {{returned}} only for political purposes, Garrow acted {{as one of the}} principal Whig spokesmen trying to stop criminal law reform as campaigned for by Samuel Romilly and also attempted to pass legislation to condemn animal cruelty. In 1817, he was made a Baron of the Exchequer and a Serjeant-at-Law, forcing his resignation from Parliament, and he spent the next 15 years as a judge. He was not particularly successful in the commercial cases the Exchequer specialised in, but when on Assize, used his criminal law knowledge from his years at the Bar to great effect. On his resignation in 1832 he was made a Privy Councillor, a sign of the respect HM Government had for him. He died on 24 September 1840.|$|E

5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the old regime, which required the consent of the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. If an individual is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to Â£5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E
5|$|The justices were {{assisted}} by {{a staff of}} over 50 officials, most of whom sat in Westminster Hall but also kept offices at the various Inns of Court. The Chief Clerk was the Custos Brevium, appointed by the crown, but in practice clerking matters were handled by his deputy, as the office was a royal favour rather than a serious judicial appointment. The crown also appointed the court chirographer, the officer responsible for noting final concords and filing records of fines. Another high-ranking clerk was the Clerk of the Outlawries, an under-clerk of the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>for</b> England and Wales, who was tasked with recording recognizances to protect {{the interests of the}} King in common law matters. In 1541 his position was replaced with the office of Clerk of the King's Process. Other offices created during the reign of Henry VIII include the Clerk of the Recognizances in 1432, who recorded debts secured by recognizances and the office of Receiver of Debts, who was tasked with receiving and recording money coming into the court via debts and fines, and was first appointed in 1536.|$|E

5|$|On July 13, 1995, Cameron County {{officials}} and state authorities traveled to Mexico City to ask Mexican officials to prosecute Puentes PizaÃ±a and Olivarez for Fischer's murder. Thousands of documents were translated from English to Spanish {{and handed over}} to Mexico's <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> <b>for</b> review. On July 15, Mexican officials agreed to prosecute both of them for the murder in an international prosecution court in Mexico City. Texas prosecutors asked the Mexican government to use Article 4 of the Mexican Federal Penal Code, a little-used provision that permits Mexican citizens to be prosecuted in Mexico for crimes they committed outside the country. In order for the provision to take effect, it required the accused to be in Mexican territory; not to have faced justice {{in the country where}} the crime was committed; and that the crime was not only illegal in the country where it was committed, but also in Mexico. Murder in Mexico carries a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison, though it is common for people to be released after 15 to 25 years for good behavior. The Cameron County office said they would use a federal prosecutor from Tamaulipas as the judge. The two accused would be issued an arrest warrant and asked to appear in court where a federal judge would review their case and determine the punishment in a few months. When Puentes PizaÃ±a heard the news, he was surprised and angered by the decision. He maintained his innocence saying he was only a car thief. Olivarez was in custody in a Matamoros prison. On September 20, a Mexican federal judge agreed to prosecute Puentes PizaÃ±a and Olivarez for the murder. Both of them were eventually found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.|$|E
