40|$|Abstract. Interval graphs are {{intersection}} graphs {{of closed}} intervals. A gener-alization of recognition called partial representation extension was introduced recently. The input gives an interval graph with a partial representation speci-fying some pre-drawn intervals. We ask {{whether we can}} <b>add</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> in-tervals and construct an extending representation. Two linear-time algorithms are known for solving this problem. In this paper, we characterize the minimal obstructions which make a par-tial representation non-extendible. This generalizes Lekkerkerker and Boland’s characterization of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs of interval graphs. Each minimal obstruction consists of a forbidden induced subgraph together with at most four pre-drawn intervals. A Helly-type result follows: A partial representation is extendible {{if and only if}} every quadruple of pre-drawn intervals is extendible by itself. Our characterization leads to the first polynomial-time certifying algorithm for partial representation extension. ...|$|E

40|$|Current {{object-oriented}} CASE {{tools are}} useful for recording and gaining insight into OO models. They offer extensive support for especially the analysis and design of object-oriented software. The possibility to generate skeleton code motivates development teams to construct a good design before coding. Developers subsequently <b>add</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> code; CASE tools then offer support for keeping model and code consistent. Extensive possibilities for maintaining models and producing documentation are also provided. Contemporary CASE tools thus provide for more efficient communication within development teams and therefore facilitate overall maintenance. Support for UML is widely spread. This standard offers a notation, not a process: no clues are provided on how to think and work in an object-oriented fashion. CASE tools do not fill this gap; the tools do not help developers decide when to take which steps to create a design. As for creating a good design, tools lack active support for recording and reusing design knowledge and experience. Developers thus still {{have to rely on}} their own instincts to develop good OO designs. This paper describes the results of evaluating four leading OO-CASE tools, based on requirements derived from current object-oriented modeling research and practice...|$|E
40|$|DE 10106553 A UPAB: 20021105 NOVELTY - A fat-reduced, e. g. Frankfurter sausage, is {{prepared}} by employing lean meat with staged reduction process incorporating ice {{and water to}} achieve finest texture. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The production stages are as follows. Mince lean, virtually fat-free meat, and cool down to 0 - 3 deg. C. Comminute (by cutting) about 2 / 3 of the meat, adding spice, seasoning and phosphate and nitrite pickling salt and 250 - 300 g filling per kilo of meat, {{in the form of}} ice, up to 10 - 12 deg. C. <b>Add</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining,</b> previously slightly frozen mince portion, and from about 50 - 70 g filling per kilo of total meat weight in the form of cooled water, in the processor (cutter). There reduce to sausage meat at 13 - 15 deg. C. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a sausage for heating in water, made as described, and containing only 2 - 3 % fat. USE - To make a low fat sausage for water-heating. ADVANTAGE - Use of lean meat and avoidance of fat as an additive reduces fat content of the product. By ice addition, comminution can be prolonged, resulting in a finer sausage meat, which can be emulsified without fat. Water addition together with the remaining meat, confers the required sheen to the meat, also preventing excessive dryness. A tasty, low-fat, e. g. Frankfurter-type sausage results...|$|E

The planned retrieval scenario includes the following steps in AN- 105 : (1) degas the tank using two submerged mixing pumps, (2) turn off the mixer pump(s) and allow any suspended solids to settle, (3) decant the supernatant to the intermediate feed staging tank(s) (IFSTs) (AP- 102 and/or AP- 104) using water/caustic dilution at the transfer pump inlet, (4) <b>add</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> dilution water/caustic to the slurry remaining in AN- 105, (5) mix the tank with the mixer pump(s) until the soluble solids dissolve, (6) turn off the mixer pump(s) and let the insoluble solids settle, and (7) decant the new supernatant to the IFST(s), leaving the insoluble solids behind. Three waste retrieval safety issues are addressed in this report. They are (1) the controlled degassing of AN- 105 to ensure that the headspace remains < 25 % of the lower flammability limit (LFL), (2) an assessment of how dissolved gas (mainly ammonia) released during the transfer of the supernatant in AN- 105 to the IFSTs and the water/caustic dilution of the remaining slurry in AN- 105 will affect the flammability in these tanks; and (3) an assessment of the maximum waste temperatures that might occur in AN- 105 during retrieval operations...|$|E
