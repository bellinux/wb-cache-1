5|$|Beginning to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Bapaume {{may have}} to be {{directly}} attacked, Russell, encouraged by Harper, the commander of IV Corps, began drawing up plans to do so on 29 August, using the 1st Wellington Battalion, of 1st Infantry Brigade. However, it was still hoped that the Germans would withdraw on their own initiative. The bombardment on Bapaume continued into 28 August while 1st Infantry Brigade moved in close to the town on its southern frontage. Particularly heavy barrages were made during the evening and it was noted that the German response was relatively muted and by early in the morning of 29 August, there was no gun fire coming from Bapaume. Overnight, Bapaume had been abandoned, a state of affairs confirmed by patrols of the 3rd Rifle Battalion entering the town from the north. They observed retreating Germans making for Bancourt, to the east. Meanwhile, 2nd Auckland Battalion entered Bapaume from the south. Likewise, the Germans had retreated from Thilloy and the 5th Manchester Battalion, of 42nd Division, moved through the village and secured it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the hearing}} before the Court of Appeal, Yong was allowed to pursue his appeal. The Court was {{of the opinion that}} the initial {{withdrawal}} of the appeal was a nullity as Yong had failed to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he could have proceeded with his appeal on points of law, namely, challenging the compatibility of the mandatory death penalty with Articles 9(1) and 12(1) of the Constitution of Singapore.|$|E
500|$|Actor Daniel Dae Kim {{enjoyed the}} fight scene {{between him and}} guest actor Tony Lee, commenting that [...] "I really <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> 's just a down-and-dirty street fighter. I think his style of {{fighting}} fits his character". He continued [...] "it was great to see a different layer to Sun's character. Because previously {{she had always been}} the good wife, and Jin was the bad husband". Actress Yunjin Kim added that [...] "now we know that 's not what she's been advertised to be for the last two seasons, but actually {{she has a lot of}} secrets." ...|$|E
50|$|The game {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews. Reviewers cited the highly addictive gameplay and good aesthetic. Many reviewers also <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> your in-game NBA player avatar can be female.|$|R

50|$|Nationalism flourished only {{in small}} {{intellectual}} circles. Indeed the intelligentsia repeatedly admonished the working-class for not <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> dissociation from Britain was, according to them, {{the only way}} to improve the situation in Scotland.|$|R
500|$|Glenn was {{an ordained}} elder of the Presbyterian Church. His {{religious}} faith began {{before he became}} an astronaut, and was reinforced after he traveled in space. [...] "To look out at this kind of creation and not believe in God is to me impossible," [...] said Glenn after his second (and final) space voyage. He saw no contradiction between belief in God and the knowledge that evolution is [...] "a fact" [...] and believed [...] evolution should be taught in schools: [...] "I don't see that I'm any less religious that I can <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> science just records that we change with evolution and time, and that's a fact. It doesn't mean it's less wondrous and it doesn't mean that there can't be some power greater {{than any of us}} that has been behind and is behind whatever is going on." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's only main {{character}} {{to have been}} spared harsh criticism, Clair has garnered very positive reviews from critics, by whom she continues to be venerated frequently. Critics and journalists often celebrate the character's [...] "outspoken, womanist views". Blake Green of The Baltimore Sun described the character as [...] "the perfect wife and mother of five who also practiced law and dressed to the nines." [...] Jezebel's Hillary Crosley Coker hailed Clair as a [...] "career-driven matriarch that kicked ass {{at home and at}} work." [...] Writing for Complex, Nikeita Hoyte described Clair as [...] "A hard-ass mom who radiates the beauty of a goddess", while the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "Clair was one big beacon of gorgeous in the Huxtable household." [...] Daisy Dumas of the Daily Mail dubbed Clair an [...] "Indomitable matriarch". AfterEllen.com's Jill Guccini called Clair [...] "divine". Including her on her list of [...] "Diverse TV Ladies That Can Help Young Girls Learn How to Kick Ass", she hailed her relationship with Cliff as [...] "something that young girls—gay or straight—really need to see", while praising her occasional use of Spanish. In a retrospective review of The Cosby Show in 2014, Daily Life writer Ruby Hamad highlighted Clair as the [...] "one thing about the show that is as good now as it was then". In terms of the character's best episodes, Joe Reid of The Atlantic cited Clair's unimpressed reaction to her husband allegedly confusing a cherished memory of her with that of an old love interest in the sixth season episode [...] "Isn't It Romantic?" [...] as a personal favorite, specifically lauding Rashad's pronunciation of [...] "tacky barrette" [...] and [...] "her hairpin turn when Cliff's real gift is revealed that shows that next dimension that always pushed Clair {{to the top of the}} heap." [...] Meanwhile, Kevin O'Keefe, writing for the same publication, selected Clair's enraged monologue to Vanessa in season six's [...] "Off to See the Wretched", followed by the character's dismay upon learning that Sondra has decided not to return to law school, as his favorites, enjoying the way in which Clair adopts an [...] "attack mode" [...] in both circumstances. Reviewing the character's conversation about pregnancy and marriage with Denise in season three's [...] "The Shower", Slates Aisha Harris wrote [...] "written realistically and delivered beautifully by Rashad, the moment attains a level of artistry that spot-on TV lessons rarely reach." [...] When the show aired, both middle and upper-class working women responded well to Clair. However, some few reviewers have occasionally accused the character of being too perfect and one-dimensional, while others found her to be too aggressive, outspoken, lacking in maternity and overly controlling towards both her children and husband. Additionally, some feminist critics did not <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Clair rarely struggles with everyday situations that working mothers typically encounter in real life.|$|E
2500|$|I further add, {{for your}} information, that I {{do not think}} the {{bondholders}} of the Lake Shore <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the bonds covering that portion of the line sold to the [...] Depot Company were not cancelled, but I may be in error regarding this.|$|E
50|$|An {{unstable}} current relationship {{may lead}} people to seek back-up lovers, particularly long-distance relationships.

50|$|Marino later {{admitted}} that he seriously considered the offer from the Vikings, but that he turned it down not because of his arm, but because he wasn't sure that his legs could take another season.

2500|$|In 1897, {{the state}} celebrated its centennial of {{statehood}} (albeit one year late) {{with a great}} exposition in Nashville. The Tennessee Centennial Exposition was the ultimate expression of the Gilded Age in the Upper South—a showcase of industrial technology and exotic papier-mâché versions of the world's wonders. The Nashville Parthenon, a full-scale replica of Athens' Parthenon, was built in plaster, wood and brick. Rebuilt of concrete in the 1920s, it {{remains one of the}} city's attractions. During its six-month run at Centennial Park, the Exposition drew nearly two million visitors to see its dazzling monuments to the South's recovery. Governor Robert Taylor observed, [...] "Some of them who saw our ruined country thirty years ago will certainly <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> we have wrought miracles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Torvalds {{describes}} himself as [...] "completely a-religious—atheist", adding that [...] "I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. I <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> 'Wow, it's incredible {{that something like this}} could have happened in the first place.'" [...] He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in America it has become very politicized. When discussing the issue of church and state separation, Torvalds also said, [...] "Yeah, it's kind of ironic that in many European countries, there is actually a kind of legal binding {{between the state and the}} state religion." ...|$|E
50|$|Rejecting the {{utilitarian}} outlook which separates {{considerations of}} means {{from those of}} ends, and judgments of fact from those of value, and which ignores social relations, conflicts and inequalities between <b>the</b> agents, EAEPE <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> inquiry is value-driven and policy-orientated, and recognises the centrality of participatory democratic processes to the identification and evaluation of real needs.|$|R
5000|$|My mother truly {{acknowledged}} and <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Star Trek fans {{played a}} vital role in keeping the Roddenberry dream alive for the past 42 years.

5000|$|Following a {{suffrage}} meeting held in Hanover Square Rooms in 1870, the Countess Russell {{told her}} son <b>that</b> she <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{his wife had}} not taken part in it. The relief was unwarranted; Viscountess Amberley spoke out at the Mechanics Institute at Stroud on 25 May, prompting Queen Victoria to exclaim that [...] "Lady Amberley ought {{to get a good}} whipping".|$|R
2500|$|GameSpy's Benjamin Turner scored it 2.5 out of 5, writing [...] "The {{designers}} [...] {{attempting to}} create something unique by combining gameplay ideas from platformers, 3D shooters, vehicular action games and even Marble Madness. While the end result doesn't quite gel, I have to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they tried." [...] However, he noted that [...] "rather than excelling, it ends up doing a fairly mediocre job of almost everything." [...] He called the platforming sections [...] "rough around the edges," [...] criticizing the collision detection and level design, and was unimpressed with Haven's mag-ball. He concluded [...] "there's just too much mediocrity and not enough quality. With a ton of tweaking and {{a heavy dose of}} polish this could have been a pretty good game. I get the sense that the creators' hearts were in the right places, but for whatever reason they couldn't execute. Their creation feels unfinished." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive critical reception, {{with many}} critics praising the band for staying true to their usual sound, though others {{have criticized the}} album for being too similar to their previous work. It received a positive review from AllMusic's James Monger, noting that [...] "as thick, smartly-produced, largely inoffensive blasts of generic hard rock go, you {{could do a lot}} worse, and longtime fans will <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Burnley and his new shipmates stay true to the band's unwavering allegiance to all things late-'90s/early-2000s post-grunge/hard rock", but also adding that [...] "it's hard to conceal {{the fact that most of}} these songs are nearly interchangeable with the band's older material." [...] Tom Spinelli at Melodic praised the album as staying true to the sound of their previous material, stating [...] "Overall this album is everything you would expect and more from the band. Breaking Benjamin is one of those bands that shouldn't really change their sound, they don't need to." ...|$|E
60|$|Like {{thousands}} of his Spanish fellow-countrymen, he was constitutionally unable to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> true religion and true faith are the natural fruits of penitence and effort, and that individual repentance and striving {{are the only}} sacrifices required of man.|$|E
60|$|When Ida Mayberry had {{her arms}} {{full of the}} great yellow flowers she {{suddenly}} <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she must be {{a long way from}} the baby, and ought immediately to return to it.

Teddy knew enough to keep his nose out of the music." ...|$|R
6000|$|This latter {{piece of}} advice was not very {{agreeable}} to one whose heart was tender, and his desire to engage in works of active benevolence very strong. But feeling that the advice was good, and thoroughly <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> having shipped as a [...] "suppernummerary hand," [...] he was bound to obey his young commander, he went on deck without remonstrance, walked aft to the binnacle, and began to fill his pipe.|$|R

60|$|Section 145. We {{are now in}} a {{position}} to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the old and more popularly know division of animals into vertebrata and invertebrata scarcely represents the facts of the case, that the primary division should be into protozoa and metazoa, and that the vertebrata are one of several groups of metazoa with a fundamental bilateral symmetry and imperfect metameric segmentation.|$|E
60|$|To all {{of these}} and a {{multitude}} of other questions Charlie Considine replied with great readiness and good-humour, {{as far as his}} knowledge enabled him, for he began quickly to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> these isolated farmers, who almost never saw a newspaper were thirsting for information as to the world in general as well as with regard to himself in particular.|$|E
40|$|The {{book does}} not merely give a polite nod to non-Western voices by {{including}} a few simplistic vignettes, since a good third {{is devoted to}} thoughtful reflection by international authors who do not underplay their differences. This re­viewer particularly <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> two Indian authors were invited to provide somewhat divergent perspectives, thereby helping to dispel the patronizing assumption sometimes found in philosophical circles that moral pluralism is the privilege (or the curse) of the West...|$|R
5000|$|In {{spite of}} the strong {{on-screen}} chemistry between Gere and Winger, the actors didn't get along during filming. Publicly, she called him a [...] "brick wall" [...] while he admitted there was [...] "tension" [...] between them. Thirty years later, Gere was complimentary towards Winger {{when he said that}} she was much more open to the camera than he was, and he <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she presented him with an award at the Rome Film Festival.|$|R
40|$|In a brief {{commentary}} on Radosław Rychcik's Forefathers' Eve (Nowy Theater in Poznań, premiere: 23. 03. 2014), Kwaśniewska {{states that the}} director has managed to read Mickiewicz's work {{in the context of}} colonialism. <b>The</b> author <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> in forging compelling analogies between the Polish partition period (as well as the People's Republic) and American slavery, the director avoids universalizing, indicating a potential conflict between the victims of colonialism.

6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Lady Hammergallow, {{throwing}} {{her head back}} and speaking with deliberate indignation, as she rustled forward, [...] "if you cannot play with Mr Wilmerdings I am afraid I cannot ask you to play again." [...] She made it sound like an ultimatum. Her glasses in her hand quivered violently with indignation. The Angel was now human enough to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he was crushed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't ever doubt {{your good}} fortune," [...] he said earnestly. [...] "The longer I live--and in my limited way I do see {{a good deal}} of life--the more I <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there isn't {{anything}} in this world that compares with the power of money.

Mr. Coulson, {{although}} he did not call himself a lady's man, was nevertheless human enough to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the young lady's face was piquant and her smile delightful. She was dressed with quiet but elegant simplicity. The perfume of the violets at her waistband seemed to remind him of his return to civilization.|$|E
60|$|While the German {{received}} this notification with his accustomed stolid air of indifference, his American friends were all grieved at his transfer. They knew the prison {{would be very}} uncomfortable for the invalid and feared he was not yet sufficiently recovered {{to be able to}} bear the new conditions imposed upon him. There was no thought of protesting the order, however, for they <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> commandant had been especially lenient in leaving the prisoner so long in their care.|$|R
60|$|There was a settle {{close behind}} her, {{and on to}} this she sank, and bending her head she opened the {{floodgates}} of her passionate little soul, and let the rage that had so long possessed her dissolve in tears. At sight of that sudden change of front La Boulaye stamped his foot. He <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{she was about to}} fight him with weapons that on a previous occasion--when, however, it is true, they were wielded by another--had accomplished his undoing.|$|R
50|$|Although Kay {{makes her}} heroines accept love {{for its own}} sake as an {{unconditional}} emotion, the result is not humiliation but empowerment as the men reciprocate with sensitivity and depth. Here, Kay <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> emotive words don't come easily to most men. Therefore, in Timber Boss (1978), and in Bitter Alliance (1978) after women have made their confessions of love, men contribute to it with cryptic but pregnant remarks such as there is no going back and don’t say anymore to seal their relationship.|$|R
