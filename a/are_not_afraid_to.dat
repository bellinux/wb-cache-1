In June 2006, the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology published the results of a telephone survey of 2004. It found that 36% of Americans ages 18–29, 24% of those 30–40, and 15% of those 41–51 had a tattoo. In September 2006, the Pew Research Center conducted a telephone survey that found that 36% of Americans ages 18–25, 40% of those 26–40 and 10% of those 41–64 had a tattoo. They concluded that Generation X and Generation Y <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> express themselves through their appearance, and tattoos are the most popular form of self-expression. In January 2008, a survey conducted online by Harris Interactive estimated that 14% of all adults in the United States have a tattoo, slightly down from 2003, when 16% had a tattoo. Among age groups, 9% of those ages 18–24, 32% of those 25–29, 25% of those 30–39 and 12% of those 40–49 have tattoos, as do 8% of those 50–64. Men are slightly {{more likely to have a}} tattoo than women.|$|E
500|$|Milian {{wrote the}} hip-hop ballad [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] about [...] "thinking that I had {{something}} good, {{what happens when}} it's over, and going forward with my life." [...] The track {{was one of the}} final songs that Milian wrote about the break-up as it [...] "helped me get it all out". While the record is about a break-up, it focuses more on closure and moving past it. Milian and Cool & Dre used the melody of the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony song [...] "Tha Crossroads" [...] and changed the lyrics [...] "and I'm gonna miss everybody" [...] to [...] "and I'm gonna tell everybody". The other song, [...] "Who's Gonna Ride", has a more street and gangster vibe, and contain more raw lyrics. Milian wrote the track with Dre, which she said helped because hip hop artists write about real things in their lives and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> say anything. While writing the track, Milian let her guard down and wrote what she was feeling and tried to be real. Lyrically, the song also deals with [...] "the girls that come around and try to take your man. Or the groupie girls that are around, paying attention to the guys on TV that only hang out with them for those reasons." [...] Milian also said [...] "Who's Gonna Ride" [...] was the hardest song to write because it was not safe, unlike previous songs she had written. The singer explained writing the lyrics was not hard, but the difficulty came from being real and actually writing about her true feelings. When writing the lyrics, Milian removed several lines that she thought were too harsh.|$|E

A plaque on her house in Wrzeszcz, a borough of Gdańsk, has recently been dedicated and the city of Gdynia named an intersection after her. Michael Szporer, Professor of Communications at University of Maryland wrote about her: [...] "Her life was very much like Poland's, never nothing, but if you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> speak up for yourself and care for others, just look what you can become, Pani Ania, a worthier role model than most, because an honest one.

2500|$|His {{approach}} to modern knowledge is also seen in sectarian Orthodox Judaism, where {{the skills and}} technical knowledge of modernity are encouraged, but the values rejected. Bhaktivedanta Swami stated [...] "devotees should not be lazy, idle...we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> work. Whatever our engagement is, by offering the result to Krishna we become Krishna conscious". Some of his representations are believed to affect women adversely and are male-centred, others are tender and celebratory. Bhaktivedanta Swami himself taught a dualism of body and soul {{and that of the}} genders. Similar to many traditional religions he considered sexuality and spirituality as conflicting opposites. Among some liberal male followers there is a positive recognition of his example in applying the spirit of the law according to time, place, person and circumstance, rather than literal tracing of the tradition.|$|E
2500|$|Staten Island {{participated in}} the 1892 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) tournament with the Lorillard, Manhattan, and New York clubs. There were {{allegations}} of professionalism and the importation of ineligible Canadian [...] by those three teams, and Staten Island played only under protest. Miller was critical of the New York club in particular:"When a club deliberately imports six or eight {{of the best players}} in Canada, feeds them like fighting cocks, keeps them with nothing to do from one week's end to another but play lacrosse, and then plays them against a team composed of business men who don't get a chance to practice more than three or four hours a week, I think it's about time to stop it ... Although we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> take a beating from a Canadian team as such, we don't care to be beaten by Canadians and have a New York club get the credit of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Livni led the Israeli {{negotiation}} team in {{the peace}} talks, brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Middle East envoy Martin Indyk from July 2013 until April 2014. Upon announcing the resumption of talks between Israel and the Palestinians {{at a press conference}} delivered at the U.S. State Department, Livni criticized the [...] "cynicism and pessimism" [...] surrounding Israeli–Palestinian peace process, and expressed hope that the negotiators would do everything in their power to transform a [...] "spark of hope into something real and lasting." [...] In concluding remarks praised for their poignancy, she said, [...] "I believe that history is not made by cynics. It is made by realists who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> dream. And let us be these people." [...] The process collapsed in April 2014 when internal political difficulties prevented Israel from releasing a promised fourth tranche of pre-Oslo prisoners and the Palestinians reacted by acceding to several international treaties. Indyk cited Israel's settlement policy during the talks as a critical factor leading to the collapse.|$|E
