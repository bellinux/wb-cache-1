5|$|Nominate T. merula may {{commence}} breeding in March, but {{eastern and}} Indian races are <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> later, and the introduced New Zealand birds start nesting in August (late winter). The breeding pair prospect for a suitable nest site in a creeper or bush, favouring evergreen or thorny {{species such as}} ivy, holly, hawthorn, honeysuckle or pyracantha. Sometimes the birds will nest in sheds or outbuildings where a ledge or cavity is used. The cup-shaped nest is made with grasses, leaves and other vegetation, bound together with mud. It is built by the female alone. She lays three to five (usually four) bluish-green eggs marked with reddish-brown blotches, heaviest at the larger end; the eggs of nominate T. merula are 2.9×2.1centimetres (1.14×0.93in) in size and weigh 7.2grammes (0.25oz), of which 6% is shell. Eggs of birds of the southern Indian races are paler than those from the northern subcontinent and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E

5|$|In the spring, mature birds {{return to}} land, usually to the colony {{at which they}} were hatched. Birds that were removed as chicks and {{released}} elsewhere were found to show fidelity to their point of liberation. They congregate {{for a few days}} on the sea in small groups offshore before returning to the cliff top nesting sites. Each large puffin colony is subdivided into sub-colonies by physical boundaries such as stands of bracken or gorse. Early arrivals take control of the best locations, the most desirable nesting sites being the densely packed burrows on grassy slopes just above the cliff edge where take-off is most easily accomplished. The birds are usually monogamous, but this is the result of their fidelity to their nesting sites rather than to their mates and they often return to the same burrows year after year. Later arrivals at the colony may find that all the best nesting sites have already been taken and be pushed towards the periphery where they are in greater danger of predation. Younger birds may come ashore <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> after the mature birds and find no remaining nesting sites. They will not breed till the following year although it has been found that if the ground cover surrounding the colony is cut back before these sub-adults arrive, the number of successfully nesting pairs may be increased.|$|E

2500|$|Sloths are {{classified}} as folivores, as {{the bulk of their}} diets consist of buds, tender shoots, and leaves, mainly of Cecropia trees. Some two-toed sloths have been documented as eating insects, small reptiles, and birds as a small supplement to their diets. Linnaeus's two-toed sloth has recently been documented eating human faeces from open latrines. They have made extraordinary adaptations to an arboreal browsing lifestyle. Leaves, their main food source, provide very little energy or nutrients, and do not digest easily. Sloths, therefore, have large, specialized, slow-acting stomachs with multiple compartments in which symbiotic bacteria break down the tough leaves. Sloths have the unique ability to protrude their tongues from their mouths , an ability that is useful for collecting leaves just out of reach.

2500|$|Chronic {{headache}}, {{or chronic}} daily headache (CDH), {{is classified as}} experiencing fifteen or more days with a headache per month. It is estimated that chronic headaches affect [...] "4% to 5% of the general population". Chronic headaches consist of different sub-groups, primarily categorized as chronic tension-type headaches and chronic migraine headaches. The treatments for chronic headache are vast and varied. Medicinal and non-medicinal methods exist to help patients cope with chronic headache, because chronic headaches cannot be cured. Whether pharmacological or not, treatment plans are often created on an individual basis. Multiple sources recommend multimodal treatment, which {{is a combination of}} medicinal and non-medicinal remedies. The long term use of opioids; however, appears to result in greater harm than benefit. Also, abortive medications can be used to [...] "stop a headache once it has begun"; such drugs include ergotamine (Cafergot), triptans (Imitrex), and prednisone (Deltasone). However, medical professionals advise that abuse of analgesics and abortive medications can actually lead to an increase in headaches. The painkiller medicines help headaches temporarily, but as the [...] "quick fix" [...] wears off, headaches become more re-current and grow in intensity. These [...] "rebound headaches" [...] can actually make the body less responsive to preventive medication. The conditions keep worsening if one takes paracetamol, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 15 days <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> Therefore, analgesic and abortive medications are often advised for headaches that are not chronic in nature.|$|E

Newly-purchased vehicles typically drive around for <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> with nothing but a dealer's advertisement or logo on a paper plate insert where the license plate would go; some drivers keep this and some remove it. This makes the new vehicle essentially [...] "untraceable," [...] both by plain visual observation by persons, and by automated means such as license-plate reading systems, red light cameras, and automatic number plate recognition. This {{has led to an}} epidemic of drivers of newly-purchased vehicles cheating tolls on bridges and toll roads where a transponder system is used instead of toll booths, causing the state to lose $15–19 million per year. Because of this, new state legislation was adopted in 2016 that will require temporary license plates in California beginning in 2019. This law was inspired by the hit-and-run death of a pedestrian who was struck by a car with dealer paper inserts: because it had no temporary plates, it was impossible to trace the suspect. California's lack of a temporary plate requirement has been jokingly known as the [...] "Steve Jobs loophole" [...] due to the former Apple CEO's habit of keeping rolling six-month leases on a series of Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMGs specifically to avoid having to put license plates on the cars.

Recent studies indicate that biodosimetry estimates from single spaceflights lie within the range expected from physical dosimetry and biophysical models, but very large uncertainties are associated with single individual measurements and the total sample population remains low. Retrospective doses may be more difficult to estimate because of the fairly rapid time-dependent loss of "stable" aberrations in blood lymphocytes. Also, biodosimetry estimates from individuals who participate in multiple missions, or very long (interplanetary) missions, may be complicated by an adaptive response to space radiation and/or changes in lymphocyte survival and repopulation.
