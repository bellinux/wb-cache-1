40|$|The physics which control <b>aircraft</b> <b>ice</b> <b>accretion</b> are {{reviewed}} {{in the context}} of identifying and forecasting hazardous icing conditions. The severity of aircraft icing is found to be extremely sensitive to temperature, liquid water content and droplet size distribution particularly near the transition between rime and mixed icing. The difficulty in measurement and the variability of these factors with altitude, position and time coupled with variable aircraft sensitivity make forecasting and identifying icing conditions difficult. Automated Pilot Reports (PIREPS) are suggested as one mechanism for improving the data base necessary to forecast icing conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} signal {{processing}} algorithms were developed for analyzing ultrasonic signals {{used to measure}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>ice</b> <b>accretion</b> in flight. A high speed digital signal acquisition system was designed and constructed to acquire the signals. The ultrasonic signals were acquired during a series of flight tests in actual icing conditions. This digital data {{was used to evaluate}} various algorithms for determining the ice thickness. An analog data acquisition system provided data for comparison with the digital data. A gated peak detector, employing low signal to noise ratio filtering and derivative preprocessing, was developed. This algorithm correctly determined the ice thickness for all tested flight data. Icing rate algorithms were also developed. The measured icing rate correlated reasonable well with the liquid water content of the cloud. May 1986 Also issued as an M.

" This version of record is available online at: [URL] ?? Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2016 Published byEmerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose ??? The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a new technique based on the combination of wavelet packet transform (WPT) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting the ice accretion on the surface of an airfoil. Design/methodology/approach ??? Wavelet packet decomposition is used to reduce the number of input vectors to ANN and to improve the training convergence. An ANN is developed with five variables (velocity, temperature, liquid water content, median volumetric diameter and exposure time) taken as input data and one dependent variable (the decomposed ice shape) given as the output. For the purpose of comparison, three different ANNs, back-propagation network (BP), radial basis function network (RBF) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN), are trained to simulate the wavelet packet coefficients as a function of the in-flight icing conditions. Findings ??? The predicted ice accretion shapes are compared with the corresponding results from previously published NASA experimentation, LEWICE and the Fourier-expansion-based method. It is found that the BP network has an advantage on predicting the rime ice, and the RBF network is relatively suitable for the glaze ice, while the GRNN can be applied for both without classifying the specimens. Results also show an advantage of WPT in performing the analysis of ice accretion information and the prediction accuracy is improved as well. Practical implications ??? The proposed method is open to further improvement and investment due to its small computational resource requirement and efficient performance. Originality/value ??? The simulation method combining ANN and WPT outlined here can lay the foundation for further research relating to ice accretion prediction under different ice cloud conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{comparison}} of <b>ice</b> <b>accretion</b> characteristics {{is an integral}} part of <b>aircraft</b> <b>icing</b> research. It is often necessary to compare an <b>ice</b> <b>accretion</b> obtained from a flight test or numerical simulation to one produced in an icing wind tunnel or for validation of an icing scaling method.

40|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>icing</b> {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as a significant hazard to aircraft operations in cold weather. When an aircraft or rotorcraft fly in a cold climate, some of the super-cooled water droplets would impact and freeze on the exposed aircraft surfaces to form ice shapes, which can degrade the aerodynamic performance of an airplane significantly by decreasing lift while increasing drag, and even lead to the aircraft crash. In the present study, a series of experimental investigations were conducted to investigate dynamics and thermodynamics of in-flight and impinging water droplets in order to elucidate the underlying physics of the important microphysical process pertinent to <b>aircraft</b> <b>icing</b> phenomena. A novel lifetime-based molecular tagging thermometry technique (MTT) is developed to achieve simultaneous measurements of droplet size, flying velocity and transient temperature of in-flight water droplets to characterize the dynamic and thermodynamic behaviors of the micro-sized in-flight droplets pertinent to <b>aircraft</b> <b>icing</b> phenomena. By using high-speed imaging and infrared thermal imaging techniques, a comprehensive experimental {{study was conducted to}} quantify the unsteady heat transfer and phase changing processes as water droplets impinging onto frozen cold surfaces under different test conditions (i. e., with different Weber numbers, Reynolds numbers, and impact angles of the impinging droplets, different temperature, hydrophobicity and roughness of the test plates) to simulate the scenario of super-cooled water droplets impinging onto the frozen cold wing surfaces. A novel digital image projector (DIP) technique was also developed to achieve time-resolved film thickness measurements to quantify the dynamic impinging process of water droplets (i. e., droplet impact, rebounding, splashing and freezing process). An impact droplet maximum spreading diameter model and a damped harmonic oscillator model was proposed based on precise measurement of the impact droplet 3 D shape. A better understanding of the important micro physical processes pertinent to <b>aircraft</b> <b>icing</b> phenomena would lead to better <b>ice</b> <b>accretion</b> models for more accurate prediction of <b>ice</b> formation and <b>accretion</b> on aircraft wings as well as develop more effective and robust anti-/de-icing strategies for safer and more efficient operation of aircraft in cold weather...|$|R
