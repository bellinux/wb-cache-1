Kahn, a {{critic for the}} Wilmington Morning Star, called the episode's writing and acting [...] "anything but hackneyed" [...] and stated, [...] "One safe prediction, Seinfeld will be here for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>long</b> run this time around (referring to how its first season only had five episodes)." [...] Joyce Millman of Salon.com stated that she disliked Seinfelds pilot episode, but after seeing a scene from [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] in which Jerry and Kramer discuss returning fruit, she was [...] "awed by Seinfeld and co-creator/writer Larry David's brilliant grasp of, A) working-class Jewish craziness, and, B) the absurd humor of the deeply mundane." ...|$|E
500|$|A common {{criticism}} amongst many reviewers {{was that}} in spite of its title, no connection is made between Fermat's Last Theorem and the alien invasion. Alex Kasman at Mathematical Fiction complained about errors in some of the author's descriptions of the mathematical problems, and in particular their unfair treatment of Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Some reviewers felt that the characters had not been developed sufficiently. Michael Sims of The Washington Post said that [...] "these characters are so thin you can see through them." [...] The aliens are depicted as cartoon-like figures, and Ranjit {{does not appear to be}} affected by his lengthy incarceration, interrogation and torture. Some critics also felt that the book ended [...] "somewhat precipitously", that after the aliens arrived, the crisis was resolved too quickly, giving the impression [...] "that there was at least <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> <b>long</b> chapter missing." ...|$|E
500|$|The imposed {{regimen of}} asylum life gave van Gogh a hard-won stability: [...] "I feel happier {{here with my}} work than I could be outside. By staying here <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>long</b> time, I shall have learned regular habits {{and in the long}} run the result will be more order in my life." [...] While his time at Saint-Rémy forced him to manage his vices, such as coffee, alcohol, poor eating habits and {{periodic}} attempts to consume turpentine and paint, his stay was not ideal. [...] He needed to obtain permission to leave the asylum grounds. The food was poor; he generally ate only bread and soup. [...] His only apparent form of treatment were two-hour baths twice a week. During his year there, van Gogh had periodic attacks, possibly due to a form of epilepsy. By early 1890, when the attacks worsened, he concluded that his stay at the asylum was not helping him to recover, which led him to move to Auvers-sur-Oise just north of Paris in May 1890.|$|E

500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} to the season. During its 1991 Program awards, Entertainment Weekly, ranked Seinfeld {{second place in}} the [...] "Program of the year" [...] category, behind Roseanne. Joseph P. Kahn, a critic for the Wilmington Morning Star, praised the writing and acting of the season premiere and stated, [...] "One safe prediction, Seinfeld will be here for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>long</b> run this time around." [...] Writing for The Spokesman-Review, critic Jon Burlingame stated that [...] "Seinfeld is an offbeat take on the standard sitcom concept. While rarely hilarious, it's often smart and amusing." [...] Dave Kehr of The New York Times felt that [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was a turning point for the show, noting that after the first few episodes, the show [...] "turn into something sharp and distinctive [...] Here, suddenly, is the tight knot of guilt and denial, of hypersensitivity and sarcastic contempt that Seinfeld would explore for the next eight years." [...] Despite the critical acclaim for the season and several of its episodes, two of the season's episodes, [...] "The Busboy" [...] and [...] "The Baby Shower", were named to a list of Seinfelds [...] "Not-so-top episodes", compiled by the New York Daily News.|$|E
500|$|The next concept, Dark Camelot, still {{focused on}} sword combat. Its plot—an {{inversion}} of Arthurian legend—featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath. According to Church, the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred's [...] "sort of good" [...] advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred {{to break into}} Camelot and steal the Holy Grail. The game's design combined a first-person perspective with action, role-playing and adventure elements. Warren Spector, who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin, became Dark Camelots producer after his predecessor departed. Artist Dan Thron said: [...] "For <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>long</b> time, {{we had no idea}} what the game was about, until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you're not just running out trying to chop people up." [...] Church recalled that [...] "the basic stealth model was [...] having the guard looking the other way and you going past pretty quickly. So Paul [...] had been pushing for a while that the thief side of it was the really interesting part and why not you just do a thief game." [...] A previously unreleased trailer for [...] Dark Camelot and its Stargate Engine was uploaded to YouTube in 2013.|$|E

A writer of Rap-Up described {{the show as}} a [...] "triumphant" [...] return to the stage. Adelle Platon of Vibe magazine described the show as post-pregnancy comeback to the stage and added that [...] "it was her amazing set of throwbacks that cemented the fact that Bey still runs the game." [...] The Village Voices Maura Johnston wrote that the Revel concerts showed how serious Beyoncé was about picking up her career exactly where she'd left it pre-maternity leave. Melinda Newman of the website HitFix praised Beyoncé's [...] "incredible" [...] performance even after {{she gave birth to}} her first child. Cathy Rainone of WVIT commented that Beyoncé was [...] "fiercer than ever" [...] during the shows. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday described it as her [...] "most ambitious live show yet" [...] and noted that [...] "the reason for the shows... was to test herself, as a new mother and an artist." [...] USA Todays Elysa Gardner praised the show, saying that [...] "The singer was all business — that is to say, warm and gracious, glamorous and relentless. Backed by an all-female band and a tireless posse of dancers and backup vocalists, Beyonce reasserted her unique pop persona; she was at once angel and seductress, cool diva and woman of the people." [...] She noted that with the performance of the concerts, Beyoncé reaffirmed [...] "her solidarity with all her fans" [...] and confirmed that she plans on [...] "sticking around for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>long</b> time." ...|$|E

He underwent physeptone treatment in a British program, returned to New York and was hospitalized there, and then finally committed himself to the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, which emphasized cultural and historical factors in trying to treat difficult psychiatric disorders. Meanwhile, Apple released his debut album, James Taylor, in December 1968 in the UK and February 1969 in the US. Critical reception was generally positive, including a complimentary Jon Landau review in Rolling Stone who said that [...] "this album is the coolest {{breath of fresh air}} I've inhaled in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>long</b> while.

[...] The record's commercial potential suffered from Taylor's inability to promote it because of his hospitalization, and it sold poorly; [...] "Carolina in My Mind" [...] was released as a single but failed to chart in the UK and only reached #118 on the U.S. charts.|$|E
