5|$|Although Islam is the {{official}} religion of the federation, Sarawak has no official state religion. However, during the chieftainship of Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, the Constitution of Sarawak was amended to make the Yang di-Pertuan Agong {{as the head of}} Islam in Sarawak and empower the state assembly to pass laws regarding Islamic affairs. With such provisions, Islamic policies can be formulated in Sarawak and the establishment of Islamic state agencies is possible. The 1978 Majlis Islam Bill enabled the setting up of Syariah Courts in Sarawak with jurisdictions over matrimonial, child custody, betrothal, inheritance, and criminal cases in the state. <b>An</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>court</b> and Courts of Kadi were also formed.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{object of}} this Article {{is to demonstrate}} that Islamic law, like any system of law, is dynamic rather than static. Islamic law cannot {{be thought of as}} law disconnected from history and society. Like any other legal system, it is influenced by political, economic and social factors. In order to illustrate this idea, this Article takes as a case study the rulings concerning custody of the Shari 2 ̆ 7 <b>a</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>Court</b> in Israel. This Article surveys the rulings of the Shari 2 ̆ 7 <b>a</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>Court</b> addressing child custody from 1992 through 2001. This Article 2 ̆ 7 s central claim is that the <b>Appeals</b> <b>Court</b> 2 ̆ 7 s approach to child custody underwent a metamorphosis during that period. In Part I, I will analyze the essential features of this transition. This will require an examination of classical Islamic law 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of custody, specifically the Hanafi school 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of it. I will focus on the new interpretation that the Shari 2 ̆ 7 <b>a</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>Court</b> gave to custody. In Part II, I will offer an explanation for this transition...|$|R
