5|$|Woods' and Nordegren's first child, a {{daughter}} named Sam Alexis Woods, {{was born in}} 2007. Woods chose the name because his own father had <b>always</b> <b>called</b> him Sam. Their son, Charlie Axel Woods, was born in 2009.|$|E
5|$|George Alan Vasey {{was born}} in Malvern East, Victoria on 29 March 1895, the third of six {{children}} of George Brinsden Vasey, a barrister and solicitor, and his wife Alice Isabel, née McCutcheon. Because his father was also George Vasey, George Alan Vasey's family <b>always</b> <b>called</b> him Alan. He was educated at Camberwell Grammar School and Wesley College, Melbourne, where his schoolmates included Robert Menzies and Edward James Milford. At Wesley, Vasey served in the Australian Army Cadets, in which he became a second lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|In Melbourne, Blamey met Minnie Millard, the {{daughter}} of a Toorak stockbroker who was involved in the Methodist Church there. They were married at her home on 8 September 1909. His first child was born on 29 June 1910, and named Charles Middleton after a friend of Blamey's who had died in a shooting accident; but the boy was <b>always</b> <b>called</b> Dolf by his family. A second child, a boy named Thomas, was born four years later.|$|E

5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (<b>always</b> <b>called</b> 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E
5|$|Shepard was {{diagnosed}} with leukemia in 1996, and died from complications of the disease in Pebble Beach, California, on July 21, 1998. He was the second astronaut who had walked on the Moon to die, Jim Irwin being the first in 1991. His widow Louise resolved to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes, but she died {{from a heart attack}} five weeks later on August 25, 1998, at 17:00, the time at which Shepard had <b>always</b> <b>called</b> her. They had been married for 53 years. The family decided to cremate them both, and their ashes were scattered together by a Navy helicopter over Stillwater Cove, in front of their Pebble Beach home.|$|E

He believed in equality of opportunity rather than of outcome, and wrote that his ideal was “to see that men had an equal chance to make themselves unequal”.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{segments}} in an antenna varies considerably amongst insects, with higher flies having only 3-6 segments, while adult cockroaches can have over 140. The general {{shape of the}} antennae is also quite variable, but the first segment (the one attached to the head) is <b>always</b> <b>called</b> the scape, and the second segment is called the pedicel. The remaining antennal segments or flagellomeres are called the flagellum.|$|E
25|$|Norris quickly {{cleared away}} the debt {{left over from}} past years and gave the Red Wings the {{financial}} backing they needed {{to become one of}} the most powerful teams in the NHL.

25|$|An oast, oast {{house or}} hop kiln is a {{building}} designed for kilning (drying) hops {{as part of}} the brewing process. They can be found in most hop-growing (and former hop-growing) areas and are often good examples of vernacular architecture. Many redundant oasts have been converted into houses. The names oast and oast house are used interchangeably in Kent and East Sussex. In Surrey, Hampshire, Hereford and Worcester they are <b>always</b> <b>called</b> hop kilns.|$|E
25|$|We AAs {{have never}} called {{alcoholism}} a disease because, technically speaking, {{it is not}} a disease entity. For example, {{there is no such thing}} as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have <b>always</b> <b>called</b> it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.|$|E
25|$|In {{recollections}} {{long after}} the frontiers closed, writers such as Wyatt Earp and E.C. Abbott referred to honky-tonks in the cowtowns of Kansas, Nebraska, and Montana in the 1870s and 1880s. Their recollections contain lurid accounts {{of the women and}} violence accompanying the shows. However, in contemporary accounts these were nearly <b>always</b> <b>called</b> hurdy-gurdy shows, possibly derived from the term hurdy-gurdy, which was sometimes mistakenly applied to a small, portable barrel organ that was frequently played by organ grinders and buskers.|$|E

25|$|The {{sequence}} of possible Game Values through 60, beginning with 18 is 18—20—22—23—24—27—30—33—35—36—40—44—45—46—48—50—54—55—59—60 (higher bids are possible albeit rare {{in a competitive}} auction). Among German players the values representing Null games, especially 23, the most common one, are often replaced by the call “Null”. Also, numbers are frequently abbreviated by only calling the lower digit of a value not divisible by 10 (e.g. “two” instead of “twenty-two” or “five” instead of “forty-five”); this is unambiguous if values are <b>always</b> <b>called</b> out in order and intermediate values never skipped, as is the custom.|$|E
25|$|Jennie Jerome {{was born}} in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn in 1854, the second of four daughters (one died in childhood) of financier, sportsman, and {{speculator}} Leonard Jerome and his wife Clarissa (<b>always</b> <b>called</b> Clara), daughter of Ambrose Hall, a landowner. She was raised in Brooklyn, Paris, and New York City. She had two surviving sisters, Clarita (18511935) and Leonie (born 1859). Another sister, Camille (1855-1863) died when Jennie was nine. Leonard Jerome was rumoured to also be the father of the American opera singer Minnie Hauk.|$|E
25|$|Greece is {{the birthplace}} of the ancient Olympic Games, first {{recorded}} in 776 BC in Olympia, and hosted the modern Olympic Games twice, the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics and the 2004 Summer Olympics. During the parade of nations Greece is <b>always</b> <b>called</b> first, as the founding nation of the ancient precursor of modern Olympics. The nation has competed at every Summer Olympic Games, one of only four countries to have done so. Having won a total of 110 medals (30 gold, 42 silver and 38 bronze), Greece is ranked 32nd by gold medals in the all-time Summer Olympic medal count. Their best ever performance was in the 1896 Summer Olympics, when Greece finished second in the medal table with 10 gold medals.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{indigenous}} {{group in}} the state are the Zapotecs at about 350,000 people or about 31% of the total indigenous population. The Zapotec have an extremely long history in the Central Valleys region and unlike other indigenous groups, {{do not have a}} migration story. For them, they have always been here. Zapotecs have <b>always</b> <b>called</b> themselves Be'ena'a, which means The People. Zapotec territory extends in and around the Central Valleys region of the state, around the capital city of Oaxaca. The Zapotec language has historically been and is still the most widely spoken in the state, with four dialects that correspond to the four subdivisions of these people: Central Valleys and Isthmus, the Sierra de Ixtlan, Villa Alta and Coapan. Zapotec communities can be found in 67 municipalities. The various Zapotec dialects account for 64 of the total 173 still surviving forms of Oto-Manguean.|$|E
25|$|Law {{was born}} on 16 September 1858 in Kingston (now Rexton), New Brunswick, to Eliza Kidston Law and the Reverend James Law, a {{minister}} of the Free Church of Scotland with Scottish and Irish (mainly Ulster Scots) ancestry. From {{the perspective of the}} time, Law was not born in Canada, as New Brunswick was then a separate colony, and Canadian confederation did not occur until 1867. His mother originally wanted to name him after Robert Murray M'Cheyne, a preacher she greatly admired, but as his older brother was already called Robert he was instead named after the Reverend Andrew Bonar, a biographer of M'Cheyne. Throughout his life he was <b>always</b> <b>called</b> Bonar (rhyming with honour) by his family and close friends, never Andrew. He originally signed his name as A.B. Law, changing to A. Bonar Law in his thirties, and he was referred to as Bonar Law by the public as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, the New York Yankees {{made the}} World Series for the 15th time in 18 years – however Mel Allen was not there. In September of that year, {{before the end}} of the season, the Yankees {{informed}} Allen that his contract with the team would not be renewed. As been frequently mentioned, in those days, the main announcers for the Series participants <b>always</b> <b>called</b> the World Series on NBC. Although Allen was therefore technically eligible to call the Series, Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick honored the Yankees' request to have Phil Rizzuto join the Series crew instead. It was the first time Allen had missed a World Series for which the Yankees were eligible since 1943, and only the second World Series (not counting those missed during World War II) that he had missed since he began calling baseball games in 1938. On December 17, after much media speculation and many letters to the Yankees from fans disgruntled at Allen's absence from the Series, the Yankees issued a terse press release announcing Allen's firing; he was replaced by Joe Garagiola. NBC and Movietone dropped him soon afterward. To this day, the Yankees have never given an explanation for Allen's sudden firing, and rumors abounded. Depending on the rumor, Allen was either homosexual, an alcoholic, a drug addict or had a nervous breakdown. Allen's sexuality was sometimes a target in those more conservative days because he had not married (and never did). Years later, Allen told author Curt Smith that the Yankees had fired him under pressure from the team's longtime sponsor, Ballantine Beer. According to Allen, he was fired as a cost-cutting move by Ballantine, which had been experiencing poor sales for years (it would eventually be sold in 1969). Smith, in his book Voices of Summer, also indicated that the medications Allen took in order to maintain his busy schedule may have affected his on-air performance (Stephen Borelli, another biographer, has also pointed out that Allen's heavy workload did not allow him time to take care of his health).|$|E
