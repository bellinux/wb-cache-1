25|$|Finally, Jude Law {{arrived at}} the very end of shooting, on 2 April, to film the Imaginarium ladders sequence, which now {{required}} more dialogue than originally planned; a key scene in the Imaginarium wagon between Tony and the rest of the cast had been reserved for the Vancouver interior shooting, and so all of the dialogue (and, thus, narrative role of that scene) had to be funnelled into a conversation between Law and Andrew Garfield's characters in the Imaginarium. This conversation proved to be the last sequence shot for the film, and involved a set completely improvised, on the day, to look like the ground at Battersea; they did not have the budget for <b>anything</b> <b>better,</b> but the production crew came away quite impressed at how well it worked.|$|E

[...] This is an allusion to the poet Homer, who was also captivated with the nature versus nurture debate.

500|$|Bohr {{read the}} 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in The Making of the Atomic Bomb that Bohr was {{influenced}} by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's Stages on Life's Way as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, [...] "It {{is the only thing}} I have to send home; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find <b>anything</b> <b>better...</b> I even think {{it is one of the}} most delightful things I have ever read." [...] Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard's philosophy. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.|$|E

[...] While Volk began the 1978 season as a starter, he was replaced by Charlie Babb for the final four games. [...] After the Dolphins lost the AFC wildcard game to the Oilers, Volk announced his retirement. Volk told reporters he had wanted to end his career with a championship team and added, [...] "When the game's over, you can't worry about it. [...] For most of the guys, there'll be another season.

500|$|To Stanford's regret, many of {{his pupils}} who {{achieved}} eminence as composers broke away from his classical, Brahmsian precepts, as he had himself rebelled against Reinecke's conservatism. The composer George Dyson wrote, [...] "In a certain sense the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view of what some of these rebels have since achieved, {{one is tempted to}} wonder whether there is really <b>anything</b> <b>better</b> a teacher can do for his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution." [...] The works of some of Stanford's pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, and to some extent elsewhere, as Stanford's never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford's greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.|$|E

The idea of an olive branch, a symbol of peace, came from a computer expert at the simulators. The call sign Columbia for the CSM came from Julian Scheer, the NASA Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs.

2500|$|The Emperor sent {{order to}} Churaman and several Rajput Rajas to join prince Azu-ud-Din, {{who had been}} deputed to Agra to watch the {{movements}} of Farrukh Siyar. But all of them procrastinated. Azi-ud-Din was subsequently defeated at Khajuha (November 1712). This alarmed Jahandar Shah. Early in December, making fulsome promises he sent a farman to Chruaman to reach Agra with his men against Farrukah Siyar. Churaman came with a big force and fought {{on the side of}} the Emperor at the battle of Agra (January 1713) But once his cause appeared to have been lost, the audacious Jat felt no qualms of conscience in plundering the rear of his professed master.This can easily be explained on account of the fact that had Churaman not taken it, [...] the victors wd definitely have laid their hands on it. [...] He did not spare the camp of the victor either.He went back to Thun carrying treasures, many elephants and camels together with their baggage. The Jats so thoroughly looted it that Farrukh Siyar could not find <b>anything</b> <b>better</b> than a filthy screen and a small wooden platform to sit on, while receiving the homage of his officials.|$|E

Before the deal was announced, O'Brien initially had reservations about the move, as it would place comedian George Lopez's show, Lopez Tonight, one hour later to midnight, effectively doing to Lopez what NBC had wanted to do with O'Brien. However, Lopez reportedly called O'Brien and expressed his excitement about the move. Lopez went on to state, [...] "I can't think of <b>anything</b> <b>better</b> than doing my show with Conan as my lead-in [...] It's the beginning of a new era in late-night comedy." [...] In an official press release by Turner Broadcasting, it stated that O'Brien had only begun negotiations a week prior to the official announcement of the show. Steve Koonin, President of Turner Entertainment Networks, went on to comment of the announcement, [...] "Conan has been the comedic voice for a generation. TBS already has a huge audience of young comedy lovers, and Conan's show will give these fans even more reasons to watch our network." ...|$|E

He further stated that his father used to borrow it. Beverly also belittles Leonard by pointing out that his brother and sister are more successful in their respective fields than he is.

2500|$|In 2005, former Liverpool and England star Steve McMahon was {{appointed}} as coach. The 2005–06 season saw a complete {{overhaul of the}} playing squad, with Simon Colosimo and former Sunderland and Leeds striker Brian Deane as key signings. Other notable signings included future young stars Nick Ward and Billy Celeski. Early results in friendlies against local opposition were not great, but Perth became {{the first team to}} defeat Sydney FC, winning 1–0 in the semi-final of the 2005 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup before losing in the final 0–1 to the Central Coast Mariners. Perth's woeful recruiting strategy was soon evident with the early departure of star import Brian Deane after seven games. Another McMahon recruit, Northern Ireland junior international Neil Teggart, quit the club {{prior to the start of}} the regular season. Deane was replaced by Damian Mori, a former Perth Glory striker. Originally on a three-game temporary contract, after some impressive performances Mori stayed for the rest of the season and finished with seven goals. However, the club continued to be dogged by problems which would only be later revealed to the public. Steve McMahon was subject to constant media criticism over his coaching style and was accused of nepotism by signing his son, Steve McMahon Jr, who was of questionable talent. Rumours also surfaced that players were planning to stage a revolt against the coach. On 7 December, the club reported that the parties had [...] "amicably" [...] chosen to go separate ways. On 9 December 2005, the club announced that assistant coach Alan Vest would move into the head coach role for the remainder of the season, with striker Damian Mori taking on a dual role as player-coach after being named as his assistant. The coach's departure was merely a symptom of deeper troubles. Poor performances saw Perth miss out on qualification for the finals for the first time since 1998. Dwindling support from chairman Nick Tana, as he looked to sell his 75 percent stake in the club, seemed to underpin a general decline in club fortunes. After the Round 20 match against Sydney FC, Alan Vest hinted that the current player group were incapable of achieving <b>anything</b> <b>better</b> and stated that [...] "cliques" [...] had been formed undermining club harmony. To cap off a bad season, Western QBE announced they were withdrawing as major sponsor after being associated with the club for 8 years.|$|E
