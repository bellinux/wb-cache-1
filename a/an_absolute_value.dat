25|$|The {{definition}} {{and evaluation of}} art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. Richard Wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the Realist, whereby aesthetic quality is <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> independent of any human view; the Objectivist, whereby it is also <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value,</b> but is dependent on general human experience; and the Relativist position, whereby it is not <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value,</b> but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.|$|E

40|$|Ostrowski {{classified}} the nontrivial <b>absolute</b> <b>values</b> on Q: up to equivalence, {{they are}} the usual (archimedean) <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> and the p-adic <b>absolute</b> <b>values</b> for different primes p, with none of these being equivalent to each other. We will see how this theorem extends to any number field K, giving {{a list of all}} the nontrivial <b>absolute</b> <b>values</b> on K up to equivalence. For a prime ideal p in OK and a constant c ∈ (0, 1), the function |α | = c ordp(α) for α ∈ K × (and | 0 | = 0) defines <b>a</b> nonarchimedean <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> on K. We call this <b>a</b> p-adic <b>absolute</b> <b>value.</b> (Changing c produces <b>an</b> equivalent <b>absolute</b> <b>value,</b> so there is a well-defined p-adic topology on K, independent of c. This topology on OK amounts to declaring the ideals p k to be a neighborhood basis of 0 in OK.) For two different primes p and q, <b>a</b> p-adic <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> and q-adic <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> are inequivalent: the Chinese remainder theorem lets us find α ∈ OK satisfying α ≡ 0 mod p and α ≡ 1 mod q, so the p-adic <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> of α is less than 1 and the q-adic <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> of α equals 1. Thus the two <b>absolute</b> <b>values</b> are inequivalent. Any embedding of K into R or C gives rise to <b>an</b> archimedean <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> on K, with complex-conjugate embeddings yielding the same <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> on K since |a + bi |...|$|R

25|$|A {{place of}} a number field F is an {{equivalence}} class of absolute values on F. Essentially, <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> is a notion to measure the size of elements f of F. Two such absolute values are considered equivalent if they give rise to the same notion of smallness (or proximity). In general, they fall into three regimes. Firstly (and mostly irrelevant), the trivial absolute value | |0, which takes the value 1 on all non-zero f in F. The second and third classes are Archimedean places and non-Archimedean (or ultrametric) places. The completion of F {{with respect to a}} place is given in both cases by taking Cauchy sequences in F and dividing out null sequences, that is, sequences (x'n)n ∈ N such that |x'n| tends to zero when n tends to infinity. This can be shown to be a field again, the so-called completion of F at the given place.|$|E

2500|$|To {{find the}} non-Archimedean places, let again f and x be as above. In Qp, f splits in factors of various degrees, {{none of which}} are repeated, and the degrees of which add up to n, the degree of f. For each of these p-adically {{irreducible}} factors t, we may suppose that x satisfies t and obtain an embedding of F into an algebraic extension of finite degree over Qp. Such a local field behaves in many ways like a number field, and the p-adic numbers may similarly {{play the role of}} the rationals; in particular, we can define the norm and trace in exactly the same way, now giving functions mapping to Qp. By using this p-adic norm map Nt for the place t, we may define <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> corresponding to a given p-adically irreducible factor t of degree m by |θ|t = |Nt(θ)|p1/m.

The roots r of factors of degree one are necessarily real, and replacing x by r gives an embedding of F into R; {{the number of such}} embeddings is equal to the number of real roots of f. Restricting the standard absolute value on R to F gives an archimedean absolute value on F; such <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> is also referred to as a real place of F. [...] On the other hand, the roots of factors of degree two are pairs of conjugate complex numbers, which allows for two conjugate embeddings into C.
