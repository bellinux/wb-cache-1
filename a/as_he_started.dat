This {{was the third}} no-hitter during which Posey played catcher and the fourth overall, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> at first base in Tim Lincecum's second career no-hitter. This puts him one behind the record for no-hitters caught, held by the Philadelphia Phillies' Carlos Ruiz and the Boston Red Sox' Jason Varitek.|$|E

5|$|On 6 March, during United's 3–1 loss against Liverpool at Anfield, Nani {{was injured}} {{following}} a challenge from Jamie Carragher just before half-time. Nani shed tears after {{the challenge and}} was subsequently taken off the pitch in a stretcher. Following post-match comments to the press from Manchester United, it was believed Nani had suffered a broken leg. However, {{this was not the}} case <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> training the following week. It was thought Nani would miss up to three weeks as a result of this tackle and would return in April, but he recovered in time to play 61 minutes of a 2–1 victory over Marseille on 15 March.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing {{of the human genome}} in 2003, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> to realise how it could be related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the Dawn was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E
5|$|Wright {{was sacked}} by Arsenal in June 1966 {{and the board}} of {{directors}} hired the club's physiotherapist Bertie Mee as his successor. Mee insisted on an escape clause in his contract provided if the arrangement did not work, which the club duly obliged. The position became permanent eleven months later, even though Arsenal were 14th in the league table. The club's fortunes changed under Mee however, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> to bed in youth players. He led Arsenal to successive League Cup final appearances in 1968 and 1969, and ended the club's 17-year wait for silverware when his side beat Anderlecht in the 1970 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final. Mee's greatest triumph was the club's league and cup double of 1970–71, but he struggled to better that achievement, having made radical changes to a successful team.|$|E

5|$|Babangida's {{international}} {{chances were}} partly limited {{due to the}} fact that he often found himself behind Finidi George in the pecking order. He played an important role in his team's Olympic triumph in Atlanta in 1996, as Nigeria overcame tough resistance from Brazil and Argentina, packed with the likes of Dida, Roberto Carlos, Bebeto, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Hernan Crespo, Claudio López, Ariel Ortega and Diego Simeone among others. Babangida took part in Nigeria's 1998 World Cup campaign, playing a total of 120 minutes <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> one game and came on as a sub in the other three. He scored his team's only goal in the second-round defeat to Denmark. In January 2001, Babangida appeared in an exhibition game at the Yokohama International Stadium (known as the Nissan Stadium nowadays), playing for FIFA XI in a game against the unified team of Japan and South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{made his}} pit {{stop on the}} 26th lap and emerged behind Michael Schumacher, while Verstappen retired from the race with a {{mechanical}} problem. All of the leaders had taken their stops {{by the start of}} lap 28, the top ten were Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Coulthard, Button, Frentzen, Salo, Zonta and Wurz. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race on the same lap, a 1:24.470 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> to close the gap to Michael Schumacher, as Ralf Schumacher again became under pressure by Coulthard in fourth. Eleven laps later, Coulthard entered the pit lane, triggering the second round of pit stops. Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello made a pit stop on the following lap and rejoined behind Coulthard. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen both made their pit stops on the 41st lap, with Häkkinen emerging in front because Michael Schumacher's pit stop was problematic. Michael Schumacher's mechanics had started refulling after putting his tyres on causing him to be stationary for ten seconds longer than usual. Salo and Zonta went into the pit lane on lap 45, allowing Button into sixth.|$|E

25|$|He loved celebrities, so {{he painted}} them as well. From these {{beginnings}} he developed his later style and subjects. Instead {{of working on}} a signature subject matter, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> out to do, he worked {{more and more on}} a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used silk-screening; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.|$|E
