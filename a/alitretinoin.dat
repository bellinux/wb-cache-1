5000|$|In {{the last}} couple of years an {{internal}} medicine has been approved for the first time for the treatment of chronic hand eczema. This involves a derivative of vitamin A, called <b>alitretinoin,</b> which is also naturally present in the human body. <b>Alitretinoin</b> can be used to treat all forms of severe chronic hand eczema which have not reacted to external cortisone preparations. The effectiveness of this form of treatment has been tested extensively in clinical study programs and proven prior to its approval. [...] The trial results showed that two thirds of patients did not suffer a recurrence 6 months after application of the medication, and that re-treatment is effective if hand eczema reoccurs. [...] The duration of <b>alitretinoin</b> treatment is 3 to 6 months. During treatment and one month prior to beginning and one month after completion, women of childbearing-age must use contraceptives and also test for pregnancy each month since, as with all derivatives of vitamin A, the substance involved is teratogenic.

40|$|P>Background. Recent {{studies have}} found that <b>alitretinoin</b> can induce {{clinically}} significant responses in subjects with severe chronic hand eczema (CHE) unresponsive to topical corticosteroids. Aims. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and safety of <b>alitretinoin</b> 10 or 30 mg once daily. Methods. This was a randomized, double-blind study, which enrolled 32 subjects aged 18 - 75 years with CHE unresponsive to potent topical corticosteroids. Subjects received <b>alitretinoin</b> 10 mg (n = 16) or 30 mg (n = 16) once daily for 12 or 24 weeks. Standard PK variables [area under the curve (AUC) of plasma concentration vs. time, maximum plasma concentration (C-max), time to maximum plasma concentration (t(max)), elimination half-life (t(1 / 2)), total systemic clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (Vd/F) ] were determined for <b>alitretinoin</b> and metabolites. Efficacy was assessed using the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) scale. Results. Chronic administration of <b>alitretinoin</b> for up to 24 weeks did not result in accumulation or time-dependent changes in the disposition of <b>alitretinoin.</b> Exposure was found to be proportional to dose. Systemic exposure (AUC) to <b>alitretinoin</b> was proportional to dose for 10 and 30 mg alitretinoin; 62. 8 % of subjects achieved clear/almost clear hands in the 30 mg group and 12. 5 % in the 10 mg group. <b>Alitretinoin</b> was well tolerated. Conclusions.

METHODS Case report. RESULTS After 1 month of <b>alitretinoin</b> treatment (30 mg daily), itch as well as prurigo and psoriasis lesions decreased markedly. Three cycles of <b>alitretinoin</b> were administered, as each cessation of treatment led to relapse of the symptoms after 6 - 8 weeks.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the evidence review group (ERG) report into the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of <b>alitretinoin</b> for the treatment of adults with severe chronic hand eczema refractory to topical steroid treatment in accordance with the licensed indication, based upon the evidence submission from Basilea Pharmaceuticals Ltd to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of the single technology appraisal process. The clinical evidence came from a single placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial of daily treatment with <b>alitretinoin</b> for 12 - 24 weeks, with follow-up for a further 24 weeks, in patients with severe chronic hand eczema (CHE) unresponsive to topical steroids. A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients using <b>alitretinoin</b> achieved the primary end point of clear or almost clear hands by week 24 than did those with placebo. Dose-dependent headache was the most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with <b>alitretinoin.</b> Serious adverse events were rare, but <b>alitretinoin</b> was associated with increases in both total cholesterol and triglycerides, which has implications for risks of future cardiovascular events. The manufacturer submitted a de novo decision analytic model to estimate, over a time horizon of 3 years, the cost-effectiveness of <b>alitretinoin</b> versus the other relevant comparators identified by NICE. In response to the points of clarification put to it by the ERG regarding the initial submission, the manufacturer provided additional evidence and a revised decision analytic model with a 'placebo' arm. In the manufacturer's original submission to NICE, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) reported for <b>alitretinoin</b> were 8614 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) versus ciclosporin, - 469 pounds per QALY versus psoralen + UVA (with <b>alitretinoin</b> dominant) and 10, 612 pounds per QALY versus azathioprine. These ICERs decreased as the time horizon was extended in sensitivity analyses. In patients with hyperkeratotic CHE and in women of child-bearing potential, the ICER remained below 20, 000. pounds When the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) values used in the model were replaced with those derived from an alternative study, these ICERs increased significantly (to 22, 312 pounds per QALY for <b>alitretinoin</b> versus azathioprine). In the revised model, <b>alitretinoin</b> was reported to have an ICER of 12, 931 pounds per QALY gained versus supportive care (placebo). However, the model underestimates the costs of treatment associated with <b>alitretinoin.</b> The manufacturer assumed that patients receiving <b>alitretinoin</b> visited the dermatologist every 4 weeks and ceased treatment as soon as they responded to it. If, in practice, patients would receive treatment for longer than this, then the manufacturer's model will have significantly underestimated the costs to the NHS. Additional analyses undertaken by the ERG produced ICERs close to 30, 000 pounds per QALY gained for <b>alitretinoin</b> versus supportive care. This was largely due to uncertainty surrounding the impact of <b>alitretinoin</b> on HRQoL. The placebo-controlled trials conducted to date have established that <b>alitretinoin</b> can be efficacious for the treatment of severe CHE refractory to topical steroids, but longer term follow-up of trials or the implementation of registries is required to better establish the longer term efficacy or safety of <b>alitretinoin.</b> NICE recommended the use of <b>alitretinoin</b> for patients with severe CHE and a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of at least 15. Treatment was recommended to be stopped as soon as an adequate response was observed, or if CHE remained severe at 12 weeks, or if response was inadequate at 24 weeks...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) {{invited the}} {{manufacturer}} of <b>alitretinoin</b> (Basilea Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of this drug {{for the treatment of}} patients with severe chronic hand eczema (CHE), as part of the Institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the manufacturer's submission to NICE. The ERG also independently searched for relevant evidence and modified the manufacturer's decision analytic model to examine the impact of altering some of the key assumptions. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from a single-placebo randomized controlled trial (RCT) of daily treatment with <b>alitretinoin</b> for 12 - 24 weeks, with follow-up for a further 24 weeks, in patients with severe CHE unresponsive to topical corticosteroids. A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved 'clear' or 'almost clear' hands by week 24 with <b>alitretinoin</b> than those using placebo: 48 % with <b>alitretinoin</b> 30 [*]mg (p[*]<[*] 0. 001); 28 % with <b>alitretinoin</b> 10 [*]mg (p[*]<[*] 0. 005); 17 % with placebo. Most patients who responded remained in remission during the 24 -week follow-up period. The most commonly reported adverse event was dose-dependent headache, with rates of 20 % in the <b>alitretinoin</b> 30 [*]mg group and 11 % in the <b>alitretinoin</b> 10 [*]mg group, respectively. Serious adverse events were rare, although <b>alitretinoin</b> was associated with increases in both total cholesterol and triglycerides. No direct or indirect comparisons of <b>alitretinoin</b> with any of the relevant treatment comparators (psoralen[*]+[*]UVA [PUVA], ciclosporin or azathioprine) were available. In the manufacturer's original submission to NICE, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) reported for <b>alitretinoin</b> were £ 8614 per QALY versus ciclosporin, -£ 469 per QALY versus PUVA (with <b>alitretinoin</b> dominant) and £ 10 [*] 612 per QALY versus azathioprine (year 2007 - 8 values). In response to a request from the ERG, the manufacturers provided a revised model that compared <b>alitretinoin</b> only with placebo, for which the ICER was reported to be £ 12 [*] 931. However, the omission of adverse events entirely from this revised model, in combination with a number of other factors, led the ERG to conclude that the model underestimated the costs of treatment associated with <b>alitretinoin.</b> Estimates of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) were the primary source of uncertainty, with the use of values from an alternative source producing ICERs of around £ 30 [*] 000 per QALY gained. The ERG concluded that, although the evidence presented indicates that <b>alitretinoin</b> is efficacious in the treatment of severe CHE, it gives little indication of alitretinoin's efficacy relative to likely alternative treatment options or its efficacy and safety in the longer term. Although the ICERs estimated by the manufacturer suggested that <b>alitretinoin</b> may be cost effective for use in the UK NHS, utilizing the alternative HR-QOL estimates resulted in a 2 -fold increase in the ICER. Thus, there was considerable uncertainty as to the true ICER of <b>alitretinoin</b> versus the relevant treatment comparators. The Appraisal Committee recommended that <b>alitretinoin</b> be provided to those patients with severe CHE and a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of at least 15. They recommended that treatment be stopped as soon as an adequate response was observed, or if CHE remained severe at 12 weeks, or if response was inadequate at 24 weeks. <b>Alitretinoin,</b> therapeutic use, Cost-utility, Eczema, treatment, Formularies...|$|E

40|$|Chronic hand eczema (CHE) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{dermatological}} disorders with a prevalence of approximately 10 %. Recent data have shown, that the skin barrier has a key function in the pathogenesis and therapy of CHE. Both, irritants and allergens are activating keratinocytes and immune cells. This leads to an increased production of inflammatory mediators (e. g. cytokines), which impair the expression of important structural skin barrier proteins (e. g. claudins, filaggrin). Oral <b>alitretinoin</b> (9 -cis-retinoic acid), a vitamin A derivate, has been licensed 2008 for the treatment of severe CHE refractory to potent topical corticosteroids. In clinical trials but also in clinical practice <b>alitretinoin</b> has been shown to be an effective and well tolerated systemic therapeutic drug. In this thesis the influence of <b>alitretinoin</b> on the skin barrier in patients with CHE were examined. Therefore the modified manuscore and the transepidermal waterloss (TEWL) were determined and skin biopsies of lesional skin (n= 15) were taken before and after therapy with <b>alitretinoin</b> for at least two months. Gene- and protein expression of structural proteins, proliferation- and inflammatory markers of the skin were measured in the biopsies by using PCR and immunohistochemistry. 	 Beside a significant decrease of the modified manuscore (parameter for clinical response) an increased gene- and protein expression of the structural proteins of the skin like tight junction-proteins (claudin 1, occludin), intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton (filaggrin, cytokeratin 10) and proteins of the cornified envelope (loricrin) were detected after treatment with <b>alitretinoin.</b> Furthermore, systemic <b>alitretinoin</b> led to a local decrease of inflammatory cells (CD 3 + cells) and of the inflammatory mediator TSLP in the skin. Although dry skin is known as a side effect of retinoids, there was no significant increase of the transepidermal waterloss. 	 The results of this thesis confirm the data of several clinical studies that <b>alitretinoin</b> is a well tolerated and effective systemic therapy for severe CHE. Herein, for the first time it has been shown that <b>alitretinoin</b> improves the epidermal skin barrier by upregulation of structural proteins of the skin and a downregulation of inflammatory markers. How long such a normalization of the skin barrier after therapy with <b>alitretinoin</b> will last and what kind of influence <b>alitretinoin</b> has on the lipid composition of lesional skin, should be investigated in future studies...|$|E

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of <b>alitretinoin</b> for CHE patient treatment from a Swiss third party payer perspective. A further objective {{of this study was}} to determine the burden of disease in Switzerland. Methods A long-term Markov cohort simulation model was used to estimate direct medical costs (€) and clinical effectiveness (quality adjusted life years, QALYs) of treating severe CHE patients with <b>alitretinoin.</b> Comparison was against the standard treatment of supportive care (optimised emollient therapy). Information on response rates were derived from a randomized controlled clinical trial. Costs were considered from the perspective of the Swiss health system. Swiss epidemiological data was derived from official Swiss Statistic institutions. Results Annual costs of <b>alitretinoin</b> treatment accounted for € 2 ' 212. After a time horizon of 22. 4 years, average remaining long-term costs accounted for € 42 ' 208 or € 38 ' 795 in the <b>alitretinoin</b> and the standard treatment arm, respectively. Compared with the standard therapy, the addition of <b>alitretinoin</b> yielded an average gain of 0. 230 QALYs at the end of the simulation.

Oral <b>alitretinoin</b> (9 -cis retinoic acid), which has been emerging as novel treatment for recalcitrant chronic hand eczema, is a vitamin A derivative with immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory activities. The specific <b>alitretinoin</b> mechanism of action which finally leads to skin inflammatory changes improvement is still far from being understood. We evaluated the therapeutic effect of <b>alitretinoin</b> plus adalimumab in patients with recalcitrant palmoplantar psoriasis thus investigating subsequent immunopathological alterations. Methods: Fifteen patients with palmoplantar psoriasis were treated with oral <b>alitretinoin</b> 30 mg once daily for 12 weeks plus adalimumab 40 mg once every 2 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by PASI, Palmoplantar Pustular Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI), visual analogue scales (VAS) on intensity of pain and pruritus along with an overall patient assessment. Immunostaining for TNFα, p 40 IL 12 - 23, RAR, and RXR was performed from skin lesions biopsied before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results: PASI, PPPASI and VAS for pruritus and pain decreased significantly after 12 weeks of treatment with adalimumab plus <b>alitretinoin.</b> The overall patient assessment ranged from 60 to 90 % clinical improvement. A significant reduction of TNFα, p 40 IL 12 - 23, RAR and RXR at immunohistochemistry was also observed reflecting clinical improvement.

No papules, intraoral striae or dysphagia recurred during the 6 months of treatment. After 4 months the patient relapsed with mucosal patches so that a second cycle was initiated for 6 months where oral LP lesions resolved after 4 weeks also (with sporadic mild headache). CONCLUSION: Further {{studies are needed to}} better understand the impact of <b>alitretinoin</b> in LP. Our observation suggests <b>alitretinoin</b> as a new, well-tolerated treatment option for esophageal LP after failed response to conventional treatments...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{of severe}} hand eczema (HE) which is {{resistant}} to topical potent corticosteroid treatment is challenging. In 2013 we surveyed 194 UK dermatologists {{to obtain information}} about usual treatment pathways to inform {{the choice of the}} comparator in a trial of <b>alitretinoin</b> in severe HE (ALPHA trial); the results indicate that treatment approaches differ among UK dermatologists. Psoralen combined with ultraviolet A (PUVA) and <b>alitretinoin</b> were identified as the most frequent first line treatment options for hyperkeratotic HE, whereas oral corticosteroids were identified as frequent first line treatment for vesicular HE, followed by PUVA and <b>alitretinoin.</b> In terms of potential side effects of long-term or repeated use, oral steroids and ciclosporin A were reported to cause most concerns. There is uncertainty about which treatment gives the best short and long-term outcome {{due to a lack of}} definitive randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of different treatment pathways in severe HE...|$|E
40|$|Background Palmoplantar {{pustular}} psoriasis {{is often}} recalcitrant to therapy. Here we evaluated the therapeutic effect of <b>alitretinoin</b> {{in patients with}} recalcitrant pal-moplantar pustular psoriasis and investigated subsequent immunopathological alterations. Methods Seven patients with palmoplantar pustular psoriasis were treated with oral <b>alitretinoin</b> 30 mg once daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by palmoplan-tar pustular psoriasis area and severity index (PPPASI), visual analogue scales (VAS) on intensity of pain and pruritus and an overall patient assessment. Immu-nohistochemical staining for neutrophil elastase, CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 1 a CD 11 c, CD 303,CD 68, CD 69, CD 208 and HLA-DR was on lesional skin biopsies obtained before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results PPPASI and VAS for pruritus and pain decreased significantly after 12 weeks of treatment with <b>alitretinoin.</b> The overall patient assessment ranged from 60 % to 90 % clinical improvement. In correlation with clinical improvement a signifi-cant reduction, particularly of neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells, wa...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with severe}} oral lichen planus {{refractory}} to standard topical treatment currently have limited options of therapy suitable for long-term use. Oral <b>alitretinoin</b> (9 -cis retinoic acid) was never systematically investigated in clinical trials, although case reports suggest its possible efficacy. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy {{and safety of}} oral <b>alitretinoin</b> taken at 30 mg once daily for up to 24 weeks {{in the treatment of}} severe oral lichen planus refractory to standard topical therapy. METHODS: We conducted a prospective open-label single arm pilot study to test the efficacy and safety of 30 mg oral <b>alitretinoin</b> once daily for up to 24 weeks in severe oral lichen planus. Ten patients were included in the study. Primary end point was reduction in signs and symptoms measured by the Escudier severity score. Secondary parameters included pain and quality of life scores. Safety parameters were assessed during a follow-up period of 5 weeks. RESULTS: A substantial response at the end of treatment, i. e. > 50...|$|E
