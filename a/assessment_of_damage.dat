5|$|The United States Coast Guard first {{performed}} an aerial <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> on Wake Island on September 2, {{three days after}} the typhoon struck. The flight indicated an overall damage smaller than expected, and reported a lack of oil spill or hazardous material leak. The U.S. Coast Guard arrived by boat with a team on September 7, with a preliminary damage assessment completed four days later; the team repaired a generator to provide power. The United States Navy's combat stores ship, the USNS San Jose (T-AFS-7), and sixteen members United States Air Force's 36th Contingency Response Group at Andersen AFB, Guam arrived on September 8 and analyzed the stability of the airfield along with assisting in clean-up efforts, and after core tests workers cleared the runway to allow flights onto the territory. On September 13, a group of engineers restored power on the island. About two weeks after the cyclone, several buildings were operational.|$|E

500|$|On June19, [...] of {{rain fell}} in Mazatlán, {{near where the}} {{remnants}} of the depression moved ashore. Rainfall rates in the region exceeded 1in/h (25mm/h) at times. High winds in Mazatlán knocked down several trees, cutting power to local residents. Heavy rains also triggered street flooding throughout the city. Several hours after the storm, electric companies reported than an estimated 50,000 residences were without power. Following an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the power grid, 20 power poles were found to have been damaged, 15 circuit breakers were damaged and 15 sections of power lines were downed. Numerous villages were flooded, some requiring the evacuation of residents. Around 11:00am PDT (1800UTC) six people were stranded offshore Sinaloa. High winds caused significant structural damage throughout Mazatlán.|$|E

500|$|Although the storm's {{intensity}} was {{equivalent to}} a Category2 hurricane, sustained winds in Belize reached only [...] Damage from the hurricane was mainly limited to an area along the coast about [...] north to south and [...] east to west. In San Pedro Town, about 90% of structures were destroyed. Newtown was completely demolished, causing its resident to establish the city of Hopkins further south. At Ambergris Caye, many houses and coconut plantations were damaged or destroyed. This forced many laborers and coconut plantation owners to seek new professions; most of them entered the fishing industry. Nine deaths were reported, though the toll may have been higher, as numerous small fishing boats were beached or swept out to sea. Widespread damage to vegetation and trees occurred. An <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> after the storm indicated that more than 75% of the canopy species had been destroyed. Although the low bush was not badly damaged, about 25% to 50% of the pine trees were toppled. Damage on deep soils was largely from breakage while on shallow soils mostly from wind throw. Tides along the coast split Caye Caulker into three separate islands and swept away [...] "everything in its path". Overall, damage totaled approximately $4million, with $1million to private and public property, including buildings and dwellings. The remaining $3million in damage was incurred to coconuts and other crops; this total possibly includes damage to the mahogany and chicle industries.|$|E

The court might also regulate the rotation of crops and the manuring of the ground. Ecclesiastical courts also existed as shown by the example of the Abbot of Kilwinning's court hill near Beith.

40|$|In an {{unpredictable}} world where human intervention or unexpected environmental conditions can prevail, damage can occur to manmade structures. Whilst structural design allows for redundancy, or a structural capability beyond the general working load of the structure, {{it is necessary}} to be able to analyse and understand the residual capability <b>of</b> a <b>damaged</b> structure {{to ensure the safety of}} personnel in the vicinity of the structure and assess the potential to facilitate repair. Idealised Structural Unit Method (ISUM) can allow rapid <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> large structural arrangements by simplification into smaller constituent parts, which are assessed against pre-calculated failure data for each part. The method has potential benefits for allowing rapid <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaged</b> steel-plated structure that would otherwise require the use of high fidelity modelling of the entire structures, such as through the use of finite element analysis. This paper presents a study on the use of ISUM to assess damaged steel-plated structures and its limitations through the collapse analysis of stiffened steel panels. A new ISUM is proposed for strength <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaged</b> structural arrangements. Analysis is undertaken to assess the effects of geometrical and material property variations that can occur in a structure as well as the effects <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> aperture size and shape on the collapse strength of stiffened steel panels. The study shows that while ISUM can be applied in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaged</b> steel-plated structures, implementing the proposed new ISUM allows greater accuracy in the calculation of the collapse strength <b>of</b> <b>damaged</b> stiffened steel panels. The paper also concludes that the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> larger structural units for application in the ISUM assessment, will allow the effects <b>of</b> the <b>damage</b> on surrounding structure to be captured, which can influence the deflection shapes that will lead to collapse of the structure...|$|R
