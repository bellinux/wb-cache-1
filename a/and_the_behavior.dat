40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to determine the dimensions of beliefs about internet advertising affecting Syrian consumers' attitudes and behaviors towards internet advertising. The results indicate that Attitudes are influenced positively by information, and entertainment; and negatively by irritation and values' corruption. Irritation positively influences consumers' behaviors of leaving websites showing the ads. Entertainment positively influences consumers' behaviors of clicking on internet ads for further information concerning advertised products. Attitude is found to fully mediate the relationships between beliefs of information, irritation, and values' corruption <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> clicking on internet ads, <b>and</b> partially mediate <b>the</b> relationship between entertainment <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> of clicking on internet ads. Attitudes fully mediate the relationships between beliefs of information, entertainment, and values' corruption <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> of leaving websites showing <b>the</b> ads, <b>and</b> partially mediate <b>the</b> relationship between irritation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> of leaving websites showing the ads. This research comes {{to be one of the}} first studies to investigate Syrian consumers' beliefs about, attitudes, and behavioral responses towards internet advertising. As well as, this study provides evidence of the direct relationship between some of the beliefs about internet advertising (i. e. entertainment <b>and</b> irritation) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> behavioral responses towards it...|$|R

It also mandated that each diocese hold a synod to proclaim {{the decisions of the}} council. Cuthbert sent his deacon Cynebert to Pope Gregory III after the council with a report on the council and its resolutions. This action may have been taken in response to Boniface's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy. The actions of the council were also gathered into a collection at Cuthbert's command.|$|E
5|$|Humans had {{free will}} to ignore divine {{guidance}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> required by maat, but {{by doing so}} they could bring divine punishment upon themselves. A deity carried out this punishment using its ba, the force that manifested the god's power in the human world. Natural disasters and human ailments were seen {{as the work of}} angry divine bas. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities: Shed, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm, and Petbe, an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|The major {{risks to}} the jaguar include {{deforestation}} across its habitat, increasing competition for food with human beings, especially in dry and unproductive habitat, poaching, hurricanes in northern parts of its range, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of ranchers who will often kill the cat where it preys on livestock. When adapted to the prey, the jaguar {{has been shown to}} take cattle as a large portion of its diet; while land clearance for grazing is a problem for the species, the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America, as the animals took advantage of the new prey base. This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.|$|E

The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as Redskins or Squaws; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures; such as the tomahawk chop.|$|E

When these conditions are not met, people will be relatively unconcerned with preserving their self-views and they will instead indulge their desire for self-enhancement. In addition, self-reported emotional reactions favor self-enhancement while more thoughtful processes favor self-verification.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} above, many metal ions {{react with}} hydrogen sulfide {{to give the}} corresponding metal sulfides. This conversion is widely exploited. For example, gases or waters contaminated by hydrogen sulfide can be cleaned with metal sulfides.

25|$|A {{functional}} analysis {{is the most}} direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects {{on the behavior of}} interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a {{functional analysis}}, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) {{it can be said that}} there is a functional relation between that condition <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.|$|E
25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session. No demands are placed on the child {{throughout}} the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of interest.|$|E
