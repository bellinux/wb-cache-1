On May 3, 1942, , a destroyer, saw Ashkhabad and determined it was an abandoned ship which was a navigational hazard so they fired three rounds which caused the midship superstructure to catch fire. HMS St. Zeno saw the fire and went towards Ashkhabad and fired a shot at it under the authorization of the commanding officer of Hertfordshire, who commanded all British trawlers at Morehead City. His explanation was that he considered Ashkhabad a menace to a large convoy expected in the area, so he <b>authorized</b> the <b>firing</b> to sink Ashkhabad to extinguish the fire. Some wonder whether the action was taken out of malice. Because of this series of military snafus, by the time the Navy salvage tug, Relief, got to Ashkhabad, it was a total loss.|$|R

The Israeli Cabinet passed unanimously a proposal on September 24 to make 4 year sentences for adults throwing stones and Molotov cocktails mandatory. The proposed measures allow police to open fire if any lives {{are perceived to be}} in danger, which is interpreted by Ynet to mean that minors also can be targeted. The families of minors between 14-18 found to have thrown rocks, Molotov cocktails, or firecrackers will be subject to fines and imprisonment.

40|$|Prescribed burning {{is used in}} many {{geographical}} areas for multiple and integrated objectives (wildfire prevention, habitat conservation, grazing management). In Europe the collaboration between researchers and fire professionals has brought to implement this technique over increasing areas (~ 104 ha year- 1), effectively and efficiently. In Italy prescribed burning has not been much studied and it is rarely applied. A new interest is recently rising. Some Regions particularly threatened by wildfires have updated their legislation and set up procedures to <b>authorize</b> prescribed <b>fire</b> experiments and interventions. From 2004 to 2011 several scientific, operative and training experiences {{have been carried out}} at a regional level (Basilicata, Campania, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Piemonte, Sardegna, Toscana). The present paper aims to: (i) document and compare these regional programs; (ii) discuss their frameworks and limitations; (iii) provide information about objectives, prescriptions, methods and results. The study has involved Universities, Forest Corps, Civil Protection, Municipalities, Parks and professionals from Italy and other Countries. Interventions have regarded integrated objectives (fire hazard reduction; habitat conservation; forest and grazing management), and involved several vegetation types (broadleaved and conifer forests; Mediterranean and Continental shrublands; grasslands). Studies on fire behaviour and ecology have helped to set prescriptions for specific objectives and environments. Results have been transferred to professionals through training sessions. Several common elements are outlined: integrated objectives, multidisciplinary character, training and research products. Ecological questions, certification to the use of fire, communication to local communities and the proposal of new studies, are some of the issues outlined in the discussion. The present study is the first review at national level and we hope it will help to deepen the meaning and limitations of a technique which is an effective tool to prevent wildfires when integrated in the forest and land planning process...|$|R
5000|$|Gulf & Western {{executive}} Charles Bluhdorn {{was frustrated}} with Coppola over {{the number of}} screen tests he had performed without finding a person to play the various roles. Production quickly fell behind because of Coppola's indecisiveness and conflicts with Paramount, which led to costs being around $40,000 per day. With the rising costs, Paramount had then Vice President Jack Ballard {{keep a close eye}} on production costs. While filming, Coppola stated that he felt he could be fired at any point as he knew Paramount executives were not happy with many of the decisions he had made. Coppola was aware that Evans had asked Elia Kazan to take over directing the film, because he feared that Coppola was too inexperienced to cope with the increased size of the production. Coppola was also convinced that the film editor, Aram Avakian, and the assistant director, Steve Kestner, were conspiring to get him fired. Avakian complained to Evans that he could not edit the scenes correctly because Coppola was not shooting enough footage. Evans however was satisfied with the footage being sent to the west coast, and <b>authorized</b> Coppola to <b>fire</b> them both. Coppola later explained: [...] "Like the godfather, I fired people as a preemptory strike. The people who were angling the most to have me fired, I had fired." [...] Brando threatened that he would quit if Coppola were fired.|$|R
40|$|American {{society has}} a general {{cultural}} bias toward con-trolling nature (Glover 2000) and, in particular, a strong bias for suppressing wildfire, even in wilderness (Saveland et al. 1988). Nevertheless, the Federal Wildland Fire Man-agement Policy directs managers to “allow lightning-caused fires to play, as nearly as possible, their natural ecological role in wilderness ” (FWFMP 2001). Each year, however, approximately 85 % of natural fire ignitions in national forest wilderness areas are suppressed (Sexton 2004). Roughly 20 % of all national forest wilderness lands have been significantly altered from historical ecological condi-tions (Miller 2003), {{and the risk}} of losing key ecosystem components within these altered landscapes is high (Schmidt et al. 2002). Current management practices fa-voring suppression of natural ignitions cannot sustain the functional role of fire in wilderness areas (Cole and Landres 1996). Although concerns and issues that influence fire management decisions on U. S. federal lands have been iden-tified (Miller and Landres 2004), to our knowledge {{there has not been a}} systematic national assessment to identify and measure Wildland Fire Use (WFU) barriers. Three requirements must be met in order to manage a natural ignition as WFU in national forests. Managing a natu-ral ignition as WFU requires a land and resource management plan (LRMP) that <b>authorizes</b> WFU, a <b>fire</b> management plan (FMP) that authorizes WFU, and a recommendation to man-age a fire (i. e., natural ignition within the WFU management zone) as WFU (USDA/USDI 2005). If the <b>fire</b> management plan <b>authorizes</b> WFU, it is still possible that the majority of natural ignitions may be suppressed.
