50|$|<b>Amensalism</b> is an {{interaction}} where an organism inflicts harm to another organism without any costs or benefits received by itself. A clear case of <b>amensalism</b> is where sheep or cattle trample grass. Whilst {{the presence of}} the grass causes negligible detrimental effects to the animal's hoof, the grass suffers from being crushed.needed <b>Amensalism</b> is often used to describe strongly asymmetrical competitive interactions, such as has been observed between the Spanish ibex and weevils of the genus Timarcha which feed upon the same type of shrub. Whilst {{the presence of the}} weevil has almost no influence on food availability, the presence of ibex has an enormous detrimental effect on weevil numbers, as they consume significant quantities of plant matter and incidentally ingest the weevils upon it.|$|E
50|$|There are {{ecological}} {{relationships in}} which two are oppositional and four are symbiotic. The oppositional relationships are predation and competition. The symbiotic relationships are mutualism, commensalism, <b>amensalism</b> , neutralism , cooperation and parasitism.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{ecological}} {{networks that}} integrate non-trophic interactions are being built. The type of interactions they can contain {{can be classified}} into six categories: mutualism, commensalism, neutralism, <b>amensalism,</b> antagonism, and competition [...]|$|E
5000|$|Associated {{with the}} term [...] "symbiosis" [...] are terms: mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, and <b>amensalism.</b> [...] This may define or limit the type of [...] "living together" [...] of two organisms, be they plant, animal, protist or {{bacteria}} they practice.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amensalism</b> is {{the type}} of {{relationship}} that exists where one species is inhibited or completely obliterated and one is unaffected by the other. There are two types of <b>amensalism,</b> competition and antibiosis. Competition is where a larger or stronger organism deprives a smaller or weaker one from a resource. Antibiosis occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion. An example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree. The mature tree can rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and, if the mature tree is very large, it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients. Throughout the process, the mature tree is unaffected by the sapling. Indeed, if the sapling dies, the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling. Note that these nutrients become available because of the sapling's decomposition, rather than from the living sapling, which would be a case of parasitism. An example of antibiosis is Juglans nigra (black walnut), secreting juglone, a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone.|$|E
50|$|Commensalism {{is a type}} of {{relationship}} among organisms in which one organism benefits while the other organism is neither benefited nor harmed. The organism that benefited is called the commensal while the other organism that is neither benefited nor harmed is called the host. For example, an epiphytic orchid attached to the tree for support benefits the orchid but neither harms nor benefits the tree.The opposite of commensalism is <b>amensalism,</b> an interspecific relationship in which a product of one organism has a negative effect on another organism.|$|E
5000|$|Commensalism, in ecology, is a {{class of}} {{relationships}} between two organisms where one organism benefits from the other without affecting it. This is in contrast with mutualism, in which both organisms benefit from each other, <b>amensalism,</b> where one is harmed while the other is unaffected, and parasitism, where one benefits while the other is harmed.The word [...] "commensalism" [...] {{is derived from the}} word [...] "commensal", meaning [...] "eating at the same table" [...] in human social interaction, which in turn comes through French from the Medieval Latin commensalis, meaning [...] "sharing a table", from the prefix , meaning [...] "together", and , meaning [...] "table" [...] or [...] "meal". Originally, the term was used to describe the use of waste food by second animals, like the carcass eaters that follow hunting animals, but wait until they have finished their meal.|$|E
30|$|During the lase decade, many {{scholars}} [13 – 19] studied the dynamic {{behavior of the}} <b>amensalism</b> model; however, only recently, scholars [14, 16, 18] studied {{the influence of the}} partial cover to the traditional two-species <b>amensalism</b> model. In this paper, for first time, we propose a two-species stage-structured <b>amensalism</b> model with a cover for the first species.|$|E
30|$|<b>Amensalism</b> and {{commensalism}} {{are common}} {{relations between the}} species. Here, <b>amensalism</b> is an interaction where a species inflicts harm on the other species without any costs or benefits received by the other, and commensalism is a relationship which is only favorable to the one side and has no influence on the other side.|$|E
30|$|When {{one party}} {{benefits}} {{the other party}} but is harmed by that party in return, the result is parasitism (+, −). Under a cooperative agreement, one party may obstruct the joint effort while another party provides benefits, which is again interpreted as parasitism (−, +). Third, when one party achieves no benefit and harms its partner, the result is <b>amensalism</b> (0, −). Similarly, a party might not benefit while also being harmed by the other, again termed <b>amensalism</b> (−, 0). Why did these specific patterns of interdependence emerge? A typical example of <b>amensalism</b> is what social psychologists term “social loafing” (Levi 2014), which refers to {{a situation in which}} a group member shirks an order from a superior. This situation provides an example of <b>amensalism</b> (0, −) because one party incurs a loss while the other gains nothing. Including neutralism (0, 0), these types of relationships between two players, which are presented in Table  1, can also be applied to participants in UBG alliances.|$|E
30|$|Hypothesis 1 c. UBG alliances {{exhibit the}} {{features}} of <b>amensalism</b> [(0, −) or (−, 0)] among participating players.|$|E
40|$|<b>Amensalism</b> may {{be common}} between non-trophically linked animals in natural ecosystems, where {{variation}} among species in body sizes and foraging modes may {{give rise to}} one-sided interference. However, species and ecosystem-level consequences of animal-animal <b>amensalism</b> are largely unknown. In a Tibetan alpine meadow, dominant herbivorous grasshoppers trigger a death feigning anti-predator response of co-occurring grassland caterpillars despite posing no consumptive threat. We hypothesized that: 1) grasshoppers reduce the performance of caterpillars while incurring no cost to themselves; and 2) this <b>amensalism</b> reduces top-down control of plant composition and biomass. We tested these hypotheses by factorial manipulation of both herbivores within replicate field enclosures. Grasshoppers significantly suppressed caterpillar feeding, growth rate, survival, reproductive effort and delayed metamorphosis. In contrast, grasshopper performance was unaffected by the caterpillars. Suppression of caterpillar feeding decreased overall herbivore suppression of plant biomass by 58 % and shifted the functional composition of the plant community (i. e. increased sedge: forb ratio). These results suggest that consideration of non-trophic interactions such as <b>amensalism</b> will help predict the consequences of species losses for the structure and functioning of ecosystems...|$|E
30|$|The third {{step of the}} {{analysis}} is to visualize the internal structure of the triple helix variables. This step allows us to check the hypotheses and interpret the possible relationships among the variables. Table  7 presents the features of mutualism, commensalism, <b>amensalism,</b> and competition; parasitism is not observed. Thus, as suggested in hypotheses 1 a and 1 c, commensalism, and <b>amensalism</b> are observed. Due {{to a lack of}} parasitism, hypothesis 1 b is rejected.|$|E
30|$|As Fig.  2 indicates, {{two cases}} of <b>amensalism</b> are {{observed}} for the news-coordinators and startups-coordinators variable pairs. The coordinators variable is negatively {{affected by the}} startups and news variables; however, there are no effects in the reverse direction. As inferred as the case of <b>amensalism,</b> the number of coordinators might be increased when alliance performance was not satisfactory. On the other hand, {{if there was a}} sufficient amount of news coverage and university startups, then additional coordinators would not be employed in the alliance.|$|E
30|$|In Fig.  2, <b>amensalism</b> is {{observed}} between the startups-coordinators pair and the news-coordinators pair. The emergent pattern of <b>amensalism</b> {{is similar to}} “social loafing” (Levi 2014), which refers to {{a situation in which}} a group member shirks an order from a superior. The relationship between the startups-coordinators and news-coordinators pairs demonstrate {{the degree to which the}} coordinators can shirk their duties as long as the university startups are spontaneously established and the news stories are covered by the local media.|$|E
30|$|Stimulated by {{the works}} of Xiong et al. [1] and Chen et al. [14 – 19], in this paper, we propose the {{nonlinear}} <b>amensalism</b> model (1.3).|$|E
30|$|To {{ensure the}} {{uniqueness}} of introducing the concepts of commensalism and <b>amensalism,</b> the correlation matrix in Table  3 must {{be compared with the}} symbiotic interdependencies in Table  7. The results of the simple correlation matrix differ considerably from the results provided by the multiple negative binomial regressions and the subsequent identification of commensalism and <b>amensalism.</b> For example, although the products and startups variables are strongly correlated (0.6939), the present analysis finds a commensal relationship in which the startups variable exerts a beneficial effect on the products variable, but not one in which the reverse is true. Common types of analyses, such as panel data analyses and structural equation modeling, presuppose dependent and independent variables for which one of a pair of variables has a decisive effect on the other. On the contrary, the data analysis in the present study has the characteristics of exploratory research because it identifies specific broken symmetrical relationships that exhibit commensalism and <b>amensalism.</b>|$|E
30|$|Recently, some {{scholars}} started {{to focus on}} the influence of the harvesting on the <b>amensalism</b> or commensalism model [20, 25]. Chen [20] proposed a non-selective harvesting Lotka–Volterra <b>amensalism</b> model incorporating partial closure for the populations, investigated the existence, local stability, and the global stability property of the equilibrium solutions of the system and discussed the influence of the parameter m. Liu et al. [25] proposed a non-autonomous non-selective harvesting Lotka–Volterra commensalism model incorporating partial closure for the populations and investigated the extinction, partial survival, persistent property, and the global stability property of the solutions of the system.|$|E
30|$|During {{the last}} decade, many {{scholars}} investigated the dynamic behaviors of a commensalism model [1 – 13], while only recently did scholars {{pay attention to}} the dynamic behaviors of an <b>amensalism</b> model [1, 14 – 21].|$|E
40|$|Demonstrating {{different}} types of biotrophy fungi are outstanding within eukaryotes. All types of symbioses sensu deBary [1] (parasitism, mutualism, <b>amensalism,</b> commensalism, neutralism, antagonism) and all possible transient forms of these are represented by them. Furtherly the word „symbiosis” will be used, as commonly, in the strict concept as mutualistic symbiosis...|$|E
30|$|With {{the aim of}} the {{ecological}} sustainability and conservation of the species to be implemented in a long run, in this paper, we propose a non-selective harvesting Lotka–Volterra <b>amensalism</b> model incorporating partial closure for the populations, i.e., system (1.2), which {{can be seen as the}} generalization of system (1.1), and the model is more suitable for the real situation.|$|E
40|$|Apparent {{competition}} {{arises when}} two victim species negatively affect each other (-, -) by enhancing the equilibrium density or changing the foraging behaviour {{of a shared}} natural enemy. Shared enemies can also mediate non-reciprocal (-, 0) indirect effects, i. e. indirect <b>amensalism,</b> whenever one prey species is not affected {{by the presence of}} alternative prey. We review 34 studies on terrestrial and freshwater systems to evaluate the extent to which apparent competition has been perceived as a reciprocal (-, -) or non-reciprocal (-, 0) interaction. We found only three studies showing reciprocal effects between apparent competitors. Indirect <b>amensalism</b> was documented in 10 studies and could be inferred for 16 other cases (76 % in total). The remaining five studies provided insufficient data to determine the form of indirect interaction. The apparent prevalence of non-reciprocal enemy-mediated interactions resembles that observed for resource-based interspecific competition. Amensal indirect effects via shared predation may result from differences in population size, nutritional value, susceptibility to attack, or asynchronous dynamics of alternative prey, or the predator's feeding preferences. Moreover, experimental protocols may confound the actual form of apparent competition through short-term observations, incomplete designs, or biased consideration of conspicuous interactions, leading to reciprocal effects being overlooked. We conclude that, at present, it is still difficult to determine the relative role of apparent competition vs indirect <b>amensalism</b> in natural food webs because most published studies have failed to document in full interactions via shared enemies...|$|E
40|$|Microorganisms {{interact}} with plants because plants offer a wide diversity of habitats including the phyllosphere (aerial plant part), the rhizosphere (zone of {{influence of the}} root system), and the endosphere (internal transport system). Interactions of epiphytes, rhizophytes or endophytes may be detrimental or beneficial for either the microorganism or the plant and may be classified as neutralism, commensalism, synergism, mutualism, <b>amensalism,</b> competition or parasitis...|$|E
30|$|Consider {{the case}} in which each of the {{instrumental}} variables in the 2 SLS may exhibit further interactions with the others, which {{may well be the}} case for UBG alliances. As a logical step to investigate the stochastic interdependence and to identify commensalism and <b>amensalism,</b> the negative binomial regression must be iterated n times to yield a set of estimations for n variables. This step determines the existence of endogeneity among the n variables.|$|E
30|$|The {{inclusion}} of the ecological concepts of commensalism and <b>amensalism</b> extends the theoretical scope {{of the field of}} strategic cooperative management. In contrast to the two parties in a bilateral relationship, two parties in a cooperative game with multiple players can interact with unbalanced payoffs. The payoffs of these two parties can be offset by the other players’ payoffs. The concept of knowledge specificity addresses this issue of decoding endogenous reciprocity in the triple helix.|$|E
30|$|If αβ>δ_ 2 (β+δ _ 1), {{then for}} large enough k (k {{is close to}} 1) {{inequality}} (3.14) can hold, and from Lemma  2.1 {{we know that in}} this case, system (2.1) admits a unique positive equilibrium. In other words, if system (2.1) admits a unique positive equilibrium, then for the <b>amensalism</b> model, if the influence of the second species to the first species is limited, then the system still admits a unique globally asymptotically stable positive equilibrium.|$|E
30|$|Beyond {{predation}} and consensus, designer cellular communications {{can be used}} {{to create}} a wide spectrum of inter-species interactions. As revealed by metagenomics and 16 S pyrosequencing, microbial interactions in nature such as biofilms and the microbiome are extremely complicated and diverse - for instance, there can be parasitism, predation, commensalism, mutualism, competition, and <b>amensalism</b> within a single pair of species [102]. As one of the earliest efforts towards the programming of complicated cellular consortia, Weber and Fussenegger developed a set of pairwise interactions between E. coli and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [51].|$|E
30|$|A non-selective {{harvesting}} Lotka–Volterra <b>amensalism</b> model incorporating {{partial closure}} for the populations is proposed and studied in this paper. Local and global {{stability of the}} boundary and interior equilibria are investigated. By introducing the harvesting, the dynamic behaviors of the system become complicated. Depending on the fraction of the stock available for harvesting, the system maybe extinction, partial survival or two species may coexist in a stable state. Our results supplement and complement the main results of Xiong, Wang, and Zhang (Adv. Appl. Math. 5 (2): 255 - 261, 2016).|$|E
30|$|It {{brings to}} our {{attention}} that, to this day, still no scholars propose and study the dynamic behaviors of the <b>amensalism</b> model with stage structure. This motivated us to propose system (1.1). We mention here that at first sight, system (1.1) is very simple, However, the third equation is independent of x_ 1 and x_ 2, and hence {{it is impossible to}} investigate the stability property of the system by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function. Also, since this is a three-dimensional system, we cannot investigate the stability property of the system by using the Dulac criterion.|$|E
30|$|Among the 90 {{possible}} combinations, eight variable pairs exhibit mutualistic {{and three}} exhibit competitive relationships. If the theoretical constructs {{are confined to}} the traditional concepts of competition and cooperation, statistical analysis will identify only relationships that involve symmetrical patterns of variable pairs. Among our possible combinations, however, there are five cases of commensalism and two cases of <b>amensalism.</b> It is notable that the startups variable is involved in only one mutualistic relationship, that with URs (Fig.  1). The dichotomy of competition versus cooperation fails to depict the pathways of influence in the triple helix structure that create new startup ventures.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Network {{interpretation}} using correlations {{has several}} known difficulties. Firstly, the data structure has discrete counts with {{an excess of}} zeros creating non-normal non-continuous data. Secondly, correlations, often used as similarity measures in network inference, are not causal. Thirdly, there is a masking effect of mutualism on commensalism and competition on <b>amensalism</b> in ecological networks that interfere with interpretation (Faust and Raes, 2012). More explicitly, the symmetric nature of correlations (cor(X,Y) =cor(Y,X)) can mask the affect of the asymmetric ecology relationship (commensalism and <b>amensalism).</b> We aim to solve the third issue which may speed up targeted drug therapies or disease diagnosis based on specific relationships in gut microbiomes. Methods: We apply a non-symmetric correlation method, Gini Correlations which {{should serve as a}} better classifier of ecological relationships revealing a fuller picture of microbiomes. First, create simulated correlated and independent Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial data. Second, validate Gini correlations by comparing Gini with Pearson Spearman and Kendall correlations; calculate false positive rate, true positive rate, accuracy, ROC, AUC after applying Benjamini-Hochberg (1995) multiple testing correction. Simulation Result: Gini is consistent and out performs other methods for small sample sizes of 10 and 25 producing consistently low false positive rates across 64 + simulation settings as well as consistently high accuracy rates. When sample size is increased to 50 Gini performs as well as other methods. Real Data Result: For well-defined microbial communities Gini correlations found novel biologically and medically relevant relationships. However, Gini's ability to unmask non-symmetric ecological relationships is yet to be determined...|$|E
40|$|Microorganisms {{interact}} with plants because plants offer a wide diversity of habitats including the phyllosphere (aerial plant part), the rhizosphere (zone of {{influence of the}} root system), and the endosphere (internal transport system) [3, 5]. Interactions of epiphytes, rhizophytes or endophytes may be detrimental or beneficial for either the microorganism or the plant and may be classified as neutralism, commensalism, synergism, mutualism, <b>amensalism,</b> competition or parasitism. Plant-associated microorganisms play essential roles in agricultural and food safety, {{and contribute to the}} environmental equilibrium. Their study has been classi-cally based on cultivation-dependent methods, which often recover only 0. 01 – 10 % of direct counts.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} and study a two-species stage {{structured}} <b>amensalism</b> {{model with a}} cover for the first species. By developing a new analysis technique or, more precisely, by combining the differential inequality theory and the Lyapunov function method, we obtain sufficient conditions ensuring the global attractivity of positive and boundary equilibria, respectively. Our study shows that the final density of the first species is an increasing function of the partial cover, and if the stage structured species is globally asymptotically stable, then there exists a threshold such that if the cover is greater than this threshold, the species can still exist in the long run, whereas if the cover is too small, then the first species is driven to extinction.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a generalized two-species population dynamic model and analytically solve {{it for the}} <b>amensalism</b> and commensalism ecological interactions. These two-species models can be simplified to a one-species model with a time dependent extrinsic growth factor. With a one-species model with an effective carrying capacity one is able to retrieve the steady state solutions of the previous one-species model. The equivalence obtained between the effective carrying capacity and the extrinsic growth factor is complete only for a particular case, the Gompertz model. Here we unveil important aspects of sigmoid growth curves, which are relevant to growth processes and population dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between technologies is a salient {{feature of the}} literature on technical change and terms like 'dominant design' and 'technology lock-in' are part of the standard vocabulary and put competition among technologies in focus. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide an account of the wide range of interaction modes beyond competition that is prevalent in transition processes and to develop a conceptual framework to facilitate more detailed and nuanced descriptions of technology interaction. Besides competition, we identify five other basic modes of interaction: symbiosis, neutralism, parasitism, commensalism and <b>amensalism.</b> Further, we describe interaction as overlapping value chains. Defining a technology as a socio-technical system extending in material, organisational and conceptual dimensions allows for an even more detailed description of interaction. The conceptual framework is tested on and illustrated by a case study of interaction among alternative transport fuels in Sweden 1974 - 2004. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of many macrobenthic {{species in the}} back-reef lagoon of Discovery Bay, Jamaica {{can be related to}} a gradient in bottom stability. This gradient is defined by increasing rates of biogenic reworking and sediment resuspension {{in the western part of}} the lagoon. Infaunal diversity and coral growth decrease in the western, unstable areas. The infauna of the carbonate sand consists mainly of deposit feeders. In the western lagoon, the feeding activities of this group result in high biogenic reworking rates (up to 6 - 7 cm/week) producing loose surface sediment easily resuspended by waves. A maximum, mean resuspension rate of 19 mg/cm 2 /day was measured. Instability of the lagoon floor, resulting in high water turbidity, inhibits settlement and growth of most suspension feeders and reduces infaunal diversity and coral growth. Because stability of the soft-bottom is significantly influenced by deposit feeders, our observations represent an extension of the trophic group <b>amensalism</b> principle to tropical nearshore enviornments...|$|E
