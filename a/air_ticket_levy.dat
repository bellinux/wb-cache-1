40|$|The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) {{exemplify the}} {{enduring}} commitment and {{potential of the}} United Nations {{to serve as a}} catalyst for collective action in the cause of equitable and all round development of all nations and peoples. Indeed, the restructuring of the development apparatus as an important element of the larger challenge of the UN reform has acquired greater urgency in view of the manifest need to push for timely implementation of MDGs. Strengthening the role of the Economic and Social Council is a tricky issue that apparently puts the industrially advanced countries and the developing countries in opposite camps. Among the issues on which both the European developed and the Asian developing countries have showed interest, the idea of <b>air</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>levy</b> for raising resources for development is worthy of being pursued vigorously as part of the UN reform negotiations. Likewise, there is more than sufficient potential for old European Union countries like Germany and fast developing countries like China to bridge gaps in their policy objectives and work as partners in strengthen-ing the multilateral mechanism dedicated to development purposes. Development is rightly seen as the cornerstone of an equitable global system and an indispensable pre-condition for world peace and stability. UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, found broad international support when he pointed to the interconnectedness of security, development and human rights in his seminal report ‘In Larger Freedom: Towards Development, Security and Human Rights for All’ (UN 2005 a). Following his line of thought, member-states unanimously passe...|$|E

For example, as of June 2011, UNITAID had collected more than one billion dollars from 29 member countries, including several from Africa, through an <b>air</b> <b>ticket</b> solidarity <b>levy</b> to expand access to care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in 94 countries.|$|R
