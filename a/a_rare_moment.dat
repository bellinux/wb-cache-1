In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> <b>moment,</b> one that true performers strive for and don't find often enough to satisfy themselves.|$|E

On [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race", Wentz uses wartime-inspired metaphors to discuss their newfound popularity; he called the song [...] "kind of a tongue-in-cheek look at the way we are so addicted and obsessed with new arts, cultures and loves – {{to the point where it}} just becomes oversaturated." [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer..."

Corey Moss of MTV felt that the song {{was one of the most}} personal moments on Destiny Fulfilled in the sense that Beyoncé's then-relatively secret relationship with rapper Jay-Z was acknowledged [...] "on record for the first time". Moss further elaborated, [...] "Albeit minor, her [...] verse (about falling for a guy from the BK, as in Jay's Brooklyn stomping grounds) offers <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> <b>moment</b> of commentary on the couple, which has thus far only been chronicled by tabloid photographers." [...] The song opens with T.I. rhyming lines and glorifying the profound love [...] "between a thug and a thugette".

40|$|This paper scrutinizes <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> methodological <b>moment</b> when I found myself, an unseasoned {{black woman}} scholar, researching {{the lives of}} three white women. In this {{reflective}} process, I make a single point: that the locution of race is limiting if it persists in being a point of struggle for marginalized scholars. In so doing, I distinguish between race {{as the site of}} intellectual engagement and race as a point from which to engage in scholarship. I begin with a brief explanation of how I came to take the decision to research three white women and of (dis) locating myself as other to the respondents. I then examine my actions in the context of concerns raised by other black scholars in their engagement with the academic establishment. Finally, I draw on the works of feminist scholars and argue that politicized and strategic understandings of otherness can potentially create challenging means for intellectual activism.

2500|$|With its {{aesthetics}} and its tone, Vinul de viață lungă {{is an unusual}} sample of militant literature, contrasting {{with the work of}} socialist or Poporanist writers from Cocea's lifetime. French historian Bernard Camboulives notes that Cocea made a point of reacting against Poporanists' call to preserve [...] "Romanian specificity". Similarly, George Călinescu notes that the Poporanist setting is given an original twist in Cocea's novel, with the erotic interludes.

Holly leads a squad consisting of Root, Artemis and Butler, and herself above ground to France to interrogate Luc. Butler breaks into {{his apartment in}} Paris, but finds only a heavily mesmerized Luc, counterfeit Euros, and a fairy handgun. Butler neutralises Luc, ensures the Parisian knows nothing of the goblin use of batteries, and leaves the private eye to be arrested. Although Artemis is concerned by the ease of the operation, he puts aside his concerns to travel to Murmansk with Butler, Root and Holly to attempt a rescue for Artemis Fowl I. Cudgeon sees this as the perfect opportunity to kill Root, and sends a goblin [...] to ambush the party. The goblins nearly succeed in killing the four as all fairy weapons currently in use by the force have just been disabled by Koboi. The resulting attack leaves Butler unconscious and trapped under rubble from an overhang with Commander Root. Holly and Artemis use a nuclear train to free Root and Butler, but the group is then forced to perform an emergency healing when the train door cuts off Holly's trigger finger. Holly questions Artemis about his father and {{how he came to}} be so ruthless in the events of the previous book, and, in <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> <b>moment</b> of sincerity, Artemis admits he made a mistake, a sign of his moral development that continues through the series.|$|E
