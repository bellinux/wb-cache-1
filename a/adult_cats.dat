5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E

40|$|Neurogenesis {{occurs in}} some regions of the adult {{mammalian}} brain and gives rise to neurons integrated into functional networks. In pathological or postlesional conditions, neurogenesis and astrogenesis can also occur, as demonstrated in the deafferented vestibular nuclei after unilateral vestibular neurectomy in the <b>adult</b> <b>cat.</b> Here we report that in cats infused with an antimitotic drug, cytosine-[beta]-D arabinofuranoside (AraC), the number of GAD 67 and GFAP immunoreactive cells is increased, despite the total mitotic activity blockade observed in the deafferented vestibular nuclei after unilateral vestibular neurectomy. At the behavioral level, recovery of posturo-locomotor function was drastically delayed, and no alteration of the horizontal spontaneous nystagmus was observed. These cellular and behavioral results suggest that reactive neurogenesis and astrogenesis might contribute highly to vestibular compensation in the <b>adult</b> <b>cat,</b> probably by accelerating the recovery of vestibular functions...|$|R
50|$|This {{technique}} can {{be useful}} when attempting to treat or move an uncooperative cat. However, since an <b>adult</b> <b>cat</b> is heavier than a kitten, a pet cat should never be carried by the scruff, but should instead have its weight supported at the rump and hind legs, and at the chest and front paws.|$|R
25|$|The energy {{requirements}} for <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> range from 60–70 kcal metabolizable energy/kg body weight {{per day for}} inactive cats to 80–90 kcal/kg BW for active cats. Kittens at five weeks of age require 250 kcal/kg BW. The requirement drops with age, to 100 kcal/kg BW at 30 weeks and to the adult requirement at about 50 weeks. Gestating cats require about 90–100 kcal/kg BW and lactating cats 90–270 kcal/kg BW depending on litter size.|$|E
25|$|In a 2013 {{study of}} {{participants}} from the United Kingdom, rescuers {{tended to be}} more willing than veterinarians to attempt to tame adult feral cats. Veterinarians {{tended to be more}} opposed to this practice, with some expressing concerns for the welfare of such a cat in a home environment. In a 2010 study of veterinarians and rescuers in the United States, 66% of respondents had socialization programs for kittens, and 8% for <b>adult</b> <b>cats.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kittens develop {{very quickly}} from {{about two weeks}} of age until their seventh week. Their {{coordination}} and strength improve. They play-fight with their litter-mates and begin to explore the world outside the nest or den. They learn to wash themselves and others as well as play hunting and stalking games, showing their inborn ability as predators. These innate skills are developed by the kittens' mother or other <b>adult</b> <b>cats,</b> who bring live prey to the nest. Later, the <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> demonstrate hunting techniques for the kittens to emulate. As they reach {{three to four weeks}} old, the kittens are gradually weaned and begin to eat solid food, with weaning usually complete by six to eight weeks. Kittens generally begin to lose their baby teeth around three months of age, and have a complete set of adult teeth by nine months. Kittens live primarily on solid food after weaning, but usually continue to suckle from time to time until separated from their mothers. Some mother cats will scatter their kittens as early as three months of age, while others continue to look after them until they approach sexual maturity.|$|E

25|$|The {{bacterium}} Capnocytophaga canimorsus {{can pose}} {{a risk of}} severe diseases in high-risk {{groups such as the}} elderly, transplant recipients, cancer patients and immunocompromised individuals. Transmission of the infection to the human from the cat has been attributed to kissing the cat, providing care that exposes the person to the body fluids of the cat and sleeping with the cat. Kittens are more likely to transmit the bacterium than <b>adult</b> <b>cats.</b> Exposure to cats with this infection has been associated with meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Feline lower {{urinary tract}} {{disease is a}} term {{that is used to}} cover many {{problems}} of the feline urinary tract, including stones and cystitis. The term feline urologic syndrome is an older term which is still sometimes used for this condition. It is a common disease in <b>adult</b> <b>cats,</b> though it can strike in young cats too. It may present as any of a variety of urinary tract problems, and can lead to a complete blockage of the urinary system, which if left untreated is fatal.|$|E
25|$|Kittens {{require a}} high-calorie diet that {{contains}} more protein than the diet of <b>adult</b> <b>cats.</b> Young orphaned kittens require cat milk {{every two to}} four hours, and they need physical stimulation to defecate and urinate. Cat milk replacement is manufactured to feed to young kittens, because cow's milk does not provide all the necessary nutrients. Human-reared kittens {{tend to be very}} affectionate with humans as adults and sometimes more dependent on them than kittens reared by their mothers, but they can also show volatile mood swings and aggression. Depending on the age at which they were orphaned and how long they were without their mothers, these kittens may be severely underweight and can have health problems later in life, such as heart conditions. The compromised immune system of orphaned kittens (from lack of antibodies found naturally in the mother's milk) can make them especially susceptible to infections, making antibiotics a necessity.|$|E

25|$|As to the {{toxicity}} of philodendrons in cats, {{the evidence is}} conflicting. In one study, 72 cases of cat poisonings were examined, of which 37 resulted {{in the death of}} the cat. The symptoms of the poisoned cats included excitability, spasms, seizures, renal failure, and encephalitis. However, in another study, three cats were tube fed Philodendron cordatum and showed no signs of acute poisoning. In this study, two <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> and one kitten were fed a puréed leaf and water mixture, observed afterward, then euthanized, and finally a necropsy was performed. Dosages of 2.8, 5.6, and 9.1 g/kg were used, with the highest dose administered being considerably more than any house cat could consume. The cats showed none of the symptoms found in past epidemiological studies and appeared normal. Necropsies showed nothing that would suggest toxicity. The past epidemiological studies have been suggested to be wrong, since sick cats may be inclined to eat plants to alleviate their illnesses. If this were the case, then such studies would be incorrectly attributing the sickness of the cats to the philodendrons. The forced feeding study may have failed to show signs of philodendron toxicity because the tube feeding bypassed the mouth and hence minimized the typical signs of irritation.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} several weeks, kittens are unable to urinate or defecate without being stimulated by their mother. They are also unable to {{regulate}} their body temperature {{for the first three}} weeks, so kittens born in temperatures less than [...] can die from hypothermia if their mother does not keep them warm. The mother's milk is very important for the kittens' nutrition and proper growth. This milk transfers antibodies to the kittens, which helps protect them against infectious disease. Newborn kittens are unable to produce concentrated urine, and so have a very high requirement for fluids. Kittens open their eyes about seven to ten days after birth. At first, the retina is poorly developed and vision is poor. Kittens are not able to see as well as <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> until about ten weeks after birth.|$|E
2500|$|Like all pythons, the African rock python is nonvenomous {{and kills}} its prey by constriction. After {{gripping}} the prey, the snake coils around it, tightening its coils {{every time the}} victim breathes out.

The African rock python feeds on a variety of large rodents, monkeys, warthogs, antelopes, fruit bats, monitor lizards, and even crocodiles in forest areas, and on rats, poultry, dogs, and goats in suburban areas. Occasionally, it may eat the cubs of big cats such as leopards, lions, and cheetahs, cubs of hyenas, and puppies of wild dogs such as jackals and Cape hunting dogs.. However, these encounters are very rare, as the <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> can easily kill pythons or fend them off.

40|$|Protein kinase C (PKC) {{consists}} {{of a family of}} different subtypes encoded by different PKC genes. We investigated the distribution of PKC beta 1 and PKC beta 2 in the visual system of the <b>adult</b> <b>cat</b> by in situ hybridization using oligonucleotide probes complementary to the PKC beta 1 and PKC beta 2 mRNAs, two splicing variants of the same gene transcript. In the primary visual cortex PKC beta 1 and PKC beta 2 were both present. The laminar distribution patterns found for the two PKC subtypes were identical. A remarkable finding was the difference between the laminar distribution of the PKC beta s in areas 17 and 18 when compared with area 19. In all three areas the highest expression levels were found in layer VI, moderately high levels were found in layers II, III and V, while layer I was devoid of signal. In area 17 and 18 layer IV stood out by its low PKC beta signal. In sharp contrast, layer IV of area 19 was indiscernible from the superficial layers because of an evenly high signal.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was generally}} accepted that the only neurotransmitter to be released at central synapses of somatic motoneurons was acetylcholine. However, studies on young mice (P 0 - 10) have provided pharmacological evidence indicating that glutamate may act as a co-transmitter with acetylcholine at synapses between motoneurons and Renshaw cells. We performed a series of anatomical experiments on axon collaterals obtained from intracellularly labelled motoneurons from an <b>adult</b> <b>cat</b> and labelled by retrograde transport in adult rats to determine if glutamate is co-localised with acetylcholine by these terminals. We could find no evidence {{for the presence of}} vesicular glutamate transporters in motoneuron axon terminals of either species. In addition, we were unable to establish any obvious relationship between motoneuron terminals and the GluR 2 subunit of the AMPA receptor. However we did observe a population of cholinergic terminals in lamina VII which did not originate from motoneurons but were immunoreactive for the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 and formed appositions to GluR 2 subunits. These were smaller than motoneuron terminals and, unlike them, formed no relationship with Renshaw cells. The evidence suggests that glutamate does not act as a co-transmitter with acetylcholine at central synapses of motoneurons in the <b>adult</b> <b>cat</b> and rat. However, glutamate is present in a population of cholinergic terminals which probably originate from interneurons where its action is via an AMPA recepto...|$|R
