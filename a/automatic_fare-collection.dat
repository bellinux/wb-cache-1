50|$|Four {{lines have}} been {{finalized}} as of 2012. The expansion project (in accordance with Chinese standards for the design and construction of metros) will use around 70 percent local labor and materials. Trains will be equipped with ATO, and stations will use an <b>automatic</b> <b>fare-collection</b> system. When lines open, they will initially operate at 38,000 p/h/d; over time, {{with the addition of}} more trains and decreasing headway, a capacity of 43,200 p/h/d is planned. The expansion program will ease traffic in Dalian (improving travel around the city for the 12th National Games of China, which will be held in Liaoning in 2013).|$|E
50|$|In January 2007, Moscow Metro began {{replacing}} {{magnetic cards}} with contactless disposable tickets based on NXP's MIFARE Ultralight technology. Ultralight tickets {{are available for}} a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards stopped 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contact-less <b>automatic</b> <b>fare-collection</b> system.|$|E
50|$|With {{the failure}} of the Go Mumbai card, The National Urban Transport Policy has envisaged a common {{mobility}} card — a single ticketing card for public transport — that can be used anywhere in the country. It can be used on national, state, and city modes of transit and will have a common framework. “For rolling out a common mobility card and an <b>automatic</b> <b>fare-collection</b> system across India, {{it is important to have}} national standard specifications so that various systems can be integrated seamlessly,” said S.K. Lohia, officer on special duty (urban transport), in the central ministry of urban development. He has written to all public transport undertakings in the country, including the chairman of the railway board and operators of the metro and monorail systems. A company owned by the finance ministry has already embarked on the project following guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India. This national common mobility card (NCMC), named 'More', was unveiled by Union Urban Development Minister Kamal Nath by December 2011 and was expected to take five years before the card becomes operational throughout the country.|$|E
