50|$|A modern {{example of}} decartelization is the {{economic}} restructuring of Germany {{after the fall}} of the Third Reich in 1945. To truly understand the term “decartelization” requires familiarity with the term “cartel”. A cartel is a formal (explicit) agreement among firms. Cartels usually occur in an oligopolistic industry (oligopoly), where there are a small number of sellers, and usually involve homogeneous products (Homogeneity and heterogeneity). Cartel members may agree on such matters as price fixing, total industry output, market shares, <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers,</b> allocation of territories, bid rigging, establishment of common sales agencies (sales agents), and the division of property or profits or combination of these. The aim of such collusion is to increase individual member's profits by reducing competition. Competition laws forbid cartels. Identifying and breaking up cartels is an important part of the competition policy in most countries, although proving the existence of a cartel is rarely easy, as firms are usually not so careless as to put agreements to collude on paper.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{propose a}} model for {{locating}} a fixed number of multiple-server service centers or facilities that may become congested.

All the customers arriving at the facilities must be served, {{up to a certain}} maximum line length. The travel cost in which customers incur {{is a function of the}} length of the trip to the facility, while the congestion cost at a facility is a general function of the number <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> waiting on line or being served at the facility.

The cost of operating such systems is significantly affected by decisions on the number and locations of the distribution centers, the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to each center, and the routing strategy.

40|$|It is {{strategically}} {{important to}} design efficient and environmentally friendly distribution networks. In this {{paper we propose}} a new methodology for solving the capacitated facility location problem (CFLP) based on combining an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm with Lagrangian Relaxation for modelling large problem instances where financial costs and CO_ 2 emissions are considered simultaneously. Two levels of decision making are required: 1) which facilities to open from a set of potential sites, and 2) which customers to assign to which open facilities without violating their capacity. We choose SEAMO 2 (Simple Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization 2) as our multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to determine which facilities to open, because of its fast execution speed. For the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to open facilities we use a Lagrangian Relaxation technique.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for short-term scheduling of multi-stage multi-product batch plants. The model determines the optimal sequencing and the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> orders to non-identical processing units by minimizing the earliness and tardiness of order completion. This {{is a highly}} combinatorial problem, especially when sequence-dependent relations are considered such as the setup time between consecutive orders. A common approach to this scheduling problem relies on the application of tetra-index binary variables, i. e. (order, order, stage, unit) to represent all the combinations of order sequences and assignments to units in the various stages. This generates {{a huge number of}} binary variables and, as a consequence, much time is required for solutions. This paper proposes a novel formulation that replaces the tetra-index binary variables by one set of tri-index binary variables (order, order, stage) without losing the model's generality. By the elimination of the unit index, the new formulation requires considerably fewer binary variables, thus significantly shortening the solution time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this research, the location-allocation problem is studied under demand uncertainty. The {{purposes of this study}} were to specify the optimal number and location of distribution centers and to determine the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> demands to distribution centers. The main feature of this research is solving the model with unknown demand function which is suitable with the real-world problems. To consider the uncertainty, a set of possible scenarios for customer demands is created based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The coefficient of variation of costs is mentioned as a measure of risk and the most stable structure for firm's distribution network is defined based on the concept of robust optimization. The best structure is identified using genetic algorithms and 14 % reduction in total supply chain costs is the outcome. Moreover, it imposes the least cost variation created by fluctuation in customer demands (such as epidemic diseases outbreak in some areas of the country) to the logistical system. It is noteworthy that this research is done in one of the largest pharmaceutical distribution firms in Iran.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{management}} of a multi-stage production-distribution system {{is one of the}} most critical problems in logistics and in facility management. Companies need to be able to evaluate and design different configurations for their logistic networks as quickly as possible. This means coordinating the entire supply chain effectively in order to minimize costs and simultaneously optimize facilities location, the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> demand to production/distribution centers, the inbound and outbound transportation activities, the product flows between production and/or warehousing facilities, the reverse logistics activities, etc. Full optimization of supply chain is achieved by integrating strategic, tactical, and operational decision-making in terms of the design, management, and control of activities. The cost-based and mixed-integer programming model presented in this study has been developed to support management in making the following decisions: the number of facilities (e. g. warehousing systems, distribution centers), the choice of their locations and the assignment <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> demand to them, and also incorporate tactical decisions regarding inventory control, production rates, and service-level determination in a stochastic environment.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} design and {{development}} of an inventory model for manufacturers with constant production rates considering location and allocation decisions in a three-level supply chain. In this supply chain, the demands of customers and the lead times {{are assumed to be}} uncertain. Therefore, each distribution center retains some amount of safety stock to provide suitable service level for customers. The proposed non-linear model aims to minimize location and inventory costs of distribution centers, manufacturers and transportation costs subject to relevant constraints. To solve the model, an efficient imperialist competitive algorithm and a Tabu search algorithm, each using variable neighborhood search, are proposed. The model outputs are decisions such as which distribution centers and manufacturers are opened, the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to distribution centers, and distribution centers to manufacturers.

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to a location allocation problem {{have focused on}} the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to a distribution center (DC) according to some arbitrary geographical boundaries (e. g., administrative zones and census districts), which usually incurs underuse or overcrowding of these centers. Location allocation with balancing requirements (e. g., balanced workload of service among DCs) has therefore been addressed. A distribu-tion strategy with balanced-workload allocation aims to be cost-efficient and to improve customer service. A novel bilevel programming model is presented that minimizes the cost of the total distribution network {{and at the same time}} balances the workload of each DC for the delivery of products to its customers. A genetic algorithm–based approach was developed to cope with the bilevel model, and it was tested on a best real-istic data set.

In this paper we are concerned with {{a particular type of}} facility location problem in which there exist two echelons of facilities; Each facility in the second echelon has limited capacity and can be supplied by only one facility in the first echelon. Each customer is serviced by only one facility in the second echelon.

40|$|Nowadays, {{competition}} {{takes place}} in an environment characterized by high market shifting, rapid new technology development and introduction, global competition and customers who need focalization. Therefore, supply chain networks are becoming more dynamic and turbulent than ever before. The Distribution Centre (DC) is an important node in a supply chain network in maintaining the flow of goods and materials among manufacturers and customers. The capability of the DC to maintain {{the same level of}} performance in a highly dynamic scenario allows improvement of the competitiveness of the supply chain network. The focus of this chapter is on the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to the DCs in very dynamic environments. A Multi-Agent System (MAS) is designed, in order to implement an architecture that is capable of rapid response to changing market conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} solving the multi-depot location-routing problem (MDLRP). Since several unrealistic assumptions, such as homogeneous #eet type and unlimited number of available vehicles, are typically made concerning this problem, a mathematical formulation is given in which these assumptions are relaxed. Since the inherent complexity of the LRP problem {{makes it impossible to}} solve the problem on a larger scale, the original problem is divided into two sub-problems, i. e., the location-allocation problem, and the general vehicle routing problem, respectively. Each sub-problem is then solved in a sequential and iterative manner by the simulated annealing algorithm embedded in the general framework for the problemsolving procedure. Test problems from the literature and newly created problems are used to test the proposed method. The results indicate that this method performs well in terms of the solution quality and run time consumed. In addition, the setting of parameters throughout the solution procedure for obtaining quick and favorable solutions is also suggested. Scope and purpose In many logistic environments managers must make decisions such as location for distribution centers (DC), <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to each service area, and transportation plans connecting customers.

40|$|Many {{companies}} {{are confronted with}} the problem of creating xed master routes for a period of more than a day either for geographically dispersed sales representatives or for eets of delivery vehicles which operate from a single depot. This involves the assignment <b>of</b> the company's <b>customers</b> to the sales reps/vehicles as well as visit pro les. For the problems de ned herein, these <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to a service group must remain xed {{for the duration of the}} planning period. A pro le represents a valid combination of visit days for a customer as well as a proportion of distributable workload (time for sales reps or mass for delivery vehicles) for each visit. For the sales rep problem, there is the option to solve for the optimal number of salesmen and their home locations if they are not known. Also, routes for the salesmen may include a new feature, sleep-outs, which are governed by rules indicating possible combinations of nights spent away from home as well as sleep-out locations. These combinatorial optimization problems are solved using exact and heuristic branch-and-bound algorithms which also assists in de ning the problem complexity.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Facility location-allocation {{decisions}} and inventory stocking decisions {{are very important}} in spare parts logistics. Both sets of decisions affect total costs {{in the system and}} the service levels that can be achieved by establishing distances between customers and distribution centers (DCs) in facility location-allocation, and by determining the availability of parts in inventory decisions. There is a trade-off between total costs and service levels that decision makers have to explicitly take into account when designing a spare parts logistics (SPL) system. The integration of the location-inventory decisions along with the multiple objectives will lead to an approach in which the sub-optimality of solutions obtained separately using a sequential approach can be overcome. However, this integration also increases the complexity of the problem. In this research, a nonlinear multi-objective optimization model was formulated in which the objectives are to minimize cost and maximize the service level. The goal is determining the number and location <b>of</b> DCs, the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> demands to DCs, and the safety stock for parts to maintain at DCs. A time-based service level requirement is considered by allocating customers to DCs that can serve demands <b>of</b> those <b>customers</b> within a specified time window. To solve this formulation, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) solution method was implemented and used to obtain Pareto optimal solutions for problems of different sizes. A full factorial experimental design was implemented to analyze the impact of factors on the problem and the performance of the solution approach.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{integrated}} logistics network design and inventory stocking problem as {{characterized by the}} interdependency of the design and stocking decisions in service parts logistics. These two sets of decisions have been usually considered sequentially in practice, and the associated problems have been tackled separately in the research literature. The overall problem is typically further complicated due to time-based service constraints that provide lower limits for the percentages of demand satisfied within specified time windows. We introduce an optimization model that explicitly captures the interdependency between network design (location of facilities, and <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to facilities) and inventory stocking decisions (stock levels and their corresponding stochastic fill rates), and present computational results from our extensive experiments that investigate the effects of several factors including demand levels, time-based service levels, and costs. We show that the integrated approach can provide significant cost savings over the decoupled approach (solving the network design first and inventory stocking next), shifting the whole efficient frontier curve between cost and service level to superior regions. We also show that the decoupled and integrated approaches may generate totally different solutions, even {{in the number of}} located facilities and in their locations, magnifying the importance of considering inventory as part of the network design models...|$|E
30|$|The {{modeling}} {{process begins}} with the generation of the set of fifteen scenarios based on the common basic network data. Then, the warehouses are located, and customers are allocated for each scenario through the optimization of transport costs. The optimization of transport costs is a two-step process. First, the geographical location of the warehouses on a continuous solution space and the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> are solved by the minimization of outbound transport cost with a heuristics based on Stolletz and Stolletz [35]. Therefore, the total demand is divided geographically into as many regions as warehouses are modeled. Each warehouse {{is located at the}} center of gravity of its demand region, considering the throughput to each customer weighted with the variable outbound transport costs, which are calculated {{on the basis of a}} given delivery frequency and the oil price–dependent transport tariffs. Afterward, the warehouses are linked to the source network through direct transports, and both a delivery frequency and a transport tariff are defined for each of them. Therefore, a subsequent mathematical optimization minimizes the total transport costs of the network, including inbound and outbound transport costs, by the possible relocation of the warehouses. Thus, higher inbound transport costs lead to the relocation of the warehouses near to the source, while higher outbound costs to their relocation near the customers.|$|E
40|$|Efficient goods {{distribution}} planning {{is vital to}} ensure high business revenues for logistics operators and minimize negative impacts on the environment. In this thesis, we address three main problems related to {{goods distribution}} planning in urban areas namely customer allocation, order scheduling, and vehicle routing. A three step approach is proposed. In the first step, we use Nearest Neighbour and Tabu Search for balanced <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to logistics depots. In the second step, Genetic Algorithm approach is used to perform order scheduling at each depot for the allocated customers. In the third and the last step, we perform vehicle allocations and generate fastest paths for goods delivery to customers using modified Dijkstra’s algorithm. All these decisions are made considering realistic conditions associated with goods distribution in urban areas such as presence of congestion, municipal regulations, for example vehicle sizing, timing and access regulations etc. The objective is to minimize total distribution costs of logistics operators under these constraints. A prototype decision support system is developed integrating the proposed approaches for goods distribution planning in urban areas. The strength of the proposed decision support system {{is its ability to}} generate fast and efficient solutions for balanced customer allocation, dynamic order scheduling, vehicle allocation considering environmental constraints and fastest path generation under dynamic traffic conditions.
