40|$|Dengue {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} vector borne diseases endangering human health. The burden of dengue will continue to increase if more effective methods of controlling dengue are not found. Therefore, understanding the transmission dynamics of dengue is important so that efficient and effective control programmes can be developed. I focused my research in Malaysia, particularly Selangor, one of the state with the highest reported dengue incidence. In this thesis, I showed two methods of estimating dengue transmission parameter. First was estimating the force of infection from age-stratified case notification data. Second, using a basic catalytic model, I estimated the force of infection and R 0 from the seroprevalence data. Using both methods, my force of infection and R 0 estimates for Selangor was comparable with other SE Asia countries. I used the parameters estimated from our data in a model of dengue transmission to assess the potential impact of dengue vaccination in Malaysia. I parameterised my model using the results from the phase 3 clinical trials of the leading vaccine candidate (CYD-TDV). My result shows that for a vaccine with the complex profile of efficacy shown by CYD-TDV, the impact of vaccination is critically hinge on the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> and the transmission intensity of dengue (R 0) in the vaccinated population. Our results have shown that as R 0 decreases, the optimal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> increase. My model also shows that vaccination can have a moderate impact on dengue disease incidence, but not sufficient to stop transmission except perhaps in very low transmission settings.

Methods. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted among parents with a daughter aged 10 - 12 years.

Trade-offs were quantified between four vaccination programme aspects: degree of protection against cervical cancer, duration of protection, risk of serious side-effects, and <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Results: Total response rate was 302 / 983 (31 %). All aspects influenced respondents' preferences for HPV vaccination (p < 0. 05). Respondents preferred vaccination at age 14 years instead of at a younger age.

We measured MenC polysaccharide-specific IgM, the IgG 1 and IgG 2 subclasses and determined the avidity of the IgG antibodies.

This disease causes intense pain which can affect {{quality of life and}} has a substantial economic burden. A vaccine is available to prevent the disease, and currently this is the best tool available for combating this disease. However, the vaccine does not have lifelong durability, and it has less efficacy in older people. Therefore, it is important to make good decisions on how and when to administer this vaccine so that we maximize both its benefit and our available resources. This dissertation uses the techniques of cost-effectiveness analysis, stochastic dynamic optimization, and value of information analysis to focus on decision making about how to best use the vaccine. First, cost-effectiveness was completed to show the value at different <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Stochastic dynamic optimization built upon the cost-effectiveness models to determine the optimal time to administer the vaccine. Finally, value of information analysis examined how the optimal policy may change if perfect information were available on some of the key uncertain parameters. Results indicate that age 67 is the most cost-effective age to vaccinate men and women. The optimal policy results from the stochastic dynamic program suggest {{it would be best to}} start vaccinating men and women at age 66 and to stop at 74 (men) or 77 (women). Results show that there is some value to determining the additional information on key uncertain model parameters. However, the value we can gain is unlikely to be worth the investment in the additional research that would be required. Overall this dissertation shows that the recommended policies in the US <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> at 60 and older could be sub-optimal.

The Committee argued that the prevalence of hepatitis B carriers among the native Dutch population is so low (0. 07 %) that universal vaccination is not relevant. In contrast, vaccination was advised for children from parents who had immigrated from middle- and high-endemic countries to the Netherlands, because horizontal transmission is an important route of transmission among these people, as it is in their country of origin. This concerns an estimated 15 % of the entire population. For the rest of the Dutch population the risk of horizontal transmission was considered negligible.

Seven focus groups and four paired interviews were conducted with 40 young people aged 16 - 26, from BAME communities: South Asian/Black African/Arab, Muslim/Sikh/Christian. Stimulus material was utilised to explore understandings of HPV, experiences of vaccine programme, views on universal vaccination. Results: Contrasting attitudes and perceptions across ethnicity and gender were observed: openness of Black African participants to information and partnership working; barriers to intergenerational dialogue expressed by Asian men; intracultural and intercultural opportunities for information-sharing proposed by Asian women. Participants identified solutions for sensitising formative public health interventions - how they are to be delivered and in which contexts including a flexible approach to offering information and the vaccine. Conclusions: Public health strategies should consider including: a staged and tailored approach to information-giving throughout school and beyond; extending the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> and including boys being offered the vaccine at a culturally acceptable stage and age; developing neutral and destigmatised messages in partnership with communities/elders; employing multi-media information campaigns for young men and women...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundMeasles is {{a highly}} {{infectious}} illness requiring herd immunity of 95 % to interrupt transmission. Measles is targeted for elimination in China, which has not reached elimination goals despite high vaccination coverage. We developed a population profile of measles immunity among residents aged 0 – 49 years in Tianjin, China. MethodsParticipants were either from community population registers or community immunization records. Measles IgG antibody status was assessed using dried blood spots. We examined the association between measles IgG antibody status and independent variables including urbanicity, sex, vaccination, measles history, and age. Results 2818 people were enrolled. The proportion measles IgG negative increased from 50. 7 % for infants aged 1 month to 98. 3 % for those aged 7 months. After 8 months, the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> eligibility, the proportion of infants and children measles IgG negative decreased. Overall, 7. 8 % of participants 9 months of age or older lacked measles immunity including over 10 % of those 20 – 39 years. Age and vaccination status {{were significantly associated with}} measles IgG status in the multivariable model. The odds of positive IgG status were 0. 337 times as high for unvaccinated compared to vaccinated (95 % CI: 0. 217, 0. 524). ConclusionsThe proportion of persons in Tianjin, China immune to measles was lower than herd immunity threshold with less than 90 % of people aged 20 – 39 years demonstrating protection. Immunization programs in Tianjin have been successful in vaccinating younger age groups although high immunization coverage in infants and children alone would not provide protective herd immunity, given the large proportion of non-immune adults...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{epidemiological}} data on maximal hepatitis A (HA) morbidity values shift to older age groups, including adolescents at the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 15 – 19 years {{and young adults}} at the age 20 – 39 years, and decreasing significance of children as a risk group have been published. These phenomena have not been well studied {{and do not have}} satisfactory explanations. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate <b>age</b> dependent characteristics <b>of</b> epidemiological process of HA in Russian Federation and its federal districts during the current period of time and to determine the necessity and appropriate <b>age</b> <b>of</b> scheduled <b>vaccination</b> against this infection in children. The comparative analysis of age-dependent values of HA morbidity (percentage of children and adults, the rate of adults and children values, intensity) of the population in federal districts of Russian Federation in 1999, 2001 and 2010 was performed. It was established, that HA is still a significant challenge in children health in Russian Federation. The percentage of children at the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 0 – 14 years among the developed the disease in 2010 (28 %) does not differ significantly from that in 1999 (40 %). In Far Eastern, Siberian and North-Caucasian federal districts the children morbidity constantly 4 – 6 times exceeds the respective values in adults. Such characteristics of HA epidemiology indicate the necessity <b>of</b> scheduled <b>vaccination</b> <b>of</b> children against this infection.   <br /...|$|R
40|$|To {{ascertain}} the economic feasibility of a pediatric tetravalent dengue vaccine, we developed and calibrated a cost-effectiveness model of vaccinating children at 15 months in SE Asia using a societal perspective. We assumed that full immunization would require two doses at prices of $ 0. 50 and $ 10 {{each in the}} public and private sectors, respectively. The gross cost per 1000 population (<b>of</b> all <b>ages)</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vaccination</b> program would be US $ 154. Due to projected savings in dengue treatment, the net cost per capita would be only $ 17 (89 % below the gross cost). The cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) saved by a pediatric vaccine would be $ 50, making the potential vaccine highly cost-effective. Eventually, vaccination may be able to replace environmental control as a strategy for dengue prevention and be cost saving...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It {{was long}} speculated {{that there could}} be under-immunized pockets in the war {{affected}} Northern part of Sri Lanka relative to other areas. With the cessation of hostilities following the military suppression of the rebellion, opportunities have arisen to appraise the immunization status of children in areas of re-settlement in former war ravaged districts. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study to describe the coverage and <b>age</b> appropriateness <b>of</b> infant <b>vaccinations</b> in a former conflict district during the phase of re-settlement. The target population comprised all children of re-settled families in the <b>age</b> group <b>of</b> 12 – 23 months in the district. We selected a study sample of 300 children from among the target population using the WHO’s 30 cluster EPI survey method. Trained surveyors collected data using a structured checklist. The infant vaccination status was ascertained by reviewing vaccination records in the Child Health Development Record or any other alternative documentary evidence. Results The survey revealed that the proportion of fully vaccinated children in the district was 91 %. For individual vaccines, it ranged from 92 % (measles) to 100 % (BCG, DPT/OPV 1). However, the <b>age</b> appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> was less than 50 % for all antigens except for BCG (94 %). The maximum number of days <b>of</b> delay <b>of</b> <b>vaccinations</b> ranged from 21 days for BCG to 253 days for measles. Age appropriate vaccination rates significantly differed for DPT/OPV 1 - 3 and measles during the conflict and post-conflict stages while it did not for the BCG. Age appropriate vaccination rates were significantly higher for DPT/OPV 1 - 3 during the conflict while for the measles it was higher in the post conflict stage. Conclusions Though the vaccination coverage for infant vaccines in the war affected Kilinochchi district was similar to other districts in the country, it masked a disparity in terms of low age-appropriateness of infant immunizations given in field settings. This finding underscores the need for investigation of underlying reasons and introduction of remedial measures in the stage of restoring Primary Health Care services in the ex-conflict zone. </p...|$|R
