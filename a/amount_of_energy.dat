5|$|The total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> that a star can {{generate}} through nuclear fusion of hydrogen {{is limited by}} the amount of hydrogen fuel that can be consumed at the core. For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated at the core must be at least equal to the energy radiated at the surface. Since the luminosity gives the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> radiated per unit time, the total life span can be estimated, to first approximation, as the total energy produced divided by the star's luminosity.|$|E

5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified {{to make them more}} useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim to reduce the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E
5|$|If the {{quantity}} of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×108 kg of water vapor are lifted, and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> released when this condenses is 1015 joules. This is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone, and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Moving towards energy {{sustainability}} {{will require}} changes {{not only in}} the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> required to deliver various goods or services is essential.

5|$|The Sun is the Solar System's {{star and}} by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses) {{produces}} temperatures and densities in its core {{high enough to}} sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star. This releases an enormous <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} affinity of an atom is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> released when an electron {{is added to}} a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although {{electron affinity}} varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so {{they may or may}} not have slightly negative values.|$|E
5|$|Although faster-than-light travel {{has been}} seriously {{considered}} by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that the enormous <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> {{required to achieve}} such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy than previously thought, needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release only a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, {{but not enough to}} produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly {{the same as that}} of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E
5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

5|$|In 1802, {{shortly after}} {{discovering}} Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments {{of a much}} larger planet that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before. Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon, do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> than was typical for a nova.|$|E
5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid {{has to do with}} the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E

5|$|Others like Stroud, Krause and Phillips opine {{that even}} Rommel's {{recklessness}} and disobedience during {{the invasion of}} France benefitted the German cause, while rescuing Hitler's mercurial objectives and inventing the actual application of blitzkrieg ("lightning war"), and it was Hitler who downgraded strategic victory to operational victory. According to Alan J. Levine, contrary to the allegation {{that he was only}} a genius tactician without a good grasp of logistics, Rommel was a clearer thinker than most of his colleagues (shown by his judgements on developing situations), and although he was the most defeatist German general, there was a serious qualification to his pessimism and he was capable of displaying a surprising <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> in building the Normandy defense at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E
5|$|Some prokaryotes use redox pairs {{that have}} only a small {{difference}} in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, {{but not enough to}} produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism. This problem is solved by using a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.|$|E
