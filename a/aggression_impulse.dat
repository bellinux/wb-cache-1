40|$|The {{present study}} served to: (1) {{evaluate}} a partial-day treatment program {{for children with}} emotional and behavioral disorders; (2) explore variables associated with increased likelihood of success in the treatment program; and (3) further {{the knowledge of the}} developmental trajectories of prosocial and aggressive behaviors in school-aged youth. Children in the treatment group attended an after-school program five days per week (and/or a full-day program during the summer); the average length of treatment was approximately 6 months. The comparison group was recruited by asking elementary school principals to send recruitment packets to the parents of children experiencing similar emotional and behavioral difficulties. The data analyzed from the treatment group consisted of pre-test and post-test parent-reports on 20 clients (16 boys and 4 girls); the data analyzed from the comparison group consisted of pre-test and post-test parent-reports on 25 children (19 boys and 6 girls). Repeated-measures ANCOVAs showed that clients decreased more than comparison children on difficult parent-child interactions, and that boys in the treatment group (compared to boys in the comparison group) decreased more on irritability and increased more on empathy. No significant group differences were found for <b>aggression,</b> <b>impulse</b> control, hyperactivity, or prosocial behavior. Exploratory analyses revealed that parental involvement was associated with a client 2 ̆ 7 s increased likelihood of graduating, while parent-child ratio in the home was not. In addition, the program seemed to be serving equally well clients with diagnoses reflecting only externalizing behaviors and clients with diagnoses reflecting internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The path analysis predicting aggressive behavior revealed that, as expected, increases in impulse control were associated with decreases in aggression (and vice versa). Contrary to expectations, the path analyses predicting prosocial behavior revealed that increases in impulse control were not reliably associated with increases in prosocial behavior. The study improved upon previous evaluations by recruiting a comparison group, using psychometrically sound outcome measures, and examining the program 2 ̆ 7 s theory of change. Implications for the program and for future evaluations are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Mental health {{professionals}} need objective measures {{to assess their}} clients 2 ̆ 7 disposition to aggress. Minuchin 2 ̆ 7 s (1950) measures of expressive aggression and defense against aggression on the TAT predicted neuropsychiatric inpatients 2 ̆ 7 aggressive behavior. Recent work with the nonverbal, projective Picture-Preference Test (PPT; Auld 2 ̆ 6 Kline, 1984; Kline, Auld, 2 ̆ 6 Cooper, 1983) suggests that several of its scales [...] and the Eysencks 2 ̆ 7 Psychoticism (P) scale [...] are also measures of a person 2 ̆ 7 s tendencies to aggress (Antisocial Tendencies, Maladjustment, Primary Process Thinking) or to inhibit <b>aggression</b> (<b>Impulse</b> Control). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the relationship between the PPT scales, Eysencks 2 ̆ 7 P scale, and Minuchin 2 ̆ 7 s TAT measures. Sex differences were also explored. A group consisting of 48 male and 63 female undergraduates responded to the scales and wrote stories to six pictures [...] pictures which best elicited aggressive themes in a pilot study. In addition to counting the frequency of Minuchin 2 ̆ 7 s TAT measures, the investigator developed scales to measure aggressive TAT content (Aggression Scale) and defensive TAT content (Inhibition of Aggression Scale). Interjudge reliabilities on these scales were good. As hypothesized, the Antisocial Tendencies, P, and Maladjustment scales significantly correlated with Minuchin 2 ̆ 7 s measure of expressive aggression, indicating that these scales are useful measures of aggression. The Impulse Control scale did not relate to Minuchin 2 ̆ 7 s measure of defense against aggression, as had been expected. As hypothesized, aggressive TAT content differed between the sexes. The stories of the men contained a greater amount of physical and antisocial, nonphysical aggression unmodified by the defenses. The stories of the women had a greater amount of inwardly directed aggression. Dept. of Psychology.

40|$|Abstract Background Conventional {{antipsychotics}} augmented with benzodiazepines {{have been}} the standard acute treatment for psychiatric emergencies for more than 50 years. The inability of patients to give informed consent limits randomised, controlled studies. This observational study on immediate therapy for <b>aggression</b> and <b>impulse</b> control in acutely agitated patients (IMPULSE) evaluated the short-term effectiveness and tolerability of atypical and typical antipsychotic medications (AP) in a non-interventional setting. Methods This was a comparative, non-randomised, prospective, open-label, observational study. Treatment over the first 5 days was classified according to whether any olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol was included or not. Documentations (PANSS-excited component, CGI-aggression, CGI-suicidality, tranquilisation score) were at baseline (day 1) and days 2 – 6 after start of AP. Results During the short treatment-period, PANSS-EC and CGI-aggression scores improved in all cohorts. 68. 7 % of patients treated with olanzapine, 72. 2 % of patients treated with risperidone, and 83. 3 % of patients treated with haloperidol received concomitant benzodiazepines (haloperidol vs. non-haloperidol: p Conclusion Current medication practices for immediate aggression control are effective with positive results present within a few days.

40|$|Suicide is a {{major cause}} of death in schizophrenia. Neurobiological studies suggest that suicidality is {{associated}} with abnormal brain structure and connectivity in fronto-temporo-limbic regions. However, it is still unclear whether suicidality in schizophrenia is related to volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures that {{play a key role in}} emotion regulation, <b>aggression</b> and <b>impulse</b> control. Therefore, we aimed to examine whether the volume of selected subcortical regions is associated with previous suicidal attempts and self-aggression in schizophrenia. For this cross-sectional study, we recruited 50 outpatients with schizophrenia and 50 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and gender. Fourteen patients had a history of one or more suicide attempts. Different forms of aggression were assessed using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale. All participants underwent structural MR imaging at 3 Tesla. Physical volumetric measures were calculated for the lateral ventricles, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, pallidum and accumbens using an automatic segmentation method on T 1 -weighted high-resolution (voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm(3)) images. Multivariate and follow-up univariate ANOVAs revealed a selective increase in volume in the right amygdala of patients with a history of suicidality compared both to patients without such a history and HC. Moreover, in the entire patient group increased right amygdala volume was related to increased self-aggression. Our findings suggest that right amygdala hypertrophy may be a risk factor for suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia and this could be relevant for suicide prevention...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. The {{effects of}} parental alcohol {{dependence}} on {{children have been}} well documented in the literature. Parental alcohol dependence has been linked with negative developmental outcomes such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, difficulties in school and conduct problems in children (Johnson, 2001). However, some {{studies have indicated that}} there may be some protective factors in the environments of children of alcohol dependent parents (COAs) which promote positive developmental outcomes for such children (Menees & Sergin, 2000). The current study focused on parental supervision as a protective family factor that is linked to conduct competence in COAs. The participants’ perception of parental supervision was measured using the Parental Monitoring Assessment and their level of conduct competence was measured using the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory. The Weinberger Adjustment Inventory includes four domains of conduct competence: suppression of aggression, consideration of others, impulse control and responsibility. The main hypothesis of the study was that the participants’ perception of parental supervision correlates with their level of conduct competence with regards to the four domains. The sample included twenty adolescent males who were recruited through their fathers’ involvement in an alcohol rehabilitation program. The results indicated that the participants’ perceptions of parental supervision correlate with levels of conduct competence in the domains of consideration of others, there is no correlation between perception of parental supervision and conduct competence in the domain of responsibility, whilst there is a negative correlation between perception of parental supervision and conduct competence in the domains of suppression of <b>aggression</b> and <b>impulse</b> control...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Recent assertions {{have been}} made that viewing violent {{material}} on ®lm and video may in¯uence children and adolescents who commit violent acts. It has also been proposed that heavy exposure to television violence in childhood is associated with violent crime as an adult, although others have emphasized that experiencing ªrealº violence as a child has a much greater effect on aggressive predispositions. Ways in which screen violence can effect behavior includes: imitation of violent roles and acts of <b>aggression,</b> triggering aggressive <b>impulses</b> in predisposed individuals, desensitizing feelings of sympathy towards victims, creating an indifference {{to the use of}} violence, and creating a frame of mind that sees violent acts as a socially acceptable response to stress and frustration. It is argued that young offenders may like violent videos because of their aggressive background and behavioral tendencies. Whether such tastes reinforce violent behavior and increase the frequency of aggressive acts and antisocial behavior is open to question. This question needs an urgent answer given the availability of violent video ®lm either to be viewed in the home environment appropriately (i. e., the whole ®lm in real time) or inappropriately (i. e., from one violent scene to the next viewed in slow motion and freeze-frame). 199...|$|R
40|$|Serotonin, {{a hormone}} {{produced}} in the brain, has long been implicated in the regulation of critical behaviors, such as those related to <b>aggression</b> or <b>impulse</b> control. However, most research on serotonin {{has focused on the}} proximate connection to behavior, and little is known about its evolution. This is unfortunate, since the serotonin system has great potential to inform our understanding of behavioral evolution. I seek to address this gap in knowledge by investigating the molecular evolution of the serotonin system in macaques (genus Macaca). 	The macaque genus represents a useful model for understanding behavioral evolution. Comprised of approximately 19 species, macaques display a wide range of behaviors. It is likely that behavioral differences are caused by differences in neuroendocrinology. Therefore, the serotonin system provides one potential mechanism through which evolution may act to shape macaque behavior. In this dissertation, I sequence four genes that are known to influence serotonin functioning and behavior: HTR 1 A, HTR 1 B, TPH 2, and SLC 6 A 4. I examine the pattern of genetic variation within and between several species of macaque, and, using an approach based on molecular evolutionary theory, discern which evolutionary force ??? positive selection, balancing selection, purifying selection, or random genetic drift ??? is most likely to have acted on these genes. Three out of the four genes (HTR 1 B, TPH 2, and SLC 6 A 4), show a low level of overall genetic variation within the coding regions, suggesting that purifying selection is the predominate force acting on these genes. Within non-coding regions, the patterns of genetic variation found are consistent with genetic drift. Thus, positive selection {{does not seem to be}} affecting these genes. The genetic variation for these genes may contribute to the behavioral variation found in macaques; however, any effect that these genes have on behavior is likely due to non-adaptive evolutionary forces. In contrast to the other genes, HTR 1 A shows a pattern that is clearly distinct. HTR 1 A displays an unusually high level of interspecific variation, which is consistent with positive selection. Moreover, a subset of macaque species share a codon loss, an extremely rare event in gene evolution, and analyses of the coding region indicate a significant elevation of protein evolution among certain sites of the gene. These results suggest that positive selection has played a significant role in the evolution of the serotonin system and it is likely that the effects of positive selection on HTR 1 A contributed to macaque behavioral evolution. This research provides an important first step towards gaining a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying the evolution of behavior...|$|R
