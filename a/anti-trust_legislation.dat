25|$|If {{not for the}} AFL, {{at least}} 17 of today's NFL teams would {{probably}} never have existed: the ten teams from the AFL, and seven clubs that were instigated by the AFL's presence to some degree. Three NFL franchises were awarded {{as a direct result}} of the AFL's competition with the older league: the Minnesota Vikings, who were awarded to Max Winter in exchange for dropping his bid to join the AFL; the Atlanta Falcons, whose franchise went to Rankin Smith to dissuade him from purchasing the AFL's Miami Dolphins; and the New Orleans Saints, because of successful <b>anti-trust</b> <b>legislation</b> which let the two leagues merge, and was supported by several Louisiana politicians.|$|E
5000|$|Economic progressivism {{is based}} on the idea that free markets are {{inherently}} unfair, favoring large corporations and the wealthy. Progressives believe that a fair market should result in a normal distribution of wealth, but in most countries, the wealthy earn heavily disproportionate incomes. Hence, progressives advocate controlling the markets through public protections that they believe will favor upward mobility and diminish income inequality. Specific economic policies that are considered progressive include: progressive taxes and mandatory income redistribution aimed at reducing inequalities of wealth, a comprehensive package of public services, universal health care, public education, social security, minimum wage laws, <b>anti-trust</b> laws, <b>legislation</b> protecting workers' rights and the rights of trade unions, and a welfare state.|$|R
5000|$|These {{governmental}} crises may {{be triggered}} by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., <b>anti-trust</b> and anti-monopoly <b>legislation</b> {{that leads to a}} [...] "legal strait-jacket" [...] for the state, local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state. and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.|$|R
50|$|A {{firm with}} market power {{has the ability}} to {{individually}} affect either the total quantity or the prevailing price in the market. Price makers face a downward-sloping demand curve, such that price increases lead to a lower quantity demanded. The decrease in supply {{as a result of the}} exercise of market power creates an economic deadweight loss which is often viewed as socially undesirable. As a result, many countries have <b>anti-trust</b> or other <b>legislation</b> intended to limit the ability of firms to accrue market power. Such legislation often regulates mergers and sometimes introduces a judicial power to compel divestiture.|$|R

40|$|In {{my master}} thesis I {{focus on the}} effect of World War 1 on labour unions power in the United States of America. The goal is to answer these questions: What factors {{influenced}} position of labour unions {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century? How did the position of labour unions change during World War I? World War I was already a second experience with war economy in the history of the USA (remember American Civil War). For the first time, though, labour unions played important role in the American economy. I have decided to analyze the effect of World War I on position of labour unions because I consider it an important one. In Chapter one I will analyze the influence of war inflation on real wages of employees and on the ratio between wages of union workers and non-union workers. Chapter two is dedicated to labour conditions (social programs, safety, unemployment benefits) and to their modifications which took place because of World War I. Chapter three is about labour legislation development (regulation of hours and wages, yellow dog contracts, <b>anti-trust</b> and immigration <b>legislation)</b> and its adjustments during the war years. In the Conclusion I sum up all the evidence and evaluate the influence of the World War I on the labour unions and their members...|$|R

5000|$|Distributism {{appears to}} have one of its {{greatest}} influences in <b>anti-trust</b> <b>legislation</b> in America and Europe designed to break up monopolies and excessive concentration of market power in one or only a few companies, trusts, interests, or cartels. Embodying the philosophy explained by Chesterton, above, that too much capitalism means too few capitalists, not too many, America's extensive system of <b>anti-trust</b> <b>legislation</b> seeks to prevent the concentration of market power in a given industry into too-few hands. Requiring that no company gain too great a share of any market {{is an example of how}} distributism has found its way into government policy. The assumption behind this legislation is the idea that having economic activity decentralized among many different industry participants is better for the economy than having one or a few large players in an industry. (Note that anti-trust regulation does take into account cases when only large companies are viable because of the nature of an industry, as in the case of natural monopolies like electricity distribution. It also accepts that mergers and acquisitions may improve consumer welfare; however, it generally prefers more economic agents to fewer, as this generally improves competition.) ...|$|E

That same year, she sold the Center Furnace to the Superior Portland Cement company, cashing the largest check ($100,000) ever cashed in a local bank at the time. She caused a stir in the business community during these years by supporting President Theodore Roosevelt's <b>anti-trust</b> <b>legislation.</b> In 1919, Nannie Kelly Wright and Daniel Gregory Wright divorced, and in a move that shocked the entire region, Mr. Wright sought alimony from his wife.|$|E

Citing Yrigoyen's 18 gubernatorial removals (including numerous ones from his own party, and {{in all but one}} of Argentina's 14 provinces at the time), they contended that the former president had imposed a [...] "personality cult", and established the Antipersonalist UCR (UCRA).

5000|$|The {{commodities}} {{bubble of}} 2008 led to global food shortages and prompted {{the price of}} oil to rise over $140 per barrel. Taibbi depicts as its cause investment-bank led commodity speculation, after having convinced regulators to dismantle sensible regulations that had safeguarded the process of commodity trading, in place since the Great Depression. The sell-off of public assets is described in another essay with examples of frittering away assets under value to the detriment of future generations. The health care reform by the Obama administration is described as a [...] "grotesque give-away" [...] to the health insurance industry and a betrayal of the public trust. Taibbi argues that the insurance industry unfairly continues to be exempted from <b>anti-trust</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During {{his early}} tenure in the Senate, O'Mahoney {{supported}} {{most of the}} New Deal programs, with the notable exception of President Roosevelt's [...] "court-packing plan." [...] He {{earned a reputation as}} a strong opponent of big business and monopolies, and was heavily involved with <b>anti-trust</b> <b>legislation.</b> One of his first actions as a Senator was to introduce legislation requiring federal licensing for corporations engaged in interstate commerce. He was a leading supporter of the creation of the Temporary National Economic Committee, which he chaired from 1938 to 1941. He also supported wool, cattle, oil, and conservation legislation, and sponsored the Casper-Alcova reclamation project. He served as chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs (1943-1947), Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (1949-1953), and co-chairman of the Joint Committee on the Economic Report (1949-1953).|$|E

[...] The American Telephone and Telegraph Company argued that using space for communications was just a modern representation of the submarine communications cables currently in use. AT&T proposed joint ownership of all of the communications satellites, with control based on the system facilities, but since AT&T had a majority of world communications this proposition was opposed by other communication companies. The Federal Communications Commission proposed that the ten companies join together in a program, but this was put down with <b>anti-trust</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Bulgaria, {{the only}} legal {{explicit}} restrictions on media ownership is {{enshrined in the}} Law on Radio and Television, adopted in 1998 and amended several times since then. The Law was elaborated {{with the aim of}} regulating the market of broadcast media. Although the Law was not conceived specifically {{to address the issue of}} concentration, it includes restrictions on cross-ownership, pertaining only to national broadcasters. According to the law, licenses cannot be awarded to legal persons (or persons related to legal persons) which already possess licenses for local radio or television stations. This amendment was introduced after discovering cases of local operators acquiring licenses for national broadcasting. The Law also stipulates that national operators cannot become owners of local and regional stations. It also requires applicants to declare that they do not hold stakes, shares or other rights of participation in radio and television broadcasters above the threshold set by <b>anti-trust</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Between 1921 and 1922, Harding {{signed a}} series of bills {{regulating}} agriculture. The legislation emanated from President Woodrow Wilson's 1919 Federal Trade Commission report, which investigated and discovered [...] "manipulations, controls, trusts, combinations, or restraints out of harmony with the law or the public interest" [...] in the meat packing industry. The first law was the Packers and Stockyards Act, which prohibited packers from engaging in unfair and deceptive practices. Two amendments {{were made to the}} Farm Loan Act of 1916 that President Wilson had signed into law, which had expanded the maximum size of rural farm loans. The Emergency Agriculture Credit Act authorized new loans to farmers to help them sell and market livestock. The Capper-Volstead Act, signed by Harding on February 18, 1922, protected farm cooperatives from <b>anti-trust</b> <b>legislation.</b> The Future Trading Act was also enacted, regulating puts and calls, bids, and offers on futures contracting. Later, on May 15, 1922, the Supreme Court ruled this legislation unconstitutional.|$|E
5000|$|Having passed major {{legislation}} {{lowering the}} tariff and reforming the banking structure, Wilson next sought <b>anti-trust</b> <b>legislation</b> {{that would provide}} for more regulation than the Sherman Antitrust Act. Wilson broke with his predecessors' practice of litigating the antitrust issue in the courts, known as [...] "trust-busting"; the new Federal Trade Commission provided a new regulatory approach, to encourage competition and reduce perceived unfair trade practices. In addition, he pushed the Clayton Antitrust Act through Congress making certain business practices illegal, such as price discrimination, agreements prohibiting retailers from handling other companies' products, and directorates and agreements to control other companies. The power of this legislation was {{greater than that of}} previous anti-trust laws since it dictated the accountability of individual corporate officers and clarified guidelines. This law was nicknamed the [...] "Magna Carta of Labor" [...] by Samuel Gompers, as it ended union liability antitrust laws. Under the threat of a national railroad strike in 1916, Wilson approved legislation that increased wages and cut working hours of railroad employees; in fact, there was no strike at all.|$|E
