5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>to</b> imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E

500|$|The {{story is}} set in the mid-1950s, shortly after Bergman's award win at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival for Smiles of a Summer Night. After his return to Stockholm, Bergman feels {{compelled}} to go to a cinema and watch a Hollywood blockbuster movie. As he exits the cinema, he inexplicably finds himself transported to Hollywood, where a limo driver is waiting to take him to a film studio.

2500|$|Katharine Birbalsingh {{has written}} of the {{problems}} she perceives in many community schools. She cites the impossibility of effective classroom management, bad teachers who cannot be dismissed, and government policies encouraging [...] "soft" [...] subjects. Birbalsingh has visited schools in Jamaica and India where pupils <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>to</b> gain the kind of education to which pupils in her own school (and their parents) were indifferent. She was a deputy head teacher in south London until she spoke at a Conservative Party conference in 2010 and was quickly sacked. Frank Chalk, who taught at an inner-city school for ten years before resigning in frustration, makes similar claims.|$|E
2500|$|Smythe's {{place in}} Alexander Pope's The Dunciad comes {{primarily}} from this play. [...] In the second act, Smythe quoted eight lines of Pope's poetry. [...] It appears that Pope had given and then revoked permission {{for the use}} of the lines, but Smythe went ahead anyway. [...] This earned him Pope's wrath, and he was already despised by the other Tory wits. [...] In The Dunciad of 1727, Pope presents Moore as a [...] "phantom poet" [...] whom all the book sellers <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>to</b> court. [...] This is partially because of the piracy (Moore does not indicate his source or credit Pope), but it is more because Thomas Lintot offered Moore Smythe the incredible sum of £105 for the publication rights to the play. [...] (In contrast, Leonard Welsted had had a much greater theatrical success in 1726 with The Dissembled Woman and had received only £30 for the publication rights.) [...] Lintot probably suspected that the controversy would mean sales and that Moore was a new Whig hero. [...] On the last score, at least, he would have been correct.|$|E
