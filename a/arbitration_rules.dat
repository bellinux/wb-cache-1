2500|$|An [...] "arbitration hearing" [...] can {{be either}} {{procedural}} or evidentiary. [...] As in court systems, a [...] "procedural hearing" [...] focuses exclusively on how the proceedings are to be conducted.

[...] Although evidentiary hearings are generally available as a means to assist the arbitral tribunal in deciding contested factual issues, <b>arbitration</b> <b>rules</b> do not usually require them and leave the means of decided disputed factual issues to the discretion of the tribunal. [...] Many decisions of arbitral tribunals are made without any hearing at all.|$|E
