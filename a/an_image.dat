5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel.

If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Pink Floyd {{bought a}} three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began {{converting}} the building into {{a recording studio}} and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of a pig.|$|E

High frequencies of the real <b>image</b> of <b>an</b> intermediate-view are estimated using the relationship between high frequencies of <b>an</b> ideal <b>image</b> and those of <b>a</b> corresponding intermediate-view <b>image.</b> Experimental results show that {{the quality of}} the resulting images is almost as good as that of ideal images. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Typically, a lens is used {{to focus}} the light {{reflected}} or emitted from objects into <b>a</b> real <b>image</b> on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure.
