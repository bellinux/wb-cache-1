5000|$|Kettering has a {{well-appointed}} Community Hall. In 2004 <b>acoustic</b> <b>panelling</b> {{was installed}} making the space suitable for meetings, concerts, theatre and exhibitions. It has a badminton court and local enthusiasts play weekly.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, the Hexagon used an {{electronically}} assisted reverberation system; {{this has}} now been removed. In {{a review of the}} system, one author wrote that the system [...] "seemed inaudiblein the stalls but made a minor contribution in the balcony", concluding that it [...] "still left an inadequate sense of reverberation." [...] <b>Acoustic</b> <b>panelling</b> is used throughout the auditorium. The ceiling features rotatable acoustic screens to provide reflections to the balcony seats.|$|E
50|$|Birmingham School of Acting, {{founded in}} 1936, offers courses at {{undergraduate}} and postgraduate level; and part-time and summer school courses; for adults, {{young people and}} children. The school is based in purpose built facilities within the City Centre campus at Millennium Point which include 11 studios with sprung floors, <b>acoustic</b> <b>panelling</b> and air displacement systems. The courses are professionally accredited by Drama UK and has partnerships with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Alongside its undergraduate programmes in Acting and Physical Theatre, the school offers specialist postgraduate programmes in Professional Voice Practice and an MFA in Acting: The British Tradition.|$|E
5000|$|The Gaines Dance Barn, built c. 1930 and remodeled in 1993, is the 3500 sq ft {{facility}} {{that serves as}} both rehearsal and performance space for Dance Workshop {{as well as for}} all dance classes. In March 1998, the facility was acoustically treated following complications stemming from the 1993 remodel. This treatment included the installation of <b>acoustic</b> wall <b>panelling</b> and a suspended JBL-based audio system. This 3500 sq ft dance studio, with its generous natural light, sound system, and sprung floor, ranks among the best for secondary schools.|$|R
50|$|An {{empty room}} with cement floor and ceiling, cinderblock walls, and no {{flammable}} materials would have approximately zero fire loading; any fire entering such a room from elsewhere will find nothing to feed on. However, nearly anything {{that makes a}} room useful (such as furniture, electrical appliances, or computer equipment), or attractive (such as wood <b>panelling,</b> <b>acoustic</b> tile, carpeting, curtains, or wall decorations), will increase the fire loading. Some usages inherently carry high fire loading as a side effect (an art gallery and studio, for example, is likely to contain large amounts of canvas, paints, solvents, and wooden framing). Buildings under construction or renovation tend to carry high fire loads {{in the form of}} construction materials, solvents, and fuel for generators.|$|R
25|$|The Max-Littmann-Saal was {{originally}} called Großer Saal (Great Hall). After {{the end of}} renovation in 2005 it was officially renamed after the architect Max Littmann. The hall of about 455 square meters is 36 meters long, 16 meters high and {{is surrounded by a}} large U-shaped gallery. In the case of row seating, the hall accommodates a maximum of 1,160 guests, in the parquet about 660 and on the gallery about 500 seats. It is used for concerts, but also for conferences. Experts count it to the best concert halls of the world. The paneling of cherry-wood gives the hall, which is of the “shoebox type”, a much acclaimed <b>acoustics.</b> Behind the <b>panelling</b> a gap of five to ten centimeters to the wall acts as resonance space. Measurements during the renovation of 2005 brought reverberation times of 1.1 to 1.8 seconds. These acoustics are similar to the Boston Symphony Hall or the Usher Hall in Edinburgh. So the Max-Littmann-Saal often was used for recordings of classical music. In the recent past the Philharmonie Festiva and the conductor Gerd Schaller produced CD recordings of symphonic works of Anton Bruckner, Johannes Brahms, and Franz Schubert, as well as the first recordings of the opera Merlin by Carl Goldmark and the Great Mass by Johann Ritter von Herbeck. Many concerts of the Kissinger Sommer are recorded in the Max-Littmann-Saal by the public broadcasting company Bayerischer Rundfunk. The hall is connected to the neighbouring halls Grüner Saal and Weißer Saal by big foldable doors, which make it possible to enlarge the capacity of the Max-Littmann-Saal.|$|R
