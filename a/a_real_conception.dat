In this context <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>conception</b> {{has to be}} planed before a deployment on the studied area. Actually researches use a simple and regular Area of Deployment (AoD) representation and do not allow interactive interface for a non programmer. Our approach tries to provide a tool to elaborate a strategy of WSN deployment. In a first part we show {{how it is possible}} to have an easy representation of WSN deployment components by using Discrete EVent Specification (DEVS) formalism. In second part we present an application that allows an accurate representation of WSN deployment based on Geographic Information System (GIS) from the results of the DEVS application. We present an example of WSN deployment that takes into account elevation variation on a mountainous area...|$|E

Right away, the proposal for the project happening was based on web Page elaboration containing a database through the studies in local and regional landscapes aiming at contributing to a better teaching in Geosciences specially the Physical Geography into Elementary and High Schools from Piemonte da Chapada Diamantina and surrounding places, {{in the course of the}} existent knowledge and its availability in a website. For that, it were applied methodological procedures and a bibliographic review of printed and digitalized materials to the research based on a propositional approach, understanding that the geossystemic theoretical/methodological assumption is an important tool into the landscapes studies. Among the obtained results it is necessary to emphasize the creation of the website ([URL] in which the materials were grouped according to the different landscape unities as well as a script production with a suggestive class field proposal with the view to make it available. So, it will be allowed to teachers and students to interpret and analyze critically the place with the intention of developing <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>conception</b> on the living place.

[...] And by a [...] "sense of the State" [...] I mean not merely a vague and sentimental and showy public-spiritedness--of that the States have enough and to spare--but <b>a</b> <b>real</b> sustaining <b>conception</b> of the collective interest embodied in the State as an object of simple duty and as a determining factor in the life of each individual.

40|$|Gear train volume {{optimization}} {{presents a}} complex problem tied to practical application in gear train manufacturing. This paper is oriented on {{the analysis of}} the problem of gear train volume minimization from a shaft axes positioning aspect. An original mathematical model has been developed where the objective function gives a minimum volume with changed shaft (spur gear) axes positions, {{while at the same time}} complying with all physical constraints. An original optimization software has also been developed using RCGA (Real Coded Genetic Algorithm) optimization methods. The general mathematical model was applied to three <b>real</b> <b>conceptions</b> of gear train as well as a comparative analysis of initial and optimal values. The results show a decrease of volume being directly linked to a decrease of not only space but material used to make the housing, costs, documentation formulation rate, etc...|$|R

We prove that every real 3 -manifold admits <b>a</b> <b>real</b> open book- <b>an</b> open book compatible with the real structure. The proof also shows that every real Heegaard decompo-sition of <b>a</b> <b>real</b> 3 -manifold comes from <b>a</b> <b>real</b> open book. This is not true in general in the non-real setting.
