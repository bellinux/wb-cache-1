50|$|Barriers to {{employment}} and promotion and equal employment opportunities {{continue to be}} one of the major issues facing Māori and Pacific peoples across the full range of occupations. The Ministry of Development’s Social Report 2010 assessed the social and economic wellbeing of New Zealanders across a range of indicators. It found higher rates of unemployment for young people, Māori, Pacific peoples and other ethnic groups, and lower rates of median hourly earnings for the same groups as compare with Pakeha/European groups. This was in line with findings from previous years. The report also found that 14 per cent of the population live in low-income households. Since 2001, the <b>annual</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Report,</b> published by the Ministry of Social Development, has charted improvements in unemployment and employment rates and outcomes for Māori in socio-economic outcomes for Māori. Despite these improvements, average outcomes for Māori tend to be poorer than for the total population and the median hourly earnings, occupational spread, representation in senior roles and workplace injury claims. Despite improvements over the last decade, these gaps have widened due to the economic recession that began in late 2008. Unemployment rates in particular have risen, and are higher for Māori than for non-Māori. Māori youth unemployment rates stand as one of the highest figures of any group in New Zealand, sitting at 30.3 percent in June 2010.|$|E

Health advocates may be unaware of the scale, nature and implications of tobacco industry CSR. This investigation aimed to construct a typology of tobacco industry CSR through a case study of the evolution and impact of CSR activities of a particular tobacco corporation in one country - British American Tobacco, Malaysia (BATM), the Malaysian market leader. Methods included searching, compiling and critically appraising publicly available materials from British American Tobacco, BATM, published literature and other sources. The study examined BATM's CSR strategy, the issues which it raises, consequences for tobacco control and potential responses by health advocates. The investigation found that BATM's CSR activities included assistance to tobacco growers, charitable donations, scholarships, involvement in anti-smuggling measures, 'youth smoking prevention' programs and <b>annual</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Reports.</b> BATM has stated that its model is predominantly motivated by social and stakeholder obligations. Its CSR activities have, however, had the additional benefits of contributing to a favourable image, deflecting criticism and establishing a modus vivendi with regulators that assists BATM's continued operations and profitability.

40|$|In {{this study}} we examine the varying {{mechanisms}} used by American businesses to address public corporate social responsibility expectations and how management’s moral foundations determine how their corporate citizenship is manifested in society. American corporations are changing their social behaviors to that of being a ―good citizens ‖ in society. Appropriateness of corporate behavior has long been debated. Perspectives on corporate social responsibility (CSR) fall along a continuum with purely economic responsibility to ownership (profit maximization) at one extreme and philanthropic citizenship (benevolent programs) at the other (Carroll, 1977; Farmer & Hogue, 1973). One certainty is that public CSR expectations are changing. This study investigates the relationships between (1) corporate social responsibility (CSR) : economic, legal, ethical or philanthropic; (2) executive moral underpinning: immoral, intentionally amoral, unintentionally amoral or moral; (3) CSR activities: profit maximization, legal compliance, stakeholder management, altruistic programs; and (4) signal: <b>annual</b> <b>social</b> responsibility <b>report,</b> CSR executive, etc...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to utilise both legitimacy theory and reputation risk management theory to examine the impact of the Beijing Olympic Sponsorship Program on <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> <b>social</b> disclosures by local sponsors. Specially, this study attempts to test whether local sponsors increase <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> <b>social</b> disclosure in responses to their sponsorship participation and whether the increases can be explained by other companies operating in the same industry group. This study also compares and contrasts legitimacy theory with reputation risk management theory, and discusses the applicable power of legitimacy theory and reputation risk management theory in positive events/issues. The annual report disclosures are reviewed for both sponsors and non-sponsors in order to make before and after comparisons. Comparisons are also made between sponsors and non-sponsors in terms of their social disclosure and event-related disclosure. The results indicate that first, sponsors disclosed more social and event-related information in their annual reports after they participated in the sponsorship program, while this was not the case for non-sponsors; second, sponsors disclosed more event-related disclosure than non-sponsors but not for the overall social disclosure. This study also found that the event-related disclosure was significantly correlated with levels of sponsorship while the total amount of social disclosure was correlated with firm size. These results suggest that the annual report could be used as a self-presentational device for managers to protect and enhance corporate reputation. Reputation risk management theory does have the power in explaining certain amounts of social disclosure particularly in these positive issues, but only limited with these firms which gained reputation from the issue. These results do not challenge the dominance of legitimacy theory in corporate social disclosure area, but argues that reputation risk management theory could provide several useful insights and be used as a supplement of legitimacy theory...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the efficiency gains from linking marginal Social Security benefits to marginal Social Security payroll taxes. In the U. S. the current combined employer-employee OASI payroll tax rate is 10. 4 percent. Recent estimates {{suggest that the}} average marginal income tax rate is roughly 27 percent (Barro and Sahaskul (1983)). If marginal OASI payroll taxes provided no marginal Social Security benefits or were incorrectly perceived to provide nomarginal benefits, the effective marginal federal government taxation of labor supply would average roughly 38 percent. Since the efficiency costs of distortionary taxation rise as roughly {{the square of the}} tax rate, the Social Security payroll tax may be more than doubling the dead weight loss of labor income taxation. The findings of this paper suggest that there may be very significant efficiency gains available from tightening the connection between marginal Social Security taxes paid and marginal Social Security benefits received. Indeed,the simulated efficiency gains are very large in comparison with those obtained from analyses of the gains from structural tax reform. Restructuring Social Security to greatly enhance marginal benefit-tax linkage may be infeasible, {{at least in the short}} run. However, simply providing <b>annual</b> <b>Social</b> Security <b>reports</b> indicating how a worker's projected benefits are affected by his or her tax contributions could provide substantial increases in economic efficiency. Such efficiency gains are potentially as large as increasing GNP by 1 percent this year and every year in the future. ...|$|R

An essential component of the institutional mission statement hence devised has called for the systematic assessment of social and environmental impacts (in addition to the traditionally studied economic ones) of all technology innovations resulting from R&D. The proposed approach emphasizes the interest of promoting close interaction between R&D teams and technology-adopting producers, under actual field contexts, {{in order to improve}} both the technology development and the demand probing processes. Given the multiplicity of technological applications ensuing from Embrapa?s very broad research encompassment, and the variety of environmental and productive contexts involved, a customized impact assessment system has been proposed.

40|$|Purpose – This {{longitudinal}} study {{aims to examine}} {{the extent to which}} football clubs in the Premier League communicate community activities in their <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> through <b>social</b> disclosure. The research also seeks to examine the relevance and use of the annual report as a disclosure medium by football clubs. The need for social disclosure is examined in conjunction with media coverage of issues affecting Premier League clubs. Design/methodology/approach – This study is deductive using three main hypotheses to test relevant underpinning theory used within the research. The study uses content analysis of <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> <b>social</b> disclosures of ten Premier League football clubs from 1993 to 2002, covering the first ten years of the Premier League. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the use of annual reports by those clubs. In addition, media reporting data from The Sunday Times is examined. Findings – This study finds that there has been an increase in adverse media reporting concerning football, football clubs and their activities. One way in which clubs have responded to this increased attention and criticism is by expanding their community activities and associated <b>social</b> <b>reporting,</b> although reporting varies between clubs. The study finds that football clubs do value the annual report as an effective means of communication. Research limitations/implications – The authors acknowledge that some limitations inevitably affect the generalisabilty of this research. The use of content analysis, the precise methods adopted and the reliance on The Sunday Times constitute limitations. Nevertheless, the research has shown that clubs do engage with their local communities and have increased their reporting of such activities.

Using institutional organisation theory as a background this paper analyses corporate responsibility reporting in the world's ten largest pulp and paper companies, representing 25 % of global production capacity. The studied companies have their headquarters in Japan, the Nordic countries or North America, and have very different geographical and cultural bases and variable company product portfolios ranging from wood-based products and printing papers to packaging boards and consumer goods. Both quantitative and qualitative economic, environmental and social metrics from the <b>annual</b> and <b>social</b> responsibility <b>reports</b> of the companies were analysed regarding institutionalised, culture-specific and company-specific characteristics. The results showed that regulated financial and environmental reporting leaves little flexibility for company-specific diversification in reporting.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to the ongoing debate on governance, accountability, transparency and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the mining sector of a developing country context. It examines the reporting practices of the two largest transnational gold-mining companies in Tanzania in order to draw attention to the role played by local government regulations and advocacy and campaigning by nationally organised non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with respect to promoting corporate <b>social</b> <b>reporting</b> practices. Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes a political economy perspective to consider the serious implications of the neo-liberal ideologies of the global capitalist economy, as manifested in Tanzania’s regulatory framework and in NGO activism, for the corporate disclosure, accountability and responsibility of transnational companies (TNCs). A qualitative field case study methodology is adopted to locate the largely unfamiliar issues of CSR in the Tanzanian mining sector within a more familiar literature on social accounting. Data for the case study were obtained from interviews and from analysis of documents such as <b>annual</b> <b>reports,</b> <b>social</b> responsibility <b>reports,</b> newspapers, NGO reports and other publicly available documents. Findings – Analysis of interviews, press clips and NGO reports draws attention to social and environmental problems in the Tanzanian mining sector, which are arguably linked to the manifestation of the broader crisis of neo-liberal agendas. While these issues have serious impacts on local populations in the mining areas, they often remain invisible in mining companies’ social disclosures. Increasing evidence of social and environmental ills raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the regulatory frameworks, as well as the roles played by NGOs and other pressure groups in Tanzania. Practical implications – By empowering local NGOs through educational, capacity building, technological and other support, NGOs’ advocacy, campaigning and networking with other civil society groups can play a pivotal role in encouraging corporations, especially TNCs, to adopt more socially and environmentally responsible business practices and to adhere to international and local standards, which in turn may help to improve the lives of many poor people living in developing countries in general, and Tanzania in particular. Originality/value – This paper contributes insights from gold-mining activities in Tanzania to the existing literature on CSR in the mining sector. It also contributes to political economy theory by locating CSR reporting within the socio-political and regulatory context in which mining operations take place in Tanzania. It is argued that, for CSR reporting to be effective, robust regulations and enforcement and stronger political pressure must be put in place...|$|R

Though the pyramid could be perceived to be a static snapshot of responsibilities, it is intended {{to be seen as a}} dynamic, adaptable framework the content of which focuses both on the present and the future. A consideration of stakeholders and sustainability, today, is inseparable from CSR. Indeed, there have been some appeals in the literature for CSR to be redefined as Corporate Stakeholder Responsibility and others have advocated Corporate Sustainability Responsibilities. These appeals highlight the intimate nature of these interrelated topics (Carroll and Buchholtz 2015). Furthermore, Ethical Corporation Magazine which emphasizes CSR in its Responsible Summit conferences integrates these two topics – CSR and Sustainability—as if they were one and, in fact, many business organizations today perceive them in this way; that is, to be socially responsible is to invest in the importance of sustainability which implicitly is concerned with the future. <b>Annual</b> corporate <b>social</b> performance <b>reports</b> frequently go by the titles of CSR and/or Sustainability Reports but their contents are undifferentiated from one another; in other words, the concepts are being used interchangeably by many.|$|R

40|$|Purpose -The main aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{underlying}} drivers for the development and subsequent discontinuation of stand-alone corporate <b>social</b> responsibility (CSR) <b>reporting</b> in a multinational subsidiary in Bangladesh. Design/Methodology/Approach - The research approach employed for this purpose is a case study using evidence from a series of in depth interviews conducted during the period 2002 - 2010. Interview data is supplemented by examining other sources of information including <b>annual</b> <b>reports,</b> stand-alone <b>social</b> <b>reports</b> and relevant newspaper articles during the study period. Findings - It appears that the stand-alone CSR reporting process was initiated to give the subsidiary a formal space in which to legitimise its activities in Bangladesh where both tobacco control regulation and a strong anti-tobacco movement were gaining momentum. At the start of the process in 2002 corporate interviewees were very receptive of this initiative and strongly believed that it would not be a one off exercise. However, in the face of subsequent significant national policy shifts concerning tobacco control, irreconcilable stakeholder demands and increasing criticism of the CSR activities of the organisation at home and abroad the process was brought to an abrupt end in 2009. Research Limitations/Implications - The paper has a number of implications for policy makers concerning the future prospects for stand-alone social/sustainability reporting as a means of enhancing organisational transparency and accountability.
