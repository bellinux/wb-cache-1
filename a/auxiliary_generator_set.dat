40|$|A new {{systematic}} {{method is}} presented {{for the design}} of high-efficiency microwave oscillators.

The combination of the two generators allows obtaining a quasisquare output-voltage waveform, with optimum harmonic components to maximize the efficiency. Attention is paid to the stability and phase noise of the implemented oscillator, which are analyzed versus technological parameters. A 6 -GHz oscillator has been designed using these techniques, with good experimental results...|$|R
