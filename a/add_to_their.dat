5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E
5|$|Dewar {{moved to}} Taranaki in 1910, {{where he played}} his club rugby for Stratford; he captained the team in 1913. He was first {{selected}} for Taranaki that year and continued to represent the club until {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. In 1912, Taranaki, with Dewar in the team, came close to winning the Ranfurly Shield from Auckland, losing 6–5. In front of a 12,000-spectator home crowd, Auckland dominated in the first half, scoring six points through a try and a penalty kick. The second half saw Taranaki's forwards take control for long periods, resulting in a converted try, but despite ongoing attacks, the visitors were unable to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> score and lost by just one point.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 2012, Kane joined Premier League team Norwich City on a season-long loan, {{making his}} debut as a {{substitute}} against West Ham United.

The 19-year-old underwent his rehabilitation at Tottenham but returned to action for Norwich on 29 December 2012, coming off the bench at half time as Norwich lost 3–4 to Manchester City. However, with Tottenham having been unable to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> attacking options during the January transfer window, they opted to recall Kane on 1 February 2013, four months before he was due to return.|$|E

5|$|On February 17, 1944, Zoldak {{was traded}} along with Barney Lutz to the St. Louis Browns for Frankie Hayes, as the Athletics wanted a veteran to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> roster, while the Browns wanted the two {{prospects}} {{as they were}} classified as 4-F, and {{would be available to}} the team {{for the duration of the}} war. He impressed the Browns coaching staff in spring training, and as a result was named to the opening day roster. Zoldak made his major league debut on May 13, and was used as a reliever during his first season, pitching in 18 games and earning an ERA of 3.72. The Browns made it to the 1944 World Series, but Zoldak did not see any action. He played in 26 games during the 1945 season, earning a 3-2 record with an ERA of 3.36. In his final appearance of the season on September 29 against the Cleveland Indians, he was given the opportunity to start a game opposite Bob Feller.
