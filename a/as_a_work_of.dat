5|$|Beginning with Michel Zink, whose {{influential}} 1979 monograph Roman rose et rose rouge: Le Roman de la rose ou de Guillaume de Dole {{ushered in}} a new era of criticism, critics have recognized Guillaume de Dole <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> literature about literature, a self-referential poem that comments on the improbability of some of its own plot elements and on its own fictional status, encouraging a trend in studies of Renart and his work.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} read <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues. Cheng Yi, {{patriarch of the}} Neo-Confucian Cheng–Zhu school, read the I Ching {{as a guide to}} moral perfection. He described the text as a way to for ministers to form honest political factions, root out corruption, and solve problems in government.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} opinion {{has been}} kinder {{than that of}} Bizet's day. Commentators describe {{the quality of the}} music as uneven and at times unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> promise in which Bizet's gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident. They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in Carmen. Since 1950 the work has been recorded on numerous occasions, in both the revised and original versions.|$|E

5|$|The work {{dates from}} Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition, and is {{regarded}} by art critics as revolutionary {{both as a}} progression of pop art and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> modern art in general. It was later reproduced in his 1973 painting, Artist's Studio—Look Mickey, which shows the painting hanging prominently on a facing wall of Lichtenstein's studio.|$|E
5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E
5|$|An 1895 fire {{destroyed}} {{half the}} village, {{as it had}} no form of fire protection at that time. Throughout the 20thcentury, {{the decline of the}} natural cement industry caused Rosendale to suffer economically and lose population. The village was also battered by a series of severe floods, and the center of commerce began to shift from Main Street to Route32. By the 1970s the village was having severe problems with its utilities and tax code, and was no longer producing cement. The hippie movement brought many artists to the village during this time, which led to ideological clashes between the newcomers and the more conservative, established residents. In 1976, the village voted to dissolve itself to solve its municipal problems, and on January1, 1978, Rosendale became disincorporated. The village's mayor {{at the time of the}} vote viewed the dissolution <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> conceptual art, and published a book on the matter.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} the book <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> normative political theory asking {{to what extent}} animals {{should be included in}} the domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Robinson {{argues that}} the {{popularity}} of Musidora reflects a change in art buyers. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the primary market for art {{was no longer a}} privately educated landed aristocracy who had been taught the Classics and were familiar with ancient mythology, but the emerging middle class. These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the references in history paintings, but could appreciate Musidora as a skilful execution and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> beauty in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Numerous polemicists, such as Irish {{journalist}} Philip Graves in a 1921 {{article in}} The Times, and British academic Norman Cohn in his 1967 book Warrant for Genocide, have proven The Protocols {{to be both}} a hoax and a clear case of plagiarism. There is general agreement that Russian-French writer and political activist Matvei Golovinski fabricated the text for Okhrana, the secret police of the Russian Empire, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> counter-revolutionary propaganda prior to the 1905 Russian Revolution, by plagiarizing, almost word for word in some passages, from The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, a 19th-century satire against Napoleon III of France written by French political satirist and Legitimist militant Maurice Joly.|$|E

5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is {{a notorious}} antisemitic {{literary}} forgery, probably written {{under the direction}} of the Russian secret police in Paris, that purported to reveal a conspiracy by the Jewish people to achieve global domination. It was exposed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> fiction in 1920 by Lucien Wolf and the following year by Philip Graves in The Times. Once exposed, it disappeared from mainstream discourse, Barkun writes, until interest in it was renewed by the American far right in the 1950s. Its use was spread further by conspiracy groups on the internet.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his death}} in 1989 {{he was given a}} state funeral. A large tomb and {{mausoleum}} were erected to form a shrine for him. The tomb, widely regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> great artistic merit, designed by Iraqi architect Chadagee, was located on the western grounds of the Ba'ath Party Pan-Arab Headquarters, at the intersection of Al-Kindi street and the Qādisiyyah Expressway overpass. Although there were rumors and accusations that his tomb was destroyed during the 2003 Iraq War, the burial chamber and building above it were left untouched. Its blue-tiled dome can be seen above the concrete T-walls surrounding the Camp's perimeter.|$|E
5|$|During the Song dynasty, {{previous}} works on architecture {{were brought to}} more sophisticated levels of description, as in Yili Shigong, written by Li Ruogui in 1193 AD. One of the most definitive works, however, was the earlier Mu Jing ("Timberwork Manual"), ascribed to Yu Hao and written sometime between 965 and 995. Yu Hao {{was responsible for the}} construction of a wooden pagoda tower in Kaifeng, which was destroyed by lightning and replaced by the brick Iron Pagoda soon after. In his time, books on architecture were still considered a lowly scholarly achievement due to the craft's status, so Mu Jing was not even recorded in the official court bibliography. Although the book itself was lost to history, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo wrote of Yu's work extensively in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, praising it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> architectural genius, saying that no one in his own time could reproduce such a work. Shen Kuo singled out, among other passages, a scene in which Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan-architect about slanting struts in order to brace a pagoda against the wind, and a passage in which Yu Hao describes the three sections of a building, the area above the crossbeams, the area above ground, and the foundation, and then proceeds to provide proportional ratios and construction techniques for each section.|$|E
