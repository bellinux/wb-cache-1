25|$|Karan {{was playing}} {{excessive}} cricket with the tennis ball that {{got into his}} parent's nerves and they finally took a decision to send him back to Nepal. The decision actually got backfired for his parents but worked in the well-being of Nepali cricket.

He has already proved himself many times and is expected to carry Nepal into glory.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer he was {{the most}} talented player of my time, <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> had {{extraordinary}} talents in every facet of cricket. In hindsight he probably didn't reach the heights that he should have, based on his cricket ability, but the guys who played with him and against him will recognise he was a fantastic player, who was dynamic in anything he did in cricket. When he was on he was unplayable. He bowled a swinging ball, he could hit the ball a mile, throw it like a bullet and he was a fantastic catcher either close to the wicket or in the outfield – a supreme cricketer. He was a very popular person, Gus, a bit of a larrikin and very much liked by everyone. He didn't take life all that seriously, played for the enjoyment of it.|$|E

500|$|When {{creating}} the character, Elwes {{did not want}} the character to be looked as [...] "good or bad", even having discussing it with Carter and Frank Spotnitz, another executive producer of the show. The producers and actors have instead labeled him as [...] "ambiguous", and a man who wants to see [...] "evidence through logic" [...] and not superstition. When describing his character to The Hollywood Reporter, Elwes said he [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is a little more buttoned up, a little more polished; he represents a different kind of FBI." ...|$|E

John Hughes and I are among the only Republicans in the picture business, and John Hughes {{put me in the}} movie", Stein said. Hughes said that Stein was an easy and early choice for the role of the teacher: [...] "He wasn't a professional actor. He had a flat voice, he looked like a teacher." ...|$|R

[...] The show deals with the theme of death, which Tsamere said is [...] "a bit strange, but it has the virtue of attracting the public's attention". He said that he and his co-authors thought that [...] "the most irrefutable reason to go on stage ... was to talk about something strong". Tsamere {{has described}} how the show changed as the size of its audiences grew and he incorporated improvisations.|$|E

[...] Actors who guest star in the episode include Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Joseph Meegar, Max Baker as Jacob Fischer, and Marylouise Burke as Flora Meegar. The first season DVD contains a deleted scene of Olivia and Peter picking up the homing pigeons from a friend of his named Tony. Tony quietly mentions to Peter that his sister could use Peter's help, but when asked, Peter refuses to tell Olivia more of the story.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Talk Soup", {{which is}} about a man who desires to go on {{television}} to tell the world about his strange life, was originally commissioned as a new theme for the E! Entertainment Television show of the same name. Although the producers approved the lyrics and enjoyed the final result, they decided against using it. [...] "Waffle King", the track that had been intended for Off the Deep End, was written as [...] "a song about <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> becomes incredibly famous for doing something kinda stupid, and then starts taking himself way too seriously".

500|$|In 1977, he {{was hired}} by Bain & Company, a {{management}} consulting firm in Boston formed a few years earlier by Bill Bain and several other ex-BCG employees. Bain himself would later say of the thirty-year-old Romney, [...] "He had the appearance [...] of confidence of <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> was maybe ten years older." [...] Unlike other consulting firms, which issued recommendations and then departed, Bain & Company [...] immersed itself in a clients' businesses and worked with them until changes were implemented. Romney became a vice-president of the firm in 1978, working with such clients as the Monsanto Company, Outboard Marine Corporation, Burlington Industries, and Corning Incorporated. Within a few years, the firm considered him one of its best consultants. In fact, clients sometimes preferred to use him rather than more-senior partners.|$|E
500|$|Within a {{few weeks}} Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent, Marc Korman. Korman phoned Salke, calling the script [...] "remarkable" [...] and praising Killen: [...] "...for <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> has never written a {{procedural}} show in his life", he was [...] "making two cases work." [...] Initially, Salke and Korman hoped to sell acquisition rights to other networks (including Fox). Although it successfully made {{its way into the}} lower executive branches of the company, the script was ultimately declined by Fox entertainment president Kevin Reilly. Gary Newman, chairman of 20th Century Fox Television, opted not to develop a deal with cable-television networks. Believing it should be a broadcast-network show, he did not accept the idea that the difference between cable and network dramas was their degree of intelligence.|$|E
500|$|According to Dave Mustaine, {{the band}} have {{encountered}} numerous mishaps and odd occurrences.

[...] In addition, Mustaine announced on Twitter that producer Johnny K was [...] "suddenly struck ill", and the band had ceased recording for the time being. However, the band resumed recording a few days later, with K having apparently recovered.

500|$|The {{following}} {{track on}} the album, [...] "I'm Going Bananas", is a Carmen Miranda-ish song {{done in a}} Spanish accent. A salsa rhythm is predominant, with Madonna squeezing her vocal cords while singing, backed by percussion and brass. In the fifth track, [...] "Crybaby", Madonna mimics the vocals of Betty Boop. The melody is heard over the interlining synth strings, horns and trumpets, and a bass. Rooksby explained that Madonna sang about <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is [...] "too sensitive and soft", and the chorus employs a chromatic chord sequence. The next track [...] "Something to Remember" [...] deals with her failed marriage to Penn and {{was the source of}} inspiration for naming her 1995 compilation album. Musically, it has melancholy chords and rambling melody, which according to Taraborrelli made it the most compelling song by Madonna.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Everything" [...] {{is aimed}} at Zac Hanson, who Marion Raven dated briefly while M2M were on tour with Hanson. According to Raven, once the tour ended he never {{contacted}} her, effectively ending the relationship. The song [...] "Miss Popular" [...] is about [...] "that one popular girl in school who goes around bad-mouthing everyone" [...] then eventually [...] "it all comes back to her", while [...] "Jennifer" [...] is about wanting to dislike [...] "the girl your boyfriend is constantly comparing you to" [...] but {{not being able to}} as she is a nice person. Raven wrote the song [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] about <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> dumped her then wanted her back, and wrote the song [...] "Sometimes" [...] when she was having a really bad day and wanted to just [...] "get it out".|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, Isaacs {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Michael Britten, the central {{character}} of the series.

[...] And so—and he's a cop who sees clues and details that crossover from one world to the next, and he uses that insight to solve crimes." [...] " [...] was somebody that you couldn't decide if you liked or hated, and I think that 's dilemma is something that we're not only sympathetic for, but somehow we want him to win." [...] Producers of the show initially approached Michaela McManus to play Hannah Britten. However, Laura Allen {{was cast in}}stead; McManus obtained the role of Tara (for which Allen originally auditioned).|$|E
