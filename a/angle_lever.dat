While Wang Zhenduo (王振铎) accepted the idea that Zhang's seismometer had cranks and levers which were disturbed by the inverted pendulum, his contemporary Akitsune Imamura (1870–1948) argued that the inverted pendulum could have had a pin at the top which, upon moving by force of the ground vibrations, would enter one of eight slots and expel the ball by pushing a slider. Since the Book of the Later Han states that the other seven dragon heads would not subsequently release the balls lodged up into their jaws after the first one had dropped, Imamura asserted that the pin of the pendulum would have been locked into the slot it had entered and thus immobilized the instrument until it was reset.|$|E

40|$|The {{absence of}} any {{tendency}} toward rotation in a moving right <b>angle</b> <b>lever</b> is given a simple explanation. One of the earliest paradoxes of special relativity is the “right <b>angle</b> <b>lever</b> paradox”, first proposed in 1909 by G. N. Lewis and R. C. Tolman[1]. The paradox involves a right <b>angle</b> <b>lever</b> at rest in a system S, acted on by four forces as shown in Fig. 1. The lever is in static equilibrium in its rest system with the vector sum of the forces zero, and the sum of moments r × F zero, with no tendency to translate or rotate. Each force F is here interpreted as being equal to the resulting dp dt if that F were the only force on the object. This is the usual interpretation of the “Lorentz force”. If a Lorentz transformation is made to a system S ′ moving with velocity −v parallel to r‖, {{it is found that}} the sum of moments r ′ × F ′ does not vanish. The implication is then made that this would lead to a rotation of the lever, seemingly violating the postulate of special relativity that a uniform velocity translation should not change the physics. This result constitutes the Lewis-Tolman right <b>angle</b> <b>lever</b> paradox...|$|E

Wheelchair prescription involves reconfiguring the wheelchair to optimize it for specific user characteristics.

In this study, we report initial results from {{the development of a}} musculoskeletal model of the wheelchair lever propulsion. Such a model could be used for the development of new advanced wheelchair approaches that allow wheelchair designers and practitioners to explore virtually, on a computer, the effects of the intended settings of the lever-propulsion interface. To investigate the lever-propulsion process, we carried out wheelchair lever propulsion experiments where joint <b>angle,</b> <b>lever</b> angle and three-directional forces and moments applied to the lever were recorded during the execution of defined propulsion motions. Kinematic and dynamic features of lever propulsion motions were extracted from the recorded data to be used for the model development. Five healthy male adults took part in these initial experiments. The analysis of the collected kinematic and dynamic motion parameters showed that lever propulsion is realized by a cyclical three-dimensional motion of upper extremities and that joint torque for propulsion is maintained within a certain range. The synthesized propulsion model was verified by computer simulation where the measured lever-angles were compared with the angles generated by the developed model simulation. Joint torque amplitudes were used to impose the torque limitation to the model joints. The results evidenced that the developed model can simulate successfully basic lever propulsion tasks such as pushing and pulling the lever...|$|E

The main difference between the two models concerns the load dependence of the run length, which is much weaker in the five-state model.

40|$|The myosin cross-bridge {{exists in}} two conformations, which di¡er in the {{orientation}} of a long lever arm. Since the lever arm undergoes a 608 rotation between the two conformations, which {{would lead to a}} displacement of the myosin ¢lament of about 11 nm, the transition between these two states has been associated with the elementary `power stroke’ of muscle. Moreover, this rotation is coupled with changes in the active site (CLOSED to OPEN), which probably enable phosphate release. The transition CLOSED to OPEN appears to be brought about by actin binding. However, kinetics shows that the binding of myosin to actin is a two-step process which a¡ects both ATP and ADP a¤nity and vice versa.

In such cases the indicator may still be useful, but an offset (multiplier or correction factor) must be applied to achieve a correct measurement (where the measurement is absolute rather than merely comparative). The same principle is also employed with CMM touch trigger probes (TTPs), where the machine (when used correctly) adjusts its ball-offset compensation to account for any difference between the approach vector and the surface vector.|$|R

It has been demonstrated that the lever-propulsion mechanisms possess few significant advantages to the handrim propulsion. Brubaker et al. established that mechanical efficiency of the lever propulsion is {{higher than that of}} handrim propulsion [1]. The same authors also suggested that lever propulsion could be applicable {{to a wide range of}} individuals because the mechanical efficiency remains slightly affected by the changes of the seat positions. Hughes et al. compared the patterns of changing the shoulder and elbow joint <b>angles</b> during <b>lever</b> propulsion and handrim propulsion at various seat positions and demonstrated that joint angles during handrim propulsion experiment change in much bigger range [11]. This result was supported by the findings of Brubaker et al. [1].

These results suggested that lever propulsion may mitigate the risk of secondary joint disorders. Jordon Lui et al. compared the energy efficiency of two commercially available lever propulsion wheelchair mechanisms with those of a handrim mechanism. Results reveal that the oxygen uptake (VO 2) and heartrate of the subjects participating in the experiments were significantly lower during the lever propulsion tests, which indicated that the mechanical efficiency of lever propulsion mechanisms could be significantly higher compared to the handrim propulsion [16].|$|R

We {{find that in}} the presence of ATP, many heads have a sharply angled conformation that is rare in its absence. The sharply angled conformation is similar to a myosin II atomic structure proposed to mimic the prepower stroke state. The leading head in molecules attached to actin by both heads has a similar conformation, but is also sharply angled in a second plane by tethering through the trail head. The lead head lever joins the motor domain � 5 nm axially from where it joins the trail motor. These positions locate the converter subdomain and show the lead motor is in the prepower stroke conformation. Tethering by the trail head places the lead head motor domain at the correct axial position along the actin for binding, but at the wrong orientation.
