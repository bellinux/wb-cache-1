50|$|The {{design for}} the Agano class was based on {{technologies}} developed by aboard the cruiser , resulting in a graceful and uncluttered <b>deck</b> <b>line</b> and single smokestack. Unlike most Japanese designs, the Agano class was not overweight, so it exhibited good stability and seaworthiness.|$|R
60|$|The others {{understood}} {{the value of}} the advice, and soon the mainsail of the yacht came down with a bang, and the jib followed. The Spray seemed inclined to list to port, but stopped settling when her <b>deck</b> <b>line</b> touched the surface of the river.|$|R
50|$|Sony {{followed}} up the SP Field Recorder with the BVW-50, that could record {{and play the}} large-size 90 minute cassettes. After this, the <b>deck</b> <b>line</b> was relatively stagnant and incredibly popular for a decade, aside from some specialty models that could record digital audio.|$|R
60|$|The vessel to leeward {{had been}} struck by only one shot, the other passing under her stern. She was struck just above her <b>deck</b> <b>line,</b> the shot passing through the bulwark, and, as they thought on board the merchantman, {{narrowly}} missing if not actually striking the mainmast.|$|R
50|$|At 23:33 local time, on 18 September, {{a terrible}} {{concussion}} occurred suddenly aboard the Bratstvo. According to the memoirs of the Captain Vadim Fillipovich Demchenkov, {{the incident was}} comparable to an explosion, based on the very powerful shake that was felt across the ship. Within 50 seconds the engine room of the ship was flooded up to the main <b>deck</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{commercial}} ship design categories, the [...] "well deck ship" [...] {{type the}} profile of the main <b>deck</b> <b>line</b> is broken rather than being [...] flush or unbroken from bow to stern. The earliest cargo steamers were flush deck with openings below rimmed only with low casings. Later designs eliminated this design as dangerous with bulwarks and eventual evolution into the [...] "three island" [...] design with raised forecastle, central bridge and poop superstructures and well decks between.|$|R

2500|$|The Admiralty ordered 18 LCAs from Messrs. Thornycroft in April 1939. These early boats weighed {{more than}} 9 tons and had flush-decked hulls, an {{armoured}} bulkhead forward that {{wrapped around the}} steering compartment on the starboard side. The steering compartment's armour plates stood about two feet proud of the <b>deck</b> <b>line.</b> In September, 8 more were ordered. Ford V8 marine conversions by Thornycroft powered the early groups of LCAs, these water-cooled petrol engines developing 65 hp each when driving the 19"x14" [...] 2-bladed propellers through a 41:20 gear reduction. The twin propulsion units gave a speed of 10½ knots at 2,800 revolutions per minute with a load of [...] in the boat. Later craft used propellers with three blades.|$|R

50|$|The Type XXIII had an {{all-welded}} single hull, {{the first}} submarine {{to use such}} a design. It had a fully streamlined outer casing and apart from the relatively small conning tower and a fairing which housed the Diesel exhaust silencer, it had an uncluttered upper <b>deck.</b> In <b>line</b> with Walter's design practice, there were no forward hydroplanes, although these were added later.|$|R
60|$|And now {{the boat}} which has rounded Harpswell Point is {{skimming}} {{across to the}} head of Middle Bay, where the new ship can distinctly be discerned standing upon her ways, while moving clusters of people were walking up and down her <b>decks</b> or <b>lining</b> the shore in the vicinity.

40|$|The {{flight deck}} of a moderm {{commercial}} airliner is a complex system consisting {{of two or more}} crew and a suite of technological devices. When everything goes right, all modem flight decks are easy to use. When things go sour, however, <b>automated</b> flight <b>decks</b> provide opportunities for new kinds of problems. A recent article in Aviation Week cited industry concern over the problem of verifying the safety of complex systems on automated, digital aircraft, stating that the industry must "guard against the kind of incident in which people and the automation seem to mismanage a minor occurrence or non-routine situation into larger trouble. " The design of <b>automated</b> flight <b>deck</b> systems that flight crews find easy to use safely is a challenge in part because this design activity requires a theoretical perspective which can simultaneously cover the interactions of people {{with each other and with}} technology. In this paper, I will introduce some concepts that can be used to understand the flight deck as a system that is composed of two or more pilots and a complex suite of automated devices. As I will try to show, without a theory, we can repeat what seems to work, but we may not know why it worked or how to make it work in novel circumstances. Theory allows us to rise above the particulars of specific situations and makes the application of the roots of success in one setting applicable to other settings...|$|R

50|$|While in Omaha, {{restoration}} {{work was}} done by volunteers including {{a fresh coat of}} paint, unstepping the mast for storage, and work on all decks. The bulkheads below <b>deck</b> were <b>lined</b> with rows of walnut plaques with the names of those hundreds of individuals that had given of their time and money to restore and save the LSM. There is evidence on every deck, in every compartment, from the galley to the engine room that many hours of restoration had taken place by dedicated workers.|$|R
50|$|The West Mitchell Street Bridge is a seven-span highway T-beam bridge {{constructed}} of reinforced concrete, with broad ogee arches supporting each span. It is 330 ft long and 60 ft wide.

50|$|Alabamas British-made {{ordnance}} {{was composed}} of six muzzle-loading, broadside, 32-pounder naval smoothbores (three firing to port and three firing to starboard) and two larger and more powerful pivot cannons. The pivot cannons were placed fore and aft of the main mast and positioned roughly amidships along the <b>deck's</b> center <b>line.</b> From those positions, they could be rotated to fire across the port or starboard sides of the cruiser. The fore pivot cannon was a heavy, long-range 100-pounder, 7-inch bore (178 mm) Blakely rifled muzzle-loader; the aft pivot cannon a large, 8-inch (203 mm) smoothbore.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the arrival}} of the jet age, airliners {{continued}} to increase in size. Wide-body types were introduced and, in 1970, the Boeing 747 [...] "Jumbo jet" [...] entered service. It featured a short second, upper deck to provide increased passenger accommodation. Variants of the 747 remained the largest airliners flying for well over thirty years, some with a [...] "stretched" [...] upper deck, until {{the arrival of}} the Airbus A380 series in 2007 featuring a full-length upper <b>deck.</b> Both <b>lines</b> continue to be developed, with ever-larger variants being introduced.

40|$|Asphalt wear {{surfaces}} cover 1, 378 of Minnesota's timber bridges. This study {{assessed the}} magnitude of premature asphalt deterioration on timber bridges; identified the primary mechanisms responsible for wear surface deterioration; and suggested methods for improving asphalt pavement performance on timber bridges. Research methods included surveys, meetings with several county engineers and tours of their timber bridges, interviews with both asphalt and timber bridge industry professionals, and literature reviews. The study revealed that approximately 50 percent of counties experience some problems with premature reduced serviceability of the asphalt pavement wear surfaces that cover their timber bridges. Possible pavement failure mechanisms include low-temperature cracking, reflective cracking from <b>deck</b> fault <b>lines</b> found at <b>deck</b> panel joint <b>lines</b> and <b>deck</b> lamination separations, asphalt fatigue fracturing, and asphalt de-bonding due to oil preservatives interference. The report presents the following proposed solutions for controlling timber bridge asphalt pavement cracking: asphalt pavement saw & seal, asphalt pavement fabric or material underlay, removal of extruded oil-type preservative before surfacing, conditioning of bridge timbers to the expected equilibrium moisture content before bridge installation, and tightening of timber decks through maintenance practices.

40|$|In 1991, 2001, and 2008 {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} to determine pilot perceptions of <b>automated</b> flight <b>decks</b> or “glass cockpits. ” Results from these similar surveys indicated {{that a number of}} factors identified remained the same. However, over time, some changes in perceptions were noted. The 2008 survey provided airline pilots the opportunity to write comments and express their ideas and concerns about aspects of the glass cockpit. This paper provides a qualitative analysis of their comments identified as a number of themes. Their perceptions of themes such as situational awareness, automation and technology, skills, stress, workload, and computer literacy are examined. Overall, the perceptions of the glass cockpit are positive. However, there remains an underlying caution concerning several aspects of piloting including perceived loss of manual flying skills, stress, and extreme workload resulting from the potential over-reliance and pervasiveness of computerized technology on the flight deck...|$|R
