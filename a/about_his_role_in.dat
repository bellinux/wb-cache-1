Dredd's qualms would become the catalyst to take the whole Judge Dredd strip in a new direction.|$|E

When asked <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> authorizing the arms deals, he first stated that he had; later, he appeared to contradict himself by stating that he had no recollection of doing so. In his 1990 autobiography, An American Life, Reagan acknowledges authorizing the shipments to Israel.|$|E

Shahin ultimately reconciled with Karam on 12 April under the mediation of the French general Charles de Beaufort. Shahin agreed {{to submit to the}} Qaimaqamate's authority without conditions. Later in 1861, Shahin relinquished the republic that he established in Keserwan. Subsequent to his retirement from politics, Shahin served as a judicial official in Rayfoun. There, in 1895, he died in relative obscurity. He left no memoirs <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the civil war.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{joined the}} Nazi Party (NSDAP) in August 1923; his Party number was 14,303. As {{a member of}} Röhm's {{paramilitary}} unit, Himmler {{was involved in the}} Beer Hall Putsch—an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. This event would set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the putsch, but was not charged because of insufficient evidence. However, he lost his job, was unable to find employment as an agronomist, and had to move in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.|$|E
5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Clay learns that Rip {{also had a}} fling with Rain and is now obsessed with her. When Clay discovers that Julian is {{currently}} Rain's boyfriend, he conspires with Rip to hand Julian over to him. When Julian is then found murdered, Rain confronts Clay <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the affair and is raped by him in response. He later receives a video of Julian's murder from Rip which has been overdubbed with an angry voicemail from Clay {{as a means to}} implicate him in the crime. The novel then depicts sequences of the savage sexual and physical abuse of a beautiful young girl and young boy, perpetrated by Clay. Clay experiences no feelings of remorse or guilt for this, for Julian's death, or for exploiting and raping Rain. In the last scenes, it is strongly implied that Blair has been hiring people to follow Clay. In return for his giving her what she wants, she offers to provide Clay with a false alibi that will prevent the police from arresting him as an accomplice to Julian's murder.|$|E

25|$|From Malta, d'Aramon wrote {{a letter}} about his {{intervention}} to Henry II. The role of d'Aramon was widely criticized by Charles V and Julius III on suspicion that he had encouraged the Ottomans to take the city.

In any instance, d'Aramon had a special relationship with the Ottomans, and was clearly aware that the fall of Tripoli represented a major setback for Charles V.|$|E

25|$|Saltsman v. Goddard {{concerned}} {{an effort}} by two parents of a teenage boy from Steubenville, Ohio, to stop blogger Alexandria Goddard's website from publishing allegedly defamatory posts about their son, Cody Saltsman. The parents sued Goddard and a dozen anonymous posters in October 2012; a legal blogger labeled it a SLAPP suit. The lawsuit asked for an injunction against the blogger, a public apology stating that the boy {{was not involved in}} the rape, and $25,000 in damages. The case was dismissed with prejudice in December 2012, after Goddard agreed to post a statement that the boy was remorseful <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of the Steubenville High School rape case.|$|E
25|$|Wallace's {{reputation}} and {{career as a}} military leader suffered a significant setback from controversy over Shiloh.

Sherman urged Wallace to be patient and not to request a formal inquiry. Although Sherman brought Wallace's concerns to Grant's attention, Wallace was not given another active duty command until March 1864.|$|E

25|$|On 6 June 1904, Kodama was {{promoted}} to full general. However, he was asked by Marshal Ōyama Iwao to be Chief of General Staff of the Manchurian Army during the Russo-Japanese War. This was a step down for him in terms of rank, but he nevertheless chose to take the position; it was a sacrifice which elicited much public applause. Throughout the Russo-Japanese War he guided the strategy of the whole campaign, as General Kawakami Sōroku had done in the First Sino-Japanese War ten years previously. The postwar historian Shiba Ryōtarō gives him complete credit for Japan's victory at the Siege of Port Arthur, {{although there is no}} historical evidence for this, and Kodama kept quiet <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the battle. Following the war, he was named Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, but he died soon afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Buchanan, {{along with}} former captain Ricky Ponting, led {{the side to}} {{numerous}} successes, including a world-record 16 consecutive Test match victories and 23 ODI victories in world cup tournaments, Buchanan only {{not involved in the}} first one, a 2001 and 2002–03 Ashes domination winning both series 4–1, the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup in South Africa, the 2004 tour of India, in which Australia hadn't won a series there in thirty-six years, and more recently, following their shock Ashes defeat, a whitewash of the Super Series that saw the Aussies up against a World XI. In late 2006 he helped the team to their first ever ICC Champions Trophy victory, after four previously failed attempts and followed this with a 5–0 whitewash in the 2006–07 Ashes Series, the first since the 1920–21 Series. In 2007 his team won their third consecutive world cup. His unorthodox methods have raised a few eyebrows and Shane Warne was dismissive <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the team. However, former captain Ponting has credited him as being one of the important reasons why Australia completed their World Cup hat trick of wins.|$|E
25|$|Solas {{confesses to}} being Fen'Harel, and {{creating}} the Veil {{in order to}} seal away the Evanuris after they assassinated Mythal, {{the only one who}} kept their ambition in check, before their lust for power destroyed the world. He also reveals his intentions to restore the world of the ancient elves, even if he must destroy the world of the present day. If asked <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the events of the core game, Solas explains that he had arranged for Corypheus to obtain the magical orb he used, intending for the magister to unlock it and kill himself in the subsequent explosion, after which Solas would retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to tear down the Veil, restoring the world of the ancient elves. After Corypheus survived the blast, an event Solas had not foreseen, Solas joined and supported the Inquisition, seeing them as the world's best hope of defeating Corypheus. If questioned about why he arranged for the Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered, depending on whether or not he is friends with the Inquisitor, he will either admit that he sees value in the present world, or that he simply wanted to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. At the end of their conversation, Solas magically amputates the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaves, with the Inquisitor resolving to stop him by any means necessary. Alternatively, an Inquisitor who befriended Solas can vow to convince him to abandon his plan, with Solas replying that he would be glad to be proven wrong again.|$|E
