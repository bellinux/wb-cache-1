5|$|The Russians had a {{numerical}} advantage {{but soon the}} tide swung as Drouet's Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte's I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines. The horse artillery of the Guard also inflicted heavy casualties on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mile. The casualties of the Russians in Pratzen included Kutuzov, who was severely wounded, and his son-in-law Ferdinand von Tiesenhausen who was killed.|$|E
5|$|Middlewich {{was founded}} by the Romans, who gave it the name Salinae because of its {{surrounding}} salt deposits. It {{became one of the}} major Roman sites for salt production, an activity that was centred on the township of Kinderton, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mile north of the present-day parish church of St. Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman salt production also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker's History of Manchester claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but {{it is more likely that}} the Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was once thought to have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.|$|E

25|$|It was {{the site}} of the now defunct Hurst Park horse race course. The 1872 Ordnance Survey map shows a race course marked Molesey Hurst in this position. The {{location}} of the cricket ground was probably in the centre of the racecourse, which was common practice in the 18th century.

25|$|In 1805 she sailed for the West Indies under Captain Robert Hall. On 2 January 1806 {{she and the}} brig-sloop , (or Wolfe), Captain George Charles Mackenzie, {{captured}} the French privateer schooners Régulateur and Napoléon in Port Azarades, Cuba. The port was protected by a double reef of rocks so Hall sent the master of Malabar in a boat to find a passage. Once a passage was found, rather than go in to capture the vessels, Wolfe came in, but stopped <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mile away. She then engaged the privateers for almost two hours until their crews abandoned their ships, landed and escaped into the woods. Then Wolfe and Malabar sent in their boats to take possession.|$|E
25|$|The {{plantation}} produced oranges, {{sea island}} cotton, indigo, okra, and other vegetables. Approximately 60 slaves were managed under the task system: each slave had a quota {{of work to}} do per day. When they were finished, they were allowed to do what they wished. Some slaves had personal gardens which they were allowed to cultivate, and from which they sold vegetables. Thirty-two cabins were constructed for and by the slaves, made from tabby, which made them durable, insulated, and inexpensive although labor-intensive. The cabins were located <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mile (400 m) from the main house. Slaves were allowed to padlock their cabins and build porches that faced away from the main house. Both of these features were unusual for slave quarters in antebellum America.|$|E

25|$|Vere {{decided on}} a plan to take {{advantage}} of the Spanish activity and this required the deployment of a body of English - 500 horse and 1,200 musketeers and pikemen, a force which was readily placed under his orders by Maurice. About two thirds of the way from the Anglo-Dutch camp there was a bridge over the broader road which Vere marched to early the next morning. He sent 200 light horse to attack the Spanish outposts and then retreat where they would be caught by the Spanish veterans. In the meantime he placed his infantry in ambush, one detachment close to the bridge, the other <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mile further back, and the rest of his cavalry in the rear. Vere hoped he would be able to lure Parma's seasoned veterans of Spaniards and Italian Tercios into a fight.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 the IBM350 RAMAC {{disk storage}} unit was {{superseded}} by the IBM1301 {{disk storage unit}}, which consisted of 50 platters, each about 1/8-inch thick and 24 inches in diameter. Whereas the IBM350 used only two read/write heads which were pneumatically actuated and moved in two dimensions, the 1301 {{was one of the}} first disk storage units to use an array of heads, one per platter, moving as a single unit. Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6µm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes. Access time was <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second.|$|E
25|$|Bourne and Clowes' Primitive Methodism germinated in the Camp Meetings from 1807 onwards and its {{separate}} {{organisational form}} came {{about as a}} direct result of the Wesleyan circuit authorities' reaction to these Meetings. Camp Meetings were all day, open-air gatherings for Christian preaching and group prayer, usually followed by a Love Feast. They were based on evangelical revival meetings in America. The first such meeting in England was held on Sunday 31 May 1807, between 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., in a field at School Farm, Mow Cop, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mile south west of Mow Cop Folly (a mock castle ruins built in 1754). Mow Cop, on the Staffordshire – Cheshire border, was a bleak spot lying as it does on a limestone ridge rising to 1,091 feet above sea level. Nevertheless, during the afternoon, the Camp still managed to draw a crowd of up to 4,000 people.|$|E

25|$|The city lies on {{the west}} bank of the Siem Reap River, a {{tributary}} of Tonle Sap, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mile from the river. The south gate of Angkor Thom is 7.2km north of Siem Reap, and 1.7km north of the entrance to Angkor Wat. The walls, 8m high and flanked by a moat, are each 3km long, enclosing an area of 9km². The walls are of laterite buttressed by earth, with a parapet on the top. There are gates at each of the cardinal points, from which roads lead to the Bayon at the centre of the city. As the Bayon itself has no wall or moat of its own, those of the city are interpreted by archaeologists as representing the mountains and oceans surrounding the Bayon's Mount Meru. Another gate—the Victory Gate—is 500m north of the east gate; the Victory Way runs parallel to the east road to the Victory Square and the Royal Palace north of the Bayon.|$|E
25|$|In 1177, John led an {{invasion}} of Ulaid (an area roughly encompassing what is today County Antrim and County Down). He reached Down (modern day Downpatrick), drove off Ruaidrí Mac Duinn Sléibe, King of Ulaid (died 1201), consolidated his conquest, and ruled {{with a certain amount}} of independence for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> century. Although the precise date of the marriage between John and Affrica is unknown, the union itself may well have attributed to his stunning successes in Ireland. Certainly, decades later in the reign of Guðrøðr's son and successor, Rǫgnvaldr (died 1229), John received significant military support from the Crovan dynasty, and it is not improbable that Guðrøðr himself supplied similar assistance. In the 1190s, John also received military assistance from Guðrøðr's kinsman Donnchad mac Gilla Brigte, Earl of Carrick (died 1250). Like Guðrøðr, Donnchad was a grandson of Fergus, and it possible that John's marriage to Affrica accounts for Donnchad's cooperation with him.|$|E
25|$|It is {{reasonable}} to assume that the present site of Cromer, around the parish church of Saints Peter and Paul, is what was in 1337 called Shipden-juxta-Felbrigg, {{and by the end of}} the 14th century known as Cromer. A reference to a place called Crowemere Shipden can be seen in a legal record, dated 1422, (1 Henry VI), the home of John Gees. The other Shipden is now <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mile to the north east of the end of Cromer Pier, under the sea. Its site is marked by Church Rock, now no longer visible, even at a low spring tide. In 1888 a small pleasure steamer called Victoria struck the remains of the church tower, and the rock was subsequently blown up for safety. In the present day, members of Great Yarmouth sub-aqua club dived at the site, and salvaged artefacts from both the medieval church and the wreck of Victoria.|$|E

The authors of a 2009 guide to the buildings of north-west Wales record the tradition that a church was first established at this site in 616. St Nidan, who founded the church here, was associated with St Seiriol's monastery at Penmon, on the eastern tip of Anglesey, and was the monastery's confessor.
