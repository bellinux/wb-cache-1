50|$|The flag is {{displayed}} <b>at</b> half-staff (<b>half-mast</b> in naval usage) {{as a sign}} of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president.

Black ribbons indicate mourning on banners that can't be lowered to halfmast.|$|R

On March 9, that following Saturday night, Hockey Night in Canada broadcast a special tribute to Connors at the opening of its broadcast.|$|R

50|$|On 15 August, {{a day of}} {{mourning}} was observed, with flags lowered to <b>half-mast</b> <b>at</b> government buildings within China and at embassies in foreign countries. Additionally, all public and online entertainment was suspended, and major newspapers and internet sites were grayscaled. At the Expo 2010 in Shanghai, all activities were canceled. Such events are rare in China; only after an earlier earthquake in 2010 and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake {{in recent years have}} such periods {{of mourning}} been observed.|$|R
25|$|The flag is {{displayed}} <b>at</b> half-staff (<b>half-mast</b> in naval usage) {{as a sign}} of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.|$|R
2500|$|King Abdullah left Saudi Arabia on [...] "special leave" [...] on 27 August 2012. Al-Quds {{reported}} that he had an operation at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, on or before 4 September 2012, following a heart attack. However, there was no official report on this alleged operation – instead, it was announced that the King went on a private trip to Morocco, where he is known to frequent. The King returned to Saudi Arabia from Morocco on 24 September. Nearly two months later, in November 2012, King Abdullah underwent another back surgery in Riyadh and left hospital on 13 December 2012. A report in April 2014 stated that the King had around six months left to live, citing a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer. On 2 January 2015, Abdullah was hospitalized in Riyadh for pneumonia and died on 23 January at the age of 90. Per Islamic tradition, his funeral was held the same day, a public ceremony at the Grand Mosque of Riyadh before burial in an unmarked grave at the Al Oud cemetery. Three days of national mourning were declared, in which flags would fly at half mast. Flags were also flown <b>half-mast</b> <b>at</b> Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey in London.|$|R
5|$|The flag {{should be}} flown <b>at</b> <b>half-mast</b> {{as a sign}} of mourning. The {{decision}} to do so lies with the President of India, who also decides the period of such mourning. When the flag is to be flown at half mast, it must first be raised {{to the top of the}} mast and then slowly lowered. Only the Indian flag is flown half mast; all other flags remain at normal height.|$|E
5|$|The monarch's {{official}} flag in the United Kingdom is the Royal Standard, which {{depicts the}} Royal Arms in banner form. It is flown only from buildings, vessels and vehicles {{in which the}} Sovereign is present. The Royal Standard is never flown <b>at</b> <b>half-mast</b> because {{there is always a}} sovereign: when one dies, his or her successor becomes the sovereign instantly.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan was {{afflicted by}} illness {{in his final}} years. He was {{diagnosed}} with throat cancer in 1993 before contracting an inoperable lung cancer, which led to his death on 6 February 1999. A public memorial service was held on 9 February at the Adelaide Festival Centre {{as a tribute to}} Dunstan's love of the arts. In attendance were former Labor Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke, Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, Premier John Olsen, and State Opposition Leader Mike Rann. Thousands more gathered outside the centre in Elder Park {{along the banks of the}} River Torrens. State flags were flown <b>at</b> <b>half-mast</b> and the memorial service was televised live.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Wheeler became {{increasingly}} forgetful {{and came to}} rely largely on his assistant, Molly Myres, to organise his affairs. Amid increasing ill health, in September 1973 he moved full-time into Myres's house in Leatherhead, Surrey, although he continued to use his central London flat during day-trips to the city. There, he authored a final book, My Archaeological Mission to India and Pakistan, {{although much of the}} text was culled from his previous publications; it was published by Thames and Hudson in 1976. After suffering a stroke, Wheeler died at Myers' home on 22 July 1976. In memoriam, the British Academy, Royal Academy, and Royal Society flew their flags <b>at</b> <b>half-mast.</b> Wheeler's funeral was held with full military honours at a local crematorium, while a larger memorial service was held in St James's Church, Piccadilly in November.|$|E
5|$|Although Heber's episcopate {{had been}} brief {{he had made}} a {{considerable}} impression, and news of his death brought many tributes from around India. Sir Charles Grey, an old Oxford friend who was serving as Calcutta's Chief Justice, spoke of Heber's cheerfulness, his lack of self-importance, his good humour, patience and kindness. Flags were flown <b>at</b> <b>half-mast</b> in Madras and Calcutta, and the Governor-General ordered a salute of 42 guns—one for each completed year of the bishop's life. In several cities public subscriptions were opened to raise funds for monuments. In St John's church in Trichinopoly, initially a simple plaque above the grave recorded the date and place of Heber's death; this was in due course made much more elaborate. In St George's church, Madras, a large sculpture by Francis Chantrey was erected, depicting Heber ministering to members of his flock. Reflecting Heber's interest in the training of local ordinands, further funds were raised to provide Heber scholarships at Bishop's College; in Trichinopoly a school founded by the German missionary Christian Friedrich Schwarz became the Heber Memorial School.|$|E
5|$|Following a long {{fight against}} cancer, {{spending}} {{most of the last}} year of his life in and out of hospital, Odlum died on 28 September 2003 in Tapion Hospital, Castries, aged 69. The body lay in state on 5 October, where it was viewed by Pearlette Louisy, Kenny Anthony, and members of the Cabinet. Odlum's funeral was held on 6 October, with a 30-vehicle procession travelling from Vieux Fort to Castries; it was led by a pair of police outriders and a coach carrying the coffin, draped in the national flag. St Lucian citizens were reported to be openly weeping at Odlum's death. The funeral itself was held in a park, due to no church in Castries being large enough to hold the number of mourners. During the service, sections of his most famous speeches were broadcast from loudspeakers. James Fletcher, a Cabinet Secretary, had previously announced that all flags would be flown <b>at</b> <b>half-mast</b> for the day as a tribute.|$|E
