5|$|An {{estimated}} 13 {{million people}} went whale watching globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic. Rules and {{codes of conduct}} have been created to minimize harassment of the whales. Iceland, Japan and Norway have both whaling and whale watching industries. Whale watching lobbyists <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, {{will be the first}} to be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas. Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. In contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.|$|E
5|$|The {{confirmation}} of extraterrestrial intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E

25|$|The {{economy is}} based {{primarily}} on tourism, which makes up 32% of the GDP. The Canaries receive about 12million tourists per year. Construction makes up nearly 20% of the GDP and tropical agriculture, primarily bananas and tobacco, are grown for export to Europe and the Americas. Ecologists <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resources, especially in the more arid islands, are being overexploited {{but there are still}} many agricultural resources like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cochineal, sugarcane, grapes, vines, dates, oranges, lemons, figs, wheat, barley, maize, apricots, peaches and almonds.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} March, {{veterinary}} organizations {{reported more}} than 100 pet deaths amongst nearly 500 cases of kidney failure, with one online database self-reporting as many as 3,600 deaths as of 11 April. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of several thousand cats and dogs who have died after eating contaminated food, but have only confirmed 14 cases, in part {{because there is no}} centralized government database of animal sickness or death in the United States, as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). As a result, many sources speculate the actual number of affected pets may never be known, and experts <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actual death toll could potentially reach into the thousands.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{and groups}} such as the ones listed above <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bills are written to hide welfare and safety {{violations}} in the animal agriculture industry from the public view. While laws aimed at restricting documentation or employee applications directly restrict documentation, the third type of law (e.g. Missouri's) is said to be intended to promote the rapid prosecution of any business displaying such practices. However, critics of the bills contend that when all material must be turned over to authorities in such {{a short amount of time}} (generally within twenty-four hours), establishments can easily cover up or change their practices or fire the employee before further documentation can occur, making a thorough investigation of any farm virtually impossible.|$|E
25|$|As this is {{a sacred}} ceremony, people are {{typically}} reluctant to discuss it in any great detail. Given {{a long history of}} cultural misappropriation, indigenous people are suspicious that non-Natives may abuse or misuse the traditional ways. Elders and medicine men <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ceremony should only be passed along in the right ways. The words used at a sun dance are often in the native language and are not translated for outsiders. Not talking about this ceremony is part of the respect the people display for it. In addition, the detailed way in which a respected elder speaks, teaches, and explains a sun dance to younger members of the tribe is unique and not easily quoted, nor is it intended for publication.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century {{it was assumed that}} any proof could, in principle, be checked by a {{competent}} mathematician to confirm its validity. However, computers are now used both to prove theorems and to carry out calculations that are too long for any human or team of humans to check; the first proof of the four color theorem {{is an example of a}} computer-assisted proof. Some mathematicians <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> possibility of an error in a computer program or a run-time error in its calculations calls the validity of such computer-assisted proofs into question. In practice, the chances of an error invalidating a computer-assisted proof can be reduced by incorporating redundancy and self-checks into calculations, and by developing multiple independent approaches and programs. Errors can never be completely ruled out in case of verification of a proof by humans either, especially if the proof contains natural language and requires deep mathematical insight.|$|E

25|$|Their slow-moving, curious nature, {{coupled with}} dense coastal development, {{has led to}} many violent {{collisions}} with propeller-driven boats and ships, leading frequently to maiming, disfigurement, and even death. As a result, {{a large proportion of}} manatees exhibit spiral cutting propeller scars on their backs, usually caused by larger vessels that do not have skegs in front of the propellers like the smaller outboard and inboard-outboard recreational boats have. They are now even identified by humans based on their scar patterns. Many manatees have been cut in two by large vessels like ships and tug boats, even in the highly populated lower St. Johns River's narrow channels. Some <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current situation is inhumane, with upwards of 50 scars and disfigurements from vessel strikes on a single manatee. Often, the lacerations lead to infections, which can prove fatal. Internal injuries stemming from being trapped between hulls and docks and impacts have also been fatal. Recent testing shows that manatees may be able to hear speed boats and other watercraft approaching, due to the frequency the boat makes. However, a manatee {{may not be able to}} hear the approaching boats when they are performing day-to-day activities or distractions. The manatee has a tested frequency range of 8 kilohertz to 32 kilohertz.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a number of criticisms of the premium support model. Some have raised concern about risk selection, where {{insurers}} find ways to avoid covering people expected to have high health care costs. Premium support proposals, such as the 2011 plan proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R–Wis.), have aimed to avoid risk selection by including protection language mandating that plans participating in such coverage must provide insurance to all beneficiaries and are not able to avoid covering higher risk beneficiaries. Some critics <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Medicare population, which has particularly high rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, would have a hard time choosing between competing health plans. Robert Moffit, a senior fellow of The Heritage Foundation responded to this concern, stating that while there may be research indicating that individuals have difficulty making the correct choice of health care plan, there is no evidence to show that government officials can make better choices. Henry Aaron, one of the original proponents of premium supports, has recently argued that the idea should not be implemented, given that Medicare Advantage plans have not successfully contained costs more effectively than traditional Medicare and because the political climate is hostile to the kinds of regulations that would be needed to make the idea workable.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} more subtle shifts away from the core {{influences}} of Dungeons & Dragons {{that existed in the}} 1980s and 1990s. Games were originally closely tied to the system's basic mechanics such as dice rolls and turn-based tactical combat, but are now moving in the direction of real-time modes, simplified mechanics and skill-based interfaces. Dungeons & Dragons itself is diverging from its roots, as the 4th Edition D rules have been compared to role-playing video games like World of Warcraft and Fire Emblem. Even as some non-role-playing games adopt RPG elements, [...] developers and publishers <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> term [...] "role-playing game" [...] might alienate non-RPG gamers.|$|E
