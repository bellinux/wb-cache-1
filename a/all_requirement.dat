50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1969, Batch 0, the {{preproduction}} batch built for initial tests had been successfully tested in lakes. Development immediately continued to directly modify Batch 0 torpedoes for oceanic trials, with modification completed in 1971, and oceanic tests begun in 1972, with the design finalized in 1975. However, oceanic environment had caused unexpected problems and from 1974 {{to the beginning of}} 1976, over 40 enterprises were ordered by the Yunnan National Defense Office to help Dawn Machinery Factory (Shuguan Jixie Chang, 曙光机械厂) of the Yunnan 6th Machinery Bureau to complete the development of Yu-3 torpedo, but when all of the problems have been solved, it was already years after the designed had already been finalized, and due to the political turmoil in China and the technology bottlenecks, China still had a long way to go. In December 1977, the production version of Yu-3 torpedo was successfully tested in lakes, and from March to October, 1983, work was concentrated on solving the problems discovered during oceanic tests, during which a total of 43 Yu-3 torpedoes were test fired. Finally, in March 1984, the torpedo met <b>all</b> <b>requirement</b> and went into mass production. In May 1988, Han class nuclear submarine had successfully test-launched Yu-3 torpedo at maximum depth in deep water testing facility in Hainan. The torpedo was also given a name as Chinese sturgeon (Zhonghua Xun, 中华鲟).|$|E

It is secure and no known attack possible on this as we have shown in informal threat analysis and above all it does not depends on Certification Authority/Trusted third party and consumes very less resources. It is also very efficient and deployable that we have shown through experiments. It meets <b>all</b> <b>requirement</b> of IoT scenario like Heterogeneity, Scalability etc...|$|E

A flexible and efficient runtime platform is therefore required to exploit the capabilities of a given programming model in practice. Arts is an open {{object oriented}} framework that provides customizable runtime services for parallel processing within a global distributed object space. In this paper we present the fundamental mechanisms of Arts including performance measurements. We focus especially on location independent invocation as well as migration mechanisms, two key concepts for dynamic load-balancing. 1 Introduction A parallel runtime system has to fill the gap between high-level programming models and the parallel computing platform.

The calibration equations relate scene radiate flux to sensor output values. The parameters integrated into the calibration equations for the system include gain and integration normalization, linearity correction, dark offset, and non-uniformity correction. The absolute responsively, spectral out-of-band sensor response, and non-ideal performance of the mid-wave infrared (MWIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and visible imaging spectrometer (VIS) sensors will be measured. The calibration will include estimates of measurement uncertainties generated with descriptions of their applicability to any particular on-orbit measurement objective.

40|$|A {{temporal}} flexible planning {{problem that}} involves contingent and requirement events can be formulated {{as a simple}} temporal network with uncertainty (STNU). An STNU is controllable {{when there is a}} strategy for executing the requirement events (or actions) {{in such a way that}} all the conditions involving contingent events can be satisfied in all situations. The most interesting and useful controllability property is dynamic controllability in which the remaining actions in an STNU can always be scheduled under all possible feasible durations of future contingent events when all the past contingent events are known. In this paper, we propose and study a novel problem of assigning bounds on the duration of each requirement link in order for the resulting STNU to be dynamically controllable and to minimize the total cost over the allowed durations of <b>all</b> <b>requirement</b> links. We first prove the NP hardness of the problem with a linear cost function. We then formulate the dynamic controllability of an STNU as the constraints in a nonlinear optimization problem. Finally, we present methods for reducing the number of constraints in order to make the problem tractable and to demonstrate the computational performance of our methods.

40|$|Work and {{employment}} {{has long been}} regarded as crucial for {{the mental health of}} human beings. Unemployment may lead to deterioration of physical and mental health. Nevertheless, for adults with psychiatric disabilities, discontinuity of employment is common. They may have various reasons to discontinue their employment. In Hong Kong, only 2. 5 % of people with psychiatric disabilities discharged from sheltered workshops are able to seek open employment. By means of illustration, the authors will show that traditional Chinese work culture tends to reinforce the discontinuity of employment of adult males with psychiatric disabilities. In Chinese culture, work is a means to occupy time, control misbehavior, show consistency of words and deeds, and to glorify parents and ancestors. All these factors contribute to the fulfillment of an adult male role and identity in traditional Chinese culture. In this case history, instead of finding realistic employment, a male adult with psychiatric disability tried to indulge himself in what he felt was his ideal job to fulfill <b>all</b> <b>requirement</b> as an adult male in Chinese culture. The imaginative ideal job gave him excuses to discontinue open employment. Its implications to vocational rehabilitation with male adults with psychiatric disability are also discussed.
