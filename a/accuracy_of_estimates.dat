The important project characteristics influencing the accuracy of pre-tender {{building cost}} estimates are examined and practical improvement for increasing the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimates</b> are considered. A quantitative approach is used to address the research problem. Analysis of data from 56 projects and from a postal questionnaire survey of 102 quantity surveying firms suggests that the accuracy of pre-tender building cost estimates varies according to project size and principal structural material. When eight identified project characteristics are controlled in a multiple regression analysis, the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimates</b> is influenced by project size. The estimates of smaller projects are more biased than the estimates of larger projects. It was discovered that pre-tender building costs are more often overestimated than are underestimated. Overestimated forecasts are incorrect by a larger amount than underestimated forecasts. Data analysis also revealed that the accuracy of pre-tender building cost estimates has not improved over time.

40|$|Introduction Genetic {{evaluation}} and estimation of breeding value {{are one of}} the most fundamental elements of breeding programmes for genetic improvement. Recently, genomic selection has become an efficient method to approach this aim. The <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> Genomic breeding value is the most important factor in genomic selection. Different studies have been performed addressing the factors affecting the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> Genomic breeding value. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of beta and gamma distributions on the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> genetic evaluation. Materials and Methods A genome consisted of 10 chromosomes with 200 cm length was simulated. Markers were spaced on 0. 2 cm intervals and different numbers of QTL with random distribution were simulated. Only additive gene effects were considered. The base population was simulated with an effective size of 100 animals and this structure continued up to generation 50 to creating linkage disequilibrium between the markers and QTL. The population size was increased to 1000 animals in generation 51 (reference generation). Marker effects were calculated from the genomic and phenotypic information. Genomic breeding value was computed in generations 52 to 57 (training generation). Effects of gamma 1 distribution (shape= 0. 4, scale= 1. 66), gamma 2 distribution (shape= 0. 4, scale= 1) and beta distribution (shape 1 = 3. 11, shape 2 = 1. 16) were studied in the reference and training groups. The heritability values were 0. 2 and 0. 05. Results and Discussion The results showed that <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> genomic breeding value reduced with passing generation (from 51 to 57) for two gamma distributions and beta distribution; this decrease may be due to two factors: recombination has negative impact on <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> genomic breeding value and selection reduces genetic variance as the number <b>of</b> generations increases. <b>Accuracy</b> <b>of</b> genomic <b>estimated</b> breeding value increased as the heritability increased so that the high heritability had more accuracy than low heritability in same QTL number. Number and distribution of genes is an important factor for <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> breeding value. Duncan test was conducted by SPSS software. Results illustrated that there was no significant difference between the different distributions. Comparing <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> breeding value showed that in the low heritability scenario with 10 and 20 QTL, gamma distribution 2 and gamma distribution 1 performed well, respectively, whilst in 50 and 100 QTL scenario, beta distribution was superior in both Lasso and Ridge methods. In the high heritability scenario with 50, 100 QTL gamma distributions 2 were superior in both Lasso and Ridge methods. With four QTL (10, 20, 50 & 100), in high heritability scenario, estimated genomic breeding value was often increased by increasing the number of QTL. This may be due to increasing linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL. In general, the gamma distribution led to the increased <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the estimations in both Lasso and Ridge methods. Conclusion Marker density, method to estimate marker effects, QTL distribution, number of QTL, number of generations and trait heritability are some effective factors on <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> genomic breeding value. The <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> genomic breeding value is output of these factors and the distribution of genes is an important factor for <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> genomic breeding value. We can conclude that, accuracy is reduced with increasing number of generations from base population to training population while the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> genomic breeding value is increased when breeding value of the reference group is used in lieu of the phenotypic records. In addition, <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> genomic breeding value is enhanced by increasing heritability, so that, between three the distributions simulated in high heritability scenario, gamma 2 distribution increased <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estimates.</b> Although, the size and distribution of QTL effects still greatly influence the effectiveness of the genomic prediction methods, but as a suggestion, models of genetic variation of genomic assessment should be considered, since a method <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> breeding value may have (or produce) a better estimation with a specific model...|$|R

The Factors manipulated in this study were type of underlying difficulty (b) distribution, type of underlying discrimination (a) distribution, type of underlying lower asymptote (c) distribution, test length (I), type of underlying latent trait (2 ̆ 6 thgr;) distribution, sample size (J), and the number of quadrature points. ^ Results showed that the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estimated</b> SEb under the 1 PL, 2 PL, and 3 PL models depended on the magnitude of the b parameter being estimated. Under the 1 PL model, the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estimated</b> SEb was related to the underlying b and 2 ̆ 6 thgr; distributions as well as I. The 2 PL model results showed that the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estimated</b> SEb was related to I, but no other factors in this study {{had an impact on the}} <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> estimation of SEb under this model. For the 3 PL model, results showed that the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estimated</b> SEb tended to be impacted by I, while certain combinations of J, I, underlying b distribution, and underlying a distribution had consistently uniform <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> estimation of SEb across the range of b parameters studied. ^ When considering the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estimated</b> SEa, the 2 PL and 3 PL model results showed that the accuracy depended upon the magnitude of the a parameter being estimated, while an increase in I increased the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estimated</b> SEa under the 2 PL and 3 PL models. Moreover, 2 PL and 3 PL model results showed the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estimated</b> SEa was related to the underlying item a, b, and 2 ̆ 6 thgr; distributions as well as J and I, when the entire range of a parameters was considered. ^ The <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estimated</b> SEc under the 3 PL model was independent of the magnitude of the item c parameter being estimated and unaffected by any combination of factors studied.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{purpose of}} this study was three fold: 1) to {{determine}} if false consensus effects would be found for <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> sexual behaviors, 2) to determine the directional <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> consensus <b>estimates</b> for subscribers and nonsubscribers and 3) to determine if the degree <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> those <b>estimates</b> was influenced by self-esteem, sexual esteem, collective self-esteem, and religiosity. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 821 university students to gather consensus estimates for twelve sexual behavior items. False consensus effects were found for all twelve behavioral items and further analysis was done to determine the directional <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estimates</b> as well as to determine what motivational factors might influence the degree <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the consensus <b>estimates.</b> The specific motivational factors examined were self-esteem, sexual esteem, collective self-esteem, and religiosity. These four factors were measured using the following scales: 1) the Self-Esteem Scale (SES) (Rosenberg, 1965), 2) the Sexuality Scale (SS) (Snell & Papini, 1989; Wiederman & Allgeier, 1993), 3) the Collective Self-Esteem Scale Revised (CSES-R) (Luhtanen & Crocker, 1992) and 4) the Scale of Attitude Towards Christianity (Francis & Stubbs, 1987; Francis, 1989).

40|$|Captive populations where {{natural mating}} in groups {{is used to}} obtain {{offspring}} typically yield unbalanced population structures with highly skewed parental contributions and unknown pedigrees. Consequently, for genetic parameter estimation, relationships need to be reconstructed or estimated using DNA marker data. With missing parents and natural mating groups, commonly used pedigree reconstruction methods are not accurate and lead to loss of data. Relatedness estimators, however, infer relationships between all animals sampled. In this study, we compared a pedigree relatedness method and a relatedness estimator ("molecular relatedness") method using <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> breeding values. A commercial data set of common sole, Solea solea, with 51 parents and 1953 offspring ("full data set") was used. Due to missing parents, for 1338 offspring, a pedigree could be reconstructed with 10 microsatellite markers ("reduced data set").
