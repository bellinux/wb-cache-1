40|$|The basic {{stability}} of the Ka-band correlation receiver’s active electronics, measured with its inputs terminated at cryogenic temperature, is quite good. Most samples show an Allan variance minimum times are beyond 100 seconds for almost all Zpectrometer lags. The electronic stability is probably dominated by relatively long-term thermal drifts in the receiver’s cryogenic or warm IF electronics. Zpectrometer correlator internal offsets have low variance and are very stable. Although low-level ground loops are apparent, we see no sign of pickup on <b>amplifier</b> <b>bias</b> lines. The cross-correlation function offsets we have analyzed earlier are symptoms of gain imbalance rather than a cause of the instability: gain imbalance in the receiver’s circuitry before the input hybrid degrades the correlation receiver’s rejection of common-mode input signals, including emission from the atmosphere. Rapid nodding and excellent input circuit gain balance are consequently more important for ground-based than space-based correlation receivers. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we have {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} optimized bias current of semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) to achieve high-speed input pulse train amplification with high gain and low distortion. Variations of the amplified output pulse duration with the <b>amplifier</b> <b>bias</b> currents have been analyzed and, {{compared to the}} input pulse duration, the amplified output pulse duration is broadened. As the SOA bias current decreases from the high level (larger than the saturated bias current) to the low level, the broadened pulse duration of the amplified output pulse initially decreases slowly and then rapidly.

The relation between the SOA optimized bias current and {{the parameters of the}} input pulse train (pulse duration, power, and repetition rate) are experimentally studied. It is found that the larger the input pulse duration, the lower the input pulse power or a higher repetition rate can lead to a larger SOA optimized bias current, which corresponds to a larger optimized SOA gain.
