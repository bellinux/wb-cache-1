5|$|As an Eastern Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone, Olivia maintained well-defined outflow and inflow. It gradually intensified as it paralleled {{the southern}} Central America coastline. Late on September 21, a Hurricane Hunters flight reported winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and an eye 23 miles (37 km) in diameter; {{based on the}} readings, Olivia was upgraded to hurricane status. For several days, Olivia moved west to west-northwestward {{off the coast of}} Mexico, although its exact intensity fluctuations were unknown, due to lack of significant observations. On September 25, the eye became very pronounced on satellite imagery, and based on <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated Olivia reached peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), about 245 miles (395 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The Hurricane Hunters also reported a pressure of 948 mbar, which was the lowest reported pressure during the 1971 Pacific hurricane season.|$|E

5|$|In Mazatlán and 22other nearby towns, power {{service was}} cut off but was {{restored}} the next day. The surge and strong winds of Hurricane Tico were responsible for severe flooding and heavy damage.

Many roofs of homes received damage. In addition, the hurricane disrupted the flow of drinking water. A total of 13 hotels received extensive damage and 14 people were hurt. Throughout Durango, many bridges collapsed due to flooding. Twenty-five thousand people were homeless and damage throughout the country was estimated at $200million (1983USD).

5|$|More than 40 {{hours after}} the {{offensive}} began, substantial columns of the Seventh Ottoman Army were seen withdrawing northeastwards from Nablus, {{in the direction of}} the Jordan River where many would be captured by the 11th Cavalry Brigade of the 4th Cavalry Division. Liman von Sanders, the commander of the Yildirim Army Group, had been surprised by the arrival of EEF cavalry at Nazareth in the early hours of 20 September. With no combat formations available to stop the EEF cavalry, he and his staff were forced to retire from Nazareth, driving via Tiberias, to reach Samakh in the late afternoon. Here he made arrangements to establish a strong rearguard garrison in what he planned would be the center of a rearguard line which was to stretch from Lake Hule to Irbid. Liman von Sanders drove on to Deraa on the morning of 21 September, where he received <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Fourth Army, which he ordered to withdraw to the Deraa-to-Irbid line, without waiting for the southern Hejaz garrisons.

5|$|Multi-purpose types {{like the}} Charolais and the Morvan were slowly supplanted in farmers' favor by draft horses. The Nivernais breed, in particular, was {{preferred}} by farmers and threatened {{the existence of}} the Charolais. Thus, the original small multi-purpose strain of Charolais gave way to a type of small draft horse that was next crossed with purebred and crossbred Thoroughbreds until, by 1850, it had become a horse for cavalry purposes. It was thought by some enthusiasts, however, that this outcrossing reduced the quality of the breed, and many missed the old-style Charolais, which had disappeared {{due to a lack of}} demand and use. However, others thought that the outcrossings had benefited the Charolais breed: in 1919, one author stated that the breeding of the Charolais type was in excellent condition, and <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> time stated that the favorite horse of King Albert I of Belgium was a Charolais named Titanic.|$|E

5|$|To {{promote the}} game, Valve has {{produced}} three machinima trailers depicting {{the game in}} play. The trailers are themed around wartime propaganda news reports for both Germany and the United States. To convey this effect, the trailers make extensive usage of the Source engine's capabilities for film grain, color correction, motion blur and depth of field, as well as sepia toning. The first trailer was released {{as part of the}} game's post-release marketing on December 20, 2005. Entitled Prelude to Victory, the trailer depicted a large firefight in the game as <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> German perspective, complete with a commentator speaking in the German language. Two further trailers were released to promote the major update to Day of Defeat: Source {{in the second quarter of}} 2006. The trailers, both from the American viewpoint, displayed how the new detonation gameplay worked, emphasising teamwork as the key to success, as well as introducing the viewer to the two new maps added by the update. To further create interest in the game, Valve has opened Day of Defeat: Source to three free weekends, the first taking place on February 10, 2006, the second on July 8, 2006 and the third on July 4, 2008, where anyone with a Steam account could download and play the game for a maximum of 48 hours free of charge.|$|E
