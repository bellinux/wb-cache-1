5|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{exist for}} acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, <b>antiseborrheic</b> medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and salicylic acid. They {{are believed to}} work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing P. acnes, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, and systemic therapies including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.|$|E
50|$|Promestriene (INN) (brand names Colpotrofin, Colpotrophine, Delipoderm), {{also known}} as {{estradiol}} 3-propyl 17β-methyl diether, is a synthetic, steroidal estrogen used topically in a 1% cream formulation. It is the 3-propyl and 17β-methyl diether of estradiol. The drug {{is described as a}} tropic agent and <b>antiseborrheic.</b> It has not been found to be effective in the treatment of androgenic alopecia or other conditions of cutaneous androgenization.|$|E

50|$|This forms a {{major and}} {{critical}} {{part in the}} disease treatment and the shampoo treatment can need to be applied as often as 3 to 4 times per week. An <b>antiseborrheic</b> shampoo removes the scale blocking theolr follicles. The mineral oil soak, whereby the oil remains on the affected animal for at least 2 hours, is needed to replace epidemal lipids {{as well as to}} restore normal epidermal barrier function. The oil is then removed through the process of many baths. This oil treatment needs to be repeated {{at least once a week}} for 4 to 7 weeks until new hair growth is observed. Once new hair growth is observed, topical treatment can be decreased to every 2 to 4 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Shampoo {{intended}} for animals may contain insecticides or other medications {{for treatment of}} skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas or mange. These must never be used on humans. While some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals, any human haircare products that contain active ingredients or drugs (such as zinc in anti-dandruff shampoos) are potentially toxic when ingested by animals. Special {{care must be taken}} not to use those products on pets. Cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues.Shampoos that are especially designed to be used on pets, commonly dogs and cats, are normally intended {{to do more than just}} clean the pet's coat or skin. Most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act differently and are meant to treat a skin condition or an allergy or to fight against fleas.The main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals, <b>antiseborrheic,</b> antibacterials, antifungals, emollients, emulsifiers and humectants. Whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions, pet owners are recommended to use them according to their veterinarian's indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused.Generally, insecticidal pet shampoos contain pyrethrin, pyrethroids (such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats) and carbaryl. These ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations.Antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or ringworm infections. These might contain ingredients such as miconazole, chlorhexidine, providone iodine, ketoconazole or selenium sulfide (which cannot be used on cats).Bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos. They commonly contain benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, triclosan, ethyl lactate, or sulfur.Antipruritic shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies. These usually contain colloidal oatmeal, hydrocortisone, Aloe vera, pramoxine hydrochloride, menthol, diphenhydramine, sulfur or salicylic acid. These ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation, cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet.Antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats. These shampoos are made of sulfur, salicylic acid, refined tar (which cannot be used on cats), selenium sulfide (cannot be used on cats) and benzoyl peroxide. All these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa, which is a condition characterized by excess oils. Dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs.Emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin. They usually contain oils such as almond, corn, cottonseed, coconut, olive, peanut, Persia, safflower, sesame, lanolin, mineral or paraffin oil. The emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients. These include ingredients such as cetyl alcohol, laureth-5, lecithin, PEG-4 dilaurate, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, carboxylic acid, lactic acid, urea, sodium lactate, propylene glycol, glycerin, or polyvinylpyrrolidone.Although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective, some others may be less effective for some condition than another. Yet, although natural pet shampoos exist, it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause irritation to the skin of the pet. Natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include eucalyptus, lemon or orange extracts and tea tree oil. On the contrary, oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skin-tolerated ingredients that is found in pet shampoos.Most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats, especially in the case of cats.Pet shampoos which include fragrances, deodorants or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation. Shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as hypoallergenic shampoos and are increasing in popularity.|$|E
40|$|Synopsis [...] ZINC PYRITHIONE, also kn,own as zinc pyridine- 2 -thiol-l-oxide, {{has been}} es-tablished as an {{effective}} <b>ANTISEBORRHEIC</b> AGENT. Because of its limited aqueous solubility it is currently being marketed as a suspension in hair-cleansing and hair-grooming preparations. A method has been developed in which clear, aqueous (as well as nonaqueous) products can be prepared. The method {{is based upon the}} COMPLEXATION of zinc pyrithione with certain ORGANIC AMINES. It appears that zinc pyrithione is highly soluble in many primary aliphatic amines. In other more complex amines, such as the poly-alkylenimines, a definite stable molecular complex is formed. The ability of such amines to complex and produce a soluble form of zinc pyrithione is discussed with respect to the physical and d•emical properties of the ensuing solutions. Based on these findings, CLEAR HAIR Pi•EPARATIONS containing zinc pyrithione can be prepared for use as antidandruff cleansers, rinses, grooming agents, and conditioners. Ex-amples are offered of product formulations having levels of zinc pyrithione ranging from 700 to 20, 000 ppm (2 %). Analytical data concerning complex formation as well as the complexes' toxicology are presented...|$|E
40|$|The Ylang Ylang (Cananga odorata) {{plant extract}} is highly popular among the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI) and is {{frequently}} used in local medicine. This {{can be attributed}} to its properties as an antiseptic, antidepressant, <b>antiseborrheic,</b> hypotensive, sedative, and nervine substance. It is also used in aromatherapy treatments, perfume, and cosmetic products all over the world. The key chemical constituents of the Ylang Ylang are linalool, germacrene, geranyl acetate, methyl benzoate, and p-cresyl methyl ether, which all contribute to its medicinal effects. With the presence of antibacterial properties, it may be used as an alternative to conventional medicine, but it has yet to be tested. The purpose of this research project is to determine whether the Yang Ylang plant extract does {{have an effect on the}} selected bacteria, Staphylococcus Aureus. We hypothesize that the extract will have an effect on the bacteria. In order to test our hypothesis, we will grow Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria in petri dishes. We will test different concentrations of the extract from steam distillation, upon bacterial strains to determine its efficacy, in comparison to a control group. Further research is necessary to discover the benefits of local medicine and suggest an alternative to regular antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Context: Acne vulgaris affects about 85 % of {{teenagers}} and {{may continue to}} adulthood. There are about two million visits to physicians per year for teenagers and the direct cost of acne treatment in the US exceeds $ 1 billion per year. Evidence Acquisition: A wide variety of treatment regimens exist for acne vulgaris including benzoil peroxide, retinoids, isotretinoids, keratolytic soaps, alpha hydroxy acids, azelaic acid, salicilic acid as well as hormonal, anti-androgen or <b>antiseborrheic</b> treatments. However, none of these methods is free of side effects and their exact role in therapy is not clear. In this paper apart from presenting the possible causes of acne vulgaris and its available drugs, recently published papers about medicinal plants used {{in the treatment of}} acne vulgaris were reviewed. Results: Consumption of alternative and complementary medicine, including medicinal plants, is increasing and is common amongst patients affected by acne and infectious skin diseases. Medicinal plants {{have a long history of}} use and have been shown to possess low side effects. These plants are a reliable source for preparation of new drugs. Conclusions: Many plants seem to have inhibitory effects on the growth of bacteria, fungi and viruses in vitro. However, there are a few clinical evidences about the effectiveness and safety of these plants in the treatment of acne and other skin infections...|$|E
