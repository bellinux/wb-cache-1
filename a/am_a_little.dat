500|$|Two friendships shaped Wollstonecraft's early life. The {{first was}} with Jane Arden in Beverley. The two {{frequently}} read books together and attended lectures presented by Arden's father, a self-styled philosopher and scientist. Wollstonecraft revelled {{in the intellectual}} atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly, sometimes {{to the point of}} being emotionally possessive. Wollstonecraft wrote to her: [...] "I have formed romantic notions of friendship... I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none." [...] In some of Wollstonecraft's letters to Arden, she reveals the volatile and depressive emotions that would haunt her throughout her life.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} year since 1927 that the main race was not covered in full {{on any of the}} BBC's {{national}} radio networks. [...] Its 4.15pm start coincided with the conclusion of the FA Cup semi-finals, and it had been decided that the rowing would be broadcast in full on the BBC World Service and BBC Radio Oxford only. [...] Commentator John Snagge who had described every race since 1931 was disappointed: [...] "I {{do not want to be}} unreasonable but I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> surprised that for an event like the Boat Race, with its tradition and history, the BBC cannot find 20 minutes on one of its four networks to carry it in full." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the Isis stories, [...] "Unacademic Exercise: A Nature Story", [...] {{describes}} {{the performance of}} a magical ceremony by which an undergraduate is transformed by his fellows into a werewolf. Waugh's interest in the occult is further demonstrated by his involvement, in the summer of 1924, in an amateur film entitled 666, in which he certainly appeared and which he may have written. He appears to have been in a state of some mental confusion or turmoil; the writer Simon Whitechapel cites a letter from Waugh to a friend, written at this time: [...] "I have been living very intensely the last three weeks. For the past fortnight I have been nearly insane. I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> saner now." [...] However, most scholars take this as a referring to Waugh's homosexuality rather than black magic.|$|E

50|$|When {{water in}} a {{circular}} bowl or cup is moving in circular motion the water displays vortex flow - the water {{at the center of}} the bowl or cup spins at relatively high speed, and the water at the perimeter spins more slowly. The water <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> deeper at the perimeter and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more shallow at the center, and the surface of the water is not flat but displays the characteristic depression toward the axis of the spinning fluid. At any elevation within the water the pressure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> greater near the perimeter of the bowl or cup where the water <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> deeper, than near the center. The water pressure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> greater where the water speed <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slower, and the pressure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less where the speed is faster, and this is consistent with Bernoulli's principle.|$|R

500|$|Soon {{after the}} book's publication, Potter's ageing Mrs. Tiggy began {{showing signs of}} failing health. She wrote a friend on February 1, 1906, [...] "I am sorry to say I am upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and {{has begun to be}} sick, and she is so thin. I am going to try some physic but I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> afraid that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is {{beginning}} to tell on her. It is a wonder she has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. I hope she will either get well or go quickly." [...] A few weeks later Potter chloroformed her beloved hedgehog and laid her to rest in the garden at the Potter family home at 2 Bolton Gardens, Kensington.|$|E
500|$|Allied {{casualties}} {{stood at}} about 36,000 {{out of an}} army of 89,000, which represented about 38% of their effective forces. The French lost around 9,000 out of an army of 66,000, or about 13% of their forces. The Allies also lost some 180 guns and about 50 standards. The great victory was met by sheer amazement and delirium in Paris, where just days earlier the nation had been teetering {{on the brink of}} financial collapse. Napoleon wrote to Josephine, [...] "I have beaten the Austro-Russian army commanded by the two emperors. I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> weary....I embrace you." [...] Tsar Alexander perhaps best summed up the harsh times for the Allies by stating, [...] "We are babies {{in the hands of a}} giant." [...] After hearing the news of Austerlitz, William Pitt referred to a map of Europe, [...] "Roll up that map; it will not be wanted these ten years." ...|$|E
500|$|Perry {{thought that}} it would be a great {{opportunity}} to showcase herself as an artist, as well as expressing the true meaning of her songs. She stated: [...] "I really wanted to do MTV Unplugged, obviously, because it has such a great history of showing off really who the person is... You get to hear the real story of the songs, which is important to me". The audience for the program was selected on a contest where fans over the age of 18 could send photos and explain why they were fans of Perry. The episode featuring Perry was recorded on July 22, 2009. For the recording, Perry was dressed in a pale pink chiffon evening gown, with flowers in her hair. She further said: [...] "Some people have an idea who I <b>am,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> piece of the cake, but I get to show off really more. I have a larger-than-life personality and my clothes reflect that. For MTV Unplugged, I wanted to be a mixture of Stevie Nicks and a fairy!".|$|E

[...] "His coat <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> duller olive-green and {{underneath}} he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit yellowish instead of being white. Of course he doesn't have red eyes, and he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> smaller than Redeye. The whole family looks pretty much alike anyway." ...|$|R

[...] And Mr. Wilder – and rightly so – looked at me and he said, [...] "Well, are you a mouse or an actress?" [...] And I said, [...] "Well, I hope I'm an actress." [...] He said, [...] "Then do the part". And I did and I'm very {{grateful}} to him.|$|E
2500|$|Roberts {{said in a}} 2007 interview: [...] "Right now I am {{focusing}} on movies. I am getting ready {{to start a new}} movie this summer so that is taking a lot of my time. I think when I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit older it is definitely something I'd like to pursue." [...] In another interview, she said: [...] "My musical career is indefinitely on hold. I don't like people who become like 'actor slash singer.' I think people should be one or the other because usually you're not going to be great at both. You're going to be better at one, so you might as well stick to the one you're good at. I'm going for acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 83rd minute, {{with the}} score at 1–1, referee Roberto Rosetti called a foul against Spain's Carles Puyol. France's Thierry Henry went down holding his face, {{although}} Puyol appeared {{to hit him}} in the chest. Patrick Vieira scored from the resulting free kick and France won the match 3–1. [...] "For me it wasn't a foul, if anything it was a foul by (Henry) because he came from behind and collided with me," [...] Puyol said, [...] "but referees can get things wrong." [...] Spain coach Luis Aragonés also called the foul [...] "non-existent". But Henry said, [...] "Puyol came up to me afterwards and apologised so how is that cheating?" [...] He also told reporters, [...] "Look at the replay, their left-back was going to take the ball and Puyol came across me and blocked me. If that's basketball that's a good block, but we're not playing basketball. In my head I'm not a guy who does go down or cheats." [...] Television announcer and former Netherlands international Ruud Gullit said of the play, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit disappointed. It shows that cheating works." ...|$|E
