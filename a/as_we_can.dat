25|$|If {{people ask}} {{in the name}} of {{religion}} we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham …etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; our duty is to make them as weak <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can.</b> Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can.</b> If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{apply the}} same process for {{determining}} if M prints 1 infinitely often. When we combine these processes, we can determine that M does, or does not, go on printing 1’s and 0’s ad infinitum. Thus we have a method for determining if M is circle-free. By Proof 1 this is impossible. So the first assertion that E exists, is wrong: E does not exist.|$|E
25|$|Not every {{conjecture}} ends {{up being}} proven true or false. The continuum hypothesis, which tries to ascertain the relative cardinality of certain infinite sets, was eventually shown to be undecidable (or independent) from the generally accepted set of axioms of set theory. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new axiom in a consistent manner (much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> take Euclid's parallel postulate as either true or false).|$|E

25|$|While {{up until}} the end of the Parthian period in the 3rd century CE, the idea of “Irān“ had an ethnic, linguistic, and {{religious}} value, it did not yet have a political import. The idea of an “Iranian“ empire or kingdom in a political sense is a purely Sasanian one. It was the result of a convergence of interests between the new dynasty and the Zoroastrian clergy, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> deduce from the available evidence. This convergence gave rise to the idea of an Ērān-šahr “Kingdom of the Iranians,” which was “ēr“ (Middle Persian equivalent of Old Persian “ariya“ and Avestan “airya“).|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of the Renormalization Group Theory of the instanton vacuum one can form a general flow diagram where the topological sectors are {{represented}} by attractive fixed points. When scaling the effective system to larger sizes, the system generally flows to a stable phase at one of these points and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> see in the flow diagram on the right, the longitudinal conductivity will vanish and the Hall conductivity takes on a quantized value. If we started with a Hall conductivity that is halfway between two attractive points, we would end up on the phase transition between topological sectors. As long as the symmetry isn't broken, the longitudinal conductivity doesn't vanish and is even able to increase when scaling to a larger system size. In the flow diagram, we see fixed points that are repulsive {{in the direction of the}} Hall current and attractive in the direction of the longitudinal current. It is most interesting to approach these fixed saddle points as close as possible and measure the (universal) behavior of the quantum Hall transitions.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

500|$|Aside from this, Adams {{generally}} stayed quiet.

[...] He did, however, privately attack the president over his Embargo Act, {{despite the fact}} that it was voted for by his son John Quincy, a U.S. senator. Another incident began in relation to Mercy Otis Warren in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had attacked Adams in a pamphlet for his [...] "partiality for monarchy" [...] and [...] "pride of talents and much ambition." [...] A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, the friendship healed.|$|E
500|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the {{methodology}} used by modern Egyptologists to translate ancient records is unreliable and unstable, and therefore produces flawed and nonsensical translations. Thus, the modern translations of the Joseph Smith Papyri as produced by Egyptologists {{are not to be}} trusted. This line of thinking was used by Nibley in his 1975 book, The Message of the Joseph Smith Papyri. He wrote: [...] "To the often asked question, 'Have the Joseph Smith Papyri been translated?' The answer is an emphatic no! What, then, is the foregoing? A mechanical transcription, no more [...] What we have is a transmission rather than a translation of the text [...] Though as correct and literal <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make it, the translation in the preceding chapter is not a translation. It is nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1921, strikes {{erupted in}} Petrograd when workers {{took to the}} streets {{demanding}} better food rations and more union autonomy. Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: [...] "To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal." [...] The unrest spread to the port town of Kronstadt, where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the Kronstadt rebellion, approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them.

500|$|Most of Gould's {{empirical}} research pertained to land snails.

In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity.

500|$|The {{conditions}} for the Americans constructing the siege works were difficult. The ground was swampy, and the trenches quickly became filled knee-deep in water.

Disease also worked to reduce the effectiveness of the Americans; by mid-October, more than 900 men had been sent back to Ticonderoga due to illness. In {{the early days of the}} siege, the fort's defenders took advantage of the land they had cleared around the fort to make life as difficult as possible for the besiegers erecting batteries. Major Preston wrote in his journal on September 23 that [...] "a deserter [...] the enemy are erecting their battery and we distress them as much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> with shells."
