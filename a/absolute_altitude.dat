40|$|Altitudinal {{patterns}} of plant species richness {{and the effects}} of area, the mid-domain effect, climatic variables, net primaryproductivity and latitude on observed richness patterns along the ridge of the Baekdudaegan Mountains, SouthKorea were studied. Data were collected from 1, 100 plots along a 200 to 1, 900 m altitudinal gradient on the ridge. Atotal of 802 plant species from 97 families and 342 genera were recorded. Common and rare species accounted for 91 %and 9 %, respectively, of the total plant species. The altitudinal {{patterns of}} species richness for total, common and rareplants showed distinctly hump-shaped patterns, although the <b>absolute</b> <b>altitudes</b> of the richness peaks varied somewhatamong plant groups. The mid-domain effect was the most powerful explanatory variable for total and common speciesrichness, whereas climatic variables were better predictors for rare plant richness. No effect of latitude on species richnesswas observed. Our study suggests that the mid-domain effect is a better predictor for wide-ranging species such ascommon species, whereas climatic variables are more important factors for range-restricted species such as rare species. The mechanisms underlying these richness patterns may reflect fundamental differences in the biology and ecology ofdifferent plant groups...|$|R

60|$|Early in {{the morning}} we passed the Nepean in a ferry-boat. The river, {{although}} at this spot both broad and deep, had a very small body of running water. Having crossed a low piece of land on the opposite side, we reached {{the slope of the}} Blue Mountains. The ascent is not steep, the road having been cut with much care {{on the side of a}} sandstone cliff. On the summit an almost level plain extends, which, rising imperceptibly to the westward, at last attains a height of more than 3000 feet. From so grand a title as Blue Mountains, and from their <b>absolute</b> <b>altitude,</b> I expected to have seen a bold chain of mountains crossing the country; but instead of this, a sloping plain presents merely an inconsiderable front to the low land near the coast. From this first slope the view of the extensive woodland to the east was striking, and the surrounding trees grew bold and lofty. But when once on the sandstone platform, the scenery becomes exceedingly monotonous; each side of the road is bordered by scrubby trees of the never-failing Eucalyptus family; and with the exception of two or three small inns, there are no houses or cultivated land; the road, moreover, is solitary; the most frequent object being a bullock-waggon, piled up with bales of wool.|$|E
6000|$|Arising {{early next}} morning, I was assured {{that it is}} {{necessary}} to cross the stream in order to reach the Cataracts. Tuckey did so, but further inquiry convinced me that it is a mistake to march along the northern bank. Of course, in skirting the southern side, we should not have approached so near the stream, where bluffs and débris rendered travelling hopeless. The amiable ichthyophagi agreed for two fathoms of fancy cloth to ferry us across the river, which is here half a mile broad. The six-knot current compels canoes to run up the left shore by means of its backwater, and, when crossing, to make allowance for the drift downwards. The aneroid now showed 860 feet of <b>absolute</b> <b>altitude,</b> and about sixty-five feet above the landing-place of Banza Nokki; the distance along the stream is fourteen miles, and thus the fall will be about five feet per mile below the Borongwa ya Vivi. We could see from a level the [...] "smaller rapids of Vivi" [...] bursting through their black gate with angry foam, flashing white from side to side. No canoe could shoot this [...] "Cachoeira," [...] but I do not think that a Nile Dahabiyah or a Brazilian Ajôjô would find great difficulty. Between us and the rapids, the concavity of the southern bank forms a bight or bay. The vortices, in which Tuckey's sloop was whirled round despite oars and sails, and in whose hollow the punt entirely disappeared, [...] "so that the depression must have been three or four feet deep," [...] were nowhere seen at this fuller season. The aspect of the surface is that of every large deep stream with broken bottom; the water boils up in ever widening domes, as though a system of fountains sprang from below. Each centre is apparently higher than its circle; it spreads as if a rock had been thrown into it, and the outer rim throws off little eddies and whirls no larger than a thimble. The mirrory surface of the lower river thus becomes mottled with light and shade, and the reflected image of the trough-cliff is broken into the most fantastic shapes.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} mean {{profiles}} of the multi [...] component pulsars PSRs B 1839 + 09, B 1916 + 14 and B 2111 + 46. We estimate the emission height of the core components, and hence find the <b>absolute</b> emission <b>altitudes</b> corresponding to the conal components. By fitting Gaussians to the emission components, we determine the phase location of the component peaks. Our findings indicate that the emission beams of these pulsars have the nested core [...] cone structures. Based on the phase location of the component peaks, we estimate the aberration [...] retardation (A/R) phase shifts in the profiles.

40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) with auto-pilot {{capabilities are}} often used for surveillance and patrol. Pilots set the flight points on a map in order to navigate to the imaging point where surveillance or patrolling is required. However, there is the limit denoting the information such as <b>absolute</b> <b>altitudes</b> and angles. Therefore, it is required to set the information accurately. This paper hereby proposes a method to construct environmental symmetric big data using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during flight by designating the imaging and non-imaging points for surveillance and patrols. The K-Means-based algorithm proposed in this paper is then employed to divide the imaging points, which is set by the pilot, into K clusters, and K imaging points are determined using these clusters. Flight data are then used to set the points to which the UAV will fly. In our experiment, flight records were gathered through an UAV in order to monitor a stadium and the imaging and non-imaging points were set using the proposed method and compared with the points determined by a traditional K-Means algorithm. Through the proposed method, the cluster centroids and cumulative distance of its members were reduced by 87. 57 % more than with the traditional K-Means algorithm. With the traditional K-Means algorithm, imaging points were not created in the five points desired by the pilot, and two incorrect points were obtained. However, with the proposed method, two incorrect imaging points were obtained. Due to these two incorrect imaging points, the two points desired by the pilot were not generated...|$|R

40|$|A {{purpose of}} {{research}} is to identify errors in interpretation of satellite images of forests based on image pixel classification by spectral brightness. The Landsat 5 satellite image was used (August, 2005). The results of interpretation were compared with data of forest estimation, i. e. descriptions of forest plots and maps of dominated species. The forest area made up 80. 8 thousand ha; quantity of plots was about 2700, including 573 sampling plots; specified number of clusters classification image – 10. As a result, there were intolerable errors in land categories, forest formations and dominated species {{on the level of}} forest plot generalization. Thus, interpretation of forest land images having applied a method of classification of spectral brightness pixels could be applied for small scale mapping only. It is supposed that inclusion of spatial analysis of relief digital simulation in the process of interpretation will improve a quality of performance. Stratums of locations were formalized by means of registration of <b>absolute</b> <b>altitudes,</b> slopes, and exposures. Spatial analysis was carried out on the base of Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission database. Errors of forest stand density, average ages and heights of trees exceed norms, which were specified for the least detailed third category of forest inventory. In such a case, there is not error reduction considering single stratums of locations. Categories of forest lands and variation of forest estimation indicates do not depend on a picture of satellite images. Therefore, achieving required accuracy of interpretation having applied methods of imagery classification and transformation, i. e. by use of the normalized vegetative index, does not seem possible. Consequently, applying the actual methods of satellite image classification in forest inventory cannot be recommended...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a robust {{altitude}} estimation technique for maneuvering targets in an MIMO radar environment. Specifically, {{we focus on}} the array apertures in the range direction that allow for spatial processing in the elevation dimension. The proposed technique is based on recent advances in non-stationary signal analyses for instantaneous multicomponent Doppler signature estimations. Because Doppler information alone does not provide sufficient information of the <b>absolute</b> target <b>altitude</b> as well as the elevation maneuvering direction (ascending or descending), the target positions are estimated using the extended Kalman filer that exploits different hypotheses of the initial conditions. We then utilize the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) criterion to estimate the initial target altitude and the maneuvering direction. Reliable target altitude estimation is enabled using the initial estimate and the knowledge guided by the time-varying Doppler signature of each individual multipath.|$|R
