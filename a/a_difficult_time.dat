5|$|Japan's small {{agricultural}} sector, however, is {{also highly}} subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America. There {{has been a}} growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> finding successors.|$|E
5|$|This {{coincided with}} the mid-1970s recession, <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> for {{independent}} schools but doubly so for the former direct grant schools, which had just lost 25–50% of their intake.|$|E
5|$|Unhalfbricking appeared, therefore, at <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> for the group, but was enthusiastically received. After {{a period}} of intense {{reflection}} about their future they decided to pursue the folk rock idea further and violinist Dave Swarbrick was invited to join full-time for the follow-up, Liege & Lief.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} {{civilian}} positions, such as positions in civil defence and in munitions factories, that were performed by refugees. This was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>times</b> for families that were separated {{due to the}} war and internment. In June 1941, the Association of Jewish Refugees was founded to provide such support.|$|R
50|$|Korean {{artists from}} the middle 1880s til 1945 had <b>a</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> when Korea was freed by the allies after the {{unconditional}} surrender of Japan.|$|R
50|$|Following the SNB's announcement, the Swiss {{stock market}} sharply declined; {{due to a}} {{stronger}} franc, Swiss companies would have had <b>a</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> selling goods and services to neighboring European citizens.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tries to film a {{commercial}} for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America but has <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> remembering his line resulting in production holding traffic up as the commercial shoot is blocking off a street. Jack comes upon the scene and realizes the problem. To speed things up, he gives Tracy jelly beans to eat and while he is chewing, Jack imitates Tracy's voice and says the line Tracy was scheduled to say.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Japan brought {{as many as}} 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to work as forced labor. About 5,000–8,000 Koreans {{were killed}} in Hiroshima and another 1,500–2,000 died in Nagasaki. For many years, Korean {{survivors}} had <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> fighting for the same recognition as Hibakusha as afforded to all Japanese survivors, a situation {{which resulted in the}} denial of the free health benefits to them. Most issues were eventually addressed in 2008 through lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{writes that}} Oprah Winfrey's {{promotion}} of Night came at <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> for {{the genre of}} memoir, after a previous book-club author, James Frey, {{was found to have}} fabricated parts of his autobiography, A Million Little Pieces (2003). She argues that Winfrey's choice of Night may have been intended to restore the book club's credibility. Night has a useful lesson to teach, Franklin writes, about the complexities of memoir and memory.|$|E
50|$|The early 20th {{century was}} <b>a</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> in France-Vatican {{relations}} because of tensions over church-state separation (laicité) and anticlericalism, which were condemned by Pius X, and {{which led to}} the freezing of relations.|$|R
5000|$|The Schoolcrafts sent Janee and John to a {{boarding}} school in Detroit for part of their education. Janee at 11 could handle the transition, but John at nine had <b>a</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> and missed his parents.|$|R
50|$|If we {{take just}} {{football}} {{as the basis}} of organized sports, its origins date back over seventy-two years. However, if we seek the origins of folk games based on active movement, we have <b>a</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> finding their first roots.|$|R
5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as a writer. He chose <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1933 Whale {{directed}} the romantic comedy By Candlelight which gained good reviews {{and was a}} modest box office hit. In 1934 he directed One More River, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Galsworthy. The film {{tells the story of a}} woman desperate to escape her abusive marriage to a member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale's films for which Production Code Administration approval was required and Universal had <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> securing that approval because of the elements of sexual sadism implicit in the husband's abusive behavior.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time.</b> Staff were leaving in droves, living {{conditions}} were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, the Missouri {{regional}} {{director for the}} Anti-Defamation League noted, [...] "For someone like Hedy, {{who came out of}} the Jewish community at <b>a</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>time,</b> to criticize Israel ... well, it's difficult. Some people perceive it as disloyal." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) [...] - [...] "We don't wish ill on {{any human}} being even though we had <b>a</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> with her as {{minister}} of health. We are sending our condolences to her family and children." ...|$|R
50|$|Record {{was founded}} by Manuel Dias. Dias was a {{newspaper}} vendor as well an athlete. Dias participated the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. In 1949, Dias would enter the national lottery in Portugal and would win 40 contos. Dias would use these funds to establish the Record newspaper. The first edition of the newspaper was published on 26 of November 1949 and was sold on a weekly basis. Over the 63 years, Record have had <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>times</b> and gone through becoming a privatizied company to a publicly traded one.|$|R
5|$|Coffin {{moved to}} the Cincinnati area in 1847, where {{he took over the}} {{management}} of a wholesale warehouse of free-labor goods. With the intention of returning to Newport, Indiana, after fulfilling his obligation in Cincinnati, Coffin rented out his Newport business and made arrangements for his Indiana home to continue serving as an Underground Railroad stop. At Cincinnati his first task was working with the eastern organizations to set up a steady supply of free-labor goods for the business. The enterprise's ongoing problem was the poor quality of its goods. Coffin had difficulty procuring free goods, such as cotton, sugar, and spices, whose quality was competitive with the goods produced by slave labor. With inferior quality goods to sell, he had <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> finding purchasers for the goods. The problem plagued the business for years, causing the enterprise constant financial struggles.|$|E
5|$|Douglas-Home {{accepted}} the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many expected {{this to be}} a short-lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> in British foreign relations: events in the self-governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on {{the right wing of the}} Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s were <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> financially, {{with less}} foreign work coming through; though they headed the {{consortium}} that built the Mosul Dam in Iraq from 1981-84. There was domestic growth, {{highlighted by the}} architecturally radical Messe Torhaus in Frankfurt, completed in 1984. It was later involved {{in the construction of}} the Messeturm in the same city; once completed in 1991 it was Europe's tallest building. In the mid-1990s, Hochtief was involved in yet another major skyscraper development in Frankfurt, the Commerzbank Tower, which overtook the Messeturm to become Europe's tallest building, losing the record to Triumph-Palace in Moscow in 2003.|$|E
50|$|The {{last two}} {{decades of the twentieth}} century were <b>a</b> {{relatively}} <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> for science fiction in Italy, regardless of medium. Thus DeepCon was conceived to promote its visibility and viability as a genre, as well as a general SF fan convention.|$|R
5000|$|Nicole Sullivan as Shego, Drakken's sassy and sarcastic sidekick. Like Kim, she has <b>an</b> {{extremely}} <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> comprehending {{any part}} of how Drakken's master plan works in the film. She nevertheless engages in combat with Kim as usual but ultimately gets defeated.|$|R
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} Battle of San Juan de Ulúa, the Spanish {{destroyed}} {{all but two}} of the English ships. Hawkins' voyage home was a miserable one. Hawkins' gunner, Job Hartop, had <b>an</b> equally <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> returning to England and did not succeed for many years.|$|R
5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor named Fox Censor (pictured on the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and had <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> getting through the real-life censors. They had issues {{with the size of}} the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with a dagger, but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did {{not sit well with}} Daltrey, and a recording session of R covers went unreleased. The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the West End of London. The group experienced <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's amphetamines down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked, but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted Richard Cole as a roadie.|$|E
2500|$|That evening, Mitchell had {{a further}} encounter, which {{unfolded}} {{in the same}} way, though on this occasion the U-boat was more wary, and Mitchell's crew had <b>a</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> before scoring hits on their assailant. [...] This U-boat, UC-17, was also not damaged.|$|R
50|$|In {{the ensuing}} Battle of San Juan de Ulúa, the Spanish {{destroyed}} {{all but two}} of the English ships. Hawkins' voyage home was a miserable one. Hawkins' gunner, Job Hartop, had <b>an</b> equally <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> returning to England and did not succeed for many years.|$|R
50|$|Non-human {{examples}} are prevalent. For example, the Golden Shiner is a fish that prefers shady areas. The single Shiner has <b>a</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> finding shady regions {{in a body}} of water whereas a large group is much more efficient at finding the shade.|$|R
5|$|Their father, Richard, {{often took}} Mary and Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions {{to make more}} money for the family. They offered their discoveries for sale to {{tourists}} on a table outside their home. This was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> for England's poor; the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars that followed, caused food shortages. The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.|$|E
5|$|When Marseille {{was still}} a young child his parents {{divorced}} and his mother subsequently married a police official named Reuter. Marseille initially assumed {{the name of his}} stepfather at school (a matter he had <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> accepting) but he reverted to his father's name of Marseille in adulthood. He acquired the reputation of being a rebel from a lack of discipline, a characteristic that plagued him early on in his Luftwaffe career. Marseille also had a difficult relationship with his natural father whom he refused to visit in Hamburg for some time after the divorce. Eventually he attempted a reconciliation with his father, who subsequently introduced him to the nightlife that was to initially hamper his military career during his early years in the Luftwaffe. However, the rapproachment with his father did not last and he did not see him again thereafter.|$|E
5|$|After the Crimson Tide defense {{forced a}} State punt {{to open the}} third quarter, Kendrick Market forced a T. J. Yeldon fumble that was {{recovered}} by Beniquez Brown at the State 49-yard line. The Bulldogs scored on their drive that ensued after Charles Siddoway recovered a Tyler Russell fumble in the endzone that made the score 10–7. Alabama responded on their next possession with an 11-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Kevin Norwood that extended their lead to 17–7. After the State possession that followed, HaHa Clinton-Dix intercepted a Tyler Russell pass. Foster then made the score 20–7 with his 35-yard field goal {{early in the fourth}} quarter. The Crimson Tide then had <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> closing the game as turnovers on consecutive possessions on a McCarron interception and a Kenyan Drake fumble. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 76–18–3 (78–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{question}} of whether nursing home market characteristics affect the ability of hospitals to discharge patients to nursing homes is examined. Also examined is {{the question of}} whether joint Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries have <b>a</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> being placed than do other patients. The principal conclusions are first, that the nursing home bed supply and the type of Medicaid payment system affect the ability of hospitals to discharge patients to nursing homes. Joint Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries have <b>a</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> being placed in nursing homes in States with fewer beds and more restrictive Medicaid payment policies, and joint beneficiaries do not appear to have longer stays in hospitals. Rather, they have a greater likelihood of being discharged to home...|$|R

As governor, he oversaw the re-constitution of provisional assembly, stabilising the law and order situation in tribal belt, and overseeing the success of covert operations in Afghanistan in 1975. His governorship and Sherpao himself tackled and faced intense communist opposition led by Asfandyiar Vali, and was assassinated in a targeted bomb explosion on the campus of Peshawar University in 1975.|$|R
