5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, {{and have no}} refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.|$|E
5|$|Although phumdi {{vegetation}} {{has existed}} for centuries, {{it was not until}} 1886 that the Manipur Gazetteer recorded that wetlands with floating islands were used by inhabitants for fishing. Before the Itahi barrage was constructed in 1986, 207 khangpoks (huts or sheds) were reported on the phumdis, but after the dam was completed in 1999, the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) reported 800 such structures. Many of the huts are reported to have been converted into permanent dwellings and about 4,000 people live in these floating huts, earning their living as fishermen. The huts <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> plastic ropes, heavy rocks, wood, bamboo, zinc plates and iron rods. Athapums, artificial circular phumdis, which were built by the villagers as enclosures for fish farming, are present on the lake, and this aquaculture has caused further proliferation of the phumdis. A tourist lodge has been built on one of the phumdis in Sandra Island.|$|E

25|$|Phylogenetic trees {{composed}} with a nontrivial number of input sequences <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> computational phylogenetics methods. Distance-matrix {{methods such as}} neighbor-joining or UPGMA, which calculate genetic distance from multiple sequence alignments, are simplest to implement, but do not invoke an evolutionary model. Many sequence alignment methods such as ClustalW also create trees by using the simpler algorithms (i.e. those based on distance) of tree construction. Maximum parsimony is another simple method of estimating phylogenetic trees, but implies an implicit model of evolution (i.e. parsimony). More advanced methods use the optimality criterion of maximum likelihood, often within a Bayesian Framework, and apply an explicit model of evolution to phylogenetic tree estimation. Identifying the optimal tree using many of these techniques is NP-hard, so heuristic search and optimization methods are used in combination with tree-scoring functions to identify a reasonably good tree that fits the data.|$|E
25|$|A {{microbial}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC) is a device that converts chemical energy to electrical energy {{by the action of}} microorganisms. These electrochemical cells <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> either a bioanode and/or a biocathode. Most MFCs contain a membrane to separate the compartments of the anode (where oxidation takes place) and the cathode (where reduction takes place). The electrons produced during oxidation are transferred directly to an electrode or, to a redox mediator species. The electron flux is moved to the cathode. The charge balance of the system is compensated by ionic movement inside the cell, usually across an ionic membrane. Most MFCs use an organic electron donor that is oxidised to produce CO2, protons and electrons. Other electron donors have been reported, such as sulphur compounds or hydrogen. The cathode reaction uses a variety of electron acceptors that includes the reduction of oxygen as the most studied process. However, other electron acceptors have been studied, including metal recovery by reduction, water to hydrogen, nitrate reduction and sulfate reduction.|$|E

25|$|In December, 2012, William Cheswick {{wrote an}} article {{published}} in ACM magazine that included the mathematical possibilities of how easy or difficult it would be to break passwords that <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> the commonly recommended, and sometimes followed, standards of today. In his article, William showed that a standard eight character alpha-numeric password could withstand a brute force attack of ten million attempts per second, and remain unbroken for 252 days. Ten million attempts each second is the acceptable rate of attempts using a multi-core system that most users would have access to. A much greater degree of attempts, at the rate of 7 billion per second, could also be achieved when using modern GPUs. At this rate, the same 8 character alpha-numeric password could be broken in approximately 30 seconds. Increasing the password complexity to a 13 character alpha-numeric password increases the time needed to crack it to more than 900,000 years at 7 billion attempts per second. This is, of course, assuming the password does not use a common word that a dictionary attack could break much sooner. Using a password of this strength reduces the obligation to change it as often as many organizations require, including the U.S. Government, as it could not be reasonably broken in such a short period of time.|$|E

500|$|Reproduction in {{the species}} {{has not been}} well studied. In the {{northeast}} of India, the breeding season is from April to May. The nest is placed off the ground, between two and eight meters high, and is often built in a hole of a (living or dead) oak or rhododendron tree, or sometimes in other large trees. Nests <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> leaves and bark, held together with hair, often that of bamboo rats.

40|$|Quantum {{cryptography}} is {{one example}} of applying a deep understanding of quantum physics to create a novel technology of potentially enormous significance. Oblivious Transfer (OT) is used as a key component in many applications of cryptography. Crépeau showed the first quantum 1 -out-of- 2 oblivious transfer in 1994 based on the transmission of polarized light and the exist of secure quantum bit commitment protocol. The protocol he constructed satisfy both the correctness and the privacy for Alice with probability 1 − εn, the privacy for Bob with probability 1 2. In this paper, we show that quantum can <b>be</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> only the Bell states, and the scheme satisfies the correctness and the privacy for Alice with probability 1, the privacy for Bob with probability 1 2. Furthermore, we show the relations between the OTs, i. e. Bit-QOT 1 2 can <b>be</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> String-QOT 1 2, String-QOT 1 n can <b>be</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> String-QOT 12, String-QOTmn can <b>be</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> can <b>be</b> <b>constructed</b> String-QOT 1 n, and vice versa. We get the conclusion that String-QOT 1 n using Bit-QOT 1 2 and vice versa. So, String-QOTm n and Bit-QOTm n can <b>be</b> <b>constructed</b> by the Bit-QOT 1 2. Finally, We show that quantum bit commitment and quantum coin flipping can <b>be</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> QOT...|$|R

2500|$|Recently, {{polyelectrolytes}} {{have been}} utilized {{in the formation}} of new types of materials known as polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs). These thin films <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition technique. During LbL deposition, a suitable growth substrate (usually charged) is dipped back and forth between dilute baths of positively and negatively charged polyelectrolyte solutions. During each dip a small amount of polyelectrolyte is adsorbed and the surface charge is reversed, allowing the gradual and controlled build-up of electrostatically cross-linked films of polycation-polyanion layers. Scientists have demonstrated thickness control of such films down to the single-nanometer scale. LbL films can also be constructed by substituting charged species such as nanoparticles or clay platelets in place of or in addition to one of the polyelectrolytes. LbL deposition has also been accomplished using hydrogen bonding instead of electrostatics. For more information on multilayer creation please see polyelectrolyte adsorption.|$|E
2500|$|The proof for {{arbitrary}} extensions uses a homomorphism {{from the}} group G onto the profinite completion of the integers with kernel G∞, or in other words a compatible sequence of homomorphisms of G onto the cyclic groups of order n for all n, with kernels G'n. These homomorphisms <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> cyclic cyclotomic extensions of fields; for finite fields they are given by the algebraic closure, for non-archimedean local fields they are given by the maximal unramified extensions, and for global fields they are slightly more complicated. As these extensions are given explicitly one can check that they [...] have the property that H2(G/G'n) is cyclic of order n, with a canonical generator. It follows from this that for any layer E, the group H2(E/E∩G∞) is canonically isomorphic to Q/Z. This idea of using roots of unity was introduced by Chebotarev in his proof of Chebotarev's density theorem, and used shortly afterwards by Artin to prove his reciprocity theorem.|$|E
2500|$|Many of today's baitcasting reels <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> aluminum, {{stainless}} steel, and/or synthetic composite materials. [...] They typically {{include a}} level-wind mechanism {{to prevent the}} line from being trapped under itself on the spool during rewind and interfering with subsequent casts. [...] Many are also fitted with anti-reverse handles and drags designed to slow runs by large and powerful game fish. [...] Because the baitcasting reel uses the weight and momentum of the lure to pull the line from the rotating spool, it normally requires lures weighing 1/4 oz. or more in order to cast a significant distance. [...] Recent developments have seen bait casting reels with gear ratios as high as 7.1/1. [...] Higher gear ratios allow much faster retrieval of line, but sacrifice some amount of strength in exchange, since the additional gear teeth required reduces torque {{as well as the}} strength of the gear train. [...] This could be a factor when fighting a large and powerful fish.|$|E
