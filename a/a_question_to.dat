Abstinence-only advocates claimed that the study was flawed because it was too narrow and began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and that other studies have demonstrated positive effects.|$|E

25|$|To {{address the}} {{question}} whether the initiative proponents had particularized standing (that is, standing either via personal interest, or standing to represent the State's interest), the Ninth Circuit certified <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the California Supreme Court on January 4, 2011, asking that court to rule whether, under the California Constitution or otherwise under California law, non-governmental proponents of an initiative have standing to appeal when the State is no longer willing to defend it. On February 16, 2011, the California Supreme Court unanimously agreed to address the Ninth Circuit's request. The court set an expedited schedule for the hearing and heard oral arguments on September 6, 2011. On November 17, 2011, the California Supreme Court issued an advisory opinion that the proponents of Proposition 8 did have standing, and could defend it.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} members of each family {{appeared}} at the face-off podium and were asked <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> which only the number-one answer was available. Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the family's bank. The process then repeated with the four remaining members from each family. On {{the first half of}} the daytime version, families were staked with $2,500. The first question was worth $500, with each succeeding question worth $500 more than the previous, with the final question worth $2,500. This allowed for a potential maximum bank of $10,000. For the second half of the daytime version, and also on the syndicated version, all values were doubled, making the maximum potential bank $20,000. The team that eventually won the game played for their bank in Fast Money.|$|E

The most common means of consulting an oracle was to pose <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the divine image while it was being carried in a festival procession, and interpret an answer from the barque's movements. Other methods included interpreting the behavior of cult animals, drawing lots, or consulting statues through which a priest apparently spoke.

500|$|Discworld is a third-person point-and-click graphic {{adventure}} game. An overhead map appears when {{leaving a}} location {{that allows the}} player {{to go straight to}} another.

Locations outside Ankh-Morpork include the Dark Wood (where Nanny Ogg resides), the Mines (where dwarves tune swords), and the Edge of the World (where [...] "the world ends and space begins"). Items can be examined or used, and can either be stored in Rincewind's pockets or in the Luggage. To progress in the game, Rincewind must collect items, talk to people and solve puzzles. Rincewind may also acquire special skills needed to perform certain tasks. Characters featured include an Archchancellor, the Dibbler, the Librarian, and Death. During a conversation, the player may choose to have Rincewind greet, joke with, vent anger towards, or pose <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the character.|$|E

Instead {{of the episode}} also featuring Donna in a reduced role, [...] "Turn Left" [...] was written to complement [...] "Midnight": [...] "Midnight" [...] featured the Doctor in the central role and [...] "Turn Left" [...] focused on Donna and Rose. The episode was written by the show's head writer and executive producer, Russell T Davies. He compared the main concept of the episode—life without the Doctor—to the 1998 film Sliding Doors. Davies hoped to pose <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the viewer: [...] "does the Doctor cause or prevent death?". The episode focuses {{on the scale of}} deaths without the Doctor; the implicit death toll surprised Davies when he wrote the script. Lead actor David Tennant cited the deaths that surrounded his character as {{a major part of the}} Doctor's guilt.

500|$|McKellen has {{appeared}} in limited release films, such as Emile (which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot), Neverwas and Asylum. He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code. During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer {{that it is a}} work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted. McKellen responded, [...] "I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie– not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story." [...] He continued, [...] "And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it". McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais' comedy series Extras, where he played himself directing Gervais' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor - Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in The Prisoner, a remake of the 1967 cult series The Prisoner. In 2013, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom Vicious as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years. On 23 August 2013 the show was renewed for a six-episode second series which began airing in June 2015.|$|E
