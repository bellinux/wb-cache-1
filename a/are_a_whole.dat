25|$|Absolute {{pitch is}} the ability to {{perceive}} pitch class and to mentally categorize sounds according to perceived pitch class. A pitch class is a set of all pitches that <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> number of octaves apart. While the boundaries of musical pitch categories vary among human cultures, the recognition of octave relationships is a natural characteristic of the mammalian auditory system. Accordingly, absolute pitch is not the ability to estimate a pitch value from the dimension of pitch evoking frequency (30–5000Hz), but to identify a pitch class category within the dimension of pitch class (e.g., C-C-D... B-C).|$|E

[...] Obama had addressed similar themes in a 2004 interview with Charlie Rose, and his strategists countered that Bill Clinton had made similar comments in 1991.|$|E

2500|$|Andreas Hackel, art {{director}} at Candygun Games described {{the inspiration for}} the game's visuals. [...] "I was inspired by games like Team Fortress 2 and classic B-movies of the 1950's", stated Hackel. When asked about the reason for choosing to set it in the 1950s, Hackel replied, [...] "not many games are set in this period and there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> slew of very typical and interesting design elements from this time period. Elements like the cars, milk bars, chrome, juke boxes, fashion and hairstyles are all instantly recognisable as coming from the 50's." [...] Hackel commented that Candygun wanted the characters to be [...] "people from the street", and not superheroes. Roger Joswig explained their choice of using Unreal Engine 3 instead of a proprietary technology. [...] "If you're looking to release your game on , Xbox 360 and PC as we were, developing your own engine is a lot more expensive, takes a long time if you start from scratch and needs a lot of QA support – so it wasn't really a feasible option for us as a small, start-up developer". He also noted that the engine is built to run on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows natively and that the team was familiar with the Unreal Engine tools. The in-game music was provided by the band Vampire State Building. The narrator's voice and in-game sound effects were outsourced to Periscope Studios.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{released}} {{a couple of}} early singles, Scritti Politti began planning their debut album in 1979, but the recording had to be delayed when Gartside collapsed after a gig supporting Gang of Four in Brighton in early 1980. Originally {{believed to be a}} heart attack, the cause of his collapse was eventually diagnosed as a panic attack, brought on by his chronic stage fright and his unhealthy lifestyle. Returning home to south Wales at his parents' insistence for a nine-month convalescence period, Gartside {{had plenty of time to}} think about the direction the band and their music were going in. During 1979 he had already become less interested in the independent music and punk scene and had started listening to and buying American funk and disco like Chic and the Jacksons, Stax soul like Aretha Franklin, and 1960s British beat music such as the Beatles' early records. Gartside came to the conclusion that [...] "you don't have to be lobotomised in order to make pop music. It's a real passion to make it" [...] and that making pop music didn't mean selling out punk's principles or dumbing down: [...] "I think the politics of punk does survive. There <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot [...] people who aren't happy to make pap but want to make pop. They understand that what sells means something. It finds a way into people's hearts in a way that independent music never did." [...] He explained his reasons for abandoning the band's original [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] philosophy to Smash Hits in November 1981: ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper was {{extremely}} impressed, scoring the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 8.7 out of 10, {{and giving the}} game an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] award. The Xbox version was also awarded the October [...] "Xbox Game of the Month" [...] award. Roper dismissed notions that the game was simply a Grand Theft Auto clone, arguing instead that it advanced the genre; [...] "much of Scarface is based on what we've seen in Grand Theft Auto. In fact, it's fairly obvious that Radical used said series as the blueprint {{and then went back}} and re-evaluated its shortcomings. The result {{is that we have a}} game that fixes many of GTAs problematic elements." [...] He praised the basic gameplay, the storyline, the balls meter, rage mode, and the aiming system. Although he was somewhat critical of the map, arguing too many areas in the game are accessible via only one road, he concluded [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot of little things about Scarface that make it fun, but it's the sum of its parts that make it the overall great game that it is. It does a whole lot to fix many of the problems with other games in the genre, and it does an absolutely fantastic job of bringing the world of Scarface to gamers." [...] Mark Bozon and Chris Roper scored the Wii version 8.5 out of 10, also giving it an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] award, and writing [...] "Scarface is a very impressive game, and while there isn't a ton of Wii-specific additions to the package, everything that was added makes a big difference." [...] Praising the controls, they wrote [...] "it's amazingly easy to target enemies and blow off specific body parts in the process." [...] They called it [...] "an intelligent, high-budget, astonishingly impressive game," [...] arguing [...] "Wii owners that fit in the hardcore crowd will absolutely eat this one up, as it's currently one of the deepest and most entertaining experiences on the system." ...|$|E
