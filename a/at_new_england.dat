5|$|Busoni's first son, Benvenuto (known as Benni), {{was born}} in Boston in 1892, but Busoni's {{experience}} <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Conservatory proved unsatisfactory.

5|$|After {{coming off}} the bench to record 101 rushing yards in his initial NFL action <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> he ran for 106 yards and {{registered}} 104 receiving yards in his first professional start against Oakland. In the Chiefs' October 18, 1981 game against the Denver Broncos, Delaney broke loose for a 75-yard touchdown run, but an offside penalty caused the play to be restarted from five yards back. On the second play after the penalty, Delaney scored an 82-yard touchdown, the longest rushing play from scrimmage in the 1981 NFL season.|$|E

5|$|Between 1954 and 1960, {{the student}} body <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> more than doubled to over 500 {{students}} with a corresponding increase in staff and faculty, forcing the school to erect temporary, weatherboard huts to accommodate its expanded facilities and classrooms. In 1958, the university received £900,000 in government grants for facilities improvements and Madgwick presided over the planning and construction of over ten permanent buildings on the main campus, {{some of which were}} completed after Madgwick retired in 1966.|$|E
5|$|At Denver, Manning again led three scoring {{drives in}} the fourth quarter in a 34–31 shootout win. He {{completed}} 32-of-39 passes for 345 yards and three touchdowns. Following a second straight season with a win <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> then a home win against Buffalo, the Colts were the NFL's last unbeaten team at 9–0. Their first loss would come in Dallas. Plagued by a run defense that would allow over 100 yards in every game, the Colts were 11–4 heading into their final game. Against Miami, Manning threw for 282 yards, two touchdowns and rushed for another touchdown. The Colts won 27–22, were AFC South division champions, and clinched the third seed in the AFC playoffs. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week. He ended the regular season with 4,397 passing yards and a league-leading 31 touchdown passes. His passer rating (101.0) was the highest in the league for the third year in a row. Manning helped the offense set an NFL record for third down conversion rate in a season (56.1%).|$|E
5|$|In 1890 Busoni {{published}} his {{first edition of}} works of J.S. Bach (the two- and three-part Inventions). In the same year he won the prize for composition, with his Konzertstück ("Concert Piece") for piano and orchestra Op.31a (BV 236), at the first Anton Rubinstein Competition, initiated by Anton Rubinstein himself at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. As a consequence {{he was invited to}} visit and teach at the Moscow Conservatoire. Gerda joined him in Moscow where they promptly married. His first concert in Moscow, when he performed Beethoven's Emperor Concerto, was warmly received. But living in Moscow did not suit the Busonis for both financial and professional reasons; he felt excluded by his nationalistically-inclined Russian colleagues. So when he received an approach from William Steinway to teach <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Conservatory of Music in Boston, he was happy to take the opportunity, particularly as the conductor at that time of the Boston Symphony Orchestra was Arthur Nikisch, whom he had known since 1876, when they performed together at a concert in Vienna.|$|E

25|$|Following {{their victory}} <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> United were in prime {{position}} to win consecutive league matches {{for the first}} time since June 2009. United, hot off a 2–1 victory <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> hosted struggling conference opponents, Montreal Impact, who were making their debutant season in MLS. In the April 18 affair, the Impact took the lead in the 68th minute off a strike from Bernardo Corradi. Montreal's lead quickly vanished as United's Santos restored parity in the 72nd minute. Santos would subsequently score, but the goal would be called back, giving United a 1–1 draw verse Montreal.|$|E

25|$|During {{the month}} of April, D.C. United went undefeated in their five league matches, winning thrice and drawing twice. The month opened with a regular season match at home to the Seattle Sounders FC. The fixture against Seattle ended in a {{scoreless}} draw, the club's second of the season, with United's Maicon Santos and Dejan Jakovic picking up yellow cards during the match. On April 14, United traveled northbound to take on Eastern Conference rivals, the New England Revolution at Gillette Stadium. After New England's José Moreno Mora opened up the scoresheet in the sixth minute, United equalized from a goal from Santos in the 19th minute. With nine minutes remaining, United's Chris Pontius received a pass from Emiliano Dudar and curled a shot around New England's Matt Reis, giving United a 2–1 lead and subsequent victory. The win marked the club's first victory <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> since August 5, 2007; when United earned a 3–0 victory <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ching {{left the}} August 16, 2003 game <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Revolution with a {{ruptured}} right Achilles tendon. He underwent surgery on August 19 {{and missed the}} rest of the 2003 season as the San Jose Earthquakes {{went on to win the}} 2003 MLS Cup. Ching scored a career-high six goals and two assists during 2003. He was named to the MLS Team of the Week for April 12 and May 3, 2003.|$|E
25|$|Judith Wright {{was born}} in Armidale, New South Wales. The eldest child of Phillip Wright and his first wife, Ethel, she {{spent most of her}} {{formative}} years in Brisbane and Sydney. Wright was of Cornish ancestry. After the early death of her mother, she lived with her aunt and then boarded <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Girls' School after her father's remarriage in 1929. After graduating, Wright studied Philosophy, English, Psychology and History at the University of Sydney. At the beginning of World War II, she returned to her father's station to help during the shortage of labour caused by the war.|$|E
25|$|D.C. {{closed out}} {{the regular season}} in Orlando knowing {{that they would be}} hosting the play-in round match four days later so long as the Montreal Impact did not win <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> so it {{probably}} should not have surprised anyone that Coach Olsen started a line-up made of entirely of reserves and a few players returning from lengthy injury spells. Not surprisingly, Orlando City dominated the match, winning 4-2, despite United goals by Saborio and Igboananike, who notched his first goal for United, with Büscher assisting on both goals. Montreal fell to defeat to the Revolution, however, so D.C. would host the Impact in the mid-week play-in match.|$|E

25|$|During the 2008 season, Ching {{established}} {{team and}} personal records with 13 {{goals in the}} regular season and five assists in 25 games. Ching ranked fifth in the league in goals. In the team's second visit to San Jose since relocating to Houston, Ching scored a game-tying goal in second half and celebrated by pointing to the Dynamo crest in front of San Jose fans. In the final CONCACAF Champions' Cup he set up two of Houston's three goals in the quarterfinal second leg vs. CSD Municipal. In the 2008 Superliga he appeared in three games, starting the semifinal vs. Pachuca and the championship game <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Revolution. In the inaugural CONCACAF Champions League, Ching appeared as a substitute at San Francisco F.C. and started vs. C.D. Luis Ángel Firpo, scoring the game's only goal to help Dynamo reach the quarterfinals.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks after}} his 12-minute {{appearance}} against Chelsea, Beckham finally made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus D.C. United {{in front of the}} sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the RFK Stadium, coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute. Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pavón failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Landon Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment – the Galaxy lost 1–0. The next match on the road trip was <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Revolution and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium's artificial surface.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their loss <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> the Broncos {{traveled}} to Qualcomm Stadium for an AFC West duel with the San Diego Chargers on Monday Night Football. The Chargers jumped {{out to a}} 10–0 lead in the first quarter, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Novak, followed by a 15-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Philip Rivers to tight end Antonio Gates. Both scores came off Broncos' miscues on special teams—the former occurred after Trindon Holliday muffed a punt return, while the latter occurred after Omar Bolden coughed up the football on a kickoff return. The Broncos were attempting to narrow the Chargers' lead midway through the second quarter, but wide receiver Eric Decker stumbled near the Chargers' 30-yard line when it appeared that he was headed to the end zone for an easy touchdown, after receiving a 55-yard pass from quarterback Peyton Manning. Three plays later, Manning threw an interception that was returned by Chargers' cornerback Quentin Jammer 80 yards for a touchdown. The Chargers increased their lead to 24–0 just before halftime, with Rivers connecting on an 11-yard touchdown pass to Gates.|$|E

500|$|While at the college, Gilbert pursued {{post-graduate}} studies <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> {{and received a}} Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) in Botanical History in 1972, with his thesis titled Botanical investigation of New South Wales, 1811-1880. [...] Also in 1972, he was awarded a Churchill Fellowship to the U.K. for four weeks to study how museums in the U.K. contributed to general education.|$|E
500|$|As an emeritus professor, McClymont {{observed}} and commented on {{issues with the}} rural science curriculum <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England.</b> [...] An external review, began in 1979 by the university with help from an independent committee of agricultural specialists from the Australian Academy of Science, recommended curriculum changes, which were implemented in 1982. [...] The most significant change was increased freedom given to students to choose electives in the fourth year of study, allowing limited specialization in certain subject areas. [...] McClymont lamented the changes, feeling that they damaged the quality and standing of the rural science degree program.|$|E
500|$|While <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> Madgwick {{continued}} his {{strong support for}} adult education (AE). The main differences between AE and external studies were that AE focused on classroom courses and the classes were not usually part of a degree program. In 1948, Madgwick secured a government grant to expand the school's adult education program. In June of that year, Arnold Walter Eberle was appointed adult education officer for the college, a position he held {{until his death in}} 1954. Eberle, with Madgwick's support, selected courses based on feedback from the local populace as to what they wanted to study, rather than adhering to the University of Sydney's established curriculum. The program, the first adult program based outside of Australia's capital cities, focused on functional, practical courses rather than formal, abstract, and theoretical instruction. As a result, [...] "effective" [...] enrolments (students who completed the class) in 1948 for New England adult courses were 88.8% compared with 66% for metropolitan Sydney adult classes. By 1949, 4% {{of the population of the}} New England area had attended one of the college's classes.|$|E
