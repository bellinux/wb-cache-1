5|$|Big Bang lattice model, {{states that}} the {{universe}} {{at the moment of}} the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of fermions, which is smeared over the fundamental domain so it has rotational, translational and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> lowest entropy of any state.|$|E
5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are {{convenient for}} specifying positions of Solar System objects, {{as most of}} the planets' orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky. Because Earth's orbit, <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> ecliptic, moves very little, it is a relatively fixed reference with respect to the stars.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{given that}} the way {{airborne}} ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will occur, {{as a function of}} distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> ash properties have large variations.|$|E

5|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen, <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> precautions {{associated with}} gaseous nitrogen {{also apply to}} liquid nitrogen. For example, oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space.|$|E
5|$|Once again, {{this is a}} simplification. Periodic {{motions of}} the Moon and {{apparent}} periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth's axis, <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> celestial equator, known as nutation.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, it was {{possible}} to increase the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E
50|$|The name Bhao {{is said to}} mean {{those who}} inspire fear in the local Dogri language, which is spoken in Jammu. According to tribal legends, when the tribe settled in Jammu, it {{inspired}} fear among its enemies, <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> got <b>the</b> name but others say the Bhao were free booters or looters <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> earned <b>the</b> title.|$|R

5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{the circular}} path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system. The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's orbit around the Sun (<b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).|$|E
5|$|The inaugural H–O–R–S–E Competition was {{sponsored}} by American auto insurance company GEICO <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> word G–E–I–C–O was used in replacement of H–O–R–S–E.

5|$|The {{supernova}} classification type {{is closely}} tied to the type of star {{at the time of the}} collapse. The occurrence of each type of supernova depends dramatically on the metallicity, <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> age of the host galaxy.|$|E

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the orbit (<b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
5|$|Adam Henry Carter is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC espionage television series Spooks, which follows {{the exploits of}} Section D, a counter-terrorism division of MI5. He is portrayed by British actor Rupert Penry-Jones.

5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E

5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted {{in the air to}} oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E
5|$|Fermium is a {{synthetic}} element with symbol Fm and atomic number 100. It {{is a member}} of the actinide series. It is the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not yet been prepared. A total of 19 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.|$|E
5|$|Galaxies have {{magnetic}} fields of their own. They {{are strong enough}} to be dynamically important: they drive mass inflow into the centers of galaxies, they modify the formation of spiral arms and they can affect the rotation of gas in the outer regions of galaxies. Magnetic fields provide the transport of angular momentum required for the collapse of gas clouds <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> formation of new stars.|$|E

5|$|In 1948 Britain's railways, <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> canal, were nationalised, {{and became}} the {{responsibility}} of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified as commercial, cruising or remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future, and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create health or safety issues. The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 José Manuel Barroso became President: the Parliament {{once again}} {{asserted}} itself in objecting {{to the proposed}} membership of the Barroso Commission. Due to the opposition Barroso was forced to reshuffle his team before taking office. The Barroso Commission {{was also the first}} full Commission since the enlargement in 2004 to 25 members <b>and</b> <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> number of Commissioners {{at the end of the}} Prodi Commission had reached 30. As a result of the increase in the number of states, the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state, rather than two for the larger states.|$|E
