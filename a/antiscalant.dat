40|$|International audienceInland {{brackish}} water reverse osmosis (RO) is economically and technically {{limited by the}} large volume of salty waste (concentrate) produced. The use of a controlled precipitation step, followed by solid/liquid separation (filtration), {{has emerged as a}} promising side-stream treatment process to treat reverse osmosis concentrate and increase overall system recovery. The addition of antiscalants to the RO feed prevents precipitation within the membrane system but might have a deleterious effect on a concentrate treatment process that uses precipitation to remove problematic precipitates. The effects of <b>antiscalant</b> type and concentration on salt precipitation and precipitate particle morphology were evaluated for several water compositions. The primary precipitate for the synthetic {{brackish water}}s tested was calcium carbonate; the presence of magnesium, sulfate, minor ions, and <b>antiscalant</b> compounds affected the amount of calcium precipitated, as well as the phases of calcium carbonate formed during precipitation. Addition of <b>antiscalant</b> decreased calcium precipitation but increased incorporation of magnesium and sulfate into precipitating calcium carbonate. Antiscalants prevented the growth of nucleated precipitates, resulting in the formation of small (100 - 200 nm diameter) particles, as well as larger (6 - 10 μm) particles. Elemental analysis revealed changes in composition and calcium carbonate polymorph with <b>antiscalant</b> addition and <b>antiscalant</b> type.

40|$|The {{formation}} of an adherent layer of inorganic deposition on the surfaces of process equipment is called scaling. Scaling {{is a major problem}} in many industries using large quantities of water. One of these industries is the paper making industry and the most common scale forming compound is calcium carbonate. The scaling problem in the paper making industry can be eased or in the best case completely solved by the use of chemical additives referred to as <b>antiscalants</b> or scale inhibitors. The most common an-tiscalant compounds are phosphonates and polycarboxylates. The {{formation of}} calcium carbonate scale and its inhibition are widely studied themes but few of the studies are linked in the conditions of paper making. The objec-tives of this thesis are to establish laboratory testing methods for the evaluation of the performance of different scale inhibitors in the paper making conditions and to evaluate the performance of different <b>antiscalants</b> in these conditions. The thesis comprises an extensive literature survey and an experimental part. The literature survey covers the precipitation process of calcium carbonate, factors affecting this process and chemistry of different <b>antiscalants.</b> Also the theory of a computational model of French Creek’s WatSIM software is covered. In the experimental part three different laboratory test methods are utilized to conclude the performance of different <b>antiscalants</b> in the condi-tions of paper making. These laboratory test methods are a static jar test, a dynamic ro-tating disk procedure, and a dynamic tube blocking procedure. The WatSIM software is utilized to calculate different scaling potential indices in the conditions of paper making. The results of this thesis show that the differences between different <b>antiscalants</b> can be distinguished with the used laboratory testing methods and that the differences are significant. The phosphonate <b>antiscalants</b> might function better than polycarboxylate <b>antiscalants</b> in certain operating conditions but even a little change in the conditions, for example in the pH or temperature, can completely block the ability of the phosphonate <b>antiscalants</b> to function. The polycarboxylate <b>antiscalants</b> are more resistant to changes in the operating conditions, which extend their range of use. The computational results yielded with WatSIM were somewhat conflicting which indicates that the software is not fully optimized for the conditions of paper making /Kir 1...|$|R

Scale deposition on these surfaces increases resistance to heat flow and leads to plant performance deterioration. Scale is formed by deposition of seawater salts that go beyond their solubility limits.

It {{can be applied to}} treatment of various industrial aqueous streams containing dissolved organic and inorganic contaminants, such as reverse osmosis (RO) retentate brine streams. Since antiscalants are dosed in RO feed streams, these become concentrated in the retentate brine stream and could have an undesirable effect on crystallization kinetics of both ice and salt in EFC. In this study, the impact of a phosphonate <b>antiscalant</b> on the kinetic processes of nucleation and growth in EFC was investigated. Firstly, the effect of an <b>antiscalant</b> on the thermodynamic phase equilibria of a binary Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution was experimentally determined.

It was noticed that a test period of only three months was too short to observe the impact of variation in seawater temperature and suspended solids on the effectiveness of the <b>antiscalant.</b> Accordingly an evaluation test was planned and carried out in one of Al-Jubail Phase II distillers to investigate the <b>antiscalant</b> effectiveness for a prolonged test period at a TBT of 90. 6 oC and a dose rate of 0. 8 PPM. Thermal and chemical parameter monitoring of the distiller which included flash range, performance ratio, overall heat transfer coefficient, fouling factor, loss of total alkalinity as well as distillate production and conductivity during a test period of 337 days, showed that the operation was smooth and steady.

40|$|Phosphonate <b>antiscalants</b> are {{commonly}} used in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis water treatment to prevent membrane fouling by mineral scale. In many circumstances it is desirable to remove these phosphonate compounds before concentrate disposal or further treatment. This research investigated the removal of phosphonate compounds from simulated membrane concentrate solutions using ferric hydroxide adsorbents. Two phosphonate <b>antiscalants</b> were investigated, Permatreat 191 ® (PT 191) and nitrilotrimethylphosphonic acid (NTMP). Batch adsorption isotherms and column breakthrough and regeneration experiments were performed on two commercial adsorbents and a ferric hydroxide loaded polyacrylonitrile fiber adsorbent prepared in our laboratory. The best performing adsorbent was Granular Ferric Hydroxide® (GFH) obtained from GEH Wasserchemie. Adsorption isotherms measured after 24 -hour equilibration periods showed initial concentration effects, whereby the isotherms were dependent on the initial adsorbate concentration in solution. Significant differences in adsorption behavior were observed between the PT 191 and the NTMP adsorbates. Differences in adsorption behavior between NTMP and PT 191 are all consistent with the PT 191 containing fewer phosphonate functional groups per molecule than NTMP. Desorption rates were bimodal, with 40 - 50 % of the adsorbed phosphonate being released on a time scale of 10 - 24 hours, while the remaining fraction was released approximately one order of magnitude more slowly. The slow desorbing fraction primarily resulted from equilibrium effects resulting from significant phosphonate adsorption, even in 1. 0 mol/L NaOH solutions. Complete regeneration could not be achieved, even after eluting the adsorbent columns with more than 300 bed volumes of 1. 0 mol/L NaOH. However, the incomplete regeneration had only a minor effect on phosphonate uptake in subsequent column breakthrough experiments...|$|R

40|$|Adsorptive {{removal of}} antiscalants offers a {{promising}} {{way to improve}} current reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate treatment processes and enables the reuse of the <b>antiscalant</b> in the RO desalination process. This work investigates the adsorption and desorption of the phosphonate <b>antiscalant</b> nitrilotris(methylenephosphonic acid) (NTMP) from RO membrane concentrate onto granular ferric hydroxide (GFH), a material that consists predominantly of akaganéite. The kinetics of the adsorption of NTMP onto GFH was predicted fairly well with two models that consider either combined film–pore or combined film–surface diffusion as the main mechanism for mass transport. It is also demonstrated that NTMP is preferentially adsorbed over sulfate by GFH at pH 7. 85. The presence of calcium causes a transformation in the equilibrium adsorption isotherm from a Langmuir type to a Freundlich type with much higher adsorption capacities. Furthermore, calcium also increases the rate of adsorption substantially. GFH is reusable after regeneration with sodium hydroxide solution, indicating that NTMP can be potentially recovered from the RO concentrate. This work shows that GFH is a promising adsorbent for the removal and recovery of NTMP <b>antiscalant</b> from RO membrane concentrates...|$|E

Thermal and chemical assessment of the unit performance showed that the operation during the test period was smooth and steady. The fouling factors of both brine heater and heat recovery section were found well below the corresponding design values. Monitoring of loss of total alkalinity (LTA) indicated no scale deposition. Post test visual inspection of the distiller revealed that the brine heater, flash chamber and water boxes were in good condition and there was no adverse effect due to the low dose rate of <b>antiscalant.</b> It has been thus concluded that <b>antiscalant</b> Belgard EV 2030 is quite effective and successful in controlling scale formation at a TBT of 98 oC and a dose rate of 0. 8 ppm during test period of 394 days.

Research was carried out with ultra-low-pressure membranes and an organophosphonate <b>antiscalant</b> (Permatreat 191). With this <b>antiscalant</b> no biofouling was introduced upon its use. Because of its low environmental impact, sulphuric acid was preferred above hydrochloric acid, but the barium sulfate scaling risk was increased. Experiments were conducted with both types of acid in increasing recovery steps from 80 % up to 90 %. While starting experimental difficulties with dosing the <b>antiscalant</b> occurred and BaSO 4 -scale formation was a fact, especially in the installation with sulphuric acid, a severe MTC decrease was seen. Successive cleaning was possible with an alkali cleaner containing a complex builder. From the barium mass balance over this 3 -month period, the precipitated barium amount was calculated. Barium analysis of the cleaning solution showed an almost complete recovery of the barium from the membrane elements. Moreover, the MTC was restored completely. From this it was concluded that the precipitated barium sulphate was washed out completely. Recoveries up to 87 % are possible without BaSO 4 -scale formation and run times up to 1 year.

40|$|Most common {{inorganic}} foulants in RO processes {{operating on}} brackish water are calcium carbonate, calcium sulphate and silica. However, silica fouling is the recovery limiting factor in RO system. Silica chemistry {{is complex and}} its degree of fouling strongly depends on the silica solubility and its polymerization under different operating conditions of RO process. In several studies carried out in batch and dynamic tests, the presence of polyvalent cations and supersaturation of silica in solutions {{were found to be}} the important factors (apart from pH and temperature) that affected the rate of silica polymerization and its induction period. Agitation did increased silica solubility; however, its effect was negligible in presence of polyvalent cations. Alkalization of water solution by coagulants particularly sodium hydroxide was found suitable for silica removal during pretreatment. The presence of magnesium in solution {{played a key role in}} silica removal mostly by the mechanism of adsorption to the metal hydroxide. The options of inline mixing (high agitation) for 5 to 10 minutes and microfiltration before RO were found suitable for silica pretreatment. During dynamic tests, the most dominant mechanism for salt deposition (mostly CaSO 4) was particulate type in high concentration water solution; while crystallization fouling was the prevailing mechanism of deposition (mostly CaCO 3 and silica) in low concentration solution. Silica showed significant effect on size and shape of inorganic salt crystals during coprecipitation. Moreover, the presence of common <b>antiscalants</b> promoted silica fouling. This important finding recommends an extra caution while using <b>antiscalants</b> in case feed water contains silica to a level that can attain saturation near membrane during RO process. A model was developed to predict the silica fouling index (SFI) based on the experimental data for induction period of silica polymerization. The model takes into account the effect of polyvalent cations and concentration polarization near membrane during RO process. It provides a conservative basis for predicting the maximum silica deposition in RO process at the normal operating conditions. A generalised correlation, which was developed for determination of the mass transfer coefficient in RO process, incorporated the effect of temperature change that is usually not considered in previous correlations. A correlation for reduction of silica content in feed water, down to a safe limit of 15 ppm for RO process, was also formulated and validated by the experimental results...|$|R

Based on previously published literature that indicated anti-scalants did not substantially decrease the scaling effect of calcium phosphate and laboratory tests that indicated controlling the pH to 6. 4 in the feed water dramatically reduced scaling formation, it was suggested that the feed water could be controlled by pH adjustments only.

40|$|Various {{membrane}} separation processes {{are being used}} for seawater desalination and treatment of wastewaters {{in order to deal}} with the worldwide water shortage problem. Different types of membranes of distinct morphologies, structures and physico-chemical characteristics are employed. Among the considered membrane technologies, membrane distillation (MD), osmotic distillation (OD) and osmotic membrane distillation (OMD) use porous and hydrophobic membranes for production of distilled water and/or concentration of wastewaters for recovery and recycling of valuable compounds. However, the efficiency of these technologies is hampered by fouling phenomena. This refers to the accumulation of organic/inorganic deposits including biological matter on the membrane surface and/or in the membrane pores. Fouling in MD, OD and OMD differs from that observed in electric and pressure-driven membrane processes such electrodialysis (ED), membrane capacitive deionization (MCD), reverse osmosis (RO), nanofiltration (NF), ultrafiltration (UF), microfiltration (MF), etc. Other than pore blockage, fouling in MD, OD and OMD increases the risk of membrane pores wetting and reduces therefore the quantity and quality of the produced water or the concentration efficiency of the process. This review deals with the observed fouling phenomena in MD, OD and OMD. It highlights different detected fouling types (organic fouling, inorganic fouling and biofouling), fouling characterization techniques as well as various methods of fouling reduction including pretreatment, membrane modification, membrane cleaning and <b>antiscalants</b> application...|$|R
40|$|Poly(aspartic acid-citric acid) {{copolymer}} (PAC) is a {{new product}} of poly(carboxylic acid) scale inhibitor. The study aims to develop a “green” water treatment agent for calcium phosphate scale. The article compares the efficiency of three polymeric <b>antiscalants,</b> poly(aspartic acid-citric acid) copolymer (PAC), polymaleic acid (HPMA) and a compound inhibitor (PAC-HPMA), for calcium phosphate scale prevention under varying experimental conditions. Inhibitor concentration, calcium concentration, system pH, temperature and experimental time were varied to determine their influences on inhibitor performance by the static scale inhibition method. The copolymer (PAC) was characterized by FTIR, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR. The compound inhibitor was applied in the actual circulating cooling water system. An atomic force microscope (AFM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and a scale formation process analysis were used to explore the scale inhibition mechanism. The results showed that scale inhibition rates of PAC, HPMA and PAC-HPMA against Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 were, respectively, about 23 %, 41. 5 % and 63 % when the dosage was 8  mg/L in the experiment. The compound inhibitor showed the better inhibition performance than the above two kinds of monomers. Under the actual working conditions, the inhibition rate of compound inhibitor was close to 100 % and completely met the actual application requirements of scale inhibitor in circulating cooling water systems. The main inhibition mechanism was the decomposition-chelation dispersion effect. The compound inhibitor {{can be used as}} an efficient “green” scale inhibitor for calcium phosphate...|$|R
40|$|Membrane fouling due to silica {{precipitation}} during {{reverse osmosis}} (RO) {{continues to be}} documented as the most common challenge in attaining stable continuous operation of RO systems across water treatment plants (1). Silica scale precipitation is time dependent and involves multiple steps leading to aqueous polymerization, condensation of polymers to form colloids, and deposition onto a solid surface (2). Exceeding the solubility of silica, widely considered {{to be in the}} range of 100 - 140 ppm, under a pH of 8 at 25 °C by various researchers, results in the precipitation of silica on the membranes, thereby limiting water recovery. Once the precipitation occurs, removal and cleaning of the same are nearly impossible (3). Therefore, pretreatment of silica becomes necessary in regions that have high a concentration of silica in the feed water. The purpose of this research was to develop a treatment system that could treat the concentrate generated by the KBH desalination plant in El Paso with the aim to recover more water for beneficial use, thereby reducing the disposal quantity and increasing the overall recovery of the plant. ^ The concentrate from the desalination plant was treated with three different processes i. e. first stage RO followed by nanofiltration and second stage RO, first stage RO followed by lime treatment and second stage RO, and first stage RO followed by seawater RO. ^ The seawater RO treatment process developed above as part of this research, called concentrate enhanced recovery reverse osmosis (CERRO©), has proved to be highly effective in treating the concentrate from the desalination plant containing high levels of silica. The results also showed that the overall recovery at the plant could be maximized without fouling the membranes. ^ Furthermore, the research also attempted to identify some of the important parameters that aided the recovery process. The effect of parameters like pH, cross flow velocity, permeate flux, initial silica concentration, alkalinity, presence of salts, precipitation time, and the use of <b>antiscalants</b> was studied. ...|$|R

H. glabra is used in traditional medicine to treat or prevent urolithiasis; it could be an interesting candidate as a green antiscaling agent. The properties of H. glabra towards CaCO 3 formation were tested by using chronoamperometry and Fast Controlled Precipitation methods. An n-butanol solution was used to partition the aqueous solution of H. glabra, yielding a polar compounds-free fraction.

40|$|Based on {{the request}} of the Director, Operation and Maintenance of the Western Coast and the {{approval}} of the Deputy Governor of Operation and Maintenance and the advice of the Director General of Department of Research & Development in Riyadh (Appendix- 1), a trial test of evaluation of <b>antiscalant</b> Belgard EV 2030 was conducted in Unit 8 of Al-Shoaiba Plant phase I at a top brine temperature (TBT) of 101 oC and a dose rate of 1. 0 ppm for a period of 326 days. Thermal and chemical assessment of the unit performance showed that the MSF distiller performance during the test period was smooth and steady. The fouling factor of brine heater was found well below the corresponding design value. Monitoring of loss of total alkalinity (LTA) indicated no scale deposition. Post test visual inspection of the distiller revealed that the brine heater, flash chamber and water boxes were in good condition and there was no adverse effect due to the use of Belgard EV 2030 at a relatively low dose rate. It has been thus concluded that <b>antiscalant</b> Belgard EV 2030 was quite effective and successful in controlling scale formation at a TBT of 101 oC and a dose rate of 1. 0 ppm during test period of 326 days. Based on the above successful evaluation test, it has been recommended to operate all distillers of this area in Al-Shoaiba plant with <b>antiscalant</b> Belgard EV 2030 with a dose rate of 1. 0 ppm and TBT of 101 oC...|$|E
40|$|Per capita water {{consumption}} declined by 25 - 36 % while recycled water use increased by 10 % in Australian capital cities from 2000 to 2009. Assuming constant per capita phosphorus loads, these changes present {{an opportunity for}} phosphorus recovery as struvite from RO brine generated at water recycling plants. A multi-parametric model for a 50, 000 equivalent population wastewater recycling plant found specific power for struvite recovery from RO brine reduced from 590 to 170 kWh/kgP as per capita {{water consumption}} declined from 300 to 50 L/c/d. Phosphonate <b>antiscalants</b> used in RO systems at a typical concentration of 30 mg/L reduced the phosphorus removal efficiency from 29 % to 20 % for phosphorus recovery from synthetic solutions and altered the rhombic struvite precipitate in 1 L jar tests. However, the effects were less pronounced in a 5 L batch reactor at higher struvite saturation (SI 1. 8), indicating the technical feasibility of struvite recovery from RO brine. An alternative magnesium source, seawater, reduced the phosphorus removal efficiency from 29 % for the control to 14 %, while the use of bittern increased the removal to 37 % in 1 L jar tests. The use of seawater also increased the calcium content of the precipitate from < 0. 1 % for the control and bittern to 6. 6 % and altered the rhombic structure in 1 L jar tests, though the effects were less pronounced in a 5 L batch reactor. While technically feasible, analysis of wastewater catchments with declining water consumption over the 2000 to 2012 period found per capita phosphorus loads declined in 11 of 12 catchments, indicating that on an energy basis, phosphorus recovery from the RO brine is unlikely to compare with production from mined phosphate rock. A life cycle analysis comparing the environmental benefits and burdens of introducing phosphorus recovery into existing infrastructure found struvite recovery from solids dewatering streams was preferred over recovery from RO brine and over direct land application of biosolids at centralised plants. Urine separation reduced the global warming and ozone depletion potentials of decentralised systems, although the soil salinization and terrestrial ecotoxicity potentials increased. While avoided fertilizer provided benefits, it didn’t necessarily outweigh the resources required to achieve phosphorus recovery...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{increasing}} water shortage and growing energy demand, novel approaches to water reuse {{is critical to}} ensuring sufficient water supply for cooling in thermoelectric power plants, the single largest use of water. Major challenges arise from complicated chemistries of the waters under consideration and changing operating conditions in open recirculating cooling systems, both of which lead to accelerated and complex mineral precipitation/deposition (mineral scaling). This study evaluated three impaired waters for their use in cooling water systems, namely, municipal wastewater, abandoned mine drainage, and coal-ash pond effluent. The focus was on understanding the mechanisms, kinetics, and inhibition of scaling from both fundamental and applied perspective. Scaling inhibition {{with a variety of}} <b>antiscalants</b> was investigated and polymaleic acid (PMA) was the most effective in all three waters. Antiscaling with PMA was achieved through two mechanisms: retardation of mineral precipitation via PMA's competitive interactions with crystallizing minerals, and stabilization of suspended mineral particles via surface adsorption of negatively-charged polymer molecules. Nevertheless, biofouling and corrosion, two other main technical challenges in water reuse for cooling, compromised the effectiveness of scaling control by PMA. Equilibrium-based chemical modeling for scaling prediction exhibited limited success in cooling systems using impaired waters. The modeling was useful for describing the pH behavior of the cooling waters. MINEQL+ modeling that considered CO 2 degassing, NH 3 stripping, and kinetically-limited solids formation captured the underlying mechanisms dictating the pH changes observed in pilot-scale cooling towers. An in situ, sensitive approach for monitoring scaling rates was developed by measuring the electrical impedance of the metal-mineral-water interface using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS capacitance correlated very well with the mass of mineral deposits. The sensitivity provides means for early scaling detection. The applicability of the method was successfully expanded to broader water chemistries and multiple minerals—conditions more relevant to cooling water systems. The key findings {{of this study indicate that}} it is possible to control scaling of several impaired waters used as cooling makeup water. The chemical treatment approach demonstrated in this study can very likely replace costly pre-treatment that is often suggested when impaired waters are used in cooling systems...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} membrane fouling {{and loss of}} hydrophobicity {{was carried out in}} direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) desalination of high salinity seawater. The membrane used was a commercial hydrophobic polypropylene flat-sheet with nominal pore size of 0. 2 microns and a porosity of 73 - 75 %. Extended runs of up to 91 hours in batch mode were conducted at various temperatures and flowrates, namely 50 - 70 ⁰C and 1. 5 - 2. 5 L/min respectively. Some runs consisted of injecting <b>antiscalant.</b> The results obtained showed that the membrane becomes significantly fouled at temperatures above 50 ⁰C often leading to significant distillate flux decline and a modest reduction of salt rejection, indicating that partial membrane wetting has occurred. It was found that the flux declined by 74 % and 92 % for temperatures of 60 ⁰C and 70 ⁰C, respectively at feed flowrate of 1. 5 L/min. The effect of flowrate on the overall flux decline was not significant. The loss of hydrophobicity was studied using distillate conductivity and used membrane surface contact angle. In this work, both partial and surface membrane wetting were observed. The modest membrane wetting occurred at 70 ⁰C and 1. 5 L/min and led to the lowest salt rejection of around 86 %. However, at flowrate of 2. 5 L/min regardless of the feed temperature studied, the salt rejection was higher than 99 %. The morphology of the membrane and the chemical composition of the fouling components were studied using SEM and EDS. These were mainly carbonates of Ca and Mg and to a lesser extent, sulfates of Ca. Sodium chloride deposits and traces of silicates and iron were also observed. The presence of calcium sulfate in the membrane surface was associated with the lowest salt rejection experiments, indicating that this foulant could be responsible for the membrane wetting mechanism. Experiments performed with commercial <b>antiscalant</b> injected in the feed with a dose of 4 ppm showed that fouling and wetting were almost completely prevented. This work has successfully shown that fouling in membrane distillation desalination can be mitigated using commercial <b>antiscalant.</b> However, the importance of developing high performance membranes was recommended to reduce the demand of costly <b>antiscalant</b> injection.
