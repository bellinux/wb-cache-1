25|$|With his cool, blond baby-face looks <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> menace, of meanness, he had {{established}} a screen persona as strong {{as any of the}} time. He might have been the Alan Ladd or the Richard Widmark of the Sixties: but the Sixties didn't want a new Alan Ladd. Peppard began appearing in a series of action movies, predictably as a tough guy, but there were much tougher guys around - like Cagney, Bogart and Robinson, whose films had now become television staples.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} often been used as the {{backdrop}} for romances like Indiscreet (1958) with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman <b>and</b> <b>A</b> <b>Touch</b> <b>of</b> Class (1973), and has become popular for romantic comedies in recent years. This is at least {{partly due to the}} television and film writer Richard Curtis, who has written some of the most successful British films of recent years â€” The Tall Guy (1989), Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), Notting Hill (1999) and Love Actually (2003), all set or partly set in the city. The films follow the awkward love lives of largely upper-middle class characters (aside from The Tall Guy, always including one played by Hugh Grant).|$|E
500|$|Playboy {{noted that}} the {{advertisements}} for the film said, [...] "this film has no socially redeeming value" [...] and continued [...] "well, that's dead right, yet this movie has some value as a promising X-rated cartoon {{in the tradition of}} Ralph Bakshi's Fritz the Cat. The New York Times called it a [...] "zany, lively, uninhibited, sexual odyssey that manages to mix a bit of Walter Mitty <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> Woody Allen with some of the innocence of Walt Disney [...] urban smarts of Ralph Bakshi". Charles Solomon of The Los Angeles Times gave the film an extremely negative review, calling [...] "a sprawling undisciplined piece of sniggering vulgarity that resembles nothing so much as animated bathroom graffiti. [...] degrading to women, blacks, Chicanos, gays, cops, lesbians, and anyone with an IQ of more than 45". Variety commented that the film [...] "has little to recommend." ...|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} sound of Lions but felt the songs were weak. [...] Writing for dotmusic, John Mulvey {{highlighted}} the [...] "gutsy, no-messing sound", but appreciated [...] "Cosmic Friend" [...] for being [...] "as impressively mad as you'd hope, too, beginning like Beatles psychedelia, taking in massive Brazilian drumming <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> pedal steel, before coalescing into furious heavy rock." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described Lions as a [...] "powerful, textured hard rock record that covers a lot of ground, surging from powerful riffs to gospel choruses and funkier-than-expected riffs", though he also complained that [...] "the songs can seem incomplete." [...] Critics disagreed on which songs were lacking, though. [...] "Losing My Mind" [...] and [...] "Young Man, Old Man" [...] were called [...] "highlights" [...] by Jane Stevenson of the Toronto Sun, though elsewhere the former was called [...] "woeful" [...] and the latter a [...] "'Freddie's Dead' vamp" [...] {{that should have been}} skipped.|$|E
500|$|Many {{felt the}} tone of the album was millennial or futuristic, anticipating {{cultural}} and political trends. According to The A.V. Club writer Steven Hyden in the feature [...] "Whatever Happened to Alternative Nation", [...] "Radiohead appeared to be ahead of the curve, forecasting the paranoia, media-driven insanity, and omnipresent sense of impending doom that's subsequently come to characterise everyday life in the 21st century." [...] In 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon described OK Computer as a [...] "prescient... dystopian essay on the darker implications of technology... oozing [...] a vague sense of dread, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> Big Brother foreboding that bears strong resemblance to the constant disquiet of life on Security Level Orange, post-9/11." [...] Chris Martin of Coldplay remarked that, [...] "It would {{be interesting to see how}} the world would be different if Dick Cheney really listened to Radiohead's OK Computer. I think the world would probably improve. That album is fucking brilliant. It changed my life, so why wouldn't it change his?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Toronto Suns Steve Tilley, who {{believed}} that Remedy did a [...] "killer job" [...] on Max Payne 2, felt that the company kept what was great about the previous game, [...] "while everything else has been tweaked, overhauled and juiced up". He was {{a fan of the}} Bullet Time from the first game, and therefore appreciated seeing it return in the sequel, with [...] "even more impressive" [...] visuals. Tilley found that the game's [...] "lifelike physics engine" [...] was easily its best aspect, and noted that while playing the game, he threw a grenade across a room, which resulted in an explosion that sent enemies flying through the air in a realistic fashion. In addition, Tilley applauded Remedy for listening to fan complaints and resolving issues from the previous game, including improved dream sequences in Max Payne 2. He was, however, disappointed with the general linearity of the game, and noted that players who are not interested in film noir themes will not enjoy them in Max Payne 2. Concluding, Tilley commented that the game [...] "has enough polish, cinematic flair and outright mayhem to thrill those who like their Sopranos with a dash of John Woo <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> Frank Miller." ...|$|E

Billy Wilder's musical entitled The Champagne Waltz, a 1937 film with the tagline, [...] "As gay and sparkling as a Champagne cocktail!", accentuates the perceived rivalry between traditional classical music and more popular, modern tunes: Champagne being the exciting, decadent newcomer, the waltz representing old-fashioned attitudes.|$|E

2500|$|Self-portrait is an oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Thomas Eakins, presented as a diploma piece upon his election as an Associate member of the National Academy of Design in 1902. Although Eakins included himself as an observer or participant in group portraits and genre scenes, this and a smaller unsigned and undated oil, {{thought to have been}} made at about the same time, are the only unadorned self-portraits he ever painted. Lloyd Goodrich wrote that it [...] "is not only one of his finest head and bust likenesses, but a revealing human document; in the direct look of his remarkable eyes one can see strength, penetrating intelligence, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> ironic humor." ...|$|E

2500|$|As The Runaway Boys {{the trio}} had {{performed}} 1950s rock revival to [...] "all the jivers and rock 'n' rollers". They also regard Australian pub rock {{as an important}} influence on the band, something the members grew up with and appreciated. Other rockabilly influences include Reverend Horton Heat and Eddie Cochran Their rockabilly influences were tempered by exposure to differing forms [...] "e'd support a jazz band one night, and a metal band the following. It helped us a lot". Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson found that by Roll On the group had grown up [...] "but continue to rampage on with their rowdy punkabilly ... their sophomore effort pulls toward their Aussie rock roots (AC/DC, Rose Tattoo) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> British class for an eager modification".|$|E
2500|$|Variety gave a {{much more}} {{positive}} review. The industry trade journal called Owen Pearce's performance [...] "scene-stealing," [...] and felt all the performances were [...] "at {{a very high level}} across the board." [...] The magazine also praised Zelder's direction: [...] "ction, comedy <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> sweetness... exactly what distinguishes Caroline Zelder's debut feature.... Zelder has a way of imbuing even the smallest gestures -- like a teenager's slump or a 5-year-old's intractable stare -- with meaning." [...] Variety also gave high marks to the film's technical production. [...] "Lenser Mark Vargo bathes the Montana locations in glorious natural light; Alan Muraoka's production design and Nola Roller's costumes mostly nail the 1968 aesthetic, but could have been even more consistent." ...|$|E

It was also revealed that Mick and Linda have a third child, Lee, who is a soldier in Afghanistan. Treadwell-Collins released a statement saying: [...] "My team have worked incredibly hard {{over the past few}} months to create the Cartersâ€”a contemporary British family with cracks, knocked edges <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> darkness that is going to make them very special to watch.

Watch out Walford, The Carters are coming!" [...] Dyer said that Mick is protective of Nancy and does not think her fiancÃ©, Wayne Ladlow (Malachi Kirby), is good enough for her.

The demos were recorded at 2Fly Studios, and produced by Alan Smyth, McClure acknowledges the work Smyth put into the demos by accrediting the debut single; [...] "Heavyweight Champion of The World" [...] as McClure/Cosens/Smyth.

Some of the internet demos feature members of other notable Sheffield musicians such as Alex Turner (Arctic Monkeys), Tim Hampton (Bromheads Jacket) and Mike Hughes (Little Ze). One of Reverend's inspirations is Manchester performance poet John Cooper Clarke and Reverend often performs his own poems, of a similar style, in between songs during his live sets. One of the B-sides to the debut single [...] "Heavyweight Champion of the World" [...] is a poem entitled [...] "Last Resort" [...] in which John Cooper Clarke and McClure read alternate stanzas. This poem was also duetted live when the band played live at Shoreditch's Spread Eagle in the first tour in May 2006.|$|E
