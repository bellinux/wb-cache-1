Various studies of the motor performance of boys have already been made in other countries as well as in South Africa, but few facts are known about the motor performance of girls. It is generally known that women of the earlier centuries were not normally allowed to participate in strenuous competitive activities - even participation in the usual forms of physical exercise and sports was considered unsuitable and harmful. Modern research has, however, proved that participation in sports and physical activities can only be beneficial to the normal, healthy female in all respects. Since 1928 women have been allowed to compete in the Olympic Games and today it is generally accepted that women should take part in competitive sports. The female should never compete against the male however, because there are too many basic differences in physical structure and capability between the two sexes. Up to the age of 10 or 11 years there is very little difference between the growth and development of boys and girls, but after the 11 th year we find that the growth and development of the girl differs markedly from that of the boy. After the 11 th year boys and girls should be separated when participating in physical activities. Boys would still compete in various age groups but such a classification would not necessarily be valid for girls any more. Research work done by Smith and others in South Africa shows that the motor performance of boys increases steadily up to the age of 20 years or more. The present study has been undertaken to provide similar data about the performance of girls in South Africa. A study conducted by McCloy in the U. S. A. proved that the motor performance of American girls increased up to 13 1 / 2 years of age and after that chronological age had no further influence on performance. One of the purposes of the present study is to check McCloy's findings against data about South African girls and it has been found that the motor performance of South African girls increase up to about 14 1 / 2 years and even later in some items. It {{is interesting to note that}} very young girls often perform very well in athletics, swimming, water-skiing and on the trampoline. Their performances usually surpass those of older girls and women. Considering this it seems that the present system of age classification of South-African girls for competitive purposes is an arbitrary one and not backed by scientific facts. The Test Battery and Method of Research. No satisfactory test battery for measuring the motor ability of girls was available in South Africa, therefore one had to be composed. The following items were included: 1. 100 -yd. dash to measure speed and stamina. At least two girls ran together to provide some form of competition and each was timed. 2. Standing broad jump to measure "explosive" power and strength of the legs. The jump was carried out from a standing position on a board nailed to the ground. 3. Cricket ball distance throwing to measure "explosive" power and coordination of the arm and shoulder-girdle. 4. 8 ¾ - 1 b. shot put to measure strength, "explosive" power and coordination. The shot was put from a circle 7 feet in diameter. 5. Basketball target toss for hand-eye coordination. A standard type basketball was tossed from behind a semi-circle with a 15 ft. radius, to pass through a ring, 18 inches in diameter, attached to a loft post. Two points were awarded if the ball passed through the ring and one point if the ball touched the ring only. 6. A zigzag run to measure speed of the legs, agility and stamina. Five chairs were put down 10 feet from each other. The girls zigzagged between the chairs from start and back twice and were timed. Data was compiled during the first half of 1965 at schools in Pretoria, Vereeniging, Vanderbijl Park, the East Rand and in some Eastern Transvaal country districts. The girls were medically fit and wore athletic uniform during the tests. Every girl's age on the day of the test was written down and each was weighed and measured. They were informed about the purpose of the tests, and the importance of giving their best performance was stressed. The procedure and rules for each item were explained to them and the necessary demonstrations were given. A total number of 750 - 800 girls between the ages 11 to 17 were tested in each of the six items listed. Results. 1. 100 -. Yd. dash: Girls of 13, 14 and 15 years perform the best Sixteen year olds also perform fairly well, but girls of 11, 12, 15 and 17 years of age do not reach the same level of achievement. 2. Broad jump: Girls of 13, 14 and 15 years of age are at the same level. Sixteen-and seventeen-year-olds jump better than any of the other age groups, while girls of 11 and 12 years jump much shorter than the others. 3. The zigzag run: The <b>achievement</b> <b>graph</b> for this item follows about the same lines as those for the 100 -yards dash. Girls of 13 and 14 years perform the best, followed• by fair performances by 11, 12 and 16 -year-olds, and poor performances by 15 - and 17 - year-olds. 4. The cricket ball distance throw: Fourteen-year-old girls reach the best distance, though little difference is found in the achievements of 14 -, 15 -, 16 - and 17 - year-olds. Girls of 11 and 12 years reach only a very short distance in comparison with the other age groups. 5. Shot put: A general gradual increase in achievement takes place to reach a peak at 17 years. The increase starts from 11 years to 12 and 13, then continues to 14 and 15 years, where little difference is found between the two age groups. Sixteen- and seventeen- year- olds again perform a little better. 6. Basketball target toss: Girls of 15 and 17 years old achieve the highest score, though the scores of all age groups only vary from 6. 5 to 8 points out of a possible 20 points. Conclusions. McCloy, who conducted a similar study of American girls, determined that chronological age has no influence on motor performance after 13 1 / 2 years of age. The results reached in the present study, however, show that there seems to be no absolute chronological age-limit at which the motor performance of South African girls reaches a peak in all fields of physical activity. These results show that speed increases up to 14 1 / 2 years after which chronological age has no further influence. In the zigzag run, where agility as well as speed is needed, the chronological age-limit of development of South African girls is 13 1 / 2 years. On the other hand the limit is nearer to 17 years in all items where strength and coordination are the deciding factors. Girls of 17 years old reached the best achievement in three of the six items of the battery, viz. basketball target toss, shot put and broad jump. They also performed second best in cricket ball throwing for distance. The 14 - year-olds took second place, performing the best in the dash and cricket ball throwing, and second best in the zigzag run. Thirteen-year-olds took third place, being the best in the zigzag run, and second best in the dash [...] both items requiring speed. When studying the results of this research we find peak achievements at 13 and 14 years and again at 17 years, while 15 - and 16 -year-olds gave surprisingly poor performances. Girls of 11 and 12 years old could hardly compete with any of the other age groups. It is clear that the present system of age classification of South African school girls is not based on scientific grounds or physiological principles. Results from this research can be used as a basis for the classification of girls, other than a strictly chronological one, in competitions. related to motor performance. As yet it is impossible to explain why some age groups perform much better than older groups in some items. This can only be determined by means of a thorough study which also takes cognizance of other factors influencing the total development of girls. Such research should, however, be undertaken by women, because it would necessarily include taking certain anthropometric measurements and asking questions of a very personal nature. It can be mentioned that McCloy unsuccessfully tried to explain the differences in performance of the various age groups that he tested. Because men usually undertake research work of this nature, girls as a subject, are neglected for obvious reasons, There is still a wide scope for research in this field for some industrious women researchers. Needless to say, such research work would be extremely advantageous to physical educators and athletic coaches. Master...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{hypotheses}} of {{this study}} stated the following: Interaction with the computer game will significantly increase the class means in: (1) mathematical achievement, (2) attitudes toward mathematics, and (3) graphing ability in high school advanced algebra. ALGEBRA ARCADE is a computerized simulation game played on a coordinate grid. One can play against one's self or another player. Greater knowledge of graphing functions results in a higher score. The game closely resembles commercially marketed videogames. Eleven teachers, at seven high schools, each taught a control and an experimental class. Four hundred twenty-three students took both attitude tests and four hundred twenty-five students took both achievement tests. Students were pretested and posttested with selected scales from the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics attitudes Scales and equivalent forms of the Intermediate Algebra portion of the Descriptive Tests of Mathematics Skills (College Board) to measure mathematical <b>achievement.</b> <b>Graphing</b> ability {{was measured by the}} score on the Coordinate Plane and Graphing part of the Intermediate Algebra test. The experiment lasted four weeks and centered around the Quadratic Functions unit. The experimental group played ALGEBRA ARCADE in lieu of the in-class assignment during the 15 - 20 minutes at the end of class. The out-of-class assignment was the same. Analysis revealed: (1) a significant difference, at the. 08 level, in- change of class means on mathematical achievement favoring use of the computer game, (2) very little difference (p=. 38) in the change of class means on attitudes toward mathematics, and (3) a significant difference, at the. 005 level, in change of class means on graphing ability favoring the use of the computer game. Analysis of the other parts of the Intermediate Algebra test and the specific attitude scales revealed no significant differences; however, a negative trend was noted in the areas of Solving Equations and Inequalities and Effectance Motivation in Mathematics...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Total quality management (TQM) has been recognized by many countries {{to be one of}} the keys to competitiveness. Organizations in other industries are increasingly using self-assessment instrument to drive continuous improvement and direct the TQM journey in moving the organizations towards business excellence. In Saudi Arabia, many organizations implementing TQM are in need for a self-assessment instrument to assist in implementing TQM properly. There is a clear need to evaluate or assess TQM practices as a key part of the TQM implementation strategy within the construction industry organizations using an appropriate self-assessment instrument. This thesis examined a novel approach for this problem through using Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) as the most suitable TQM model selected among 16 models used worldwide within the construction industry organizations. The developed TQM generic model is based on the selected TQM model with consideration for the Saudi organizational culture and the requirements of construction industry. The criteria in the developed TQM generic model were used as a framework that was translated into a multi-item questionnaire for assessing quality performance. Quality, Assessment Instrument for the Saudi Construction Industry or "QAISCI" was developed and it has the potential to assist in implementing and assessing TQM. It contains TQM generic model, self-assessment questionnaire, scoring system and <b>achievement</b> assessment <b>graph.</b> Statistical testing confirmed that the self-assessment instrument is valid and there is significant correlation between the scores obtained from survey and that obtained from TQM assessors. The research also describes the results of survey about the quality management practices carried out for 112 organizations consisting of clients, design consultants and construction organizations. The level of TQM awareness for construction client, consultant-design, and construction organizations were determined through QAISCL The general level of TQM awareness for the construction industry organizations in Saudi Arabia appears to be "Enlightenment" or exactly in the early stage of "Enlightenment" with a percentage of progress towards full TQM implementation equals to 32...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} self-regulated learning (SRL) as {{a relationship between}} metacognitive self-regulation, motivational self-regulation and behavioural self-regulation and focussed on whether year 9 science {{students were able to}} develop SRL strategies. The teacher/researcher, through a PEEL lens, designed an intervention which embedded opportunities for student reflection on learning and understandings in a usual classroom setting. Scheduled sessions were used to develop a common learning language which students used to reflect on learning and metacognition that was taking place from week to week. These sessions also provided a forum for the teacher to share her pedagogical reasoning (PR), develop an understanding of student/teacher roles during learning events, and of the value of formative assessment and effective feedback. Of course, the main intention was to introduce students to a greater repertoire of SRL strategies which they learned to activate and reflect on through the use of detailed <b>achievement</b> score <b>graphs.</b> Qualitative data were collected via classroom observations, use of student learning journals, the teacher/researcher's own teaching journal, collection of artefacts and responses from semi-structured interviews. From these observed data, students were categorised as High self-regulated learners (HSRL), Average self-regulated learnings (AvSRL) or Low self-regulated learners (LSRL) during the baseline stage and were re-categorised {{at the end of the}} intervention stage. It was found that the HSRL students flourished and in fact, migrated towards each other and away from LSRL students; this had a greater effect on the learning of LSRL students who floundered as a result. The AvSRL students bifurcated forming two new groups known as AvSRL-A (demonstrating SRL behaviours closely related to those of HSRL students) and AvSRL-B (demonstrating SRL behaviours closely related to those of LSRL students); students made a choice to either "opt in" or "opt out" of science lessons and this had a direct effect on student learning. Quantitative data were collected via a modified version of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and was triangulated with the qualitative data described above. It confirmed that, despite all students demonstrating developing SRL skills, the spread of the class had widened. That is, this research found that although year nine science students were able to develop SRL strategies, the extent to which this occurred and the ways in which this manifested itself, varied within the class and in fact, increased the spread between those who could and those who could not...|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} {{measure for}} evaluating health system performance is the achievement index, {{which can be}} calculated using prevalence and distribution of a health measure across different socioeconomic groups. This study extends this approach by examining how achievement can be represented on a two-dimensional plane with the x-axis being the difference in mean ill-health and the y-axis being the difference in an absolute measure of inequality based on the generalised concentration index. The achievement plane is an easily understandable visual aid which provides a method of tracking changes in health and inequality over time, as well as uncertainty around these measures. We also demonstrate how comparisons over time and {{at different levels of}} inequality aversion can be undertaken using measures of net achievement. To illustrate the use of the achievement plane, we compared changes in prevalence of various cardiovascular risk factors and absolute inequality in the distribution of these factors, using data from four successive Australian National Health Surveys conducted between 1989 and 2005. While self-reported rates of smoking and high cholesterol have been declining, inequalities have been rising as the greatest reductions in these risk factors have been among higher income groups. Conversely for risk factors where the prevalence has been increasing, health inequalities are either not changing (i. e. diabetes and obesity), or diminishing over time (overweight/obese). All of these changes can be summarized using an <b>achievement</b> plane and <b>graphs</b> of net <b>achievement</b> to examine changes in prevalence and distribution of these risk factors over time.

40|$|SUMMARY This study aims {{to examine}} {{the extent to which}} {{entrepreneurial}} characters of co-operative leaders is related to the success of agribusiness co-operatives, so that the findings can be used to form strategies for developing agribusiness co-operatives. This general objective can be achieved through some of the following operational objectives, namely to: (1) analyze factors that influence the development of co-operatives to determine success levels of agribusiness co-operatives in Indonesia; (2) identify characteristics of co-operative entrepreneurs in successful agribusiness co-operatives; (3) evaluate the effectiveness of co-operative education and training (CET) programs in Indonesia; and (4) formulate strategies for developing co-operative entrepreneurs and agribusiness co-operatives in Indonesia. The research was conducted in thirty dairy co-operatives in the Provinces of West Java and East Java. The determination of dairy co-operatives as the object of study was done deliberately, because dairy co-operatives in Indonesia are established in one of two ways, either {{in the form of a}} KUD which is established by government policy (top-down approach) or in the form of a Non-KUD, which is established naturally by dairy farmers (bottom-up approach). Analyses were conducted on the performance of co-operatives in 2000, and on the growth of co-operative businesses over five years (1996 - 2000). The data collected were analyzed in terms of the business and organizational aspects of co-operatives. Research respondents included co-operative boards of directors (BOD), managers, employees, and members and non-members of co-operatives, coming to a total of 420 respondents. Two indices were made, one each for business and organizational variables. After this was done, both of these indexes were plotted to form quadrants, in which the thirty dairy co-operatives distributed themselves into four typologies. The best co-operatives were those in the typology of Quadrant-I, which had relatively better performance in both business and organizational aspects than those in the other typologies. There were ten co-operatives in Quadrant- 1, four co-operatives in Quadrant-II, and ten and six co-operatives in Quadrant-III and IV, respectively. Additionally, the two indices were then processed into a single index called the Dairy Co-operative Development Index, which sorted the thirty sample co-operatives from best-to-worst performance. The performance of co-operative leaders was analyzed by comparing their performance among quadrants. A statistical test was used to determine whether the character of co-operative leaders was significantly different among quadrants, particularly between Quadrant-I and the other Quadrants. This study shows that co-operative leaders in Quadrant-I have traits frequently recognized as entrepreneurial traits, namely the highest score for internal locus of control and the need for <b>achievement,</b> an ideal <b>graph</b> form of social motives, as well as a moderate risk-taking attitude. To examine the third operational objective, the study observed the implementation of CET programs in Indonesia. The primary data was obtained from 58 co-operative lecturers from 32 universities throughout Indonesia and 206 students who were taking co-operative studies at four sampled universities. In addition to this, expert interviews were conducted with eight co-operative experts, using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The result showed that the implementation of CET programs in Indonesia was still not effective in supporting the development of co-operatives. In addition, a review of the implementation of co-operative education at universities showed that co-operative education was still not capable of motivating students to contribute to the development of co-operatives. The strategy proposed for developing CE consists of developing its three pillars, namely: (1) building understanding and confidence in co-operatives, (2) developing business and technological knowledge and skills, and (3) developing altruistic leadership skills. Meanwhile, the strategy for developing agribusiness co-operatives prioritizes the development of the existing agribusiness co-operatives, which is formulated while referring to the typology of co-operatives and Co-operative Development Index...|$|R
