40|$|The over-arching {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{consider}} how Diderot <b>and</b> <b>Lessing</b> dealt {{with the impact of}} Spinozist thought and its consequences and to analyse {{the extent to which they}} can be said to exemplify a post-Spinozist mentality in dealing with three main issues: virtue and vice; freedom; and, finally, belief. It aims to prove not that Diderot <b>and</b> <b>Lessing</b> were direct disciples of Spinoza, but that both were influenced by the post-Spinozist climate pervading the eighteenth-century intellectual world. At the same time as locating similarities of approach between their thinking and Spinoza's, this thesis will also point out how Diderot <b>and</b> <b>Lessing</b> went beyond the Dutch philosopher's thinking, and how they often showed themselves to be even more radical than Spinoza himself.

Leonardo privileges painting over poetry owing to the power of visiblity; on the other hand, Lessing subordinates painting to poetry since the former frustrates vision and thus allows the free play of the imagination. In so doing, however, they both push their metaphysical arguments into an aporia and as such, that which is proper and decidable turns out to be improper and undecidable...|$|R
