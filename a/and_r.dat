40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{association}} between CETP gene polymorphisms and metabolic syndrome (MS), {{as well as the}} relationship between the CETP gene polymorphisms and each component of MS. Methods: A total of 571 individuals which were randomly selected from 5692 Uyghur adults were subdivided into two groups, including 280 patients with MS and 291 control subjects, using the group-matching method after matching for gender. We detected CETP polymorphisms (rs 5882, rs 1800775, rs 3764261, rs 12149545, <b>rs</b> 711752, <b>and</b> <b>rs</b> 708272) by using the Snapshot method. Results: (1) Significant differences were found involving the frequency distribution of genotypes <b>and</b> alleles of <b>rs</b> 1800775, rs 3764261, rs 12149545, <b>rs</b> 711752, <b>and</b> <b>rs</b> 708272 between the control and MS groups (all p < 0. 05). (2) rs 1800775, rs 3764261, rs 12149545, <b>rs</b> 711752, <b>and</b> <b>rs</b> 708272 polymorphisms were significantly related to the risk of MS (all p < 0. 05). (3) The rs 1800775 polymorphism was associated with high fasting blood glucose levels and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); <b>rs</b> 3764261 <b>and</b> <b>rs</b> 12149545 polymorphisms were associated with all components of MS except high blood pressure; <b>rs</b> 711752 <b>and</b> <b>rs</b> 708272 polymorphisms were associated with low HDL-C (all p < 0. 05). (4) Complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) was identified for two pairs of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<b>rs</b> 3764261 <b>and</b> <b>rs</b> 12149545 (D’ = 1. 000, r 2 = 0. 931), <b>rs</b> 711752 <b>and</b> <b>rs</b> 708272 (D’ = 1. 000, r 2 = 0. 996)). (5) The A-G-G-G-C (p = 0. 013, odds ratio [OR] = 0. 622, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] = 0. 427 – 0. 906) and A-T-A-A-T (p < 0. 001, OR = 0. 519, 95 % CI = 0. 386 – 0. 697) haplotypes were more frequent in the control group than in the case group. Conclusions: The rs 1800775, rs 3764261, rs 12149545, <b>rs</b> 711752, <b>and</b> <b>rs</b> 708272 polymorphisms of CETP were associated with MS and its components among the Uyghur ethnic group.
