40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the long-term functional nerve recovery after reconstruction of a IO-mm gap in the sciatic nerve of the rat, with a thin-walled nerve guide, composed of a biodegradable copolymer of DL-lactide and epsilon-caprolactone [p(DLLA-epsilon-CL) ]. To evaluate both motor and sensory nerve recovery, walking track analysis and electrostimulation tests were carried out after implantation periods ranging from 3 to 52 weeks postoperatively. The first signs of both motor and sensory nerve recovery could be observed after 5 weeks. After 15 weeks, 70 % of the sciatic function and 90 % of the sensory nerve function had been recovered. After this period, the sciatic function index (SFI) did not improve further, whereas the sensory nerve function appeared to return to normal. When {{the results of the}} SFI measurements, minus those obtained from rats with severe <b>automutilation,</b> are extrapolated, further improvement of the SFI might be expected after 52 weeks. The fact that 100 % sensory nerve recovery was obtained, as measured by the electrostimulation test, could be explained by sensory reinnervation from surrounding areas. The SFI was not fully reestablished because <b>automutilation</b> had a great impact on the use of walking track assessment. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Pro-anorexia {{websites}} portray {{an extreme}} form of thin-ideal. This between-subjects experiment {{examined the effects}} of viewing such a website on body satisfaction, affect, and appearance self-efficacy compared to viewing control websites (fashion, home decoration, <b>automutilation).</b> The sample consisted of 124 normal weight, young adult, Dutch women (mean age 21. 2, mean body mass index 21. 4). Participants did not differ on affect and appearance self-efficacy. One body satisfaction measure showed that pro-anorexia viewers were more satisfied with their bodies than home decoration viewers. Our findings suggest that viewing a pro-anorexia website might not have detrimental effects on body satisfaction and affect among normal weight young women. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|Autotomy is a {{phenomenon}} of deafferentation of the rat limb by transection of the sciatic and saphenous nerves, inducing an <b>automutilation</b> of the limb {{as a response to}} painful stimuli generated from the amputation neuroma. Autotomy has been proposed as an experimental model for neuralgia pain. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of streptomycin, ampicillin and chloramphenicol applied either {{in the vicinity of the}} nerve stump or intramuscularly. The course of autotomy was followed during 8 weeks using the scoring system of Wall et al. (1979). It was shown that streptomycin and ampicillin can suppress autotomy when applied topically whereas systemic use of the investigated antibiotics was efficient only when streptomycin was injected.

40|$|Some typical {{distributions}} of skin lesions represent a helpful {{sign for the}} differential diagnosis in dermatology. Indeed, some dermatoses, affecting the skin, nails or mucosae, display an annular or linear disposition. The linear pattern {{can be explained by}} several factors. The dermatosis can follow either a nerve traject, vascular or lymphatic vessels, or embryological lines. Exogenous factors, including traumatisms or <b>automutilations,</b> can also contribute to this particular distribution. In this review, the principal linear dermatoses are discussed together with their pathogenesis. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|One way {{to improve}} nerve {{regeneration}} and bridge longer nerve gaps may be the use of semipermeable/porous conduits. With porosity less biomaterial {{is used for the}} nerve conduit. We evaluated the short-term effects of porous Neurolac (R) nerve conduits for in vivo peripheral nerve regeneration. In 10 male Black Hooded rats, a gap of 10 mm was bridged by a porous Neurolac (R) nerve conduit. Evaluation point ranged from 3 to 12 weeks. The sciatic nerve function was not measurable due to <b>automutilation</b> and flexion contractures. The gait-stance duration showed no improvement with time, indicating a disturbed walking pattern. The nerve guides showed very fast degradation with swelling, fragmentation, and collapse. Furthermore, a severe foreign body reaction occurred. Nerve regeneration was severely hampered. This study showed no beneficial effects of porous Neurolac (R) nerve conduits when compared with previous findings with nonporous copolymeric nerve guides of a slightly different composition.

40|$|Abstract Nephrolithiasis {{associated}} with inborn metabolic diseases {{is a very}} rare condition with some common characteristics: early onset of symptoms, family history, associated tubular impairment, bilateral, multiple and recurrent stones, and association with nephrocalcinosis. The prognosis of such diseases may lead to life threatening conditions, {{not only because of}} unabated kidney damage but also because of progressive extra-renal involvement, either in a systemic form (e. g. primary hyperoxaluria type 1, requiring combined liver and kidney transplantation), or in a neurological form (Lesch–Nyhan syndrome leading to <b>automutilation</b> and disability, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase superactivity, which is {{associated with}} mental retardation). Patients with other inborn metabolic diseases present only with recurrent stone formation, such as cystinuria, adenine phosphoribosyl-transferase deficiency, xanthine deficiency. Finally, nephrolithiasis may be secondarily part of some other metabolic diseases, such as glycogen storage disease type 1 or inborn errors of metabolism leading to Fanconi syndrome (nephropathic cystinosis, tyrosinaemia type 1, fructose intolerance, Wilson disease, respirator...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In the {{historic}} description of Herodotus {{on the battle}} of Thermopylae at 480 BC two formerly healthy warriors suffer from "ophthalmia". The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess the possible aetiologies of this disease. DESIGN: We studied Herodotus' description in translation and offer a differential diagnosis. RESULTS: From the text we deduced that the "ophthalmia" was a condition in two physically fit males with a bilateral decreased or distorted vision, lasting longer than an hour, with an acute or subacute onset in Ancient Greece. The condition ultimately went into remission in one of the two patients, whereas the other subject deceased in combat not long after the onset of the disease, still suffering from the disease. The differential diagnosis consists of (1) anticholinergic syndrome secondary to an intoxication with the berries of the plant Atropa belladonna, (2) <b>automutilation</b> and (3) psychogenic loss of visual acuity. CONCLUSION: It is impossible to assess the ultimate cause of the "opthalmia" after 2500 years, but we suggest the anticholinergic syndrome by intoxication with Atropa belladonna is the most likely...|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} various methods of treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In {{the first part}} of the thesis, the literary review, four evidence-based therapies of ASD are introduced. Also, the work outlines some of the alternative approaches to therapy with an emphasis on potentially dangerous methods. Furthermore, pharmacotherapeutic options which are commonly used to manage the comorbid symptoms such as anxiety, repetitive and <b>automutilation</b> behaviors are mentioned. The last chapter of the literary review is devoted to an overview of the latest research related to biological interventions and their potential to capture the cause of ASD. The main goal of the literary review is to outline various options for upbringing, education and overall improvement of the quality of life of people with ASD. The first part of thesis is followed by a research project proposal which is based on the literary review. The main objective of this part of thesis is to measure the effectivity of relatively new therapeutic approach, specifically a DIR/Floortime approach, in the Czech republic and the Slovak republic. A quantitative type of research design, a naturalistic study, was chosen for this purpose. This type of research design should enable a proper measure of the chosen therapeutic approach and its [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of an enriched environment on {{the recovery of}} nerve function was studied after a sciatic nerve lesion and repair. A sciatic nerve gap of 15 mm was bridged in 12 rats using autologous nerve grafts. The rats were housed either in an enriched environment or in standard cages. In the enhanced housing environment, the rats were forced to move by dissociating food and water sources, including wire for foot gripping instead of flat plastic floors, and wooden play toys. Locomotor behavior was recorded on tape with a digital videorecorder and behavioral data were {{compared with those of}} a group of six unoperated rats. The video-recordings were analyzed for the stance factor (SF) as well as several other aspects of the rat's walking pattern. Walking was evaluated between 10 and 21 weeks after the operation. Differences in walking behavior between rats raised in an enriched environment and rats raised in standard cages could not be demonstrated. Differences in walking behavior between male and female rats were not found either. But data differed significantly at all ages with rats of the control group. <b>Automutilation</b> of parts of the denervated foot revealed a significant difference in both experimental groups, occurring less often in the enriched environment group.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the main {{risk factors for}} suicide and nonfatal suicidal behavior in patients with bipolar disorder through a systematic review of the international literature. Data Sources: Studies were identified through electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 -December 2003), EMBASE (1980 -December 2003), PsycINFO (1872 -November 2003), and Biological Abstracts (1985 -December 2003) using index and free-text search terms for bipolar disorder, bipolar depression, manic depression, mania, and affective disorders; combined with terms for self-harm, self-injury, suicide, attempted suicide, <b>automutilation,</b> self-mutilation, self-poisoning, and self-cutting; and combined with terms for risk, case control, cohort, comparative, longitudinal, and follow-up studies. No language restrictions were applied to the search. Study Selection: Included studies were cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional investigations of patients with bipolar disorder in which suicide (13 studies) or attempted suicide (23 studies) was reported as an outcome. The selected studies also used diagnostic tools including the DSM, International Classification of Diseases, and Research Diagnostic Criteria. Data Synthesis: Meta-analysis of factors reported in more than 1 study identified the main risk factors for suicide as a previous suicide attempt and hopelessness. The main risk factors for nonfatal suicidal behavior included family history of suicide, early onset of bipolar disorder, extent of depressive symptoms, increasing severity of affective episodes, the presence of mixed affective states, rapid cycling, comorbid Axis I disorders, and abuse of alcohol or drugs. Conclusions: Prevention of suicidal behavior in patients with bipolar disorder should include attention to these risk factors in assessment and treatment, including when deciding whether to initiate treatment aimed specifically at reducing suicide risk...|$|E
40|$|To assess {{feasibility}} of the harmonic Osteovue blade (HOB) {{for use in}} the soft tissue approach for dogs undergoing hemilaminectomy and to compare outcomes between dogs undergoing HOB or traditional approach (TRAD). A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed using 20 client-owned dogs with thoracolumbar intervertebral disk extrusion requiring hemilaminectomy. Dogs were randomly assigned to HOB or TRAD. Neurologic function and pain scores were assessed pre-operatively. Intraoperative blood loss and surgical approach time as well as postoperative pain and wound healing scores were recorded. Additionally, neurologic recovery and owner perceived quality of life were recorded at day 10 and 30 postoperative. There {{was no significant difference in}} sex distribution, weight, age, preoperative neurological grade and pain score, and perioperative outcome measures between groups. Intraoperative total blood loss was minimal for HOB and TRAD (median: 0 ml (range 0 - 9) and 2. 2 ml (range 0 - 6. 8), respectively; p = 0. 165) and approach times were similar (median: 7 min (range 5 - 12) and 8 min (range 5 - 13), respectively; p = 0. 315). While changes in wound healing scores were similar, changes in postoperative pain scores and neurological function were significantly improved in the HOB compared to the TRAD group. Postoperative complications in the HOB group consisted of <b>automutilation</b> of part of the incision and development of a small soft, non-painful subcutaneous swelling in 1 dog each. The HOB is a safe and effective tool for the soft tissue approach for routine spinal surgery in dogs and is associated with decreased pain and increased neurological function post-surgery...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{clinically}} noted that peripheral nerve transections in infants and {{very young children}} seem to show better functional recovery after nerve repair compared with adult patients. There can be several reasons for this (e. g. outgrowing axons might have maintained their potential to locate their genuine target muscle, {{the distance from the}} lesion site to the target organ is shorter, or there is enhanced compensational capacity of central brain areas at early stages of development). We decided to study the effects on walking performance of sciatic nerve transection and repair in nine rats at the youngest age at which appreciable numbers of motoneurons survive transaction (10 th day of life). The follow-up period was 52 weeks. Walking movements were recorded on video and performance was qualitatively assessed. The stance factor and the sciatic function index were calculated and abnormalities such as <b>automutilation</b> of the toes or flexion contractures were noted. Postmortem inspection aimed to examine the continuity of the regenerated nerve and the presence of neuromas. Nine days after the transection and nerve repair, walking performance in all rats was close to the level in rats that had not undergone the procedure. Exorotation of the hind leg on the operated side was observed in only two rats. However, 20 days after lesioning the walking performance started to deteriorate, and walking patterns in all but one rat showed severe disability {{until the end of the}} observations. Only one out of the nine animals walked relatively undisturbed, with a sciatic function index approaching normal values but with an abnormal stance factor. We conclude that a sciatic nerve transection in rats aged 10 days leads to long-term impairments in walking patterns...|$|E
40|$|Title Perceptions {{of support}} staff {{with respect to}} {{discontinuation}} of long-term used antipsychotics for residential individuals with intellectual disability; a mixed method study Background Antipsychotics are the most used psychotropic drugs by residential intellectually disabled individuals and have harmful side effects. There is limited evidence on the efficacy of antipsychotics on challenging behaviour. Discontinuation is possible for a part of residential individuals with intellectual disability and decreases some harmful side effects. In order to discontinue antipsychotics the cooperation of support staff is important. There is no knowledge on perceptions of support staff with respect to discontinuation of antipsychotic medication in persons with intellectual disability. Aim This study wants to gain insights in the perceptions of support staff about discontinuation of antipsychotics in residential individuals with intellectual disability. Method Four focus groups were conducted in this mixed methods study, followed by a survey with 29 Likert items. Results Support staff perceive antipsychotics as effective in decreasing anxiety, <b>automutilation,</b> agitation and aggression. Support staff perceives themselves as motivated to contribute to discontinuation of antipsychotics. A larger proportion of support staff believes reduction is possible compared with the proportion that believes that complete discontinuation is possible. A clear plan for the multidisciplinary team is perceived indispensable. Support staff has no perceived knowledge deficits on side effects of antipsychotics. Conclusion In this first study directed at the perceptions of support staff about discontinuation of antipsychotics a combination was found of {{a positive attitude toward}} contributing to discontinuation of antipsychotics on one hand {{and on the other hand}} the perceived efficacy of antipsychotics in reducing challenging behaviour and an expectation that discontinuation of antipsychotics is almost only possible in exceptional cases. Recommendations The development of a decision guide is recommended in order to contribute the use of tailor-made discontinuation or reduction plans...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study vaginal {{disorders}} of 233 bitches were described. A literature survey serves as an introduction. Clinical records of all bitches with vaginal disorders {{in a period of}} 10 years were analysed at the Clinic for Reproduction of the Free University of Berlin, of the Veterinary Clinic-Animal shelter-GmbH Rostock and of several veterinary practitioners. 60 bitches suffered from a vaginitis, 41 had a vaginal prolaps, 122 a vaginal neoplasia, seven congenital anomalies and three injuries. Any patients with vaginal prolaps or tumors had injuries of the vaginal mucosa too, three of them after <b>automutilation.</b> Anamnesis, clinical signs, breed and age were evaluatet. In 22 bitches with vaginitis bacteriological investigations were carried out and in 76 cases of vaginal tumors a histological investigation was performed. Congenital defectes were dursified and in two cases an X-ray was performed. 60, 0 % of the bitches with vaginitis were of large breeds, only eight percent of small breeds. In most cases (73, 3 %) a juvenile vaginitis was diagnosed. The average age was 5, 6 months. In 26, 7 % of cases the vaginitis was diagnosed {{for the first time in}} adult bitches (average of age: 5, 8 years), often with underlying diseases. They often were of small breeds. The juvenil vaginitis was found significant frequentlier (p= 0, 014) in bitches of large breeds than in bitches of small breeds. The microbiological investigations showed 57, 9 % monocultures and 42, 1 % mixed cultures. In most cases (49 %) Staphylococcus spp. (S. intermedius, S. aureus, S. epidermidis) were isolated and in 22 % of cases Streptococcus spp. After treatment with antibiotics and/or local flushing the clinical signs in 15, 0 % of the bitches did not stop or returned after some days. The juvenile vaginitis of the bitches stopped after and less treatment after sexual maturity. 41 bitches showed a prolaps of vaginal tissue, 39 of them during oestrus and two during last days of pregnancy. The age of the bitches with prolaps during oestrus was in average 18 months. Vaginal prolapses were observed especially in bitches of large breeds (58, 5 %). The highest incidence had Boxers and Doberman (12, 2 %), Staffordshire Terriers (9, 8 %) and German shepherd dogs (7, 3 %). The number of bitches of brachicephal breeds was especially high (36, 6 %). Most of the vaginal prolapses were so called pearshaped prolapses (67, 9 %). 21, 4 % showed a prolaps in form of three lobes and 10, 7 % were complete doughnut-shaped prolapses of different size. The form and circumference of prolapsed tissue was not related to the duration of the disease. Surgical treatment as the treatment of choice was carried out in 75, 6 % of all prolapses. Neoplasia of the vagina was a problem of older dogs. The bitches of 26 breeds had an average of age of 9, 1 years. Most of them were mongrels (16, 4 %) followed by German shepherd dog (15, 5 %), Poodle (15, 6 %) and Cocker Spaniel (11, 5 %). In 49, 2 % of cases the bitches were of small breeds. Main signs of vaginal neoplasia included prolaps of tumor tissue (54, 1 %), sanguineous vaginal discharge (22, 9 %) and bulging of the perineum (9, 8 %). 18, 8 % of the bitches did not show any specific signs. Tumor locations were in 81, 9 % of cases the vagina propria and only in rare cases the vestibulum, perivaginal, perivestibular or perineal area. Of all investigated tumors 81, 6 % were benigne. Most vaginal tumors were fibromas (43, 4 %), leiomyomas (18, 4 %) and lipomas (10, 5 %). Of the malignant tumors sarcomas had the highest frequency (14, 5 %). Single or multiple growth is no sign for dignity. Surgical excision was the method of choice. It was performed in 93, 4 % of patients. An episiotomy was necessary in 39, 5 %. Congenital anomalies were diagnosed as stenosis (n= 3), vaginal septa (n= 3) and ano-rectal defect (n= 1). Treatment and prognosis were dependent on the extent and form of the defect. The injuries resulted from assisted delivery (n= 1), mating (n= 1) and trimming (n= 1) ...|$|E
