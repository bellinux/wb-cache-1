Choy So-yuk, from the usually pro-Government DAB, called for the vote to be postponed, and the Liberal Party equally did not back the Government. However, Government ministers declared that it had [...] "no plans to list the pier as a declared monument", and insisted that there was [...] "no direct relationship between the grading <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> will demolish and relocate the pier". During the debate, the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services also said that even if the site was pronounced a first-class monument, there remained no legally binding prohibition against its demolition. Liberal Party Chairman James Tien said that, in failing to muster support to implement its policies, [...] "the Government is like a crab with weak legs".|$|E

He called for expanded education about the residential school system and said [...] "this is a moment for national reflection and introspection... {{to think about the}} depth of our commitment to tolerance, respect and inclusiveness, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> can do better.

[...] I think our players took that to heart." [...] With this game Michigan opened the season with two home losses, {{the first time that}} had happened since 1959. [...] It also gave them a losing streak of four games, the most in four decades. [...] Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr said [...] "We have good kids and they're hurting.
