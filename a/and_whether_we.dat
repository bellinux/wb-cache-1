500|$|On 9 May, {{after an}} hour-long heated debate, the {{government}} was forced to withdraw its motion {{due to the lack}} of support. Choy So-yuk, from the usually pro-Government DAB, called for the vote to be postponed, and the Liberal Party equally did not back the Government. However, Government ministers declared that it had [...] "no plans to list the pier as a declared monument", and insisted that there was [...] "no direct relationship between the grading <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> will demolish and relocate the pier". During the debate, the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services also said that even if the site was pronounced a first-class monument, there remained no legally binding prohibition against its demolition. Liberal Party Chairman James Tien said that, in failing to muster support to implement its policies, [...] "the Government is like a crab with weak legs".|$|E

When the commission's work was {{completed}} in December 2015, Johnston presided over a closing ceremony at Rideau Hall, which book-ended the commission along with the opening ceremony hosted by Johnston's viceregal predecessor. He called for expanded education about the residential school system and said [...] "this is a moment for national reflection and introspection... {{to think about the}} depth of our commitment to tolerance, respect and inclusiveness, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> can do better. This is a moment to think about those people — those children, those mothers and fathers, those families and those elders, past and present.

2500|$|Netanyahu's father, Benzion, was a {{professor}} of Jewish history at Cornell University, editor of the Encyclopaedia Hebraica, and a senior aide to Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who remained active in research and writing into his nineties. Regarding the Palestinian people, he stated: [...] "That they won't be able to face [...] the war with us, which will include withholding food from Arab cities, preventing education, terminating electrical power and more.

[...] Netanyahu has dismissed those who note similarities between his relentlessly hawkish views and those of his late father as [...] "psychobabble". For example, David Remnick has written: [...] "To understand Bibi, {{you have to understand the}} father." ...|$|E

[...] The Ducks led by 25 at halftime, and faced little opposition in the second half. [...] According to Oregon coach Mike Bellotti the game was a [...] "good win because I think there were some questions about how Michigan was going to bounce back, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> would be competitive. [...] I think our players took that to heart." [...] With this game Michigan opened the season with two home losses, {{the first time that}} had happened since 1959. [...] It also gave them a losing streak of four games, the most in four decades. [...] Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr said [...] "We have good kids and they're hurting. [...] If losing doesn't make you hurt, you shouldn't be at Michigan." ...|$|E
