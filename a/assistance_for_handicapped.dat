40|$|D. Ed. (Educational Psychology) Particular {{prominence}} {{has been}} given worldwide since the 1920 's to educational <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> <b>handicapped</b> pupils. From the 1930 's in South Africa attention {{has been given}} to the visually, hearing and,intellectually handicapped by means of specialized teaching, but after the appearance of the Murray Report (1969) specific aid has been given to learning disabled pupils to a greater degree. This assistance has been aimed almost only at the primary school pupil and a good many pupils enter the secondary school with unsolved specific learning problems. Such pupils generally exhibit specific characteristics such as amongst others, a poor self-image, poor interpersonal relations, failure orientation, a high anxiety level and general lack of motivation [...] They generally maintain unsound relationships with their parents because such parents often do not understand their child's problems and consequently become disappointed in their apparently normal child's inability to progress scholastically according to his ability. To assist the learning disabled pupil to realise his potential to the best of his ability, a motivation programme has been compiled and used to raise his learning and achievement motivation. This programme is devised with a clear image of the learning disabled pupil in mind and also by applying the essentials of motivation. The motivation programme is devised around the theme: "I am a winner" whereby an attempt is made to raise the self concept to the central variable. are applicable: Additional to this, strategies like the following Realistic setting of goals; A positive attitude to life; The experience and acceptance of success and failure; Correct study methods...|$|E

Our method can be applied as interactive <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> visually <b>handicapped</b> people to help them passing a pedestrian crossing. Since the computation power and the storage resources of mobile devices are limited the main objective on the localization task is {{the efficiency of the}} used computer vision algorithms. The requirement on the traffic light classification is not to miss the crucial red light (reliability). We have designed a prototype for German traffic lights and realized it on a Nokia N 95.

40|$|Abstract—Visual servoing was {{introduced}} in robotics nearly 4 decades ago. However until now, there are still {{only a handful of}} known examples of application of this technique in addressing real word robotics problems such as disaster response, <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> elderly or <b>handicapped</b> people, etc. As the world is moving towards the use of robotics to improve quality of life, it is time to assess the challenges involved in applying visual servoing to solve real world problems. This paper presents an overview of these challenges, by asking the question what are the missing components for practical visual servoing? and by providing practical possible solutions for these components. Illustration of these challenges and our current practical solutions are given using our 7 -DoFs Barrett WAM Arm.

40|$|In the Netherlands {{growing numbers}} of young people and {{adolescents}} are in receipt of special education, mental health care services and benefits because of long-term illness, handicap or chronic disease. The most alarming increase is in those covered by the Disablement <b>Assistance</b> Act <b>for</b> <b>Handicapped</b> Young Persons (Wajong). In 2001, 120, 000 people received a Wajong benefit. By 2010, this had risen to almost 200, 000. This means {{that one out of}} every 20 people aged 18 (4. 8 %) is claiming and receiving this disability benefit. Key characteristics of the growing number of young people with disabilities receiving Wajong, special education and other services include early school leaving with no or little education, behavioural problems and mental health difficulties (Besseling et al, 2010). The increasing numbers of children in youth mental health care, special education, and special services for youth and their parents reflects an increase in the types of behaviour and communication disorders that are recognised as medical impairments, a wider awareness of these schemes amongst the population and the lack of incentives to exit these schemes on financial grounds. In 2009, the Minister of the Department of Social Affairs and Work informed parliament in a letter that it was expected, if policies did not change, that the Wajong numbers would double to 400, 000 by the year 2040. The old Wajong legislation has been superseded as of 1 January 2010 by the Work and Employment Support (Young Disabled Persons) Act, which {{is referred to as the}} ‘new’ Wajong. The new Act is primarily concerned with what young people with disabilities can do...|$|R
40|$|Title: Sugestion on {{database}} of sports <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> handicaped people Objective: A suggestion {{to create a}} {{database of}} sport assistants <b>for</b> <b>handicapped</b> people. The database should reflect the needs of handicapped people {{as much as possible}} and simultaneously respect assistants' real possibilities. Methods: In our thesis we used a descriptive research method of quantitative character containing some qualitative features. The research concentrated on 2 groups "users" and "assistants" via electronic online survey. Results: We found out that most of the handicapped people do not have a person with whom they could do sport activity as often as wanted. It is a reason why they do sport less. The users are willing to pay <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> more than expected. The assistants are obliging to provide more hours of assistance on the grounds of pay rise. The results offer sufficient amount of information to create a database of sport assistants <b>for</b> <b>handicapped</b> people.
