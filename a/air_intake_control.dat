The effects of <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature on HCCI combustion and emissions are investigated.

Dual-fuel HCCI combustion needs lower <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature than gasoline HCCI combustion, which reduces the requirements on heat management system. As <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature decreases, air charge increases and maximum pressure rising rate decreases. When <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature is about 55 ºC, HCCI combustion becomes worse and misfire happens. In fixed dual fuel content condition, HC and CO emission decreases as <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature increases.

5000|$|There were {{unprecedented}} Soviet {{requests for}} Western technological aid {{with the development}} of the Tu-144. The request was made despite obviously not helping to foster Soviet technological prestige, {{which was one of the}} key purposes of the Tu-144 programme. In 1977, the USSR approached Lucas Industries, a designer of the engine control system for Concorde, requesting help with the design of the electronic management system of the Tu-144 engines, and also asked BAC-Aérospatiale for assistance in improving the Tu-144 <b>air</b> <b>intakes.</b> (The design of air intakes' variable geometry and their control system was one of the most intricate features of Concorde, contributing to its fuel efficiency. Over half of the wind-tunnel time during Concorde development was spent on the design of <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> and their <b>control</b> system.) In late 1978, the USSR requested a wide range of Concorde technologies, evidently reflecting the broad spectrum of unresolved Tu-144 technical issues. The list included de-icing equipment for the leading edge of the <b>air</b> <b>intakes,</b> fuel-system pipes and devices to improve durability of these pipes, drain valves for fuel tanks, fireproof paints, navigation and piloting equipment, systems and techniques for acoustical loading of airframe and controls (to test against acoustic fatigue caused by high jet-noise environment), ways to reinforce the airframe to withstand damage, firefighting equipment, including warning devices and lightning protection, emergency power supply, and landing gear spray guards (aka water deflectors or [...] "mud flaps" [...] that increase engine efficiency when taking off from wet airstrips). These requests were denied after the British government vetoed them on the ground that the same technologies, if transferred, could be also employed in Soviet bombers.

40|$|The Thermochemical Power Group (TPG) of the University of Genoa, Italy, has {{developed}} a new flexible laboratory to study advanced energy systems based on micro gas turbine technology. In the laboratory a general-purpose experimental rig, based on a modified commercial 100 kW recuperated micro gas turbine, was installed and fully instrumented. The main objectives of the laboratory is to perform experimental activities related to gas turbine based cycles in both steady-state and transient conditions. The rig layout was defined to include the effects of interaction between the turbomachines (especially the compressor) and further components. This approach is extremely significant for innovative cycle analyses, such as recuperated, humid air, and hybrid (with high temperature fuel cells) configurations. The facility was partially funded by two Integrated Projects of the EU VI Framework Program (Felicitas and Large-SOFC) and the Italian Government (PRIN project). It was designed with a high flexibility approach including: flow control management, co-generative applications, downstream compressor volume variation, grid-connected or stand-alone operations, recuperated or simple cycles, and room temperature control. In the new EU VII Framework (E-HUB Project), the test rig has been improved with the installation of an absorption cooler to operate the system in tri-generative configuration. The layout of the whole system, including connection pipes, valves, and instrumentation (in particular mass flow meter locations) was carefully designed to measure all the significant properties with high accuracy performance. Particular attention was devoted to component design, using CFD tools (Fluent), to perform emulation tests on high temperature fuel cell hybrid systems. For this reason, the facility was equipped with a modular cathodic vessel, an anodic recirculation loop (including a vessel and an ejector), and a steam injection system for chemical composition emulation. To compare tests affected by a significant influence of the ambient temperature variation, such as the performance tests on the machine maximum electrical power and electrical efficiency or on the recuperator effectiveness, the rig was integrated with a compressor inlet temperature control system. This equipment is composed of three air/water heat exchangers located at the <b>air</b> <b>intake,</b> <b>controlled</b> valves and a variable speed pump operating in a closed loop. This circuit was designed to couple the machine air inlet with the absorption cooler. The large number of experimental data available for the high flexibility test rig design {{is also used to}} validate both steady-state (design and off-design) and transient (also real-time) theoretical models. A good level of consistency can be achieved thanks to the complete knowledge of the test rig dimensions, volumes, masses, shaft inertia, thermal capacitances, and operating procedure. Such completeness is difficult to obtain in industrial plants, where details about equipment are often missing or confidential. This facility is also essential to introduce undergraduate students to micro gas turbine technology, and Ph. D. s to advanced experimental activities in the same field. With this experimental rig, in addition to learning about the thermodynamic cycles and plant layouts, students can also become familiar with their materials, piping, gaskets, technology for auxiliaries, and instrumentation...|$|R

40|$|Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) {{is widely}} used in IC {{combustion}} engines for diluting <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> charge and <b>controlling</b> NOx emission. The rate of EGR required by an engine varies by the speed and load {{and control of the}} right amount entering the cylinders is crucial to ensure good engine performance and low NOx emission. However, controlling the amount of EGR entering the intake manifold does not ensure that EGR rate will be evenly distributed among the engine’s cylinders. This can many times lead to cylinders operating at very high or low EGR rates which contradictory can deteriorate particulate matter and NOx emission. The present study analyses the cylinder-to-cylinder EGR dispersion of a 4 cylinder 2. 2 L EUROV Diesel engine and its effects on the combustion stability. A 1 D- 3 D coupling simulation is performed using GT-Power and STAR-CCM+ to analyze the effects of intake manifold geometry and EGR supply configuration on the EGR homogeneity and cylinder to-cylinder distribution. The results confirm that the EGR supply configuration plays a key role on the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> charge homogeneity and as a result to the EGR cylinder-to-cylinder distribution and combustion stability. The turbulence flow created at the point of EGR diffusion was found to be the governing factor influencing the performance of an EGR mixer. Small air-EGR “contact” areas, Venturi shape and high pressure differences contribute towards the increase of turbulence kinetic energy at the EGR injection area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The flow {{characteristics}} of an aerator inserted on the chute with a concave surface {{is more complex}} than that of on the straight chute. The area of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> of the aerator is a very important factor which influences the cavity size of jet flow after the aerator, the air pressure in the cavity and air concentrations in high-speed flows along the chute.
