25|$|On appeal, Salaam's {{supporters}} and attorneys charged {{that he had}} been held by police without access to parents or guardians. The majority appellate court decision noted that Salaam had initially lied to police in claiming to be 16, and he had backed up his claim with a transit pass that indeed (falsely, as it turned out) indicated that he was 16. If a suspect has reached 16 years of age, his parents or guardians no longer have a right to accompany him during police questioning, or to refuse to permit him to <b>answer</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions.</b> When Salaam informed police of his true age, police permitted his mother to be present.|$|E
25|$|A {{probationary}} {{condition that}} a defendant testify under oath on all {{questions as to}} his financial condition relating to amounts and locations of all assets was upheld as legal because the defendant made a blanket refusal to <b>answer</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions,</b> and therefore {{it could not be}} shown that his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was violated by any particular question. It was ruled that a court did not abuse its discretion in requiring, as a condition of supervised release, that the defendant report financial obligations in excess of $250 incurred by his wife. The condition was held to serve a legitimate monitoring purpose in light of the defendant's history of masking his income and ownership of assets, and the financial information was also deemed necessary for evaluating the defendant's ability to meet his restitution schedule.|$|E
