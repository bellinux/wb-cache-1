Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E

The Tales of Ise implies this journey {{was the result}} of the scandalous affair between Narihira and Fujiwara no Takaiko. There are doubts as to whether this journey actually took place, from the point of view both that the number of surviving poems is quite small for having made such a trip and composing poems along the way, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical likelihood that a courtier could have gone wandering to the other end of the country with only one or two friends keeping him company.|$|E

The tiles covering the vaulted areas around each of the altars and the end wall of the nave above the chancel date to 1719 and reflect the popular national blue-on-white style of the period. One panel in the chancel represents St. James on a caravel fighting the Moors in the naval Battle of Lepanto (1571) in which Dom John of Austria defeated the Turks. The panel reflects the military and religious power of Christianity over Islam, an implicit message for {{the descendants of the}} Muslims still resident in the area and who still maintained certain Muslim traditions.|$|E

Graham's troops had beaten a French force approaching twice their number despite having marched through the previous night {{and part of that}} day. The British lost approximately 1,240 men, including Portuguese and German contingents under Graham's command, while Victor lost around 2,380. The Spanish suffered 300–400 casualties. [...] Strategically, however, the failure of the Allies to follow up their victory allowed Victor to reoccupy his siege lines; Cádiz was not relieved and the campaign effectively failed to achieve anything. [...] Victor even claimed the battle as a French victory, since the positions of the opposing sides remained unchanged following the action.|$|E

They are not yet going make a formal planning application for the plant, saying that the time is not right for such a huge investment. Dave Carlton, RWE's project manager, has said that they [...] "see the site as an important one, both for RWE npower <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK’s future power generation”, and so RWE npower have retained the site for a possible future power station. Malcolm Reid of People Against New Coal Stations, a group opposed to the power station development, said: [...] "We would now like to see Northumberland County Council re-designate the Cambois site for green, clean technology, to match what is happening at the New and Renewable Energy Centre (NaREC) in Blyth. It is a perfect area for a factory for offshore wind turbines and housing development. If Cambois is re-designated then {{the prospect of the}} area being regenerated rises colossally." ...|$|E
500|$|A broad {{historical}} {{paradigm in}} both sociology and anthropology, functionalism addresses the social structure, {{referred to as}} social organization in among the classical theorists, as a whole <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by Herbert Spencer) is to regard norms and institutions as 'organs' that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society. The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis {{in the work of}} theorists such as Marcel Mauss, Bronisław Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged. Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of social evolutionism, in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As Giddens states: [...] "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)." ...|$|E

500|$|Family, {{gender and}} {{sexuality}} form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub-fields of sociology. A {{family is a}} group of people who are related by kinship ties :- Relations of blood / marriage / civil partnership or adoption. The family unit is one of the most important social institutions found in some form in nearly all known societies. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an institution and unit of socialization, with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the nuclear family and its distinct gender roles. The notion of [...] "childhood" [...] is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula. Feminist sociology, on the other hand, is a normative sub-field that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of feminist theory is the patriarchy and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small-scale interaction <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broader social structure. Feminist sociology also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities. [...] "How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods" [...] is also a concern. Social psychology of gender, on the other hand, uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification. For example, one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood.|$|E

His works, in the words of Maynard Solomon, were [...] "...the models against which nineteenth-century romanticism measured its achievements and failures." [...] His late quartets, in particular, were considered so daunting an accomplishment that many composers after him were afraid to try composing quartets; Johannes Brahms composed and tore up 20 string quartets before he dared publish a work that he felt was worthy of the [...] "giant marching behind".|$|E

Situational understanding {{is the same as}} Level 2 SA in the Endsley model—the comprehension of the meaning of the information as integrated with each other <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual's goals.

2500|$|Beside {{the length}} of the {{syllable}}s (measured in tenths of seconds), each text syllable was evaluated in terms of its position within the word to which it belongs, defining such variables as [...] "the syllable has or has not the main accent", [...] "the syllable is or is not {{at the end of a}} word", etc., <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particular sounds produced (for instance, the syllable contains the vowel [...] "i"). The various neume elements were evaluated by attaching different duration values to them, both in terms of semiological propositions (nuanced durations according to the manner of neume writing in Chris Hakkennes’ Graduale Lagal), and in terms of fixed duration values that were based on mensuralistic notions, however with ratios between short and long notes ranging from 1 : 1, via 1 : 1.2, 1 : 1.4, etc. to 1 : 3. To distinguish short and long notes, tables were consulted that were established by Van Kampen in an unpublished comparative study regarding the neume notations according to St Gallen and Laon codices. With some exceptions, these tables confirm the short vs. long distinctions in Cardine’s 'Semiologie Gregorienne'.|$|E

2500|$|A ligand {{that can}} bind to a receptor, alter the {{function}} of the receptor, and trigger a physiological response is called an agonist for that receptor. Agonist binding to a receptor can be characterized both in terms of how much physiological response can be triggered <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concentration of the agonist that is required to produce the physiological response. High-affinity ligand binding implies that a relatively low concentration of a ligand is adequate to maximally occupy a ligand-binding site and trigger a physiological response. [...] The lower the Ki concentration is, the more likely there will be a chemical reaction between the pending ion and the receptive antigen. Low-affinity binding (high Ki level) implies that a relatively high concentration of a ligand is required before the binding site is maximally occupied and the maximum physiological response to the ligand is achieved. In the example shown to the right, two different ligands bind to the same receptor binding site. Only one of the agonists shown can maximally stimulate the receptor and, thus, can be defined as a full agonist. An agonist that can only partially activate the physiological response is called a partial agonist. In this example, the concentration at which the full agonist (red curve) can half-maximally activate the receptor is about 5 x 10−9 Molar (nM = nanomolar).|$|E
