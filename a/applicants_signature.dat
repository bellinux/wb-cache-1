They {{must be at least}} 18 years of age, have no unpardoned felony convictions, be able to read and write, and fill out an application (which itself must be notarized) which is sent to the Secretary of the Commonwealth. [...] The application used to require the <b>applicant</b> obtain <b>signatures</b> of two Virginia voters attesting to the honesty and character of the applicant; this provision has been eliminated effective July 1. The application to become a notary points out that since the persons who sign the application as voters are parties to the document, the notary who authenticates the <b>applicant's</b> <b>signature</b> cannot be either of those persons. Virginia officials request, but do not require, that the applicant include their social security number (they have also accepted Virginia drivers license numbers) on the form, for use as a unique identifier. The applicant may, by checking a box on the application, choose to remove the words [...] "in the year of Our Lord" [...] which normally appear before the year the commission is issued. While the applicant must swear that they have read the notary laws, there is no test or special knowledge required.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{openness}} which is being applied in the advanced democracies for years; it is newly started to be implementedin Turkish public administration. In this study, {{in the process of}} passing from traditional administration approach that isdominated by privacy and confidentiality to the new administration approach that is determined by transparency, accountability,participation and how much importance was given to the principle of openness in Turkish public administration will be evaluated. Throughout study, the traditional public administration structure which has privacy and state secrets understanding in a country;Turkey, in which the most important step for openness in recent years the Right of Information Acquirement in theadministration will be investigated, and this law will be evaluated whether it is a challange against the traditional structure or aregulation that was remained on the paper will be focused on. The {{purpose of this article is}} to investigate whether the law on Right of Information Acquirement is being implemented inTurkish public administration or it is just an amendment that was remained on paper. The Right of Information AcquirementLaw lays down the guidelines and procedures for individuals to exercise their right of information acquirement in accordance withthe principles of equality, neutrality and openness which are the fundamentals of democratic and transparent administration. Thelaw is applicable to the activities of public institutions and organisations, and professional organisations which have the capacityof a public institution and these institutions and organisations are obliged to take the necessary administrative and technicalmeasures to make available to the applicants all kinds of information or documents, save for those exceptions included in theLaw, and to complete applications to acquire information in an effective, swift and accurate manner. As it is mentioned in the study, the application to acquire information shall be made to the institution or organisation wherethe requested information or document is kept, with a petition comprising the name of the <b>applicant,</b> <b>signature,</b> domicile orbusiness address; and if the applicant is a legal person, comprising the title of the legal person, address, and the signature of theauthorised person and the certificate of authority. This application can be made in electronic format or by other means ofcommunication on the condition that other information to identify the person’s identity and signature or from whom the letteroriginates can be legally identified. Thus, in the petition, the information or documents requested must be clearly indicated. If, inthe information and documents requested, there is classifed information or information, disclosure of which is prohibited,together with information which can be disclosed, and if these can be extracted, the information or document in question shall beprovided to the applicant after extraction of classified or disclosure-prohibited information. This is very important because thislaw prevented the way of getting information from all state actions. In accordance with the Right of Information Acquirement, Institutions and organisations shall provide the applicant acertified copy of the document requested. In cases where providing a copy of the information or document is not possible due tothe nature of the information or document, or in cases where making a copy thereof will give harm to the original, the institutionsand organisations make sure that the applicant; Reviews the original of the document in question and takes notes, in the event ofwritten or printed documents, Listens the the information or documents in the form of audio recording, Watches the informationor documents in the form of visual recording. If it is possible to acquire the information or documents in ways other than the above, this opportunity is provided on thecondition that the document is not damaged. The institution and organisation to which the application is made may collect a feeequal to the cost of access, from the applicant for the information or documents to which access is given, to be recorded asincome in its budget. Moreover, the institutions and organisations, upon application, provide access to the requested informationor document in fifteen working days. However, in the event that the requested information or document is provided from another unit within the institution or organisation to which the application is made; the opinion of another institution andorganisation needs to be taken regarding the application; or the content of the application relates to more than one institution andorganisation, then access to the information or document is provided within thirty working days. In this case, the extension of thetime and the reason therefor are notified to the applicant in writing and before the expiration of the period of fifteen workingdays. Upon notification of the cost of access to information or documents mentioned in Article 10 by the administration to theapplicant, the period of fifteeen working days is terminated. If the applicant does not pay the fee in fifteen working days, he isdeemed to have waived his demand. Although this law is a very important step towards openness, this study shows us that, the law has not got any constitutionalprotection. This means that it can be easily be annuled by the next government. Thus, the application procedure is very long andweary, this makes people abondon from their petition. The law seems to be designed not to force people make application andthink that it is a useless procedure. Moreover, state personnel and institutions are very reluctant to give information about theiractions. In conclusion, this law is enacted with the enforcement of the European Union process, and it seems us that Right ofInformation Acquirement Law is Turkishized during the process. This means that the bureacracy for this Law is preventing publicto get information from the state institutions and if the information is given at the end, it is not a satisfactory answe...|$|R
