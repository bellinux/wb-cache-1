There were 171 out-patients; prescription details were obtained for 149. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobial drug was procaine penicillin, accounting for 33 % of antimicrobial prescriptions, followed by benzathine penicillin (31 %), <b>ampicillin</b> <b>or</b> <b>amoxicillin</b> (12 %), and cotrimoxazole (8 %). Benzathine penicillin was frequently given with other drugs, but was the sole antimicrobial agent for 31 children. Compliance with antimicrobial treatment was 52 % overall and was higher for the injectables. Prescription patterns varied from child to child, and children were often prescribed more than one antimicrobial in the same or repeat prescriptions; combining this information with compliance, 81 (54 %) of the children were estimated to have received 5 or more days of appropriate antimicrobial treatment for pneumonia. This percentage is not high, and five days were often reached after using more than one antimicrobial and after repeat visits.

40|$|Augmentin (Beecham Laboratories, Bristol, Tenn.), a {{combination}} drug {{consisting of two}} parts amoxicillin to one part clavulanic acid and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated in vitro in comparison with <b>ampicillin</b> <b>or</b> <b>amoxicillin</b> or both for its inhibitory and bactericidal activities against selected clinical isolates. Regression analysis was performed and tentative disk diffusion susceptibility breakpoints were determined. A multicenter performance study of the disk diffusion test was conducted with three quality control organisms to determine tentative quality control limits. All methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to Augmentin, although the minimal inhibitory concentrations for beta-lactamase-producing strains of both groups were, on the average, fourfold higher than those for enzyme-negative strains. Among the Enterobacteriaceae, Augmentin exhibited significantly greater activity than did ampicillin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus vulgaris, and {{about one-third of the}} Escherichia coli strains tested. Bactericidal activity usually occurred at the minimal inhibitory concentration. There was a slight inoculum concentration effect on the Augmentin minimal inhibitory concentrations. On the basis of regression and error rate-bounded analyses, the suggested interpretive disk diffusion susceptibility breakpoints for Augmentin are: susceptible, {{greater than or equal to}} 18 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 13 mm (gram-negative bacilli); and susceptible, greater than or equal to 20 mm (staphylococci and H. influenzae). The use of a beta-lactamase-producing organism, such as E. coli Beecham 1532, is recommended for quality assurance of Augmentin susceptibility testing...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{incidence}} of neonatal group B streptococcus (GBS) infection in active GBS carriers with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROMs) after penicillins and erythromycin prophylaxis. Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed to have PPROM between 2004 and 2009 inclusive were treated using erythromycin (erythromycin group), <b>ampicillin,</b> <b>amoxicillin</b> <b>or</b> co-amoxiclav (penicillin group), or no antibiotics (control group) according to department protocols depending on their gestation and their GBS status {{at the time of}} presentation. Patients receiving both erythromycin and penicillins were included in the penicillin group. The incidence of neonatal GBS infection was compared between groups categorized according to the antibiotic regime received. Results: A total of 680 women were diagnosed to have PPROM of which 85 (12. 5 %) were active GBS carriers. GBS isolates were 100 % sensitive to penicillins but only 35 % were sensitive to erythromycin. There were 16, 22, and 47 patients in the penicillin, erythromycin, and control groups, respectively. The incidence of neonatal GBS infection in the three groups was 0 %, 36 %, and 13 %, respectively, and was statistically significant (p =  0. 023). Conclusion: Penicillins are more effective than erythromycin in preventing neonatal GBS infection in women with PPROM who were active GBS carriers. Because most women do not know their GBS status at the time of PPROM and it is practically difficult to identify the active carriers before delivery, ampicillin/amoxicillin should be used as a prophylactic antibiotic for active GBS carriers and women with unknown GBS carriage status to prevent neonatal GBS infection following PPROM...|$|R

40|$|Ampicillin {{resistance}} in Haemophilus influenzae due to alterations in penicillin-binding proteins (β-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant [BLNAR]) is acquiring increasing clinical and epidemiological importance. BLNAR strains with low ampicillin MICs (0. 5 to 4 μg/ml) represent {{the majority of}} this population in Europe and the United States, but separating them from susceptible isolates is challenging. To investigate the best method to identify low-BLNAR strains, we studied the antibiotic susceptibilities of 94 clinical isolates of H. influenzae by microdilution, Etest, and disk diffusion: 25 had no resistance mechanisms (gBLNAS), 34 had mutations in the ftsI gene only (gBLNAR), 20 were β-lactamase producers only (gBLPAR), and 15 showed β-lactamase production and mutations in the ftsI gene (gBLPACR). By current CLSI breakpoints, most gBLNAR isolates were ampicillin susceptible by microdilution (76. 5 %) or by Etest (88. 2 %). Most gBLNAR strains (79. 4 %) were nonsusceptible to amoxicillin (the most widely used community antibiotic in the United States and Europe) when tested by microdilution. By Etest, 15 % of β-lactamase-positive isolates were nonresistant to <b>ampicillin</b> <b>or</b> <b>amoxicillin.</b> The poorest agreement between Etest and microdilution results was for the gBLPAR isolates (25 % for ampicillin, 15 % for amoxicillin, and 10 % for cefaclor). Low-strength disks of ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid poorly identified low-BLNAR isolates and are not recommended as a screening method. We suggest new amoxicillin breakpoints for BLNAR isolates as follows: susceptible, MIC ≤ 0. 5 μg/ml (no resistance mechanisms; pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic [PK/PD] data favorable); intermediate, MICs = 1 to 2 μg/ml (resistance mechanisms present but PK/PD data favorable), and resistant, MICs ≥ 4 μg/ml (resistance mechanisms present and PK/PD data unfavorable) ...|$|E

Foram investigadas 171 crianças com diagnóstico de pneumonia. Através de questionário foram coletadas informações referentes à prescrição médica e estimada a aderência ao tratamento de 149 crianças. Os antimicrobianos mais comumente prescritos foram penicilina procaína (33 %), penicilina benzatina (31 %), ampicilina ou amoxacilina (12 %) e cotrimoxazol (8 %). Embora tenha sido freqüente a associação de antimicrobianos com outros medicamentos, tratamento exclusivo com penicilina procaina foi prescrito para 31 crianças. A aderência ao uso de antimicrobianos foi de 52 %, tendo sido mais elevada para os pacientes tratados exclusivamente com medicação injetável. As prescrições médicas combinaram, muitas vezes, diferentes antimicrobianos durante o mesmo tratamento. A análise das diferentes associações antimicrobianas revelou que apenas 81 (54 %) crianças receberam tratamento apropriado, por período de cinco ou mais dias. Conclui-se que a identificação de antimicrobianos que possam resultar na maior aderência ao tratamento permanece como um dos principais desafios no manejo ambulatorial das pneumonias nas crianças.

MethodsThree barrier membranes, including expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane, collagen membrane, and glycolide fiber membrane, were loaded with tetracycline <b>or</b> <b>amoxicillin.</b> The adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans onto the GTR membranes with or without antibiotics was analyzed using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. ResultsThe SEM analysis showed no apparent alteration in the physical structure of the membranes loaded with antibiotics. Both S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans attached best on the collagen membranes, followed by the ePTFE membranes, and then the glycolide fiber membranes without antibiotics. Moreover, higher numbers of bacteria were observed on the fibril areas than on the laminar areas of the ePTFE membranes. The amounts of attached bacteria on the GTR membranes increased after longer incubation. Incorporation of tetracycline <b>or</b> <b>amoxicillin</b> greatly reduced the adhesion of S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans onto all of the GTR membranes examined. ConclusionIncorporation of tetracycline <b>or</b> <b>amoxicillin</b> greatly reduced adhesion of S. mutans or A. actinomycetemcomitans on the ePTFE, glycolide fiber, or collagen membranes.
