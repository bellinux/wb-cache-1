In response, United Verde began {{reducing}} its work force; UVX operated at a loss, and the third big mine, Verde Central, closed completely. The price of copper fell further in 1932 to 5 cents a pound, leading to layoffs, temporary shut-downs, <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> reductions in the Verde District. In 1935, the Clark family sold United Verde to Phelps Dodge, and in 1938 UVX went out of business.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} who needed additional funds for education or vied for political office found farming as a decent profession which, although humble, was not {{looked down upon}} by fellow gentrymen. Wealthy nobles, officials, and merchants could own land, but they often did not cultivate it themselves and merely acted as absentee landlords while living in the city. They mostly relied on poor tenant farmers (diannong 佃農) who paid rent {{in the form of}} roughly fifty percent of their produce in exchange for land, tools, draft animals, and a small house. Wage laborers (gunong 雇農) and slaves were also employed on the estates of the wealthy, although they were not as numerous as tenants. During Western Han, the small independent owner-cultivator represented the majority of farming peasants, yet their economic struggle to remain independent during times of war, natural disaster and crisis drove many into debt, banditry, slavery, and dramatically increased the number of landless tenants by late Eastern Han. The social status of poor independent owner-cultivators was above tenants <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> laborers, yet below that of wealthy landowners. While wealthy landowners employed tenants <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> laborers, landowners who managed small to medium-sized estates often acted as managers over their sons who tilled the fields and daughters who weaved clothes and engaged in sericulture to produce silk for the home or sale at market.|$|E

In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be more eager {{to take on a}} wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers would be paid a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E

He wrote several biographies; his works on Johan Sverdrup and Henrik Ibsen spanned several volumes each. He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles of peasants <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> labourers as historical agents who found their place in an expanding notion of the Norwegian nation. He was also interested in the United States and its history, and was a pioneer in Norway in this respect.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E

5|$|The {{agricultural}} {{sector of the}} English economy, still by far the largest, was transformed by the Black Death. With the shortage of manpower after the Black Death, wages for agricultural labourers rapidly increased and continued to then grow steadily throughout the 15th century. As their incomes increased, labourers' living conditions and diet improved steadily. A trend for labourers to eat less barley and more wheat and rye, and to replace bread in their diet with more meat, had been apparent since before the Black Death, but intensified during this later period. Nonetheless, England's much smaller population needed less food {{and the demand for}} agricultural products fell. The position of the larger landowners became increasingly difficult. Revenues from demesne lands were diminishing as demand remained low <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> costs increased; nobles were also finding it more difficult to raise revenue from their local courts, fines and privileges in the years after the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Despite attempts to increase money rents, {{by the end of the}} 14th century the rents paid from peasant lands were also declining, with revenues falling as much as 55% between the 1380s and 1420s.|$|E
