FCA has invested heavily in plants ($2 billion, not including engineering of the engines themselves). The engine was initially named [...] "Phoenix", but the name was changed before the official launch due to a trademark conflict; the Pentastar name is derived from the now-defunct trademark of the former Chrysler Corporation, which dates back to 1963. The Pentastar was introduced at the 2009 New York Auto Show. The engine design also allows the use of E85 or 87 octane fuel, supports cylinder deactivation, and features dual variable valve timing. The Pentastar engine currently does not use EGR [...] however it not only supports the use of the technology but is expected to add it in a near-term engine update known as the [...] "2016 Pentastar". Both Direct Injection as well as forced air induction options were engineered into the Pentastar engine's design, however, like cylinder deactivation, these have not yet been implemented from the factory and remain [...] "on the shelf" [...] at this time.|$|E

40|$|In serial {{production}} of components for automotive {{applications such as}} cooling and air-conditioning systems, <b>aluminium</b> <b>die-cast</b> material is frequently used due to its excellent castability. The aim of providing light weight components can be approached with thin walled cross sections even for complex structural parts. However, cast components are usually connected to semi-finished products, such as profiles or tubes. The connections have to be mostly pressure tight. The joining technique for those applications has to be highly productive to obtain high component outcome as well as cost-efficient. Laser beam welding techniques are especially suitable for those tasks. Die-cast components have limited or no weldability due to their manufacturing process. Reasons for that are entrapped gases within pores or cavities under high pressure conditions. Furthermore, the mold release agents forthe die-cast process are inappropriate for obtaining homogeneous and sound weld seams. Consequently, a high {{amount of pores in}} the weld seam and stochastic melt pool blow-outs occur, which prohibit mostly the use of the component. To solve these issues a new welding technique, remoweld®T, has been developed at Fraunhofer IWS. The unique method has been extensively tested and transferred to serial-production. The decisive step was to use laser sources with brilliant beam quality in combination with a high frequency beam oscillation within the melt pool. In this paper the technological approach will be presented. With the remoweld®T method it was possible to obtain homogeneous weld seams with low porosity and a strongly reduced distortion for the first time. Minor component tolerances and a reproducible joining technique with a high output for {{serial production}} can be achieved...|$|E

40|$|Non-destructive testing using {{ultrasonic}} measurement {{is used to}} ensure the quality of the die-casting products. The quality of a casting depends on the presence of discontinuities such as porosity and on the final metallurgical structure. Discontinuities occurring in the sub-surface of the cast structure mostly have irregular surfaces which scatter the ultrasound waves and make ultrasonic testing more difficult. The effective use of ultrasonic testing for inspection of castings depends greatly upon the skills and expertise of the operator. However, the initial experimental set-up is important to develop a proper inspection procedure that is easily understood by the operators. The aim of the present work is to investigate and develop an automated ultrasonic inspection system for detecting sub-surface defects in <b>aluminium</b> <b>die-casting</b> parts. Two sample test cases were selected from the industrial partners. Ultrasonic immersion testing was carried out on the sample parts using different probes situated at different water path distances to obtain the best possible signal from the defect.

40|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>die-casting</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{automotive}} industry. Brackets, engine blocks, wheels and suspension arms etc. are typical applications. Due to the gases contained in the melt, more or less spherical pores arise in the cast components during the cooling procedure, usually with a higher concentration in the middle. The distribution of the pores depends both on the casting condition and on {{the form of the}} components and is stochastic. In the past, the simple way is often chosen for the fatigue life estimation of aluminium die-casting: The fatigue strengths of the material, e. g. in the form of S-N curves, are determined by an unnotched specimen which are then used in the fatigue calculation. However, the application of these data to real components with notches leads in many cases to fatigue life estimations which are by far too conservative. In the present paper a simple geometrical model of pores is presented. Using this model, the notch stress caused by a pore can be estimated. The behaviour of pores in a real component with notches will be treated. It will be shown that the mentioned conservative nature of the fatigue life prediction and the apparent notch insensitivity of <b>aluminium</b> <b>die-casting</b> {{can be explained by the}} facts that the stress distribution in a real component, contrary to an unnotched specimen, is inhomogeneous and that the porosity density on the surface is often low...|$|R

40|$|Gross {{cracking}} of die-casting dies with inferior toughness sometimes occurs through too low preheating temperature and/or {{too slow}} cooling during quenching.

The decrease in energy absorption with increasing cooling time between 800 °C and 500 °C at both ambient temperature and 200 °C was pronounced. At ambient temperature, the decrease in total energy was a consequence of a decrease in initiation energy whereas, at 200 °C, the decrease in total energy was due to a decrease in propagation energy. The present investigation does not explain the decrease in toughness with increasing cooling time between 800 °C and 500 °C.

Design/methodology/approach: The studies were performed on the specimens which were cut from the failed prematurely die along the three axes of the coordinate system (X-axe was parallel to the cracks direction). Macroscopic, metallographic, SEM and dilatometric examination were made. Findings: Surface cracks of die are parallel to the microstructural banding orientation. Differences in the values of thermal expansion coefficient determined along the three axes of the coordinate system probably promote cracks propagation direction. Research limitations/implications: Studies were performed on the single prematurely failed die for economic reason.

40|$|Automotive quality {{demands are}} getting higher every year. Aluminium die-castings are {{especially}} important {{components in the}} automotive industry because of their light weight, rigidity, good corrosion resistance and heat dissipation. Since the pressure die-casting process {{is a very complex}} procedure, there must also be a number of quality controls to avoid dimensional, internal and surface defects. The dimensional and internal objective quality controls are already implemented on in-line real time production. As for the surface quality control of die-castings only subjective visual control of the worker is used. This subjective visual control of surface is substituted with objective surface quality control by the laser control system. The laser control system acquires the three-dimensional (3 D) data by the principle of laser triangulation and analyses the surface defects by LACO (Laser Casting Control) analysis. 3 D data representing the measured surface of the die-casting is statistically analyzed and evaluated. It is capable of detecting the most common die-casting surface defects, such as laminations, cold shuts, non-fills, stains and imprints. We found that the LACO system satisfies the requirements for detecting surface defects on diecastings. Combined with the dimensional and internal quality controls, it is a good way of obtaining a total automatic quality inspection with records of die-castings in real time production.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} inter-bar current effects on induction motors with <b>die-cast</b> <b>aluminium</b> and <b>die-cast</b> copper rotors. The parasitic effects introduced by these currents are analyzed and possible solutions to these problems are presented. This is realized by developing analytical tools for the simulation of inter-bar current effects. The methods used are verified by measurements on prototype machines. It is shown that the inter-bar currents can have a considerable effect on the motor starting performance, which {{can result in a}} reduced pull-out torque. At rated operation, this is seen as increased harmonic rotor currents, having a negative effect on the motor performance. Results from calorimetric measurements show, that the efficiency gained when substituting a skewed <b>die-cast</b> <b>aluminium</b> rotor with a skewed die-cast copper rotor, is less than the theoretical expectation. It is shown that this is a result of a reduced power factor for the copper rotor. High inter-bar currents are believed to be the origin of this effect, increasing the harmonic content in the rotor magnetomotive force. This would be seen as an increased rotor leakage reactance. Results from locked-rotor tests, and simulations using measured values of inter-bar resistance, support this theory. It is shown, that these negative effects are suppressed to a negligible level by the use of an unskewed rotor, but to the expense of a large synchronous torque at a low speed. By using a modulated rotor concept, having an asymmetrical rotor slot distribution, an unskewed rotor is designed to reduce this parasitic torque. Measurements on a prototype machine show that the modulated rotor suppresses both the inter-bar currents and the synchronous torque, resulting in an improved starting performance, without any significant change of the motor efficiency. The presented results strengthen the potential of the modulated rotor concept, introducing new possibilities for the reduction of negative effects appearing in induction machines.

40|$|Tools for {{machining}} {{are made}} of hard steels and cemented carbide (WC-Co). For specialized applications, such as aluminium machining, diamond or polycrystalline cubic boron nitride are also used. The main problem with steel, is that it exhibits a relatively low hardness (below 10 GPa) which strongly decreases upon annealing above about 600 K. Thus, the majority of modern tools are nowadays coated with hard coatings that increase the hardness, decrease the coefficient of friction and protect the tools against oxidation. A similar approach has been recently used to obtain a longer duration of the dies for <b>aluminium</b> <b>die-casting.</b> Multi-component and nanostructured materials represent a promising class of protective hard coatings due to their enhanced mechanical and thermal oxidation properties. Surface properties modification is {{an effective way to}} improve the performances of materials subjected to thermo-mechanical stress. Three different thin hard nitrogen-rich coatings were mechanically, microstructurally, and thermally characterized: a 2. 5 micron-thick CrN-NbN, a 11. 7 micron-thick TiAlN, and a 2. 92 micron-thick AlTiCrxNy. The CrN-NbN coating main feature is the fabrication by the alternate deposition of 4 nm thick-nanolayer of NewChrome (new type of CrN, with strong adhesion and low coating temperature). All the three coatings can reach hardness and elastic modulus in excess of 20, and 250 GPa, respectively. Their main applications include stainless steel drawing, plastic materials forming and extrusion and aluminum alloys die-casting. The here studied TiAlN (SBN, super booster nitride) is one of the latest evolution of TiAlN coatings for cutting applications, where maximum resistance to wear and oxidation are required. The AlTiCrxNy combines the very high wear resistance characteristic of the Cr-coatings and the high thermal stability and high-temperature hardness typical of Al-containing coatings. All the coatings were deposited on a S 600 tool steels. The coatings were subjected to two different thermal cycling tests: one for 100 thermal cycles consisting of 60 s dwelling time, respectively at the high- (573 to 1173 K) and at the room-temperature, a second for 100 thermal cycles consisting of 115 s dwelling time, at same temperatures of the first test, followed by 5 s dwelling at room-temperature. The investigated coatings showed a sufficient-to-optimal thermal response in terms of stability of hardness, elastic modulus, and oxidation behavior.

40|$|Recycling play a {{key role}} on saving of natural {{resources}} and on reducing pollution. The recycling of aluminium alloys is also cost-effective, since it reduce the material cost and creates a considerable energy-saving. The use of recycled Al alloys (usually called secondary) has improved in recent years also because of their comparable mechanical properties with primary aluminium alloys. During the production of secondary aluminium alloys, the scrap are mixed regardless of their specific chemical composition, and then master alloys or pure elements are added to the molten metal. Furthermore, certain impurity elements are either difficult or expensive to remove, and their role in mechanical properties can be important. Due to the presence of these additional trace elements, a number of complex intermetallic phases can therefore form in multi-component Al-Si alloys. Mechanical and physical properties of alloys and castings are strongly related to sizes, morphologies and distribution of these intermetallic phases, which are in turn a function of alloy composition and cooling rate. The Al–Si based alloys are transversally used in different foundry processes. Among all the technologies, high-pressure die-casting (HPDC) represents the most common process to produce automotive components by secondary Al–Si alloys because it allows one to increase the production by lowering the cycle time and to obtain economically components with complex geometries and high quality surface. The effects of trace elements and intermetallics phases on features of aluminium castings are still not fully understood, especially when components are made by means of HPDC process. The motivation of the research presented in this doctoral thesis was, therefore, to fill this gap in knowledge. The study has aimed at understanding the influence of various trace elements on the microstructure and mechanical properties of secondary <b>die-cast</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloys and, in particular, on secondary AlSi 9 Cu 3 (Fe) die-cast alloys. A literature review and a sufficient background of previously reported results on the influence of trace elements on the features of aluminium alloys as well as the formation of intermetallic phases were carried out. It was found that the mechanical and microstructural analysis generally referred to primary cast Al alloys with low concentration of trace elements outside of those studied. Furthermore the samples were usually produced on gravity die-cast, while some intermetallics phases were frequently observed in high-pressure die-casting, where higher cooling rates and different feeding conditions exist. Special attention has been given to: The effects of Bismuth addition on secondary <b>die-cast</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloys: Bismuth substitute the lead in free-cutting wrought Al alloys, and this is leading to a steady increase of Bi content in secondary Al alloys due to the recycling process. The nucleation temperature of primary Fe-rich intermetallic compounds, as function of Fe, Mn and Cr content and cooling rate: Fe-rich phases have a high specific gravity and tend to segregate to the bottom of aluminium melts and holding furnaces. These phases form primary solid particles, generally called sludge, thus reduce the effective capacity of the furnace. The influence of Fe, Mn and Cr addition, separately or in combination, on the microstructural and mechanical characteristics of secondary <b>die-cast</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloys: sludge crystals are hard and brittle compact inclusions which can compromise the machining operations, with a considerable effects on the cutting tool life, and even more degrade the mechanical and physical properties of the component.
