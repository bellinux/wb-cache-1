The song contains an ascending bridge {{incorporated into the}} chorus, which consists of the lines: [...] "If you're ready for me boy / You'd better push the button <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> / Before I get the wrong idea and go." [...] Lyrically, the song is about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. [...] Joe Macare of Stylus Magazine described Buena's delivery of the lyric [...] "my sexy ass" [...] as [...] "carefree", and noted that the lyrics adapt an [...] "idiosyncratic approach" [...] to the English language. Musically, [...] "Push the Button" [...] received comparisons {{to the sound of}} pop group ABBA.|$|E

500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> {{what he was thinking}} without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April 1801, Nelson began to advance into Copenhagen harbour. The battle began badly for the British, with , [...] and [...] running aground, {{and the rest of}} the fleet encountering heavier fire from the Danish shore {{batteries}} than had been anticipated. Parker sent the signal for Nelson to withdraw, reasoning:I will make the signal for recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in a condition to continue the action he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be attached to him. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: [...] "I told you to look out on the Danish commodore <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> when he surrendered. Keep your eyes fixed on him." [...] He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes." [...] He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said [...] "I really do not see the signal." [...] The battle lasted three hours, leaving both Danish and British fleets heavily damaged. At length Nelson dispatched a letter to the Danish commander, Crown Prince Frederick, calling for a truce, which the Prince accepted. Parker approved of Nelson's actions in retrospect, and Nelson was given the honour of going into Copenhagen the next day to open formal negotiations. At a banquet that evening, he told Prince Frederick that the battle had been the most severe he had ever been in. The outcome of the battle and several weeks of ensuing negotiations was a 14-week armistice, and on Parker's recall in May, Nelson became commander-in-chief in the Baltic Sea. As a reward for the victory, he was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, on 19 May 1801. In addition, on 4 August 1801, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk, this time with a special remainder to his father and sisters. Nelson had sailed to the Russian naval base at Reval (now Tallinn) in May, and there learned that the pact of armed neutrality was to be disbanded. Satisfied with the outcome of the expedition, he returned to England, arriving on 1 July.|$|E

One is “No litter”; anyone caught littering, {{and that includes}} cigarette butts, will not be invited back to hunt on Bradley 3 land. She insists that guests treat her as a friend, not as a business associate, and that they stay in communication: “We have a busy ranch, so I like to have hunters call ahead of time <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> when they’ll be there. All of my hunters are great at communicating when they plan on being out and are always quick {{to let me know}} if they see any problems on the ranch.” ...|$|E

[...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I {{just want you to}} know that I was thinking about you and Dr. King. If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me."

60|$|As I {{sat here}} {{looking around for}} an idea {{it struck me that}} I was called for two reasons.

The other reason that I can see is that you have called me to show by way of contrast what education can accomplish if administered in the right sort of doses.|$|R

[...] During the Battle of Copenhagen Phillimore {{had been sent to}} Parker's flagship, the 90-gun [...] to take his examination. He served as the Londons acting-signal lieutenant during the battle, sending Parker's famous signal for Nelson to withdraw. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: 'I told you to look out on the Danish commodore <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> when he surrendered.

He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said 'I really do not see the signal.' [...] Phillimore returned to the Edgar after the battle, where he learnt that the Edgars first lieutenant had been killed in the engagement. A round of general promotions of the junior officers followed, and Phillimore was promoted to lieutenant.|$|E

In one incident, after receiving a complaint from Steve Jobs of Apple, Schmidt sent an email to Google's HR people saying; [...] "I believe we have a policy of no recruiting from Apple and this is a direct inbound request.

Under Schmidt, there was a [...] "Do Not Call list" [...] of companies Google would avoid recruiting from. According to a court filing, another email exchange shows Google's human resources director asking Schmidt about sharing its no-cold call agreements with competitors.
