5|$|New Hampshire {{was to be}} {{the fourth}} Montana-class battleship, and was to be named in honor of the ninth state. She was {{assigned}} to the New York Navy Yard, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the third ship to bear that name had she been commissioned.|$|E
5|$|A second range stood {{along the}} north-west wall, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{connected}} to the hall range by the donjon tower. The ground floor housed a kitchen. In 1725 the range was remodelled into a two-storey house, accessed via a stone stair, and topped with the dormer windows which now form part of the gatehouse. The well in front is original, although the large stone surround is of 19th century date.|$|E
5|$|Gelimer {{was given}} an ample estate in Galatia, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> raised to patrician rank {{if he had not}} steadfastly refused to renounce his Arian faith. Belisarius was also named consul ordinarius for the year 535, {{allowing}} him to celebrate a second triumphal procession, being carried through the streets seated on his consular curule chair, held aloft by Vandal warriors, distributing largesse to the populace from his share of the war booty.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2013, Gaffney {{suffered}} serious {{head injuries}} {{when a car}} he was travelling in collided with the central reservation on the A38 in Derby. Gaffney admitted he <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> wearing his seat belt {{at the time of}} the accident, and said [...] "It could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a lot worse. One inch down <b>and</b> I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> blind. [...] One inch up <b>and</b> I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> brain damaged." ...|$|R
5|$|In April 2011, {{after many}} years of {{proposals}} and delays, construction began on a major upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange. An underpass was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very costly, and was subsequently scrapped. The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier left and right turns, speeding up queue times. Cycle paths and safer pedestrian crossings were included.|$|E
5|$|On July 26, 2011, Forcier {{announced}} that he had committed to play football at San Jose State University <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> eligible to play there in 2012. On January 9, 2012, however, Forcier withdrew from the San Jose State football program. Although he was expected to be the starting quarterback for the 2012 Spartans, academics played a role in his leaving the program.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2012, American {{officials}} {{claimed that}} they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253. American officials stated that the attack would have involved a more sophisticated bomb, also planted in undergarments, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> deployed near {{the anniversary of the}} killing of Osama Bin Laden. Officials did not state whether any persons had been arrested or charged in their operation.|$|E

5|$|Scholarly {{consideration}} of the likely outcome of invasion, including the 1974 Royal Military Academy Sandhurst war game, agree that while German forces {{would have been able}} to land and gain a significant beachhead, intervention of the Royal Navy would have been decisive and, even with the most optimistic assumptions, the German army would not have penetrated further than GHQ Line <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> defeated.|$|E
5|$|The Avro 732 was a 1956 {{proposal}} for a supersonic development of the Vulcan <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> powered by 8 de Havilland Gyron Junior engines. Unlike the proposed Avro 721 low-level bomber of 1952 or the Avro 730 supersonic stainless steel canard bomber dating from 1954 (cancelled in 1957 before completion of the prototype), the Type 732 showed its Vulcan heritage.|$|E
5|$|The {{hotel was}} {{scheduled}} to open in June 1989 for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, but problems with building methods and materials delayed completion. Had it opened on schedule, it would have surpassed the Westin Stamford Hotel to become the world's tallest hotel, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the seventh-tallest building in the world.|$|E

5|$|The walled {{garden to}} the {{north-east}} {{was built in}} 1708 by Alexander McGill, to designs by the Earl of Mar, who also designed the gate piers and garden buildings, and supplied statuary. The garden may have been balanced by a similar walled garden to the south-east of the house. No trace is now visible, but a second garden is shown on 18th century maps of the area, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> consistent with Bruce's symmetrical layout.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the post-medieval period, the tower was {{deliberately}} damaged to put it beyond military use, a process called slighting. This probably occurred {{towards the end of the}} English Civil War, after the defeat of the Royalist forces in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone. The tower was then owned by Sir John Rayney of Wrotham Place, a Royalist, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an effective lookout tower in any future conflict. There appears to have been an attempt to bring down the whole tower by damaging the stair turret at its base, possibly using gunpowder, which failed due to the spiral staircase's unusually strong design. After this the upper storey of the tower was carefully removed instead, leaving the building roofless.|$|E

5|$|Harry's Walls are {{the remains}} of an {{unfinished}} artillery fort, started in 1551 {{by the government of}} Edward VI to defend the island of St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly. Constructed to defend the harbour of Hugh Town from possible French attack, the fortification incorporated Italianate-style bastions with protective orillons <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the most advanced design in the kingdom at the time. It was not completed, probably due to a shortage of funds and the passing of the invasion threat, and only the south-west side remains. In the 21st century, Harry's Walls are managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Australia {{won their}} first two gold medals, the first time any {{southern}} hemisphere country had won an event. Australia's maiden gold came in highly unlikely circumstances. Steven Bradbury, {{a member of the}} bronze-winning 1994 relay team, won gold in short track speed skating on 17 February when all of his competitors in the 1,000m final crashed out on the final turn while jostling for the medal positions. He had qualified for the final after benefiting from similar incidents and disqualifications in the quarter and semifinals. Bradbury came third in his quarterfinal <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> eliminated, but world champion Marc Gagnon was disqualified for obstruction and the Australian progressed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found that the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the graves, several buildings stood within the cemetery. A larger rectangular structure with an east-west alignment, identified from postholes left in the ground, stood on the east side. It has been interpreted as a chapel or shrine. A smaller grubenhaus – a type of sunken building – which {{is thought to have}} been used as a mortuary chapel was located close by in the central area of the cemetery. An Iron Age roundhouse had also once been located within the north-west quadrant but was no longer standing at the time the cemetery was laid out. All of these buildings would have stood on the crest of a ridge, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> especially prominent to travelers arriving from the south.|$|E
5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather {{was the most}} obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E
5|$|Manning's offenses {{carried a}} maximum {{sentence}} of 90 years. The government asked for 60 {{years as a}} deterrent to others, while Manning's lawyer asked for no more than 25 years. She was sentenced on August 21 to 35 years in prison, reduction in rank to private (private E-1 or PVT), forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. She was given credit for 1,293 days of pretrial confinement, including 112 days for her treatment at Quantico, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> eligible for parole after serving one-third of the sentence. She was confined at the United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.|$|E
