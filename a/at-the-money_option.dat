40|$|In {{order to}} study the value and {{incentive}} effects of indexed, Asian and indexed Asian options in practice I use hand-collected compensation and assumption data to give a realistic representation of how the nontraditional options would differ from the standard <b>at-the-money</b> <b>option</b> without adjustments. The paper implements the data into an analysis of incentives and accumulated value of the options on {{a sample of the}} largest S&P 500 companies that issued executive stock options from 2010 to 2014. The paper employs Delta and Vega to compare the incentives created by the options, and find that the benefits from indexing are typically small. The options linked to average stock price, Asian and indexed Asian options, provide consistently higher incentives to increase stock price, but provide fewer incentives to increase volatility. Compared to earlier research, the differences in incentives created by the four options are smaller. This is mainly due to the low risk-free rates in the sample period, which reduces the number of nontraditional options that can be granted at equal cost. To analyze how the value of options change over time, the paper employs a new way of measuring the value over time, combining the value of realized and unrealized options. The results show that the traditional and Asian options provide significantly higher compensation than their indexed counterparts over the bullish sample period. The findings have important consequences for the viability of the nontraditional options, and might help explain the near uniform use of the standard <b>at-the-money</b> <b>option</b> in practice...|$|E

Furthermore, we test diffusion option pricing models by using mean–variance span-ning properties implied in the models. The spanning tests reject one-factor diffusion models, as well as the hypothesis that the underlying asset and an equally weighted option index span options.

40|$|We {{develop and}} {{implement}} a new method for maximum likelihood estimation in closed-form of stochastic volatility models. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compare a full likelihood procedure, where an option price is inverted into the unobservable volatility state, to an approximate likelihood procedure where the volatility state is replaced by the implied volatility of a short dated <b>at-the-money</b> <b>option.</b> We find that the approximation results in a negligible loss of accuracy. We apply this method to market prices of index options for several stochastic volatility models, and compare {{the characteristics of the}} estimated models. The evidence for a general CEV model, which nests both the affine model of Heston (1993) and a GARCH model, suggests that the elasticity of variance of volatility lies between that assumed by the two nested models. ...|$|E
40|$|A shout option may be {{broadly defined}} as a {{financial}} contract which can be modified by its holder according to specified rules. In a simple example, the holder could {{have the right to}} set the strike of an option equal to the current value of the underlying asset. In such a case, the holder effectively has the right to select when to take ownership of an <b>at-the-money</b> <b>option.</b> More generally, the holder could have multiple rights along these lines, in some cases with a limit placed on the number of rights which may be exercised within a given time period (e. g. four times per year). The value of these types of contracts can be estimated by solving a system of interdependent linear complementarity problems. This paper describes a general framework for the valuation of complex types of shout options. Numerical issues related to interpolation and choice of timestepping method are considered in detail.

40|$|Properly {{designed}} incentives should reward management if {{and only}} if it succeeds in increasing shareholder wealth. We show that conventional <b>at-the-money</b> stock <b>options</b> do not achieve this objective, because they allow management to benefit from value created before the options were awarded. Consequently the cost of the options can exceed any value created for shareholders, and management can even benefit from negative-NPV projects. We also find that with <b>at-the-money</b> <b>options,</b> dividends are undesirable to management unless the strike is adjusted while repurchases are quite favorable to management. These problems are solved by indexing the exercise price to the cost of capital, a type of option that has been discussed lightly in the practitioner literature. Empirical estimates reveal that the difference in value between <b>at-the-money</b> <b>options</b> and options indexed to the cost of capital is about one-quarter percent of equity value but about 42 percent of option value and about 18 percent of total compensation. This figure is positively and significantly related to measures of free cash flow and overinvestment, as predicted by the model. If options are viewed strictly as incentives, this figure suggests a substantial waste of shareholder value, but if options are viewed a...|$|R

The aim was to test directly for {{the presence or absence of}} informed trading in the options market and for the possible impact of this trading on underlying asset prices. Our findings reveal that potential informed trading in options markets is channelled basically through out-of-the-money options, except for volatility trading which mainly involves <b>at-the-money</b> <b>options</b> because of their liquidity. In both cases, we have found evidence in favour of investors' strategic fragmentation of transactions into intermediate size trades (stealth trading).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we employ the L´evy copula model to {{determine}} basket option prices. More precisely, basket option prices {{are determined by}} replacing the real basket with an appropriate approximation. For the approximate basket we determine the underlying characteristic function and hence we can derive the related basket option prices by using the Carr-Madan formula. Two approaches are considered. In the first approach, we replace the arithmetic sum by an appropriate geometric sum, whereas the second approach {{can be considered as}} a three-moments-matching method. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of our approximations; several L´evy models are calibrated to market data and basket option prices are determined. In a last part we show how our newly designed basket option pricing formula can be used to define implied L´evy correlation by matching model and market prices for basket options. Our main finding is that the implied L´evy correlation smile is flatter than its Gaussian counterpart. Furthermore, if (near) <b>at-the-money</b> <b>option</b> prices are used, the corresponding implied Gaussian correlation estimate is a good proxy for the implied L´evy correlation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new methodology for measuring and analyzing capital structure effects on option prices of individual {{firms in the}} economy. By focusing on individual firms we examine the cross sectional effects of leverage on option prices. Our methodology allows {{the market value of}} each firm’s debt to be implied directly from two contemporaneous, liquid, <b>at-the-money</b> <b>option</b> prices without the use of any historical price data. We compare Geske’s parsimonious model to the alternative models of Black Scholes (BS) (1973), Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (BCC, 1997) (stochastic volatility (SV), stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rates (SVSI), and stochastic volatility and jumps (SVJ)), and Pan (2002) (no-risk premia (SV 0), volatility-risk premia(SV), jump-risk premia (SVJ 0), volatility and jump risk premia (SVJ)) which allows state-dependent jump intensity and adopts implied state-GMM econometrics. These alternative models do not directly incorporate leverage effects into option pricing, and except for Black-Scholes these model calibrations require the use of historical prices, and many more parameters which require complex estimation procedures. The comparison demonstrates that firm leverage has significant statistical and economi...|$|E
40|$|For a {{given time}} horizon DT, this article explores the {{relationship}} between the realized volatility (the volatility that will occur between t and t+DT), the implied volatility (corresponding to <b>at-the-money</b> <b>option</b> with expiry at t+DT), and several forecasts for the volatility build from multi-scales linear ARCH processes. The forecasts are derived from the process equations, and the parameters set a priori. An empirical analysis across multiple time horizons DT shows that a forecast provided by an I-GARCH(1) process (1 time scale) does not capture correctly the dynamic of the realized volatility. An I-GARCH(2) process (2 time scales, similar to GARCH(1, 1)) is better, while a long memory LM-ARCH process (multiple time scales) replicates correctly the dynamic of the realized volatility and delivers consistently good forecast for the implied volatility. The relationship between market models for the forward variance and the volatility forecasts provided by ARCH processes is investigated. The structure of the forecast equations is identical, but with different coefficients. Yet the process equations for the variance are very different (postulated for a market model, induced by the process equations for an ARCH model), and not of any usual diffusive type when derived from ARCH. ...|$|E

40|$|Accumulating {{empirical}} {{evidence indicates that}} stock volatilities are driven {{by more than one}} latent factor. In this paper we provide additional evidence by combining FTSE 100 stock-index data and three <b>at-the-money</b> <b>option</b> series of various maturities in a Kalman filter-based QML estimation strategy of multifactor affine stochastic volatility option pricing models (see Van der Ploeg et al. (2003)). We find that the volatility dynamics can satisfactorily be described by three independent volatility factors. In line with the literature, the first factor is extremely persistent. The second factor is much quicker mean-reverting. Shocks to this factor have a half-life of 2. 5 months. The third factor is very fast mean-reverting, with shocks that have a half-life of about 10 days. We interpret the volatility factors in two ways. One interpretation is that each determines the long-term, middle-long-term and shortterm trends in the stock volatility evolution respectively. We show how each of the factors influences the prices of options of different maturities. Our second interpretation concerns their impact on the shape and dynamics of the volatility term structure. The long-memory factor appears mainly responsible for changes in the general level of the term structure. Slope changes are mainly associated with the second (but also the third) factor. Changes in the curvature of the volatility term structure are surprisingly closely related to the third factor...|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between several forecasts for the volatility built from multi-scale linear ARCH processes, and linear market models for the forward variance. This shows that the structures of the forecast equations are identical, but with different dependencies on the forecast horizon. The process equations for the forward variance are induced by the process equations for an ARCH model, but postulated in a market model. In the ARCH case, they {{are different from the}} usual diffusive type. The conceptual differences between both approaches and their implication for volatility forecasts are analysed. The volatility forecast is compared with the realized volatility (the volatility that will occur between date t and t + ΔT), and the implied volatility (corresponding to an <b>at-the-money</b> <b>option</b> with expiry at t + ΔT). For the ARCH forecasts, the parameters are set a priori. An empirical analysis across multiple time horizons ΔT shows that a forecast provided by an I-GARCH(1) process (one time scale) does not capture correctly the dynamics of the realized volatility. An I-GARCH(2) process (two time scales, similar to GARCH(1, 1)) is better, while a long-memory LM-ARCH process (multiple time scales) replicates correctly the dynamics of the implied and realized volatilities and delivers consistently good forecasts for the realized volatility.
