5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, {{though she is}} well aware of them. Over the years, she has learned how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> extends across the 12-song album.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
5|$|Higham theorises that Gregory {{believed}} {{that the end of}} the world was imminent, and that he was destined to be a major part of God's plan for the apocalypse. His belief was rooted in the idea that the world would go through six ages, and that he was living at the end of the sixth age, <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> may have played a part in Gregory's decision to dispatch the mission. Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work together for the conversion of non-Christians within their territories. He urged the conversion of the heretical Arians in Italy and elsewhere, as well as the conversion of Jews. Also pagans in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica were the subject of letters to officials, urging their conversion.|$|E

25|$|Interactions with {{computer}} science, complexity {{theory and the}} theory of formal languages.

25|$|The {{difference}} or {{distance between}} two colors is a metric {{of interest in}} color science. It allows quantified examination of <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> formerly could only be described with adjectives. Quantification of these properties is of great importance to those whose work is color critical. Common definitions {{make use of the}} Euclidean distance in a device independent color space.|$|E

25|$|From 1990 through 1994, NBC only {{televised}} the All Star Game. NBC reportedly {{wanted to}} test the appeal of hockey, having recently lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS. Shortly thereafter however, NBC would gain the broadcast television rights to the National Basketball Association (NBA) from CBS, thus {{there was a bit}} of <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> NBC no longer really needed hockey.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientist}} of the Roman period who had {{the greatest}} influence on later generations was undoubtedly the astronomer Ptolemy. He lived during the 2nd century AD, though little is known of his life. His masterpiece, originally entitled The Mathematical Collection, {{has come to the}} present under the title Almagest, as it was translated by Arab astronomers with that title. It was Ptolemy who devised a detailed description of an Earth-centered universe, <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> dominated astronomical thinking for more than 1,300 years. The Ptolemaic view of the universe endured until Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and other early modern astronomers replaced it with heliocentrism.|$|E

25|$|Spock {{advocated}} {{ideas about}} parenting that were, at the time, considered {{out of the}} mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to {{sleep through the night}} (<b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E
25|$|James S. Donnelly, Jr., a {{historian}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, {{wrote in his}} book, Landlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-century Ireland:I would draw the following broad conclusion: at a fairly early stage of the Great Famine the government's abject failure to stop or even slow down the clearances (evictions) contributed {{in a major way}} to enshrining the idea of English state-sponsored genocide in Irish popular mind. Or perhaps one should say in the Irish mind, for this was <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> appealed to many educated and discriminating men and women, and not only to the revolutionary minority...And it is also my contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what happened during {{and as a result of}} the clearances had the look of genocide to a great many Irish.|$|E
25|$|In 1876 Grassi {{investigated}} {{his native}} hometown Rovellasca {{for the high}} mortality of cats and discovered that they were heavily infected with the nematode Dochmius balsami. In 1878, while still {{a student at the}} University of Pavia, he discovered anchylostomiasis in Italy from by identifying the eggs from the faeces of infected individuals. He continued to make great impacts on the study of Anguillula intestinalis, filarial worms, Trichocephalus dispar, and Bilharzia. He was the first to show that the human dwarf tapeworm Taenia nana is able to go through its entire life cycle in one animal, without the need of an intermediate host, <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> had long been rejected. He was also the first to show that the flea Pulex serraticeps is the intermediate host of feline tapeworm Taenia elliptica. Thus he proposed that swallowing of infected fleas (for example, with milk) might be the reason for taeniasis in children. In 1879 he published a work on the life cycle of Strongyloides stercoralis, and erected the genus Strongyloides. In 1890 he, with Salvatore Calandruccio, described Dipetalonema reconditum, a non-pathogenic filarial worm of dogs, and showed that the parasite completed its development in human fleas, Pulex irritans.|$|E

500|$|The theory {{holds that}} moral reasoning, {{the basis for}} ethical behavior, has six {{identifiable}} developmental stages, each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor. [...] Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget, who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages. Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined {{that the process of}} moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime, <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.|$|E
500|$|Renaissance {{painters}} {{may also}} have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The larynx in the human throat has been called the [...] "Adam's apple" [...] because of <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam. The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein.|$|E
500|$|In a {{decaying}} mansion {{overlooking the}} Hudson River, millionaire Cyrus West approaches death. His greedy family descends upon him like [...] "cats around a canary", {{causing him to}} become insane. West orders that his {{last will and testament}} remain locked in a safe and go unread until the 20th anniversary of his death. As the appointed time arrives, West's lawyer, Roger Crosby (Tully Marshall), discovers that a second will mysteriously appeared in the safe. The second will may only be opened if the terms of the first will are not fulfilled. The caretaker of the West mansion, Mammy Pleasant (Martha Mattox), blames the manifestation of the second will on the ghost of Cyrus West, <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the astonished Crosby quickly rejects.|$|E

500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production [...] "puts a higher gloss, {{and sometimes a}} heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "Let's {{try to figure out}} why we wanted to be in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys—first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually." [...] He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, [...] "The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make {{is a long way from}} where you live." [...] Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, Glitter {{has been charged}} with {{numerous}} sexual offences. According to The Daily Telegraph's music critic, Neil McCormick, [...] "there was <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> every rock star had complete impunity to commit the crimes, the moral crimes that nobody else in society were committing" [...] and he felt that Glitter was [...] "a sexual predator who exploited the possibilities of what was there".|$|E
2500|$|The {{field of}} {{psychology}} {{has long been}} fascinated with the personality assessment of dictators, <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> resulted in an extensive personality evaluation of Kim Jong-il.
