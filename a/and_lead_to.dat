5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were {{much closer to}} those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. Amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E
5|$|A 2014 study {{examined}} the effects of combined NVC and mindfulness training on 885 male inmates of the Monroe Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washington. The training was found to reduce recidivism from 37% to 21%, and the training was estimated as having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs. The training was found to increase equanimity, decrease anger, <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> abilities to take responsibility for one's feelings, express empathy, and to make requests without imposing demands.|$|E
5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to call out the Indiana National Guard. Members of both parties accused the union leaders of trying to prevent their voters from reaching the polls. The riots made national news and public leaders began to consider them an embarrassment to the state. Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> more bloodshed.|$|E

5|$|At the Jock River, {{southwest}} of Barrhaven, deposits of sensitive leda clay presented {{a challenge in}} designing the crossing for the freeway {{as well as the}} Canadian National Railway overpass to the north. It was feared that the weight of these structures could destabilize the clay deposits beneath <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> landslides. In place of the standard heavier aggregate, lighter blast furnace slag, at half the weight, was substituted.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{called his}} ideas Nai Talim (literally, 'new education'). He {{believed}} that the Western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures. A different basic education model, he believed, would lead to better self awareness, prepare people to treat all work equally respectable and valued, <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> a society with less social diseases.|$|E

5|$|Guiteau came {{to believe}} he had lost the {{position}} {{because he was a}} Stalwart. The office-seeker decided {{that the only way to}} end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die—though he had nothing personal against the president. Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.|$|E
5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. It appears {{that this was a}} conscious {{effort on the part of}} Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> a steady decline in the fortunes of Copán.|$|E
5|$|Killer7 was Suda51's {{first game}} {{released}} outside Japan. It received polarized reviews {{due to its}} unconventional control scheme and complex noir plot. The game's score, visual style and thought-provoking story received wide praise from most critics as the best aspects of the game <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> several accolades and nominations. While some reviewers appreciated the stripped-down controls and stylized arthouse approach, others panned it as confusing and restricting. Despite these setbacks, Killer7s cult appeal led to remakes of Suda51's older works and the successful launch of No More Heroes.|$|E

The surviving ruins are protected as a scheduled monument and Grade II listed building because of their historical importance, {{but there is no}} active management.

5|$|Selenium {{interacts with}} other nutrients, such as iodine and vitamin E. The effect of {{selenium}} deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly {{in relation to}} Kashin-Beck disease. Also, selenium interacts with other minerals, such as zinc and copper. High doses of Se supplements in pregnant animals might disturb the Zn:Cu ratio <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> Zn reduction; in such treatment cases, Zn levels should be monitored. Further {{studies are needed to}} conﬁrm these interactions.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{pathogenic}} mutations {{have been}} identified in the prion-like domains of heterogeneous nuclear riboproteins hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 in familial cases of muscle, brain, bone and motor neuron degeneration. The wild-type form of all of these proteins show a tendency to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, while the pathogenic mutations exacerbate this behaviour <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> excess accumulation.|$|E

Similarly, the differential geometry of surfaces is investigated in section 2. 4 <b>and</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the concept of surface coordinates, treated in section 2. 5.

5|$|The {{alleviation}} {{of widespread}} unemployment and hunger in Poplar {{had to be}} funded from money raised by the borough itself under the Poor Law. The poverty of the borough made this patently unfair <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the 1921 conflict between government and the local councillors known as the Poplar Rates Rebellion. Council meetings were for a time held in Brixton prison, and the councillors received wide support.

5|$|The {{growth of}} Giffnock was furthered in 1905 {{by the arrival}} of the first Glasgow Corporation Tramways tram in the town. The {{addition}} of this tram link and the nearby Whitecraigs railway station helped the popularity of Giffnock as a weekend destination <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the opening of Rouken Glen park in 1906 by Archibald Corbett (later Lord Rowallan), the M.P. for Tradeston. The Giffnock tramline was one of Glasgow Corporation Tramways's most profitable routes; up to 15,000 travelled to Giffnock on a Sunday to visit Rouken Glen.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{campaign}} against the Catholic Church, hundreds of monasteries in Germany and Austria were confiscated by the Gestapo and their occupants were expelled. In 1941 the Catholic Bishop of Münster, August von Galen, publicly protested against this persecution and against Action T4, the Nazi non-voluntary euthanasia programme under which the mentally ill, physically deformed, and incurably sick were to be killed. In a series of sermons that received international attention, he criticised the programme as illegal and immoral. His sermons led to a widespread protest movement among church leaders, the strongest protest against a Nazi policy up until that point. Bormann and others called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels concluded that Galen's death would only {{be viewed as a}} martyrdom <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> further unrest. Hitler decided {{to deal with the issue}} when the war was over.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
