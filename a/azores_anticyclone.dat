Measurements of NO 2 and O 3 columns from the GOME and MOPITT {{satellite}} instruments are first used in conjunction with the GEOS-CHEM global model of transport and tropospheric chemistry to identify the major events of LRT that reach Europe {{over the course of the}} summer 2000. Model simulations are then used to examine surface O 3 observations at a European mountain site and O 3 vertical profiles over several European cities to quantify the impact of the LRT events on the European ozone distributions. Over the course of summer 2000, we identified nine major episodes of pollution transport between North America and Europe, which are in majority associated with WCB/post-frontal outflow (7 events) and zonal transport (2 events). We find that on average three episodes occur per month with the strongest ones being in June. The number and frequency of LRT events that reach Europe after leaving North America is strongly driven by the position and strength of the <b>Azores</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> After leaving North America, the plumes can either i) travel in the North American cyclones, mostly in the Warm Conveyor Belt (WCB), tracking poleward and thus reach Europe at high latitudes; ii) be transported zonally between 40 ° and 55 ° N directly to Europe; iii) be incorporated into the <b>Azores</b> <b>anticyclone</b> and reach Europe at mid-latitudes. Based on model sensitivity simulation it can be concluded that on average the North American sources of ozone contribute between 2 – 8 ppb in PBL and 10 – 13 ppb in FT.

Measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) columns from the GOME and MOPITT satellite instruments, respectively, are used in conjunction with the GEOS-CHEM global model of transport and tropospheric chemistry to identify the major events of long range transport that reach Europe over the course of summer 2000. Sensitivity model simulations are used to analyse observed O 3 distributions with respect to the impact of long range transport events. For that purpose, we used in-situ O 3 observations taken at the mountain site of Jungfraujoch as well as O 3 vertical profiles taken in the vicinity of central European cities. Over the course of summer 2000, we identified 9 major episodes of transatlantic pollution transport; 7 events are associated with transient cyclones while 2 events occur through zonal transport (e. g. by advection in the strong low-level westerly winds established in summer between the <b>Azores</b> <b>anticyclone</b> and transient cyclones). We find that on average three episodes occur per month with the strongest ones being in June. The number and frequency of long range transport events that reach Europe are driven by the position and strength of the <b>Azores</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> Model sensitivity simulations indicate that the summer mean North American O 3 contribution ranges from 3 to 5 ppb (7 – 11 %) in the planetary boundary layer and 10 to 13 ppb (18 – 23 %) in the middle and upper troposphere. During particular episodes, North American sources can result in O 3 enhancements up to 25 – 28 ppb in the layer between 800 – 600 hPa and 10 – 12 ppb in the boundary layer. The impact of the zonal transport events on O 3 distribution over Europe is more clearly seen below 700 hPa as they tend to transport pollution at lower levels while the events associated with transient cyclones {{are more likely to have}} an impact on the middle and upper troposphere (i. e. above 600 hPa). The air mass origins found in the GEOS-CHEM model are clearly confirmed by back trajectory analyses. During most of the 9 events, a strong contribution in North American O 3 is in general associated with only little European O 3 and vice-versa (in particular at the Jungfraujoch).

40|$|Abstract. The {{benefit of}} having a daily {{synoptic}} weather type catalogue and even more, a detailed catalogue for high impact weather events is well recognised by both climatolo-gist and meteorologist communities. In this way the Meteo-rological Service of Catalonia (SMC) has produced some ac-curate classifications for extreme events, such as hailstorms or strong winds (SW). Within {{the framework of the}} MEDEX project, the SMC has been collaborating to increase the level of awareness about these events. Following this line of work, the aim {{of this study is to}} characterise the SW events in Cat-alonia. According to the guidelines of the MEDEX project we worked with its SW event database for the period June 1995 to May 2004. We also used the period 2005 – 2009 to test the methodology. The methodology is based on principal com-ponent, cluster and discriminant analyses and applied to four variables: SLP, temperature at 850 hPa and geopotential at 500 hPa on a synoptic-scale and local gust wind. We worked with ERA-Interim reanalysis and applied discriminant anal-ysis to test the quality of the methodology and to classify the events of the validation period. We found seven patterns for the SW events. The strongest event corresponds to NW-Flow with the <b>Azores</b> <b>Anticyclone</b> and the passing of a low pressure through the Pyrenees.

The higher part of the air mass observed comes from the wet subtropics while the lower part comes from the midlatitudes. Both are advected by the <b>Azores</b> <b>anticyclone,</b> encounter cold temperatures (∼ 205 K) above the North Atlantic Ocean, and flow eastward along the anticyclonic flank of the polar jet stream. A simulation of this cloud by an isentropic model is tested to see if synoptic-scale atmospheric structures could explain by itself the presence of such clouds. The developments made in the Modélisation Isentrope du transport Méso-échelle de l'Ozone Stratosphérique par Advection (MIMOSA) model to take into account the three phases of water and their interactions allow reproduction of the occurrence of the cirrus and its temporal evolution. MIMOSA-H 2 O reproduces the atmospheric water vapor structures observed with Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) with, however, an apparent wet bias of around 50 %. Reliable water vapor fields appear to be the main condition to correctly simulate such cirrus clouds. The model reproduces the cirrus cloud altitude for fall speeds around 1 cm/s and gives ice water content around 3 – 4 mg/m 3. Fall speed is also a critical parameter, and a better parameterization with altitude or other atmospheric conditions in the modeling of such cirrus clouds is required.

40|$|The Mediterranean basin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{sensitive}} regions in the world regarding climate change and air quality. This is partly due to the singular dynamical situation of the Mediterranean basin that leads to tropospheric-ozone concentrations that are among the highest over the Northern Hemisphere. Six years of summertime tropospheric ozone observed by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument from 2007 to 2012 have been analysed to document the variability of ozone over this region. The satellite observations have been examined together with meteorological analyses (from ECMWF) to understand the processes driving this variability. Our work confirmed the presence of a steep west–east ozone gradient in the lower troposphere with the highest concentrations observed over the eastern part of the Mediterranean basin. This gradient is mainly explained by diabatic convection over the Persian Gulf during the Indian monsoon season, which induces an important subsidence of ozone-rich air masses from the upper to the lower troposphere over the central and the eastern Mediterranean basin. IASI observations of ozone concentrations at a 3 km height show a clear summertime maximum in July that is well correlated to the maximum of downward transport of ozone-rich air masses from the upper troposphere. Even if this feature is robust over the six analysed years, we have also investigated monthly ozone anomalies – one positive (June 2008) and one negative (June and July 2009) – using daily IASI observations. We show that the relative position and the strength of the meteorological systems (<b>Azores</b> <b>anticyclone</b> and Middle Eastern depression) present over the Mediterranean are key factors in explaining both the variability and the anomalies of ozone in the lower troposphere in this region...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{negative}} features of Poland’s climate is the periodic occurrence of atmospheric droughts. The most frequent source of this phenomenon is the occurrence of long-term (sometimes lasting several weeks) rainless periods. The occurrence of these periods is connected with the persistence of a stationary east European high that joins with the <b>Azores</b> <b>anticyclone</b> via central Europe. In such situations, with the accompanying lack or insufficiency of atmospheric precipitation, a drought begins to develop gradually. First, a soil drought appears, followed by hydrologic drought. During a hydrologic drought, {{a decrease in the}} ground water flow into surface waters is observed, among other phenomena. This results in the reduction of water flow in rivers. During such periods, a significant drop in the level of underground waters, as well as drying of some springs and small water courses, is observed. In its initial phase of development, a drought exerts its first negative effects on crops. Intensification of this phenomenon also causes disturbances in other sectors of the national economy. Droughts and their negative results do not pose the same threat to all areas of Poland, although in general the influence of droughts is stronger here than in the majority of central European countries.

Furthermore, and importantly, this thesis provides additional verification of this largely untapped data source for scientific purposes. 	Such is the recent nature of this field that the logbook data required careful translation and manipulation before they could be used in climatological studies and a significant element of the thesis is devoted therefore to the important question of data verification and treatment. 	Indices were derived from the logbook data that described the wind patterns in the areas north and south of the <b>Azores</b> <b>anticyclone,</b> taking the form of vectors combining wind force and direction. These indices were developed at monthly resolution (although the original logbook data are presented in daily form on CD 1, which accompanies this thesis) and also aggregated up to annual resolution. The indices showed good agreement with accepted climatological theory and the general character of wind flows in the two constituent sub-regions noted above could be identified at this scale of resolution for the very first time. 	Studies were developed using independently derived indices, including a grid-based North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), the Central England Temperature series (CET), the England and Wales Precipitation series (EWP) and sunspot number, which were selected for their coverage of the study period at monthly resolution. A number of significant correlations were found between the logbook indices and also between the latter and the ‘independent’ series. Some of these, such as those between airflow and the Central England Temperature series were not unexpected, but welcome nonetheless by conforming to climatological theory. Others, however, especially those suggesting a solar signal in the climate record were new and more challenging. These require additional research, much of it beyond the scope of this thesis, and provide an inviting pointer for future studies using this demonstrably valuable data source...|$|E

The field observations show that the limestone tuffs precipitation is nowadays residual and radiocarbon dating of Portuguese deposits points to a chronological framework for their formation starting {{in the beginning of the}} post-Younger Dryas climatic recovery and ending around 2. 5 ky BP. The oxygen stable isotopes data show a gradual change in the tuffs isotopic signature through the time interval during which the system remained active, without any particular record of climate events such as the 8. 2 ka. The available data and those from monitored modern pluvial characteristics allow the speculation on the parameters controlling the limestone tuffs deposition on both northern and southern sides of the Gibraltar Strait during the Holocene. The carbonate deposition on fluvial systems, such as the studied ones, probably depends on the precipitation / evaporation balance leading to the availability and turbulence of the flowing water along the streams.

40|$|The Mediterranean {{region is}} known to be {{characterized}} by a high spatial and temporal variability of precipitations. Precipitations fluctuations in time and space are due to a large spectrum of processes from climate dynamics to droplet formation. Because of its latitude (between 36 ° and 44 ° N) the Mediterranean region is affected by sub-tropical storm as well as mid-latitude synoptic disturbances. Hence the summer is warm and dry while being persistently affected by the <b>Azores</b> <b>anticyclone</b> and the winter is temperate and moderately humid because of the mid-latitude westerlies. Moreover since the Mediterranean is surrounded by mountain barriers, and strong contrasts between sea and continent exist, local forcing is also important. Our work aims at examining the environmental conditions and precipitation structures of storms observed in these regions and at improving our knowledge about the life-cycle of the more intense events and processes that govern their evolution. It uses observations gathered by the X band polarimetric & Doppler weather Radar HYDRIX. This radar, owned by the LATMOS/CNRS, developed and operated by NOVIMET, collects in an operational way since 2008 reflectivity, Doppler and polarimetric data with a time step and a spatial resolution of 5 minutes and 1 km respectively. In addition to these data, derived products such as instantaneous rainfall, cumulated rain, cell displacement and hydrometeor classification are obtained in real time. It also provides Doppler information in clear air region. All these data can be used to document the low level environment and the internal dynamics, microphysics and the interaction-mechanisms (wind shear, [...] .) leading to high-accumulated surface rainfall. The presentation will be devoted to the temporal and spatial characterisation of the precipitation that affects the 100 km radius region around Nice in a range from annual to daily scale and to the analysis of the universal scaling behavior of the rain. To document those two topics, we analysed the data with the help of various tools such as rain frequency and mean, cumulative distribution function, fourier and wavelet transform...|$|E
40|$|In this PhD Thesis {{the main}} types of the {{atmospheric}} circulation {{evolution in the}} lower and middle troposphere are being defined, that favor 5 kinds of extreme weather episodes in Greece (warm episodes, cold episodes, episodes of extreme rainfall, snowfall episodes and fog episodes). For this purpose two data sets are used a) daily values of meteorological parameters at 16 meteorological stations in Greece, for the period 1 / 9 / 1957 to 31 / 8 / 2002. b) values of meteorological parameters describing the atmospheric circulation in the lower and middle troposphere in Europe and the Mediterranean one day before the initiation, {{the day of the}} initiation and one day {{after the end of the}} episodes. For each of the 5 kinds of episodes, from the first data set the episodes dates are located. On the second data set a methodology scheme is applied that comprises of the multivariate methods of Factor Analysis and Cluster Analysis in order to define the main types of the atmospheric circulation, favoring each kind of episodes. For the warm episodes, the cold episodes, the extreme rain episodes, the snow episodes and the fog episodes, 7, 6, 16, 13 and 10 main types of the atmospheric circulation are defined, respectively. The main cause of warm episodes in Greece is the anticyclonic circulation over Greece, due to the expansion of the <b>Azores</b> <b>Anticyclone.</b> Cold episodes are favored by the combination of an anticyclone in Europe and cyclonic circulation in the eastern Mediterranean. The main cause of extreme rain episodes is a depression in the Mediterranean and a trough in the 500 hPa level west of Greece. Snow episodes are favored mainly by the combination of anticyclonic circulation in Europe and a deep depression in the Mediterranean, which contribute to the advection of cold air masses and to an intense baroclinicity over Greece. The formation of radiation fogs is being favored by anticyclonic circulation and a constant pressure value over Greece. A weak southerly flow of humid air masses can cause advection fogs mainly in the coastal regions and in the islands. ...|$|E
40|$|Air quality {{trends and}} {{patterns}} in the coastal city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) for the period 2011 – 2015 were analyzed. The orographic and meteorological characteristics, the proximity to the African continent, {{and the influence of}} the <b>Azores</b> <b>anticyclone</b> in combination with the anthropogenic (oil refinery, road/maritime traffic) and natural emissions create specific dispersion conditions. SO 2, NO 2, PM 10, PM 2. 5, and O 3 pollutants were assessed. The refinery was the primary source of SO 2; EU hourly and daily average limit values were exceeded during 2011 and alert thresholds were reached in 2011 and 2012. WHO daily mean guideline was occasionally exceeded. Annual averages in the three stations that registered the highest concentrations in 2011 and 2012 were between 9. 3 and 20. 4 µg/m 3. The spatial analysis of SO 2 concentrations with respect to prevailing winds corroborates a clear influence of the refinery to the SO 2 levels. In 2014 and 2015, the refinery did not operate and the concentrations fell abruptly to background levels of 2. 5 – 7. 1 µg/m 3 far below from WHO AQG. NO 2 EU limit values, as well as WHO AQG for the period 2011 – 2015, were not exceeded. The progressive dieselization of the vehicle fleet caused an increment on NO 2 annual mean concentrations (from 2011 to 2015) measured at two stations close to busy roads 25 to 31 µg/m 3 (+ 21 %) and 27 to 35 µg/m 3 (+ 29 %). NOx daily and weekly cycles (working days and weekends) were characterized. An anti-correlation was found between NOx and O 3, showing that O 3 is titrated by locally emitted NO. Higher O 3 concentrations were reported because less NOx emitted during the weekends showing a clear weekend effect. Saharan dust intrusions {{have a significant impact on}} PM levels. After subtracting natural sources contribution, none of the stations reached the EU maximum 35 yearly exceedances of daily means despite seldom exceedances at some stations. None of the stations exceeded the annual mean EU limit values; however, many stations exceeded the annual mean WHO AQG. Observed PM 10 annual average concentrations in all the stations fluctuated between 10. 1 and 35. 3 µg/m 3, where background concentrations were 6. 5 – 24. 4 µg/m 3 and natural contributions: 4. 2 – 9. 1 µg/m 3. No PM 10 temporal trends were identified during the period except for an effect of washout due to the rain: concentrations were lower in 2013 and 2014 (the most rainy years of the period). None of the stations reached the PM 2. 5 annual mean EU 2015 limit value. However, almost all the stations registered daily mean WHO AQG exceedances. During 2015, PM 2. 5 concentrations were higher than the previous years (2015, 8. 8 – 12. 3 µg/m 3; 2011 – 2014, 3. 7 – 9. 6 µg/m 3). O 3 complied with EU target values; stricter WHO AQG were sometimes exceeded in all the stations for the whole time periodPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
