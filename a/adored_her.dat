5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He <b>adored</b> <b>her.</b> She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as {{representative}} from San Augustine, Houston was elected in 1841 to once again serve as the Republic's president. Margaret disliked campaign events and, giving up her privacy, frequently staying home while her husband traveled about the Republic canvassing for votes. Yet, when she rose to the occasion, such as the extended post-election tour of San Augustine County and victory celebrations in Washington County and Houston City, the public <b>adored</b> <b>her,</b> and she became an impressive political asset. She rode in a local presidential parade, but stayed home rather than travel to the inauguration in Austin. When the couple appeared at several events in Nacogdoches, his old friends took notice of his total avoidance of alcohol, and he continued to assure {{her that he was}} giving it up completely. He also began to clean up his language to please his new wife, and would eventually claim to have eliminated his profanity altogether.|$|E
5|$|Chloe {{takes over}} full {{custody of her}} {{daughter}} from Billy; Delia is later diagnosed with leukemia, and Billy's bone marrow donation saves her life. During this trying time, Chloe reconnects with Kevin, and they become engaged following Delia's recovery. Mob princess Angelina Veneziano (Diana DeGarmo) arrives in town and develops a crush on Kevin. Her father Angelo Veneziano (Mike Starr) blackmails Kevin into leaving Chloe at the altar and marry Angelina, which he does. Once Angelina leaves town, Chloe and Kevin marry and resume their courtship. The couple join forces with Adam (Michael Muhney) and Chelsea Newman (Melissa Claire Egan) to start a fashion website entitled TagNGrab. The site ends unsuccessfully, leaving Chloe and Kevin in need of money. In a Bonnie and Clyde themed story arc, they steal money to save their house. Their marriage flounders as Kevin continues to steal and lets Chloe spend a night in jail for his crime, and they decide to get a divorce, which particularly affects Delia who <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> stepfather. During this period Chloe develops a fashion line for Jabot's fashion division with her best friend, Chelsea. Months later, Chloe and Kevin decide to start over and begin dating again. On the night of Delia's performance in a play, Billy leaves Delia and her dog, Dash, alone in his car while purchasing ice-cream. Dash runs off, causing Delia to run after him. Delia is struck down by a car believed {{to be driven by}} Adam, before being rushed to the hospital and dying of her injuries. When she learns of Delia's death from Billy at the hospital, Chloe breaks down and begins lashing out emotionally at Billy and everyone around her. Chloe decides to honor Delia by donating her corneas to Adam's son, Connor, who needs a transplant to save his eyesight. The operation is successful and Connor's vision is restored.|$|E

25|$|Away from Hollywood and {{the culture}} of celebrity, Monroe's life became more normal; she began cooking, keeping house and giving Miller more {{attention}} and affection than he had been used to. His children, aged twelve and nine, <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> and were reluctant to return to their mother when the weekend was over. As she was also fond of older people, she got along well with his parents, and the feeling was mutual.|$|E
25|$|Addams <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> {{father when}} she was a child, as she made clear in the stories of her memoir, Twenty Years at Hull House (1910). John Huy Addams was an {{agricultural}} businessman with large timber, cattle, and agricultural holdings; flour and timber mills; and a woolen factory. He was the president of The Second National Bank of Freeport. He remarried in 1868, when Jane was eight years old. His second wife was Anna Hostetter Haldeman, the widow of a miller in Freeport.|$|E

500|$|Manning <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> lively, handsome, womanising {{father who}} entertained others by singing Gilbert and Sullivan and reciting poetry he had {{memorised}} during long sea voyages. In contrast, {{her mother was}} bossy and domineering, with a [...] "mind as rigid as cast-iron", and there were constant marital disputes. The initially warm relationship between mother and daughter became strained {{after the birth of}} Manning's brother Oliver in 1913; delicate and frequently ill, he was the centre of his mother's attention, much to the displeasure of Manning, who made several childish attempts to harm him. This unhappy, insecure childhood left a lasting mark on her work and personality.|$|E
500|$|Maureen and her {{immediate}} family made regular visits to see Hindley, who reportedly <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> niece. In 1980, Maureen suffered a brain haemorrhage; Hindley was granted permission {{to visit her}} sister in hospital, but she arrived an hour after Maureen's death. Sheila and Patrick Kilbride, who were by then divorced, were present at Maureen's funeral, believing that Hindley might make an appearance. Patrick Kilbride mistook Bill Scott's daughter from a previous relationship, Ann Wallace, for Hindley and tried to attack her before being knocked to the ground by another mourner; the police were called to restore order. Shortly before her death {{at the age of}} 70, Sheila Kilbride said: [...] "If she [...] ever comes out of jail I'll kill her". It was a threat repeated by her son Danny, and Ann West.|$|E
500|$|Kanhopatra's abhangas {{frequently}} portray {{her struggle}} between her profession and her devotion to Vithoba, the patron deity of the Varkaris. She presents {{herself as a}} woman deeply devoted to Vithoba, and pleads for him to save her from the unbearable bondage of her profession. Kanhopatra speaks of her humiliation and her banishment from society owing to her profession and social stature. She expresses disgust for the society which <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> {{as an object of}} beauty rather than as a human being, and abhorred her for profession. She describes how she has been the object of lustful thoughts. She worries that she was beyond the [...] "scope of God's love". In Nako Devaraya Anta Aata—believed to be the last abhanga of her life—unable to bear the thought of separation from her Lord, Kanhopatra begs Vithoba to end her misery.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of whether LeHand and Roosevelt's relationship contained a sexual component was widely discussed among their contemporaries {{and continues to be}} debated by historians. Hazel Rowley argues that [...] "there is no doubt that Franklin's relationship with Missy was romantic", but notes the possibility that the relationship could not have been consummated due to FDR's disability. Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin states that [...] "beneath the complexity, it is absolutely clear that Franklin was the love of Missy's life, and that he <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> and depended on her for affection and support as well as work". Doug Wead wrote in his work on the parents of presidents, The Raising of a President, [...] "Some Roosevelt historians insist that their relationship was never consummated. Eleanor and the children accepted the relationship, which speaks for its innocence. Sara [...] spoke favorably of Missy's family and upbringing. Years later, only Elliott, of all the children, would declare that it had not been as benign as historians like to believe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deemed [...] "a {{woman you}} {{would not want to}} cross" [...] by James Rampton of The Independent, Bianca is a {{tenacious}} foe, but a loyal friend. The way the character is portrayed, as a [...] "person who wouldn't take nonsense from anyone", has led Rampton to comment that she embodies [...] "girl power", a cultural phenomenon of the mid-late 1990s. He added, [...] "Bianca could sulk for Britain – and we <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> for it." [...] However, Rampton also noted that underneath Bianca's bravado, the character is capable of showing [...] "the most affecting vulnerability".|$|E
2500|$|Cody married Louisa Frederici in 1866, just a {{few days}} after his twentieth birthday. The couple met when Cody had {{traveled}} to St. Louis under his command during the Civil War. Cody's Autobiography barely mentioned the courtship to Frederici but declared, [...] "I now <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> above any other young lady I had ever seen." [...] Cody suggested in letters and in his autobiography that Frederici had pestered him into marriage, but he was aware that it was [...] "very smart to be engaged." [...] This rhetoric became pushed more and more in his explanations for marriage as the relationship between him and his wife began to decline.|$|E

2500|$|The August {{issue of}} Brush and Pencil had an article [...] "American Art Eminently Distinctive" [...] by Ford. The December issue of Success (magazine) {{had a short}} story by Ford: [...] "Love enough for all". The story began with a husband {{swearing}} about [...] "modern club-woman" [...] with contrary ideas on raising children, but as the story continues the impatient mother gets in an accident who did not deal well with the child that <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> yet kept her from clubs. While recuperating she marvels at the housewife who can hold a conversation with guests and husband, children entertained, house well kept, and she well loved. The recuperating lady dreams and sees marvels all giving gifts to this one who loves all and is loved.|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{moved from}} the Tuileries in early 1662 to the Palais Royal. Later in March of the same year, Philippe became a father when Henrietta gave birth to their {{daughter}} Marie Louise, the future wife of Charles II of Spain. Henrietta's disappointment at {{the birth of a}} daughter was great, and she even remarked that she should [...] "throw her into the river!" [...] This greatly offended Queen Anne, who <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> first granddaughter. For his part, Philippe would always consider Marie Louise his favourite child. [...] The girl was baptised on 21 May 1662. On the same day Philippe took part in the famous Carrousel du Louvre, where he dressed extravagantly as the King of Persia with the king as the King of the Romans and all ladies of the court in attendance.|$|E
2500|$|Natalie’s {{relationship}} with Barry Evans- frequently {{described as a}} “bumbling buffoon” – was central to the character upon her return to the serial. Speed has explained her character’s initial attraction to Barry: [...] "I think {{it has a lot}} to do with her childhood. Natalie really <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> dad but he couldn't put up with that horrible wife of his, Andrea… and so he walked out on the family. Andrea is a total nightmare control freak, and it says a lot about who Natalie is, why she had no confidence in herself. Her mother probably emotionally abused her. So Barry represented safety and a secure family environment…She feels safe with him and she felt she made the right choice at the time, although of course she was apprehensive about it.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1920, they {{returned}} to Paris and bought {{a house on the}} Rue Gutenberg in Boulogne-sur-Seine, where they lived most of their lives. They founded a short-lived couture house called Irfé, which took its name from the first two letters of the names Irina and Felix. Irina modeled some of the dresses. The Yusupovs became renowned in the Russian émigré community for their financial generosity. This philanthropy and their continued high living and poor financial management extinguished what remained of the family fortune. Their daughter was largely raised (and spoiled) by her paternal grandparents until she was nine. Her unstable upbringing caused her to become [...] "capricious," [...] according to Felix. Felix and Irina, raised mainly by nannies themselves, were ill-suited to take on the day-to-day burdens of child-rearing. Irina's daughter <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> father but had a more distant relationship with her mother.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{family had}} a barn and orchard that kept her entertained. She played with her elder sister Geraldine (whom she called [...] "Sister"), {{climbing}} trees and riding ponies. Martin <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> father. [...] "He was tall, good-looking, silver-haired, with the kindest brown eyes. Mother was the disciplinarian, but it was Daddy who could turn me into an angel with just one look." [...] (p.19) Martin, who said [...] "I’d never understand the law" [...] (p.19), began singing outside the courtroom where her father worked every Saturday night at a bandstand. She sang in a trio with her sister and Marion Swofford, dressed in bellhop uniforms. [...] "Even in those days without microphones, my high piping voice carried all over the square. I have always thought that I inherited my carrying voice from my father." [...] (p.19) ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{marriage}} did {{not stop}} the steady stream of infatuated men. [...] The Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev in particular fell passionately {{in love with her}} after hearing her rendition of The Barber of Seville in Russia in 1843. In 1845, he left Russia to follow Pauline and eventually installed himself in the Viardot household, treated her four children as his own, and <b>adored</b> <b>her</b> until he died. [...] She, in turn, critiqued his work and through her connections and social abilities, presented him in the best light whenever they were in public. [...] The exact status of their relationship is a matter of debate. [...] Other men closely linked to her included the composers Charles Gounod (she created the title role in his opera Sapho) and Hector Berlioz (who initially had her in mind for the role of Dido in Les Troyens, but changed his mind, which led to a cooling of his relations with the Viardots).|$|E
