5|$|During Rædwald's youth, the {{establishment}} of other ruling houses was accomplished. Sometime before 588, Æthelberht of Kent married Bercta, the Christian daughter of the Frankish ruler Charibert. As early as 568, Ceawlin of Wessex, the most powerful ruler south of the River Humber, repulsed Æthelberht. According to later sources, Mercia was founded by Creoda in 585, although <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of sources {{makes it difficult to}} know how the Mercian royal line became established.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows {{are always in}} flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of water.|$|E
5|$|The {{ferocity of}} the fight {{convinced}} Black Hawk that Apple River Fort was impossible to defeat. He considered burning the fort, but feared the rising smoke would alert other militia in the area. His war-party slackened their fire as their fellow braves raided cabins near the fort. Taken were meat, flour, clothing, cooking utensils. Left behind was <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of real vandalism. Braves then raided the livestock: horses were run off and pigs and cattle were shot down and the choicest cut of meat taken. In the gathering darkness, Black Hawk quietly withdrew his war party and retreated back to the gap in Terrapin Ridge and gained the Galena Road. Casualties were few, given {{the intensity of the}} battle. Courier George Harkleroad was shot in the neck early in the battle and died; it has been documented that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall's pickets. Besides Welch, the only other garrison casualty was Josiah Nutting, who suffered a non-lethal wound to the side of his head. The number of Sauk casualties is unknown.|$|E

25|$|Haak et al.

25|$|Significantly less {{is known}} about North Island paleofaunas, due to <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of fossil sites {{compared}} to the South Island; however, the basic pattern of moa-habitat relationships was the same. Although the South Island and the North Island shared some moa species (Euryapteryx gravis, Anomalopteryx didiformis), most were exclusive to one island, reflecting divergence over several thousand years since lower sea level had resulted in a land bridge across Cook Strait.|$|E
25|$|Relatively common, {{the green}} lanternshark is caught {{infrequently}} as bycatch in deepwater fisheries, {{but has no}} commercial value because of its small size. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as of Least Concern, as at present it appears to face no substantial threats. However, like many other deep-sea sharks, there is <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of information on this species, and vigilance is warranted regarding expanding fisheries within its range.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his best}} {{intentions}} {{of producing a}} publication that did not dwell {{in the realm of}} heavy political exposé, Simons found <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of publishable material written on vaguely socialist themes in a light-hearted vein. With little humor or light fiction from which to choose, The Coming Nation inevitably moved into the usual heavier political fare, with the farmer's son Simons once again revisiting a theme near and dear to him in a series of articles: the role of the farmer in the American socialist movement.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, a {{study by}} Haak et al.about ancient DNA, concluded, however, that both R1a and R1b very likely spread into Europe from the Pontic-Caspian steppe after 3,000 BCE. They found there was <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of haplogroup R1b (or any other variant of R1) in {{the limited number of}} European {{population}} y-chromosome samples predating the Bronze Age, with only one of 70 individuals from Mesolithic and Neolithic Europe belonging to haplogroup R1. Among the analyzed male samples taken from Yamna culture sites, however, all possessed haplogroup R1b. Analysis of modern Europeans' autosomal DNA also gives support to a large population displacement from the steppe into Europe.|$|E
25|$|A {{long history}} of taxonomic {{confusion}} exists regarding the species within Cephaloscyllium owing to several factors, including variation in appearance (particularly between juveniles and adults), the existence of multiple undescribed species, <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of detailed scientific descriptions and type material, {{and the use of}} unreliable characters. Until recently, various authors had recognized five to eight species, along with at least five undescribed species in Australian waters and more in the western central Pacific and the Indian Ocean. In 2008, significant strides were made in resolving the taxonomy of Cephaloscyllium, with a revision of the genus and {{an increase in the number}} of described species to 21.|$|E

25|$|Small {{listening}} rooms suffer <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of {{low frequency}} resonances with gaps between them, so another complementary method is adding a subwoofer {{to drive the}} room resonances from an optimal physical location that minimizes ripple in the frequency response at the listening position. Yet another complementary method is splitting an existing subwoofer allocation up into multiple smaller subwoofers in spatially separated locations that increase the degrees of freedom available to tune the response with. Multiple subwoofers also tend to smooth the bass response across a larger listening area and are often easier to place for good bass response than a single larger subwoofer (or no subwoofer).|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the BJP {{asked for}} Pawar's {{resignation}} after alleging {{he was involved}} in a multi-crore Indian rupee (INR) scam involving wheat imports. In May 2007, a tender floated by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for procurement of wheat was cancelled when the lowest bid received was for 263 USD/ton. The government subsequently allowed private traders to purchase wheat directly from farmers that year resulting in <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of wheat to stock FCI granaries. By July 2007 the shortage at FCI was large enough to require import of wheat at a much higher price of 320–360 USD/ton. Taking advantage of this, traders who had domestically purchased wheat at 900 INR/ton earlier, were now offering the same to FCI at 1,300 INR/ton.|$|E
25|$|The Sino-Soviet split {{burst into}} the open in June 1960 at a Romanian Workers' Party congress, at which Khrushchev {{attempted}} to secure condemnation of Beijing. Albania's delegation, alone among the European delegations, supported the Chinese. The Soviet Union immediately retaliated by organizing a campaign to oust Hoxha and Shehu {{in the summer of}} 1960. Moscow cut promised grain deliveries to Albania during a drought, and the Soviet embassy in Tirana overtly encouraged a pro-Soviet faction in the Party of Labour of Albania (APL) to speak out against the party's pro-Chinese stance. Moscow also apparently involved itself in a plot within the APL to unseat Hoxha and Shehu by force. But given their tight control of the party machinery, army, and Shehu's secret police, the Directorate of State Security (Drejtorija e Sigurimit të Shtetit—Sigurimi), the two Albanian leaders easily parried the threat. Four pro-Soviet Albanian leaders, including Teme Sejko and Tahir Demi, were eventually tried and executed. The PRC immediately began making up for the cancellation of Soviet wheat shipments despite <b>a</b> <b>paucity</b> of foreign currency and its own economic hardships.|$|E
