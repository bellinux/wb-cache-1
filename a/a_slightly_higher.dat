5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} the customer orientation profile of Ohio State University Extension (OSU Extension). The sample for the study consisted of Extension personnel (n = 265) at th county level. An evaluative framework was utilized to describe the organizational customer orientation proJile infour dimensions: Definition, Sensitivity, Measurement, andlmplementation. Additionally, the level of commitment to Customer Service and attitude toward Continuous Quality Improvement (@I,) were analyzed. A mail survey was used to collect the research data. <b>A</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>high</b> level of customer orientation was found, portiavying the organization (OSIJ Extension) as extroverted, proactive, formal, and action-oriented. <b>A</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>high</b> level of commitment to customer service and <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> positive attitude toward CQI were exhibited by OSIJ Extension personnel.

5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> inclination (74°).|$|E
5|$|Before the battle, both armies {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by smaller units; {{by the time}} of the battle, the Allied forces had about 60,000 men, with another 5,000 holding Frankfurt, and the Prussians had almost 50,000. The Russians and Austrians lost about 15,000 men (approx. 5,000 killed), although some sources suggest <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> number, perhaps 15,600 or 15,700, about 26 percent. Christopher Duffy places Russian losses at 13,477; in addition, the Russians had lost about 4,000 at the Battle of Kay a week earlier. Sources differ on Prussian losses. Duffy maintains 6,000 killed and 13,000 wounded, a casualty rate of more than 37 percent. Gaston Bodart represents losses at 39 percent, and that two thirds (12,000) of the 19,000 casualties were deaths. Frank Szabo places Prussian losses at 21,000.|$|E

5|$|Operated by Germany and Italy, the ECR (Electric Combat / Reconnaissance) is a Tornado variant {{devoted to}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. It was first {{delivered}} on 21 May 1990. The ECR has sensors to detect radar usage and {{is equipped with}} anti-radiation AGM-88 HARM missiles. The Luftwaffe's 35 ECRs were delivered new, while Italy received 16 converted IDSs. Italian Tornado ECRs differ from the Luftwaffe aircraft as they lack built-in reconnaissance capability and use RecceLite reconnaissance pods, also only Luftwaffe ECRs are equipped with RB199 Mk.105 engine, which has <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> thrust rating. The German ECRs do not carry a cannon. The RAF uses the IDS version in the SEAD role instead of the ECR. It also modified several of its Tornado F.3s to undertake the mission.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombardment}} {{was scheduled}} to cease immediately before the assault companies deployed on Juno, but due to heavy seas, the landing was delayed by ten minutes, to 07:45 in Mike sector and 07:55 in Nan Sector. This was at <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> tide, closer to the beach obstacles and mines. The LCTs carrying the field artillery were forced to adjust course to avoid landing too early; the LCTs carrying DD tanks were forced to break off their advance. The seas proved too rough to launch the DD tanks, so they were ordered to deploy from the LCTs several hundred yards out from the beach.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, ButterFly debuted {{at number}} 72 on the Billboard 200 chart {{for the week}} ending November 16, 1974. The {{following}} week it rose to number 52 and on January 4, 1975, it reached its peak position at number 13. The record spent a total of 24 consecutive weeks on the Billboard 200. ButterFly was commercially less successful than its predecessor, which topped the Billboard 200. However, due to the album's strong sales, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified ButterFly gold on January 6, 1975 for physical sales exceeding 500,000 copies. In Canada, the album peaked at <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> position. It debuted on the list, compiled by RPM, at number 92 on November 23, 1974, and 11 weeks later it would peak at number 11 on February 15, 1975. In total, it spent 17 weeks charting in that country. It also charted in Australia, where it peaked at number 49 according to the Kent Music Report.|$|E
5|$|Linus Pauling {{estimated}} the electronegativity of francium at 0.7 on the Pauling scale, {{the same as}} caesium; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, {{but there are no}} experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium. Francium has <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> ionization energy than caesium, 392.811(4)kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2)kJ/mol for caesium, as would be expected from relativistic effects, and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two. Francium should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and the Fr− ion should be more polarizable than the Cs− ion. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium–oxygen bonding.|$|E
5|$|Some H-3 and H-4s were {{equipped}} with barrage balloon cable-cutting {{equipment in the}} shape of cutter installations forward of the engines and cockpit. They were designated H-8, but later named H8/R2. These aircraft were difficult to fly and production stopped. The H-6 initiated some overall improvements in design. The Jumo 211 F-1 engine of 1,007kW (1,350hp) increased its speed while the defensive armament was upgraded with one 20mm MG FF cannon in the nose position, one MG 15 in the ventral turret, and in each of the fuselage side windows (optional). Some H-6 variants carried tail-mounted MG 17 defensive armament. The performance of the H-6 was much improved. The climb rate was higher and the machine could reach <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> ceiling of 8,500 m (27,200ft). When heavy bomb loads were added, this ceiling was reduced to 6,500 m (20,800ft). The weight of the H-6 increased to 14,000kg (30,600lb). Some H-6s received Jumo 211F-2s which improved a low-level speed of 226mph (365km/h). At an altitude of 6,000 m (19,200ft) the maximum speed was 270mph (435km/h). If heavy external loads were added, the speed was reduced by 21.75mph (35km/h).|$|E
