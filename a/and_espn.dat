5|$|For {{five years}} after the {{expansion}} era contract with ESPN ended in 1997, the CFL was absent on American television.

A more modest deal of 14 games was negotiated with the NFL Network in 2010, which lasted two years.

Both the NBC <b>and</b> <b>ESPN</b> deals were renewed in 2013 with a slight scaling back of playoff coverage and ESPN2 also picking up a handful of games in the summer months. American broadcasts have been simulcasts of game coverage from Canadian networks.|$|E
