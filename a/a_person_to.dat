The ear facilitates two types of balance: static balance, which allows <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> feel the effects of gravity, and dynamic balance, which allows <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> sense acceleration.|$|E
5|$|Bribery. Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery. It is also bribery for <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that he will use the money for bribery at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both; and disqualification from being registered as a voter, voting at any election, or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years.|$|E
5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that for <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E

The effect of the act was to make it a specific criminal offence for <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> trespass onto the site.|$|E
5|$|Prostitution is {{considered}} sinful {{for both the}} prostitute and the customer; it reduces <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> an instrument of sexual pleasure, violating human dignity and harming society. The gravity of the sinfulness is less for prostitutes who are forced into the act by destitution, blackmail or social pressure.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher Kenneth Craik {{had noted}} {{the ability of}} thought to predict events. He {{stressed}} the survival value of natural selection for this ability. This internal working model allows <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> try out alternatives mentally, using knowledge of the past while responding to the present and future. Bowlby applied Craik's ideas to attachment, when other psychologists were applying these concepts to adult perception and cognition.|$|E

5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive condition {{due to a}} mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. For <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent. Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests, and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing {{may be used to}} screen family members of those affected.|$|E
5|$|Commenting on {{the usage}} of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found {{the death of the}} sorcerer similar to the story of Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> ashes by {{touching}} her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are reminiscent of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya.|$|E

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> {{wait for a}} longer delay, {{as long as the}} reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mayor}} dies in office, resigns, or {{is unable to}} carry out his/her duties and he/she did not {{designate}} an acting mayor, {{the president of the}} Board of Supervisors becomes acting mayor until the full Board select <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> fill the vacancy and finish the previous mayoral term. (In the case that both the president of the Board of Supervisors and the mayor are incapacitated, the order of succession is followed.) This has happened six times: James Otis died in office and was succeeded by George Hewston, Eugene Schmitz was removed and succeeded by Charles Boxton, Charles Boxton resigned and was succeeded by Edward Robeson Taylor, James Rolph resigned and was succeeded by Angelo Rossi, George Moscone was assassinated and was succeeded by Dianne Feinstein, and Gavin Newsom resigned and was succeeded by Ed Lee.|$|E

Dysmetria of the extremities caused by hemispheric syndromes is manifested in multiple ways: dysrhythmic tapping of {{hands and feet}} and dysdiadochokinesis, which is the impairment of alternating movements. Damage to the cerebellum makes <b>a</b> <b>person</b> slow <b>to</b> orient their extremities in space.|$|R

5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E

Other working models are in the collections of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, the Didrichsen Art Museum in Helsinki, the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, and the Kunsthaus in Zurich. Moore planned the full-size sculpture to be over 10 feet high, large enough for <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> walk between the two elements.|$|E
5|$|On average, IIH {{occurs in}} about one per 100,000 people, and {{can occur in}} {{children}} and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight {{times more likely than}} men to be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> IIH: women who are more than ten percent over their ideal body weight are thirteen times more likely to develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the time}} of McCarthy, the word McCarthyism has entered American speech as a general term {{for a variety of}} practices: aggressively {{questioning}} a person's patriotism, making poorly supported accusations, using accusations of disloyalty to pressure <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> adhere to conformist politics or to discredit an opponent, subverting civil and political rights in the name of national security, and the use of demagoguery are all often referred to as McCarthyism. McCarthyism can also be synonymous with the term witch-hunt, both referring to mass hysteria and moral panic.|$|E
5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} the orders had been made without any notice or hearing, {{and they were not}} given an {{opportunity}} to explain or correct the allegations against them. This was contrary to natural justice, which requires <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> be given the right to be heard before his or her interest is violated. As natural justice is an essential aspect of both {{the rule of law and}} the equal treatment by the law of all persons, the appellants argued that the deprivation of their right to a fair hearing was a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which affords to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E
5|$|The book {{presents}} {{case histories}} {{of all the}} twin-pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses. Its last chapters put the results {{in the context of}} existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder. The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study.|$|E
