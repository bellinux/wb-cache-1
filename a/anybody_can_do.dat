500|$|In [...] "Where Life Begins", Madonna {{promises}} to teach [...] "a {{different kind of}} kiss" [...] to the listener. In the song, Madonna talks about the pleasures of oral sex and also references safe-sex. The sixth track is [...] "Bad Girl". It talks {{about a woman who}} would rather get drunk than end a relationship she is too neurotic to handle. The seventh song, [...] "Waiting", {{has been described as a}} [...] "yearning ballad." [...] Featuring spoken words, it addresses rejection and unrequited love. It ends with lyrics [...] "The next time you want pussy, just look in the mirror, baby." [...] The next track, [...] "Thief of Hearts", is a dark and rumbling song. It uses tough hip-hop language to ward off a rival for her lover's attention. It opens with the smashing of a glass, and Madonna shouting, [...] "Bitch!/Which leg do you want me to break?" [...] and later, she sneers, [...] "Little miss thinks she can have his child/Well <b>anybody</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] "Words" [...] was compared to the previous track [...] "Thief of Hearts," [...] with music critics finding similarity in scope, each with sharp lyrics and catchy beats. The song features clattering programs and icy synth block-chords.|$|E
500|$|In retirement, Penfold {{has been}} {{critical}} of the FCO's attitude towards Africa, and has expressed the view that it does not give high enough priority to the continent. He stated {{in an interview that he}} felt the FCO was keen to develop experts in other areas, such as Europe and the Middle East, but [...] "Africa is the place where <b>anybody</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it so long as they have average intelligence". Since retiring, he has taken on roles with various charities and other organisations focusing on Africa and Sierra Leone, including New Africa Analysis, the UK Association for Schools for the Blind, Sierra Leone (which supports the Sir Milton Margai School for the Blind in Freetown), and the Dorothy Springer Trust. He is considered a folk hero in Sierra Leone, and continues to speak on issues relating to Sierra Leone. He was vocal in his opposition to indictment of Samuel Hinga Norman—a pro-Kabbah militia leader during the civil war—for war crimes by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and to the special court itself. He described the special court as an [...] "expensive and divisive piece of judicial machinery" [...] which served little purpose following the deaths of most of the prominent defendants, and believed that its continuation [...] "could undermine the fragile peace" [...] in Sierra Leone. Penfold was granted the Freedom of the City of Freetown and given the honorary title of Paramount Chief for his role in Sierra Leone, and has written a book about his experiences in the country, Atrocities, Diamonds and Diplomacy (...)

[...] The song starts out quietly and builds throughout until it reaches a loud crescendo near the end of the song.

The railway is a Circumstance, the steamship is a Circumstance, the telegraph is a Circumstance.

500|$|Musically, [...] "You'll See" [...] is an {{acoustic}} pop ballad. It {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, having a tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song is played in the key of G Major, with a basic sequence of Em–D–Em as its chord progression during the first verse, while piano and guitar are used to play the background music. The sequence shifts to Em–C–D–G–C–F during the chorus. Madonna's voice spans from G3 to C5. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. String synths and drums build the track further with the second verse seeing the singer harmonizing with herself. During the recording of the track, the singer used her vocal lessons for Evita; she said [...] "If you listen to those songs, you can hear how I was trying to absorb and utilize what I was learning for the recording [...]" [...] Lyrically the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. When asked if the track was about revenge, the singer replied: [...] "No, it's about empowering yourself", but also adding that [...] "there's another side too which is—'Don't fuck with me, I don't need <b>anybody.</b> I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> what I want'".|$|R

Let any honest reader shut his eyes for a few moments, and {{approaching}} the secret tribunal of his soul, ask himself whether he would really rather be asked in the next two hours to write {{the front page of the}} Times, which is full of long leading articles, or the front page of Tit-Bits, which is full of short jokes. If the reader is the fine conscientious fellow I take him for, he will at once reply that he would rather on the spur of the moment write ten Times articles than one Tit-Bits joke. Responsibility, a heavy and cautious responsibility of speech, is the easiest thing in the world; <b>anybody</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it. That is why so many tired, elderly, and wealthy men go in for politics. They are responsible, because they have not the strength of mind left to be irresponsible.

6000|$|... 166. Much that I have endeavoured {{to teach}} {{on this subject}} has been gravely misunderstood, by both young {{painters}} and sculptors, especially by the latter. Because I am always urging them to imitate organic forms, they think if they carve quantities of flowers and leaves, and copy them from the life, they have done all that is needed. But the difficulty is not to carve quantities of leaves. <b>Anybody</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that. The difficulty is, never anywhere to have an unnecessary leaf. Over the arch on the right, you see there is a cluster of seven, with their short stalks springing from a thick stem. Now, you could not turn one of those leaves a hair's-breadth out of its place, nor thicken one of their stems, nor alter the angle at which each slips over the next one, without spoiling the whole {{as much as you}} would a piece of melody by missing a note. That is disposition of masses. Again, in the group on the left, while the placing of every leaf is just as skilful, they are made more interesting yet by the lovely undulation of their surfaces, so that not one of them is in equal light with another. And that is so in all good sculpture, without exception. From the Elgin marbles down to the lightest tendril that curls round a capital in the thirteenth century, every piece of stone that has been touched by the hand of a master, becomes soft with under-life, not resembling nature merely in skin-texture, nor in fibres of leaf, or veins of flesh; but in the broad, tender, unspeakably subtle undulation of its organic form.|$|E
6000|$|Thus, on {{our side}} of the Atlantic, to cite our own faults first, we still cling to the {{supposed}} humour of bad spelling. We have, indeed, told ourselves a thousand times over that bad spelling is not funny, but is very tiresome. Yet it is no sooner laid aside and buried than it gets resurrected. I suppose the real reason is that it is funny, at least to our eyes. When Bill Nye spells wife with [...] "yph" [...] we can't help being amused. Now Bill Nye's bad spelling had absolutely no point to it except its oddity. At times it was extremely funny, but as a mode it led easily to widespread and pointless imitation. It was the kind of thing--like poetry--that <b>anybody</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> badly. It was most deservedly abandoned with execration. No American editor would print it to-day. But witness the new and excellent effect produced with bad spelling by Mr. Ring W. Lardner. Here, however, the case is altered; it is not the falseness of Mr. Lardner's spelling that is the amusing feature of it, but the truth of it. When he writes, [...] "dear friend, Al, I would of rote sooner," [...] etc., he is truer to actual sound and intonation than the lexicon. The mode is excellent. But the imitations will soon debase it into such bad coin that it will fail to pass current. In England, however, the humour of bad spelling does not and has never, I believe, flourished. Bad spelling is only used in England as an attempt to reproduce phonetically a dialect; it is not intended that the spelling itself should be thought funny, but the dialect that it represents. But the effect, on the whole, is tiresome. A little dose of the humour of Lancashire or Somerset or Yorkshire pronunciation may be all right, but a whole page of it looks like the gibbering of chimpanzees set down on paper.|$|E
50|$|Weegee {{was born}} Usher Fellig in Złoczów (now Zolochiv, Ukraine), near Lemberg in Austrian Galicia.

There he took {{numerous}} odd jobs, including working as a street photographer of children on his pony and as an assistant to a commercial photographer. In 1924 he was hired as a darkroom technician by Acme Newspictures (later United Press International Photos). He left, however, in 1935 to become a freelance photographer. Describing his beginnings, Weegee stated:In my particular case I didn't wait 'til somebody gave me a job or something, I went and created a job for myself—freelance photographer. And what I <b>did,</b> <b>anybody</b> else <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> What I did simply was this: I went down to Manhattan Police Headquarters and for two years I worked without a police card or any kind of credentials. When a story came over a police teletype, I would go to it. The idea was I sold the pictures to the newspapers. And naturally, I picked a story that meant something.He worked at night and competed with the police to be first at the scene of a crime, selling his photographs to tabloids and photographic agencies. His photographs, centered around Manhattan police headquarters, were soon published by the Herald Tribune, World-Telegram, Daily News, New York Post, New York Journal American, Sun, and others.|$|R
