500|$|For [...] "Tempest", this {{boils down}} to: the {{departure}} of Whitney, which causes distress in Lana; the experimental relationship between Clark and Chloe, who <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> whether or not [...] "they’ll be in love"; the evilness of Roger Nixon, and how Jonathan fights to protect his family; and the battle between father and son (Lionel and Lex).

500|$|Western analysts {{generally}} see the Eurasian Economic Union {{as a way}} {{to reunite}} many of the former Soviet republics. For example, Washington Post author Abigail Hauslohner wrote the treaty was intended [...] "to further bolster 's ties to former Soviet republics." [...] The United States expressed its opposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is [...] "an attempt" [...] to re-establish a USSR-type union among the former Soviet republics. In December 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed [...] "It's not going to be called that [...] It's going to be called customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that, but let's make no mistake about it.

By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title.

50|$|Meanwhile, Vera {{attends a}} medical conference where doctors <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the Miracle. When a doctor tweets that his {{hospital}} needs more antibiotics, Vera realises because nobody is dying, {{people who were}} supposed to die have become living incubators for bacteria which allows them to grow and become resistant to antibiotics. What's worse, the Miracle is not true immortality as people still age and grow old. With fears that supplies will dwindle as the undying grows, Vera suggests that hospitals need more painkillers to handle this situation. Later, Vera meets Jilly who actually works for a pharmaceutical company called PhiCorp and convinces Vera that they can work together as she can help her.|$|E

A heartbroken Agastya left the college as a result and eventually wound up in Houston working for NASA.|$|E
5000|$|Another dilemma Beeman faced {{was keeping}} the {{performances}} realistic, and not [...] "over-the-top". Beeman believes that [...] "Tempest" [...] proves {{exactly what he}} thought about Smallville, that the show is [...] "seen and experienced {{from the point of view}} of a teenager". Beeman explains, [...] "If you’re in love, you’re head over heels in love. If you’re scared, you’re terrified. If you’re sad, you’re in grief. The emotions are strong, but it doesn’t mean that the performances are over-the-top."For [...] "Tempest", this boils down to: the departure of Whitney, which causes distress in Lana; the experimental relationship between Clark and Chloe, who <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> whether or not [...] "they’ll be in love"; the evilness of Roger Nixon, and how Jonathan fights to protect his family; and the battle between father and son (Lionel and Lex).
