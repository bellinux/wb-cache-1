To {{cut out the}} lengthy time {{it would take to}} obtain informed consent from infected patients, Dr. Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and immediately visits her gravely ill father (Dan Flannery), who has been infected with MEV-1. The doctor does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the <b>attenuated</b> <b>virus</b> in the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{experienced}} {{an outbreak of}} 58,000 and 35,000 polio cases, respectively, up from a typical number of some 20,000 a year. Amid this U.S. polio epidemic, millions of dollars were invested in finding and marketing a polio vaccine by commercial interests, including Lederle Laboratories in New York {{under the direction of}} H. R. Cox. Also working at Lederle was Polish-born virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, who tested the first successful polio vaccine, in 1950. His vaccine, however, being a live <b>attenuated</b> <b>virus</b> taken orally, was still in the research stage and would not be ready for use until five years after Jonas Salk's polio vaccine (a dead-virus injectable vaccine) had reached the market. Koprowski's attenuated vaccine was prepared by successive passages through the brains of Swiss albino mice. By the seventh passage, the vaccine strains could no longer infect nervous tissue or cause paralysis. After one to three further passages on rats, the vaccine was deemed safe for human use. On 27 February 1950, Koprowski's live, attenuated vaccine was tested {{for the first time on}} an 8-year-old boy living at Letchworth Village, an institution for the physically and mentally disabled located in New York. After the child suffered no side effects, Koprowski enlarged his experiment to include 19 other children.|$|E
50|$|Vaccines {{created through}} reverse {{genetics}} methods {{are known as}} attenuated vaccines, named because they contain weakened (<b>attenuated)</b> live <b>viruses.</b> <b>Attenuated</b> vaccines are created by combining genes from a novel or current virus strain with previously <b>attenuated</b> <b>viruses</b> of the same species. <b>Attenuated</b> <b>viruses</b> are created by propagating a live virus under novel conditions, such as a chickenâ€™s egg. This produces a viral strain that is still live, but not pathogenic to humans, as these viruses are rendered defective in that they cannot replicate their genome enough to propagate and sufficiently infect a host. However, the viral genes are still expressed in the host's cell through a single replication cycle, allowing {{for the development of}} an immunity.|$|R
40|$|Large-scale codon re-encoding is a {{new method}} of <b>attenuating</b> RNA <b>viruses.</b> However, the use of {{infectious}} clones to generate <b>attenuated</b> <b>viruses</b> has inherent technical problems. We previously developed a bacterium-free reverse genetics protocol, designated ISA, and now combined it with large-scale random codon-re-encoding method to produce <b>attenuated</b> tick-borne encephalitis <b>virus</b> (TBEV), a pathogenic flavivirus which causes febrile illness and encephalitis in humans. We produced wild-type (WT) and two re-encoded TBEVs, containing 273 or 273 + 284 synonymous mutations in the NS 5 and NS 5 +NS 3 coding regions respectively. Both re-encoded <b>viruses</b> were <b>attenuated</b> when compared with WT virus using a laboratory mouse model and the relative level of attenuation increased with the degree of re-encoding. Moreover, all infected animals produced neutralizing antibodies. This novel, rapid and efficient approach to engineering <b>attenuated</b> <b>viruses</b> could potentially expedite the development of safe and effective new-generation live attenuated vaccines...|$|R
50|$|No formal drug {{interaction}} {{studies have been}} conducted with ofatumumab. Although it is advised that patients are not administered live virus vaccines (e.g. the oral polio vaccine) while undergoing treatment with ofatumumab due to the compromised ability to fight the <b>attenuated</b> <b>viruses</b> seen in patients being treated with ofatumumab.|$|R
25|$|Rubella {{infections are}} {{prevented}} by active immunisation programs using live, disabled virus vaccines. Two live <b>attenuated</b> <b>virus</b> vaccines, RA 27/3 and Cendehill strains, were {{effective in the}} prevention of adult disease. However their use in prepubertal females did not produce a significant fall in the overall incidence rate of CRS in the UK. Reductions were only achieved by immunisation of all children.|$|E
25|$|The {{two types}} of {{vaccines}} contain either inactivated hepatitis A virus or a live but <b>attenuated</b> <b>virus.</b> Both provide active immunity against a future infection. The vaccine protects against HAV in more than 95% of cases for longer than 25 years. In the US, the vaccine was first used in 1996 for children in high-risk areas, and in 1999 it was spread to areas with elevating levels of infection.|$|E
25|$|While plant {{viruses and}} bacteriophages {{can be grown}} {{comparatively}} easily, animal viruses normally require a living host animal, which complicates their study immensely. In 1931 it was shown that influenza virus could be grown in fertilized chicken eggs, a method that is still used today to produce vaccines. In 1937, Max Theiler managed to grow the yellow fever virus in chicken eggs and produced a vaccine from an <b>attenuated</b> <b>virus</b> strain; this vaccine saved millions of lives and is still being used today.|$|E

25|$|The MMR vaccine (also {{known as}} the MPR vaccine after the Latin names of the diseases) is an {{immunization}} vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles).

2500|$|In 1969 a live <b>attenuated</b> <b>virus</b> vaccine was licensed. In {{the early}} 1970s, a triple vaccine {{containing}} attenuated measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) viruses was introduced.

2500|$|Although Jenner used cowpox, {{the vaccine}} now {{contains}} a virus immunologically related to cowpox and smallpox viruses called vaccinia which causes a mild infection. The vaccine is infectious which improves its effectiveness, but causes serious complications {{for people with}} impaired immune systems (for example chemotherapy and AIDS patients, and people with eczema), and is not yet considered safe for pregnant women. A woman planning on conceiving within one month should not receive the smallpox immunization until after the pregnancy. In {{the event of an}} outbreak, the woman should delay pregnancy if possible. Vaccines that only contain attenuated vaccinia viruses (an <b>attenuated</b> <b>virus</b> is one in which the pathogenicity has been decreased through serial passage) have been proposed, but some researchers have questioned the possible effectiveness of such a vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), [...] "vaccination within 3 days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority of}} people. Vaccination 4 to 7 days after exposure likely offers some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease." [...] This, along with vaccinations of so-called first-responders, is the current plan of action being devised by the United States Department of Homeland Security (including Federal Emergency Management Agency) in the United States.|$|E

50|$|A {{small number}} of {{asymptomatic}} carriers (referred to as chronic excretors) continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the oral Sabin vaccine.

40|$|Mosquito-borne flaviviruses {{are among}} the most {{significant}} arboviral pathogens worldwide. Vaccinations and mosquito population control programs remain the most reliable means for flavivirus disease prevention, and live <b>attenuated</b> <b>viruses</b> remain one of the most attractive flavivirus vaccine platforms. Some live <b>attenuated</b> <b>viruses</b> are capable of infecting principle mosquito vectors, as demonstrated in the laboratory, which in combination with their intrin-sic genetic instability could potentially lead to a vaccine virus reversion back to wild-type in nature, followed by introduction and dissemination of potentially dangerous viral strains into new geographic locations. To mitigate this risk we developed a microRNA-targeting ap-proach that selectively restricts replication of flavivirus in the mosquito host. Introduction of sequences complementary to a mosquito-specific mir- 184 and mir- 275 miRNAs individually or in combination into the 3 â€™NCR and/or ORF region resulted in selective restriction of den-gue type 4 virus (DEN 4) replication in mosquito cell lines and adult Aedesmosquitos.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{activities of}} five measles virus (MV) polymerase (L) proteins were compared in an intracellular, plasmid-based replication assay. When coexpressed with N and P proteins from an attenuated strain, L proteins from two <b>attenuated</b> <b>viruses</b> directed {{the production of}} up to eight times more reporter protein from an MV minigenome than the three wild-type L proteins. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the differences in reporter protein production correlated with mRNA transcription levels. Increased activity of polymerases from <b>attenuated</b> <b>viruses</b> equally affected mRNA transcription and minigenome replication. The higher level of transcription may be a consequence of increased template availability or may be an independent effect of the elevated activity of the attenuated polymerases. Coexpression of wild-type L proteins with homologous N and P proteins {{did not affect the}} activity of the wild-type polymerases, indicating that the differential activity was a function of the L proteins alone. Use of a minigenome that incorporated two nucleotide changes found in the genomic leader of the three wild-type viruses did not raise the activity of the wild-type L proteins. These data demonstrate that increased polymerase activity differentiates <b>attenuated</b> from wild-type <b>viruses</b> and suggest that functions involved in RNA synthesis contribute to the attenuated phenotype of MV vaccine strains...|$|R
50|$|VLPs {{are useful}} as vaccines.

Two of these vaccinated monkeys developed AIDS, while the control monkeys infected in parallel remained asymptomatic. Concomitant with an increase in viral load, a recombinant of the vaccine virus and the challenge virus could be detected.
