Collections were made from the first two locations by Auguste Bergy with studies by Henri Fleisch and the third location noted by Peter Wescombe in 1965. Material from location one was mixed with some showing Middle Paleolithic forms including picks, scrapers, flakes and cores. Location two is a section in the 50 m high banks of the stream on a bank of pebbles overlaying a layer of red sand. Henri Fleisch collected Middle Paleolithic <b>appearance</b> <b>material</b> from this red layer, which is suggested to represent a dry period where dunes covered the area. Location three was located west of the riverbed in the foundations of a building cut into the bank amongst terraces planted with olives. A red sand layer of 2 m contained scrapers and cores overlies a deep layer of pebbles. This was covered by black soil containing a few flakes. Two wet periods intervened by a drier one were indicated and the material stored in the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory marked [...] "Salikha".|$|E
40|$|The {{emotional}} Stroop task, {{an adaptation}} of the original Stroop methodology, has allowed an enhanced understanding of information processing biases {{in a range of}} disorders. Increased response latencies are typically found when participants are presented with disorder-specific stimuli, indicating preferential attention for that information. The application of the emotional Stroop to understanding body image disturbance has yielded mixed findings, in part due to methodological flaws in past research. The aim of the current study was to assess whether attention and memory biases exist in a community sample using a refined methodology. 103 male and female participants completed an emotional Stroop task and incidental memory test. Stimulus words covered a range of body image concerns such as high and low calorie foods, positive and negative appearance, negative mood, and physical activity. No consistent attention or memory biases were found within the sample, even when considering a range of vulnerability factors. Some widespread biases for negative <b>appearance</b> <b>material</b> were found, which may reflect the high levels of body image disturbance commonly found. Thus it appears that processing biases are not stable within a non-clinical sample, but may more influenced by environmental cues...|$|E

The quality of a product should be satisfactory to customers in terms of usability, <b>appearance,</b> <b>material,</b> life span of the product, comfort and so on. This thesis is about understanding quality from the customer perspective. With the initiative from the case company, the authors tried to understand what the customers expects from the company and create a knowledge base for the company to improve their products’ quality and to provide a perception to implement a continuous quality improvement strategy. Customers are always satisfied with a good quality product. The authors have used different methods such as questionnaires, surveys and one-one discussions to extract the customer’s needs. The affinity diagram was used to categorize these needs and the pairwise method was used to ascertain the most important needs from customer perspective. The House of Quality is used to understand and define the attributes that the company needs to improve. Based on the outcomes of the QFD, the authors have suggested some future improvement strategies. Key Words: House of quality; Kano’s model; QFD; Quality improvement...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Extensive pulp defects of the thumb, {{with the}} {{exposure}} of tendon or bone, are challenging reconstructive problems. Surgical treatment includes the use of local, regional, and free flaps. AIM: This paper is focused in Foucher’s neuro vascular flap. First DMCA or Foucher’s pedicle flap is a successful thumb reconstruction method, especially in patients not disturbed by its cosmetic <b>appearance.</b> <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS: The first dorsal metacarpal artery (FDMCA) arises from the radial artery in the first intermetacarpal space, just distal to the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus. Pulp area of the thumb is the area where Foucher’s flap is more utilizable. This technique has other applications such as first web reconstruction, thumb lengthening, and following resection of tumors on the dorsum of the hand. RESLTS: We have in study 7 cases with work related trauma in two years period of time, between 2012 and 2014. We had only one partial flap survival {{and all the other}} flaps survived entirely. We have also taken in consideration subjective satisfaction with a range score from 4 to 10, cold intolerance, flap area and donor site sensibility with a range score from low to medium to normal. CONCLUSION: Careful pedicle discovery, secured elevation, pedicle strangulation prevention are very important for flap survival...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this paper}} was to observe the {{reactive}} changes of epithelial cells exposed to the influence of cervicovaginitis agents that {{play an important role in}} the cytology practice and may cause an exaggerated <b>appearance.</b> <b>Material</b> and Method: 378 cases with cervicovaginitis caused by a specific agent were compared with 100 control cases. It was recorded if the inflammation had concomitant cellular changes and atypia or not. After treatment, control smears were examined. The reactive and atypical situations of the cells were considered after the treatment. With the aid of the previous data, the answer to the following question was searched: Is epithelial atypia a real event or a reactive atypia that accompanies an existing cervicitis agent?Results: In the first interpretation, Candida group had the most frequent reactive and ASC-US (Atypic Squamous cells of Undetermined Significance) changes (56, 4 % and 59, 5 % respectively). The bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis groups showed ASC-US rates of 25 % and 9, 5 % respectively while in control group the rate was 6, 0 %. After treatment, the number of cases of ASC-US decreased from 50 to 11. Similarly, the number decreased from 21 to 10 in the bacterial vaginosis group. Conclusion: Cervicovaginitis agents need more attention because of their outcomes. Being aware of the cervicovaginitis agents during interpretation is essential for preventing a false positive diagnosis and unnecessary anxiety especially where cellular atypia is concerned...|$|E

All patients were split up three groups depending on occurrence of pathologic Q-wave on ECG and time of its appearance. First group consisted of 311 patients with early Q-wave (during first 6 hours from onset of MI symptoms). Second group consisted of 120 patients with late Q-wave (from 6 to 24 hours from onset of MI symptoms). Third group consisted of 185 patients with non-Q-wave MI. Results. The hospital lethality in the patients with early Q-wave {{was significantly higher than}} this in patients of the second and the third groups. However, we didn’t reveal significant differences between patients with late Q-wave and patients without Q-wave on ECG. The incidences of cardiac death (sudden death and fatal MI), non-fatal MI and hospitalization because of unstable angina was assessed during next two years. During the follow-up period patients of three groups had similar incidences of the non-fatal MI and hospitalization because of unstable angina. However, incidence of cardiac death was significantly higher in early Q-wave group in comparison with non-Q-wave group. Conclusion. Occurrence of pathologic Q-wave on ECG and time of its appearance should be taken into account to assessed short- and long-term prognosis of MI...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the optical properties of newly developed esthetic coatings for metallic implants and components for an improved peri-implant soft tissue <b>appearance.</b> <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS Pig maxillae (n = 6) were used for the in vitro color evaluation of coated and uncoated samples. Three different coating systems (Ti-ZrO 2, Ti-Al-ZrO 2, and Ti-Ag-ZrO 2) were deposited on titanium substrates, which exhibited different roughness (polished, machined, and sand-blasted) and interference colors (pink, yellow, and white). Spectrophotometric measurements were made of samples below three different mucosa thicknesses (1 mm, 2 mm, and 3 mm) and titanium served as negative control. Color difference ΔE was calculated using ΔL, Δa, and Δb values for each sample (in total 30 samples). RESULTS ΔE values were significantly above the threshold value of 3. 70 for sand-blasted Ti and Ti-ZrO 2 samples when tested below 1 mm thick soft tissue, hence resulted in a dark appearance of the soft tissues. In contrast, Ti-Al-ZrO 2 and Ti-Ag-ZrO 2 samples showed significant ΔL values below 1 mm, which indicates a brightening of the covering tissue. In general, ΔE values decreased with increasing thickness of the tissue. At 3 mm thick tissue, ΔE values were significantly below 3. 70 for Ti-Al-ZrO 2 and Ti-Ag-ZrO 2 samples. The preferable substrate surface should be machined due increased color brightness, good soft tissue integration and improved adhesion between coating and substrates. Improvement of the optical appearance of the metal was achieved with the coating systems Ti-Al-ZrO 2 and Ti-Ag-ZrO 2. Darkening effects could not be observed for these systems, and partially light brightening of the tissue was observed. Advantageous colors were suggested to be pink and yellow...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sessile {{serrated}} adenoma/polyp (SSA/p) is a precancerous lesion, mostly {{located in}} {{the right side of}} the colon (cecum, ascending and transverse colon). The difficulty is to visualize this lesion during colonoscopy because of its subtle <b>appearance.</b> <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHOD: We compared proteomes of serrated polyps (SSA/p) and conventional adenomas using residual human formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. FFPE-FASP method was applied on samples before label free proteomic analysis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) characterisation of one candidate marker was performed for tissue validation on an independent set of samples including: conventional adenomas (low and high-grade dysplasia), serrated polyps (hyperplastic polyps, SSA/p and traditional serrated adenoma) and finally normal colon (taken at the margin of colorectal cancer (CRC) or of diverticular disease). RESULTS: Proteomics provided 765 proteins (out of 5992 proteins identified) significantly discriminating conventional adenomas from serrated lesions. We selected 53 BP 1 (Tumor suppressor p 53 -binding protein 1) among these for IHC validation, because of its tumor suppressor gene function and role as a mediator of DNA damage checkpoint. 53 BP 1 appeared significantly up-regulated in proteomes of low and high grade adenomas compared to these of normal tissue and SSA/p. 53 BP 1 IHC signal was {{located in the}} nucleus and the percentage of positive nucleus decreased in serrated polyps, especially in crypts and in the border epithelium, confirming part of the proteomic results. CONCLUSION: This study highlights potential marker proteins, including 53 BP 1 from which IHC signal was strongly decreased in some serrated polyps. The loss of 53 BP 1 has been associated with tumour progression and poor prognosis, while little is currently known about its involvement in precancerous CRC lesions. 53 BP 1 decrease of expression in the nucleus and therefore possible loss of function in some epithelial cells could reflect important changes occurring during dysplasia to neoplasia progression in serrated lesions.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the ways in which actions involving the construction of funerary mounds facilitated the continuity of Beaker and Bronze Age society in South-West Britain by creating and renewing meaningful traditions of knowledge. Following a brief introduction (Chapter 1) which reviews the character and contents of the study, the second chapter considers some theoretical issues arising from the practice of interpretative archaeology, and concludes with a discussion of death rituals and their archaeological appropriation. Chapter 3 is a critical review of the modem tradition of barrow study, and proposes an alternative perspective pursued in later chapters. Chapter 4 involves an examination of the environmental and social context surrounding later third and second millennium burial practices in the South-West in terms of its implications for community regionalization, social structure, and funerary function. Chapter 5 contains an overview of the funerary sites, a discussion of the analysis employed in their examination, and a contextual history of Bronze Age funerary practices, integrating the results into a general view of social and ritual development. Chapter 6 elaborates upon Beaker/Bronze Age traditions of knowledge by detailing the form and content of the meaningful taxonomies which structured perception, and how such taxonomies were forwarded and reproduced through tomb construction and related ritual actions. The chapter concludes by considering the results of the analysis against the current approaches to the subject. The picture of Bronze Age ceremonial burial which emerges differs from that produced by traditional and current perspectives, in that local contingent circumstances and cosmological constructs are shown to have been of equal importance to both power relations and large scale economic structures in influencing site location, monument <b>appearance,</b> <b>material</b> culture use, and funerary action.

40|$|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The optical {{appearance}} of human skin is {{highly dependent on}} {{the interaction between the}} illumination (type and position), observer position and the skin surface structure. Different currently available photographic techniques record different aspects of this appearance, each providing its own incomplete description. This limits their usefulness, especially for pigmented skin lesion diagnosis. In this paper a new, easy to use, low-cost photographic method is described,which aims to generate an efficiently encoded yet reasonably complete representation of skin <b>appearance.</b> <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS: A prototype hand-held camera was developed that rapidly acquires six colour images, each with the skin illuminated from a different direction. A novel photometric stereo processing was used to combine these into a colour image of the skin's diffuse reflectance, independent of the skin surface topography, as well as a separate representation of that topography {{in the form of a}} surface gradient image. Images of four clinical pigmented skin lesions were evaluated in comparison with conventional digital photographs by both visual judgement and automated lesion boundary detection. RESULTS: The new colour reflectance images were free from the effects of topographical shading, shadowing and specular reflections. Lesion boundaries obtained automatically from the reflectance images were always closer to the outline drawn by a dermatologist than those obtained from conventional photographs. Finally, recombining the colour reflectance and surface gradient data to form a virtual image of the skin surface that is highly realistic in appearance. CONCLUSIONS: The new colour photometric stereo camera produces images of skin and skin tumours in which the reflectance information that is related to subsurface pigment distribution is separated from the surface topographic information. The total information generated by the system, for use in visual or automated analysis, is potentially greater than that for either conventional photography or dermatoscopy alone. Its further development and broader clinical evaluation are warranted to determine its usefulness and role in a wide range of dermatological tasks, including tele-dermatology applications. ...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} re-examine {{the role of}} extra-urban ritual spaces in the ritual and socio-political landscapes of Bronze Age Crete during the second millennium BC. Within {{the context of the}} transformation between the heterarchical relationships that appear to have characterized the earlier Protopalatial period and the more distinctly hierarchical structures of Neopalatial times, I consider the role played by ritual spaces — including peak sanctuaries, caves, and sacred enclosures — in these shifting power dynamics. By looking at the performance of ritual activity, as expressed through archaeological assemblages, my work investigates how regional interactions influenced ritual activities and their material signature in the landscape. Two opposing but complementary forces appear to have shaped the character of the material deposited at each of these site-types. Each site constituted {{an integral part of the}} ritual landscape of Minoan Crete that influenced the performance of ritual and votive dedication. At the same time, its specific context in local and regional scale socio-political landscapes shaped permutations of activity and material culture. The tension between these forces accounts for the distinctiveness and variability in the assemblages. Each of the sites and categories of sacred site is explored to assess specifically the effects of this tension on site-based activities and the assemblages that resulted. Sacred caves are considered with respect to the sensory experience of ritual activity and the presumed links to an emergent elite. Peak sanctuaries are examined with particular regard to their assemblages and the subtle but distinct variations that highlight local and regional influences. The huge, unpublished pottery assemblage from Vrysinas is closely examined as a detailed case-study that provides new perspectives on the nature of ritual activity. Sacred enclosures are shown each to have a distinct character and landscape setting, which, more than peak sanctuaries or caves, directly influenced the sites’ <b>appearance,</b> <b>material</b> culture, and performed ritual. I argue that each site must be understood as part of a whole, but simultaneously as having a precise and distinctive trajectory that reflected and was informed by its specific role in a complex network of dynamic relationships and associations...|$|E
