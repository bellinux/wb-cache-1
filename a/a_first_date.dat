25|$|<b>A</b> <b>first</b> <b>date</b> {{is a type}} {{of initial}} meeting between two individuals, whether or not {{previously}} acquainted, where an effort is made to ask, plan, and organize some sort of social activity, with the goals ranging from forming a friendship, finding a romantic or sexual partner for a short period, to finding a long-term spouse. Dating can vary between cultures, lifestyles, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} outcomes on {{the conclusion of}} <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>date.</b> The two individuals may agree to a second date. One or both parties may decide that there were compatibility issues and decide not to pursue further dates. Compatibility factors vary a great deal, and can include religion, {{whether or not a}} person uses drugs or alcohol, appearance, or personality. Alternatively, the two parties may decide to become friends or some other type of Platonic relationship (a non-sexual relationship). Some first dates may lead to a romantic relationship that can range in duration from short period to a long period.|$|E
25|$|Where cheek kissing is used, in some {{countries}} a single kiss is the custom, while in others a kiss on each cheek is the norm, or even three or four kisses on alternating cheeks. In the United States, an air kiss is becoming more common. This involves kissing in the air near the cheek, with the cheeks touching or not. After <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>date,</b> {{it is common for}} the couple to give each other a quick kiss on the cheek (or lips where that is the norm) on parting, to indicate that a good time was had and perhaps to indicate an interest in another meeting.|$|E

25|$|Overall, on <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>date,</b> women’s {{goals are}} related more to {{establishing}} friendships and having fun. Mongeau, in his 2004 {{study found that}} 60 percent of women go on first dates mainly to have fun and 59 percent go on dates to reduce uncertainty. (Note, however, {{that there are some}} errors in the mathematical calculations done in the study, and the study is statistically invalid as it uses the convenience sampling method.) Women's goals tend to be more relationship-oriented than men’s goals. Also, unlike men, women are usually more reserved {{when it comes to the}} sexual aspect and having sex. Women are more likely to express companionship, friendship, and romantic relationship goals than men and are also more likely to consider the first date in terms of their relational implications than men.|$|E
25|$|Charlie and Itchy live in San Francisco as {{guardian}} angels. In each episode, {{they are}} given an assignment by Anabelle but, while they {{try to do the}} right thing, they become caught {{up in the middle of}} awkward situations. Charlie’s callous enemy Carface and his sidekick, Killer (from the first film), also appeared in the series, as did Charlie’s friends: the dog Sasha, the dog-angel Anabelle, and the human kid David. Finally, the series also featured two new characters named Bess, a pure bred award winning show dog and Itchy's love interest, and Belladonna, Anabelle's demonic cousin. The series makes several changes to the second film. For example, Charlie and Sasha were shown as being a couple at the end of the second film, however, in the series, they seem to have never had <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>date</b> together; also, Itchy decides to stay in Heaven, but he is alive in the series, although it is explained later in the series why he is on Earth instead of being in Heaven.|$|E

2500|$|In one sense, {{the purpose}} of <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>date</b> {{is the same as}} {{the purpose of}} any {{subsequent}} date: it is an opportunity for the two people to meet. However, the first date differs in that it is often used to screen potential dating candidates. If a person displays behaviours deemed to be negative, the other person may decide to not meet again. In some cases, one or both parties may decide to end the date before the end of the activity they are engaged in. Because they often set the tone for the relationship, first dates are highly important. [...] As the study by Mary Claire Morr Serewicz of the Department of Human Communication Studies at the University of Denver, and Paul Mongeau of Arizona State University, states that first dates [...] "represent an important early event in the development of dating relationship." ...|$|E

However, in the season 6 finale [...] "The Bon Voyage Reaction", Lucy feels too pressured by Raj to meet his friends, and a dinner between Lucy, Raj, and Amy does not go well. Raj apologizes for his behavior and asks Lucy to come to Leonard's goodbye party before his departure for the North Sea on Professor Stephen Hawking's expedition. However, Lucy text messages him at the party saying {{she will not be}} there and does not want to see him again. [...] The next day, Penny goes to comfort a heartbroken Raj, who thinks he is completely unlovable. Penny suggests that this lament is attributed to alcohol, but Raj says he that he has not had a drink since the night before: he is finally cured of his selective mutism.|$|E
2500|$|In early December 2011, Clinton {{made the}} first visit to Burma by a U.S. {{secretary}} of state since John Foster Dulles's in 1955, as she met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms. Clinton said that due to the direct and indirect communications she had had with Suu Kyi over the years, [...] "it was like seeing a friend you hadn't seen {{for a very long}} time even though it was our first meeting." [...] The outreach to Burma attracted both praise and criticism, with Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen saying it [...] "sends the wrong signal to the Burmese military thugs" [...] but others saying the visit combined idealism with respect to reform and realpolitik with respect to keeping Burma out of the direct Chinese sphere of influence. Clinton had had to overcome internal administration opposition from the White House and Pentagon, as well as from Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, to make the move, eventually making a personal appeal to Obama and gaining his approval. Regarding whether the Burmese regime would follow up on reform pledges, Clinton said, [...] "I can't predict what's going to happen, but I think it certainly is important for the United States to be on the side of democratic reform ... This is <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>date,</b> not a marriage, and we'll see where it leads." [...] She continued to address rights concerns in a December 2011 speech a few days later before the United Nations Human Rights Council, saying that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights abroad and that [...] "Gay rights are human rights" [...] and that [...] "It should never be a crime to be gay." [...] This itself drew criticism from some American social conservatives.|$|E
40|$|Modern Dendrochronological {{techniques}} were applied on Picea smithiana (Wall) Boiss, from District Dangam of Afghanistan. Twenty eight wood samples {{in the form}} of cores were obtained from 15 Picea trees and cross-dating was obtained among 24 cores of 12 trees. <b>A</b> <b>first</b> <b>dated</b> chronology (1663 - 2006 AD) from this country was presented. Various statistics are described. It is indicated that all cores are highly correlated, showing similar climatic signals. On the basis of present investigations, it is suggested that this species has high Dendroclimatic value and more information could be obtained, if this chronology is correlated with other regional chronologies of the same species...|$|R
