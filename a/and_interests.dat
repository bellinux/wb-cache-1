Even when these forms of relationship are inevitable and they are playing a crucial role in public policy decision-making. The problem of the project’s – how and to what extent do Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups relationship or not relationship? The project’s object is – political parties, <b>interest</b> groups <b>and</b> relationship between them. The subject of this project’s is the relationship between Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups. The project’s aim – to examine the relationship between Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups. The objectives of the project: to analyse theoretical aspects of the relationship between political parties <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups; to prepare the research methodology of the relationship between Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups; to typologise interest groups active in Kaunas; to create of Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups relationship model. The methods used are: analysis of scientific literature, analysis of documents, descriptive statistics, and semi-structured interview. The first chapter discusses and systemises information about the concept of relationship between political parties <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups, functions, types, etc. The key differences and similarities are identified. Also, the features of relationship between political parties <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups are analyses, and reviewed relations of the Social Democratic Party with interest groups. The second chapter presents the empirical research methodology. The third chapter provides the results of the empirical study. This chapter presents LSDP and its Kaunas City Department. It identifies social democratic provisions in relation to <b>interest</b> groups <b>and</b> typologises <b>interest</b> groups active in Kaunas. It was also revealed how and to what extent Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups do (not) relationship. The study showed that social democrats cannot imagine the process of decision-making, democratic development and welfare creation without the involvement of various interest groups. It turned out that in Kaunas, out of all interest groups, 320 met the criteria (having a website, and (or) insured employees). It was also established that Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups active in Kaunas (LAEA, ZUR, KCPDS and so on.) are connected.

5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities <b>and</b> <b>interests,</b> and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
