They include issues {{associated}} with bracket creep, the redistribution of income, low rates of return on saving, sluggish economic growth, capriciousness of the tax system, and problems associated with the <b>averaging</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> the marriage tax penalty, automatic stabilization, and the cost of administration. In {{the second part of the}} paper there is an examination of the four most influential tax proposals that culminated in the 1986 tax law. The economic effects of the new levy are investigated. In the final section of the article the prospects for genuine tax-reform in the United States are examined. It is argued that, under existing political institutions and incentives, there is little hope for meaningful reform. Data are produced to support this hypothesis. ...|$|E
