5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, {{to the point of being}} unfair in <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that</b> was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its design}} focus on player choice, Deus Ex has been {{compared}} with System Shock, <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that</b> inspired its design. Together, these factors give the game a great degree of replayability, as the player will have vastly different experiences, depending on which methods he or she uses to accomplish objectives.|$|E
5|$|Chuck Klein, Pat Seerey, and Mike Schmidt each {{hit their}} four in <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that</b> went into extra innings.

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for Interpol: The Trail of Dr. Chaos has been negative. The Xbox 360 version currently holds {{a rating of}} 48.85 on GameRankings, based on 26 reviews. IGN panned the game, writing [...] "Interpol is good for a few short bursts of seek-and-find fun, but it's just not <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that's</b> very well suited to the console. Add that to the poor image resolution, inconsistent puzzles and overall shaky production value, and you have <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that's</b> probably not worth the download." [...] ABC.com.au's Good Game Stories also panned the game.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, Richard Garfield {{approached}} Wizards of the Coast {{with the}} idea for a new board game called RoboRally, but was turned down because the game would have been too expensive for Wizards of the Coast to produce.

5|$|In February 2011 the Smithsonian Institution {{announced}} it would be holding an exhibit dedicated {{to the art of}} video games. Several games were chosen initially and the public could vote for which games they felt deserved to be displayed via a poll on the exhibit's website.

5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters, and that market for games like Spec Ops: The Line is too small. As a result, the team would {{not return to the}} franchise. Team members expressed a desire to move on and develop <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that</b> has a much lighter tone.|$|E

5|$|As {{the first}} major Final Fantasy game for mobile devices, Before Crisis was {{designed}} as a gameplay and multiplayer experience unique to the platform. It is {{the first major}} project directed by Hajime Tabata, who created the initial concept at the request of Tetsuya Nomura for <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that</b> had the Turks as protagonists. The music was composed by Takeharu Ishimoto, originally a sound arranger at Square Enix. It was highly successful upon release, registering 200,000 users and being accessed over one million times. Western critics have generally praised the title, but due to issues involving the capacity of mobile devices in the west, it has not been released outside Japan.|$|E
50|$|Fun House was <b>a</b> board <b>game</b> <b>that</b> {{is based}} on the American children's game show of the same name.

5|$|Despite being <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that</b> used a {{graphical}} display, the cathode-ray tube {{amusement device}} {{is generally not}} considered under most definitions to {{be a candidate for}} the first video game, as it used purely analog hardware and did not run on a computing device; some loose definitions may still consider it a video game, but it is still usually disqualified as the device was never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to other games in the early history of video games. As the device was never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any other games and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings {{that are designed to}} manipulate the Steam storefront and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that</b> has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.|$|E
5|$|Development of Silent Hill {{started in}} September 1996. The game {{was created by}} Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that</b> would be {{successful}} in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for Silent Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers {{did not know how to}} proceed with the Silent Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>that</b> would appeal to the emotions of players instead.|$|E
