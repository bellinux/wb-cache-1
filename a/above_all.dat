5|$|Beecham's {{repertoire}} was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers {{whose works}} were neglected in Britain {{before he became}} their advocate, such as Delius and Berlioz. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were Haydn, Schubert, Sibelius and the composer he revered <b>above</b> <b>all</b> others, Mozart.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí was {{inspired}} <b>above</b> <b>all</b> by mediaeval Gothic art, {{but wanted to}} improve on its structural solutions. Neo-gothic {{was one of the}} most successful historicist styles at that time, <b>above</b> <b>all</b> as a result of the theoretical studies of Viollet-le-Duc. Gaudí studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in León and Burgos, and became convinced that it was an imperfect style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated the need of buttresses through the use of ruled surfaces, and abolished crenellations and excessive openwork.|$|E

5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the novella, in which Candide finally dismisses his tutor's optimism, leaves unresolved what philosophy the protagonist is to accept in its stead.

5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Christian life, stressed Escrivá, is divine filiation: Christians are children of God, identified with Christ's life and mission. Other main features of Opus Dei, according to its official literature, are: freedom, respecting choice and taking personal responsibility; and charity, love of God <b>above</b> <b>all</b> and love of others.|$|E

5|$|Although Sicily was lost, {{the general}} Nikephoros Phokas the Elder succeeded in taking Taranto {{and much of}} Calabria in 880, forming the nucleus for the later Catepanate of Italy.

5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. <b>Above</b> <b>all,</b> however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1920s saw {{a slight}} growth in traffic, the network's {{expansion}} {{slowed to a}} halt. Private motoring had arrived {{to put an end}} to its monopoly. The rising power of buses and trolleybuses, the Great Depression in France, and <b>above</b> <b>all</b> the Second World War that ravaged Rouen and Normandy, condemned the tramway to death. The last trams stopped running in 1953, after seventy-six years of service. However, in 1994, a new Rouen tramway came to the Norman capital.|$|E
5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony <b>above</b> <b>all</b> other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his writing, {{at the time of his}} death Wallace had been for many years a {{well-known}} figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics. He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the Order of Merit in 1908. <b>Above</b> <b>all,</b> his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. <b>Above</b> <b>all,</b> he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
5|$|Constantine I {{completed}} {{the separation of}} military commands from the administrative structure. The vicarii and praefecti praetorio lost their field commands and became purely administrative officials.

It is unclear whether the duces on the border now reported direct to the emperor, or to one of the two magistri of the comitatus.|$|E
