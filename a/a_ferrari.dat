5|$|Along with {{single-seater}} racing, Rindt took up {{sports car}} racing in the mid-1960s. Rindt {{started at the}} 24 Hours of Le Mans {{a total of four}} times. At his debut in 1964, sharing <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari</b> 250LM with David Piper, the car retired too early for Rindt even to take the wheel.|$|E
5|$|Overall, he {{competed in}} 62 Grands Prix, winning six and {{achieving}} 13 podium finishes. He was also successful in sports car racing, winning the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans paired with Masten Gregory in <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari</b> 250LM.|$|E

5|$|He {{attended}} several Grands Prix {{during the}} season. Schumacher drove the Ferrari F2007 {{for the first}} time on 24 October at Ferrari's home track in Fiorano, Italy. He ran no more than five laps and no lap times were recorded. <b>A</b> <b>Ferrari</b> spokesman said the short drive was done for the Fiat board of directors who were holding their meeting in Maranello.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Rindt drove, {{again in}} <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari</b> 250LM, at the 500 {{kilometre}} race at Zeltweg. He {{was able to}} win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of Mike Parkes owing to a special lever that manually activated the brake lights. Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes to brake earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher, Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne, and Jean Todt (hired in 1993), {{have been}} {{credited}} as turning this once struggling team {{into the most}} successful team in Formula One history. Three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart believes {{the transformation of the}} Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat. Eddie Irvine also joined the team, moving from Jordan. During winter testing, Schumacher first drove <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari,</b> their 1995 Ferrari 412 T2, and was two seconds faster than former regulars Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger had been.|$|E

5|$|Sebastian Vettel led <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari</b> 1-2 {{in third}} {{practice}} ahead of Räikkönen, setting {{a time of}} 1:31.683. The two Mercedes drivers of Rosberg and Hamilton followed, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Romain Grosjean. On the soft compound tyres, both Mercedes drivers had set identical times, before Rosberg edged out Hamilton on the super-softs. Higher temperatures {{in the afternoon sun}} meant that the times dropped from second practice. Felipe Massa ran a new, shorter nase for Williams, but managed only the ninth fastest time, more than half a second slower than teammate Bottas. Not running the super-soft tyres, Toro Rosso got its two drivers on 15th and 16th place respectively. Jolyon Palmer was 20th fastest before puncturing a tyre {{at the end of the}} session.|$|E
5|$|Menem {{began his}} {{presidency}} assuming a non-confrontational approach, and appointing {{people from the}} conservative opposition, and business people to his cabinet. To prevent successful legal cases against the projected privatizations, the Supreme Court's numbers were increased from five to nine judges; the new judges ruled in support of Menem and usually had the majority. Other institutions that restrained or limited executive power were controlled as well. When Congress resisted some of his proposals, he used the Necessity and Urgency Decree {{as an alternative to}} send bills to it. He even considered it feasible to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, but this step was never implemented. In addition, he developed a bon vivant lifestyle, taking advantage of his authority. For instance, he made a journey from Buenos Aires to Pinamar driving <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari</b> Testarossa in less than two hours, violating speed limits. He divorced his wife Zulema Yoma and expanded the Quinta de Olivos presidential residence with a golf course, a small zoo, servants, barber, and even a buffoon.|$|E

5|$|On September 2009, Glickenhaus {{announced}} {{his intention to}} race {{a new version of}} the P4/5 in the 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring. The car, called the P4/5 Competizione, would not be a conversion of his road car but instead an entirely new car with <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari</b> chassis, VIN and drivetrain. On May 2010 however, it was revealed that the Competizione would in fact be raced in 2011, based on a 430 Scuderia. It would be built to FIA GT2 standards and raced by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in an Experimental Class under the direction of Paolo Garella, former Head of Special Projects at Pininfarina. Ferrari completely distanced themselves from the P4/5 Competizione project in 2011, refusing to sell the team parts for vital engine rebuilds between races. The car finished 39th in the 2011 24 Hours Nürburgring (after bursting into flames) and in 2012 won its class and finished 12th overall.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Grande Prêmio do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 March 1995 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil. It was the firstround of the 1995 Formula One season. The 71-lap {{race was}} won by Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team after {{starting}} from second position. David Coulthard {{finished second in}} a Williams, with Gerhard Berger third in <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari.</b> Damon Hill, who started the race from pole position, spun out while leading on lap30 with an apparent gearbox problem, which was later {{found to be a}} suspension failure. Schumacher's win came despite Benetton encountering steering problems with his car during Friday practice, leading to him crashing heavily and necessitating steering component changes {{for the rest of the}} event. Despite Schumacher's victory, Hill proved to be faster during the race, and seemed to be on course for a comfortable victory before his sudden retirement.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen {{continued}} with Opel into the 1983 season, now driving the Manta 400, which {{took advantage of}} the new Group B regulations. Although the Manta was a Group B car, it was underpowered against the likes of the Audi Quattro A2 and Lancia 037, which were controlling the world rally scene at the time. Toivonen achieved a win at the Manx International Rally, a round of the British Open Rally Championship and the European Rally Championship, in the Isle of Man, at his first attempt. He also finished first at the Mille Pistes rally in France, but the organisers decided to ban the Group B cars halfway through the event. Toivonen and his co-driver, Ian Grindrod, received only a consolation trophy. In the World Rally Championship, he retired in three rallies, finished sixth at the Monte Carlo Rally and fourth at the Rallye Sanremo. He also drove <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari</b> 308 GTB at the San Marino Rally, where he was co-driven by Juha Piironen for the first time. The pair retired from the event, but Piironen would become his main co-driver for the next two seasons, and later have a long and successful partnership with four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen. In late October, Toivonen again competed on the circuits. This time he entered two sportscar races, driving a Porsche 956 for Richard Lloyd Racing in the World Sportscar Championship. Partnered with Derek Bell and Jonathan Palmer, he finished fourth at Imola and third in the next race at Mugello.|$|E

25|$|From 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 also counted {{toward the}} FIA's World Championship of Drivers (now synonymous with Formula One), {{although}} few drivers {{participated in the}} other races of that series. Italian driver Alberto Ascari was the only European-based driver to actually race in the 500 during its World Championship years. His appearance in 1952 in <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari</b> was also the only time <b>a</b> <b>Ferrari</b> has ever appeared in the race. Juan Manuel Fangio practiced at the track in 1958 but declined an offer to race.|$|E
