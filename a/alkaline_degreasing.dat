40|$|The centerpieces of NKK’s {{new series}} of {{environmentally}} friendly steel sheets, a new chromium-free coated steel sheet “GEO-FRONTIER COAT ” and a new chromium-free prepainted steel sheet “GEO-FRONTIER EXCEL COAT”, have been developed. The major advantage of “GEO-FRONTIER COAT ” {{is that it has}} excellent corrosion resistance comparable to conventional chromate coated steel sheets even after <b>alkaline</b> <b>degreasing.</b> This property is due to a proprietary organic composite coating. It is a new product with a good balance of corrosion resistance, electrical grounding properties, and is easy to weld. While developing “GEO-FRONTIER EXCEL COAT”, a new type of primer coating was designed in order to achieve excellent corrosion resistance comparable to that provided by the conventional chromate-based prepainted steel sheet...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to study the effect of surface mild steel {{preparation}} on its electrochemical behaviour in neutral chloride solution without and with an inorganic inhibitor. Various surface preparations are examined: <b>alkaline</b> <b>degreasing,</b> acid pickling and polishing. Open circuit potential measurements and potentiodynamic polarisations are used as corrosion monitoring techniques. The effect of chloride concentration is evaluated. The ability of inorganic inhibitors (Na 2 MoO 4, NaNO 2, Na 2 WO 4 and Na 2 VO 3) to stabilise the passive state of steel in chloride containing solutions is assessed by electrochemical and surface analysis techniques. The results reveal that, among the four inhibitors studied, the sodium molybdate is the best environmentally friendly corrosion inorganic inhibitor for steel. © 2013 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of heat-exchangers, it is of great importance that the heat-exchanger plates be thoroughly cleaned before being sealed. At a Swedish heat-exchanger manufacturer, oil, grease and other impurities are removed in a washing plant consisting of three stages: a degreasing tank and two rinsing tanks. The possibility of improving the cleanliness of the heat-exchanger plates, without increasing the need for fresh water, by treating the rinsing water in a reverse osmosis (RO) plant, was studied in this investigation. A new, high-temperature-resistant, thin-film RO membrane from Osmonics-Desal {{was used in the}} experiments. The influence of a lubricant, based on a block copolymer, and an <b>alkaline</b> <b>degreasing</b> agent on the membrane performance was studied. The flux reduction of a model rinsing solution with time was moderate. The flux after 500 h of continuous treatment at 65 degrees C and 4. 0 MPa was 351 /m(2) h, and the permeate quality fulfilled the demands of the heat-exchanger manufacturer...|$|E

40|$|Even though highly {{corrosion}} resistant in general, AlMgSi (6000 -series) alloys may sometimes develop susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC). In this work {{the effect of}} Cu content and various thermomechanical treatments on IGC of AlMgSi model alloy extrusions of nominal composition 0. 55 wt% Mg and 0. 60 wt%Si was investigated. The corrosion susceptibility was tested according to the standard BS 11846 method B, which essentially involved <b>degreasing,</b> <b>alkaline</b> etching, desmutting in concentrated HNO 3 and 24 h immersion in an acidified NaCl solution. The validity of this test as a reliable laboratory tool for qualitative ranking of samples for IGC susceptibility was verified by comparing it to results obtained by outdoor exposure in an industrial-marine environment at Karmøy, located {{on the coast of}} Norway The most important factor causing IGC susceptibility of the model alloys was the Cu content. The high Cu models were susceptible to IGC, although the Cu content was as low as 0. 12 – 0. 17 wt. % Cu. Model alloys with low Cu content (0. 005 – 0. 02 wt. %) were resistant. However, the corrosion mode of the high Cu alloys was strongly related to the thermomechanical history. Therefore, by applying the correct heat treatment, it was possible to reduce or eliminate IGC susceptibility also on the high Cu samples. Samples which were slow-cooled (air cooling) after extrusion and samples which were subsequently solution heat treated gave the most susceptible variants where nearly all grain boundaries exposed to the corrosive test solution were attacked (uniform IGC). Artificial aging reduced the IGC susceptibility by confining the intergranular attacks to localised sites (localised IGC), and near fully resistance to localised corrosion developed in the peak aged temper. Rapid quenching (water quenching) after extrusion prevented IGC, but high susceptibility (uniform IGC) was introduced as a result of short time aging. Further aging to peak hardness reduced IGC susceptibility (local IGC), but did not remove it completely. Overaging introduced slight pitting susceptibility to the air cooled extrusion. In contrast overaging reintroduced localised IGC to the solution heat treated air cooled samples. The solution heat treated and water quenched samples were susceptible to localised IGC both in the the T 6 temper (peak aged) and in the overaged temper. The grain boundary microstructure was also strongly dependent on the thermal history. Samples which were slow-cooled (air cooling) after extrusion and samples which were subsequently solution heat treated exhibited extensive precipitation of large (_ 5 μm) elongated grain boundary precipitates of the equilibrium phases _ (Mg 2 Si) and Q (Al 4 Mg 8 Si 7 Cu 2). The Q-phase was however not present on the low Cu alloys. The shape and size of these precipitates were not affected by artificial aging. On the high Cu alloy, a Cu enriched grain boundary film was additionally present. This film coarsened as a result of artificial aging. Water quenching after extrusion effectively prevented grain boundary precipitation, and this could thus explain the observed resistance of the water quenched high Cu alloys to IGC. Small grain boundary Q-phase precipitates evolved as a result of artificial aging of water quenched samples, which explained slight deterioration of IGC resistance of such samples. The susceptibility to IGC was related to enriched Cu along the grain boundaries, in the form of discrete Q-phase precipitates and the continuous Cu enriched film. IGC was caused by a microgalvanic coupling between the Cu enriched grain boundary (noble) and the adjacent solute depleted zone (active). The Cu containing film formed a continuous cathodic path on the grain boundaries, which resulted in significant (uniform) IGC, characterised by knife-edge attacks along the grain boundaries. Increased IGC resistance was obtained by artificial aging which coarsened the film and broke the continuous microgalvanic path, resulting in coarse localised IGC or a surface virtually resistant to all forms of localised corrosion. The present work showed that IGC can be avoided or eliminated either by reducing the Cu content or applying the correct thermomechanical treatment. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of washing chemicals used at car washes on the flux {{and retention of}} three ultrafiltration (UF) membranes has been studied. Eleven commercial degreasing agents, two shampoo agents and a wax {{were included in the}} investigation. The membrane performance when treating waste water collected at a car wash at different times of the year was also studied. The retention of the different chemicals varied greatly, but {{there was no significant difference}} in COD retention among the three UF membranes. The highest flux was observed when treating the <b>alkaline</b> <b>degreasing</b> agents and the shampoo solutions. The flux and COD retention when treating the waste water from the car wash were 30 - 50 l/m(2) h and 60 %, respectively. One of the low-retention degreasing agents was treated by nanofiltration (NF). The retention was significantly higher when using NF, but the COD concentration in the permeate was still too high to allow the permeate to be discharged without further treatment...|$|E
40|$|Ultrafiltration of {{emulsified}} oil {{in water}} wastestreams from waste cutting and grinding operations, waste rolling oil solutions, and <b>alkaline</b> <b>degreasing</b> baths can produce an effluent water phase that is acceptable for discharge to sewer systems. Since ultrafiltration membranes {{act as a}} physical barrier between the wastestream and the clean water effluent, operator or flow caused upsets are prevented, ensuring no carryover of oil to the effluent. The effluent (permeate) from the ultrafiltration system is usually of sufficient quality for discharge to a sanitary sewer system. The permeate, as a rule, contains less than 100 mgll of freon-extractable oil and grease and less than 10 mgll suspended solids. The ultrafiltration process also produces a liquid oil concentrate containing up to 60 % oil and solids, which can be disposed of by hauling or incineration. The concentrate will be only 3. 5 % of the original volume. No sludge containing large amounts of chemicals and heavy metals is produced in ultrafiltration because no such chemicals are required as in other methods of treating oily emulsions. Ultrafiltration {{has been found to}} be the most costeffective treatment method for treatment of oillwater emulsions in many applications...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{evaluation}} {{of the quality of}} the surface treatment on the service life of the experimental samples. We have tested two sets of samples, which was pre-treated by the different ways. We have used one kind of material – laboratory used material Q-panel Fe - for the experiment. The material was pre-treated by mechanical pretreatment (soft blasting) and chemical pre-treatments (<b>alkaline</b> <b>degreasing,</b> ferric phosphate and zirconium nanopassivation). For all samples it was measured the thickness of the coated layer before insertion into the spray chamber at five points of the each experimental sample and for all chemical pre-treatments was measured surface roughness. The results are summarized in tables and graphs. Then the samples were placed in to corrosion chamber and subjected to salt spray corrosion test. The sample loading time was chosen according to the standard for 480, 720 and 1000 hours. The samples were compared with each other and their status was evaluated after corrosive load in corrosion chamber after removal from the corrosive environment. Experimental samples were statistically evaluated according to the thickness measurement of coated layer, chemical pre-treatment surface roughness and their effect on the corrosion resistance of painted sheet metal.
