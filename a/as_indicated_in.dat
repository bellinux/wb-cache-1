5|$|After resigning {{from the}} presidency, Suharto reclused {{himself in his}} family {{compound}} in the Menteng area of Jakarta, protected by soldiers and rarely making public appearances. Suharto's family {{spend much of their}} time fending-off corruption investigations. However, Suharto himself was protected from serious prosecution by politicians who owed their positions to the former president, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> the leaked telephone conversation between President Habibie and attorney-general Andi Muhammad Ghalib in February 1999.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians, where {{regionally}} accessible, {{have been}} found in the river otter's diet during the spring and summer months, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> many of the food habit studies. The most common amphibians recognized were frogs (Rana and Hyla). Specific species of reptiles and amphibians prey include: boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata); Canadian toads (Bufo hemiophrys); wood frogs (Rana sylvatica); bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana); green frogs (Rana clamitans); northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile); Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus); rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa); and garter snakes (Thamnophis).|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> {{the table}} below, each basin uses a {{separate}} system of terminology, {{which can make}} comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur. It {{should also be noted}} that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> {{the temple}} records, the priests {{of the temple}} were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to Nambudiri community, a {{religious}} group common in modern Kerala. When {{the last of the}} ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs. The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer and a publicity officer to assist the chief executive officer.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{documentation}} {{that allows}} us to reconstruct a genealogy of artists after Gasparo, from his son Simone onwards. Though little information is available about Simone, it appears that no works are attributed directly to him; rather, he appears to have worked as a builder when outside his father's workshop. In a bill dated 1534, Simone declares his age as 38, born in 1496, and around twenty years of age on his father's death. He also cites his firstborn son Gasparo, twelve years old, in turn a sculptor, his wife Catlina, sister of the engraver Andrea Testi of Manerbio. A daughter of Gasparo, Giulia, became the wife of an artisan potter, while a third child, Giovanni Antonio, was a qualified goldsmith, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> a deed relating Stefano Lamberti and Bernardino delle Croci.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} hypotheses {{exist in}} Egyptology {{to describe the}} succession of events running from the death of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty, to the coronation of Nyuserre Ini, the sixth ruler of the dynasty. Relying on historical sources, where Nyuserre {{is said to have}} directly succeeded Neferefre, many Egyptologists such as Jürgen von Beckerath and Hartwig Altenmüller have traditionally believed that the following succession took place: Neferirkare Kakai → Shepseskare → Neferefre → Nyuserre Ini. In this scenario, Neferefre is the father of Nyuserre, who would have become pharaoh after Neferefre's unexpected death. Neferefre would be the successor of Shepseskare, credited with seven years of reign, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>in</b> Manetho's Aegyptiaca.|$|E
