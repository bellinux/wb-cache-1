5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they {{believe that it is}} necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|While not {{uncommon}} in predominantly Catholic cultures, Christian metal is rooted in evangelical Protestantism, beginning {{as a means of}} evangelism among the non-Christian metal scene. Over the years the focus changed because of the increased secularization of Christianity in the West during the 1990s. Moberg (2008) notes that the current scene seems to have very little interest in evangelism, especially in Northern Europe. Instead, it is argued that the current Christian metal music scene ultimately provides its core members with important resources for the shaping of an alternative and complementary form of religious expression and practice and an alternative Christian identity. Thus, Moberg states that Christian metal serves four main purposes: an alternative form of religious expression and identity; as a legitimate form of religious expression; as <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> evangelism and fighting and standing up for the Christian faith; as a positive alternative to non-Christian metal.|$|E

25|$|Cell {{suicide is}} <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> {{stemming}} {{the spread of}} a pathogen throughout an organism. In apoptotic responses to infection, the contents of an infected cell (including the pathogen) are contained and engulfed by phagocytosis. Some pathogens, such as human cytomegalovirus, express caspase inhibitors that arrest the apoptotic machinery of the host cell. The caspase-independence of necroptosis allows the cell to bypass caspase activation, decreasing the time during which the pathogen can inhabit the cell.|$|E
25|$|Although certain control {{methods are}} {{effective}} on other root-feeding arthropods, control measures for sugarbeet root aphids are more difficult. Crop rotation and simple foliar and postemergence insecticides are usually ineffective. However, Knox Out 2FM and Counter 15G {{have proven to}} be effective in containing infestations, although some states, such as California, currently have no chemicals registered for use on the sugarbeet root aphid. Biological controls, such as introduction of fungal diseases or natural predators, may also serve as <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> pest control. Although it is unlikely that biological controls are fully capable of controlling sugarbeet root aphid populations, future research may increase their role in management.|$|E

25|$|Anoxic {{regeneration}} of NAD+ is only <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> {{energy production}} during short, intense exercise in vertebrates, {{for a period}} ranging from 10 seconds to 2 minutes during a maximal effort in humans. (At lower exercise intensities it can sustain muscle activity in diving animals, such as seals, whales and other aquatic vertebrates, for very much longer periods of time.) Under these conditions NAD+ is replenished by NADH donating its electrons to pyruvate to form lactate. This produces 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, or about 5% of glucose's energy potential (38 ATP molecules in bacteria). But {{the speed at which}} ATP is produced in this manner is about 100 times that of oxidative phosphorylation. The pH in the cytoplasm quickly drops when hydrogen ions accumulate in the muscle, eventually inhibiting the enzymes involved in glycolysis.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{existing}} narrow gauge between Stirling North and Port Augusta {{had been removed}} many years earlier, {{the challenge for the}} PRRPS was to develop <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> reinstating the narrow gauge in to Port Augusta. The greatest aspect to this challenge was how to cross over what remains of the standard gauge line to Marree, which has since been truncated at Leigh Creek {{with the opening of the}} newer standard gauge line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs in 1980. This line to Leigh Creek is exclusively used for transporting coal from Leigh Creek to Northern Power Station, and branches off the main standard gauge network at Stirling North. Many options for crossing this line were investigated, including a draw bridge arrangement, diamond crossovers and an underpass. The final decision was an underpass, passing below the Leigh Creek coal train line, which greatly reduced the amount of safe working interfacing with the standard gauge line. Diagram.|$|E
