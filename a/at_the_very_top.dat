The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, {{and the fact that it}} is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes.

5|$|As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some {{similarity}} {{with the}} flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, {{blue and red}} tricolor, but {{that is where the}} similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, the ratio of the stripes were set at 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was set at 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the coat of arms is only changed {{in the middle of the}} flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces. For Venezuela, the basic design was to have all three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to change their flag with white stars instead of a coat of arms. A coat of arms was not added to the national flag 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the coat of arms. The position of the coat of arms on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus lambei and L. magnicristatus, {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation, {{were members of}} a diverse and {{well-documented}} fauna of prehistoric animals that included such well-known dinosaurs as the horned Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Chasmosaurus, fellow duckbills Prosaurolophus, Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus, and armored Edmontonia and Euoplocephalus. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms. The anatomically similar L. lambei, L. magnicristatus, and Corythosaurus were separated by time within the formation, based on stratigraphy. Corythosaurus fossils are known from the lower two-thirds of the Formation, L. lambei fossils {{are present in the}} upper third, and L. magnicristatus remains are rare and present only <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top,</b> where the marine influence was greater.|$|E

Although the narration of the series describes them as [...] "green men," [...] their color varies from scene to scene (including other colors such as orange, tan, and blue). Their skin has black spots, or in some scenes, circles. Their pudgy bodies are pear-shaped. Their onion-shaped heads are bald, save for tufts of hair <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>tops.</b> They have no noses (Cloyd remarks that they have no sense of smell because of this) and they have no visible external ears. Cloyd displays a toothy smile; whatever mouth Gidney may have is concealed by a shaggy mustache. Cloyd wears a belt and holster for his scrootch gun (which has the power to immobilize its targets for a variable length of time). They are otherwise unclothed. Both Gidney and Cloyd possess the ability to disappear and reappear at will; they can disappear completely, but at times their eyes, and/or Cloyd's mouth, may remain visible (in the manner of the Cheshire cat's smile).|$|R
5000|$|Worm drives {{have been}} used in a few {{automotive}} rear-axle final drives (though not the differential itself). They took advantage of the location of <b>the</b> gear being <b>at</b> either <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> or <b>very</b> bottom of <b>the</b> differential crown wheel. In the 1910s they were common on trucks; to gain the most clearance on muddy roads the worm gear was placed on top. In the 1920s the Stutz firm used them on its cars; to have a lower floor than its competitors, the gear was located on the bottom. An example from around 1960 was the Peugeot 404. The worm gear carries the differential gearing, which protects the vehicle against rollback. This ability has largely fallen from favour due to the higher-than-necessary reduction ratios.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] As job-based health {{coverage}} declines and employers shift ever-growing health costs onto employees, workers increasingly must turn to taxpayer-funded programs like Medicaid {{to get health}} care {{for themselves and their}} families. Meanwhile, Medicaid is wrestling with explosive cost growth, increasing 56 percent since 2000. Medicaid is the second largest expense for most states, accounting for around 16 percent of state budgets, on average. States’ spending on the program is expected to grow almost 12 percent this year, four times faster than the increase in states’ general fund spending. Recent studies in 13 states have examined the extent to which employers’ workers utilize public health programs to secure {{health coverage}} for themselves and their families. As the following summary of those analyses reflects, in each one of these states, Wal-Mart ranks <b>at</b> or near <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> list of employers that are shifting to the public the cost of providing health care for their workers.

These platforms contain records of rapid interglacial climate change and are useful in studying the impacts of climate change on similar tropical carbonate environments. Blue holes are dissolution lakes that may be beneficial for understanding climate change and anthropogenic impact. A δ 13 C and δ 18 O study was conducted on lake sediment core samples from Watling’s Blue Hole and Blue Hole Five on San Salvador Island, Bahamas. These lakes are located in a failed housing development and Watling’s Blue Hole was once part of an early 19 th century plantation which modified {{the landscape of the}} surrounding watershed.

The 1986 event was one where {{a number of the}} leaders ran on fumes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> end; <b>top</b> three drivers Piquet, Senna and Prost were all running out of fuel and although Brazilians Piquet and Senna finished 1-2, Prost finished sixth after his car was completely drained of fuel. The 1988 race was run in wet conditions; these conditions were particularly treacherous <b>at</b> Hockenheim because <b>the</b> circuit ran through a forest and the thick moisture from the rain tended to hang in the air because of the trees that surrounded the track. Even when it was not raining, the track still did not dry. Senna (now driving a McLaren) took advantage of his skill in the wet to win over his teammate Prost. The 1989 race was near the height Prost and Senna's famous rivalry and this race was one where the two McLaren teammates drove on their absolute limits throughout the entire race. Prost's gearbox malfunctioned and lost use of sixth gear on the second to last lap and Senna passed him to take the victory. Senna won the next year's race as well from Italian Alessandro Nannini. The 1992 race saw further changes to the Ostkurve after a crash that Érik Comas had there in 1991; it was turned into a more complex chicane rather than simple left-right chicane with a tyre wall in the middle. 1994 saw a further change to the third chicane to make it slower {{in the aftermath of the}} 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.1995 saw German Michael Schumacher win, he was the first German to win his home race since Rudolf Caracciola in 1939. Formula One interest in Germany had peaked during the emergence of Schumacher. 1997 saw an exceptional win by Austrian Gerhard Berger. But the 2000 race was to play host to a number of problems.

And on the far side of the circuit (where the Ost-Kurve was) it was dry, but in the stadium section and the pits, it was pouring with rain.
