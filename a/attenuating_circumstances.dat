In recent years, Jordan has amended its Criminal Code to modify its laws which used to offer a complete defense for honor killings.|$|E

50|$|On 23 July 1951, the Court sentenced Stroop and Franz Konrad {{to death}} by hanging. In passing sentence, the Court declared,Since the {{character}} and magnitude of Stroop's crimes, his attitude and his twisted explanations not only indicate a total lack of repentance but actually confirm that he retains his Nazi view of the world, the Court is unable to find the slightest <b>attenuating</b> <b>circumstance</b> in the accused Stroop's conduct.

40|$|On June 20, 2016, the United States Supreme Court held in Utah v. Strieff that {{evidence}} discovered incident to an unconstitutional arrest {{of an individual}} should not be suppressed given that the subsequent discovery of an outstanding warrant attenuated the taint from the unlawful detention. Approximately two weeks later the issue of aggressive policing was again thrust into the national spotlight when two African-American individuals—Alton Sterling and Philando Castile—were killed by policemen in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Falcon Heights, Minnesota, respectively, under questionable circumstances. Though connected by proximity in time, this article will demonstrate that these events are also—and much more importantly—connected by decades of Supreme Court jurisprudence. It will describe how since before {{the close of the}} Warren Court in 1969 the Supreme Court began a process of expanding police powers, restricting individual Fourth Amendment safeguards, and encouraging officers to engage in unconstitutional investigative practices. The article will proceed with a particularized focus upon the Supreme Court’s exclusionary rule and standing jurisprudence, and its discussion of Strieff will take place in this broader context. It will explain how the decline of the exclusionary rule and the attendant standing doctrine {{over the course of several}} decades has helped foster a culture of aggressive police practices. It will illuminate how the Court’s steady expansion of police investigative authority, coupled with its increasing willingness to forgive constitutional missteps by the government, have encouraged the police to engage in unconstitutional practices and to test the outer limits of acceptable police behaviors. When viewed in this context, Strieff is the latest in a series of Supreme Court cases that have implicitly encouraged aggressive police conduct. Strieff is a most unfortunate and perilous expansion of the <b>attenuated</b> <b>circumstances</b> doctrine. Though accurately cast as a case that encourages unconstitutional detentions by the police, a more apt description of Streiff is that it promotes physical contact with individuals by the police without just cause. In contrast to the Court’s good faith exception and <b>attenuated</b> <b>circumstances</b> cases that preceded it, Strieff breaks disturbing new ground; it creates an incentive for officers to get within close proximity of individuals, to detain them unconstitutionally, and to risk unnecessary physical confrontation. At a time when officer aggression has ignited national controversy and irritation in communities (particularly minority) from coast to coast, Strieff delivers the wrong message at the wrong time...|$|R

He was tried by the Supreme National Tribunal at the Auschwitz Trial in Kraków and was found guilty of perpetrating the genocide of the Jews, but the court sentenced him to life imprisonment as opposed to death.

5000|$|Fénéon {{received}} {{support from}} the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, who qualified him as a [...] "fine spirit" [...] {{and one of the}} [...] "more subtile critique" [...] (un esprit très fin et un des critiques les plus subtils et les plus aigus que nous avons). Debates continued during one week. The general prosecutor Bulot intended to prove that there had been an effective agreement between theoreticians and illegalists, but failed to do so for lack of evidence. He abandoned the accusations for some of them, and claimed <b>attenuating</b> <b>circumstances</b> for others, but requested harsh sentences for those he depicted as the leaders: Grave, Faure, Matha and some others. Finally, the jury acquitted all, except the common law prisoners, Ortiz, Chericotti, Bertani, respectively condemned to 15 and 8 years of forced labour and to six months of prison.|$|E
50|$|The {{practical}} {{effect of}} this decision is rather limited. The case presented a rather <b>attenuated</b> set of <b>circumstances.</b> However, the reasoning continues to be reaffirmed. See, e.g., Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U.S. 113 (1998). In Knowles, the Supreme Court held that the search of an automobile violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments where, following the issuance of a traffic citation, and notwithstanding the permissibility of effecting a full custodial arrest for the infraction at issue, police did not arrest the suspect. According to the court, once the citation was issued, no {{further evidence of the}} offense was needed to prosecute. Thus, the need for a Cupp detention and search was not present.|$|R
40|$|Contact {{dermatitis}} may {{be either}} irritant, allergic or both. The differential diagnosis {{is based on}} information from the patient, nature and concentration of chemicals involved and clinical examination. In case of suspicion of allergic contact dermatitis, {{the search for the}} responsible allergen(s) is built on patch testing. Positive patch test results, the current and/or past relevance of which has to be assessed, are confirmative. Additional tests, such as the repeated open application test, are sometimes recommended. Treatment which is symptomatic, is mainly based upon corticosteroids, either local or systemic; efficacy is rather limited. By any means, it cannot be substituted to the eviction of allergens. Primary and secondary prevention are linked with the complete eviction of allergens, but this caveat can be <b>attenuated</b> in some <b>circumstances...</b>|$|R
40|$|Knockout (KO) mice {{that lack}} the {{dopamine}} transporter (SL 6 A 3; DAT) display increased locomotion {{that can be}} <b>attenuated,</b> under some <b>circumstances,</b> by administration of drugs that normally produce psychostimulant-like effects, such as amphetamine and methylphenidate. These results have led to suggestions that DAT KO mice may model features of {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and that these drugs may act upon serotonin (5 -HT) systems to produce these unusual locomotor decreasing effects. Evidence from patterns of brain expression and initial pharmacologic studies led us to use genetic and pharmacologic approaches to examine the influence of altered 5 -HT 1 B receptor activity on hyperactivity in DAT KO mice. Heterozygous 5 -HT 1 B KO and pharmacologic 5 -HT 1 B antagonism both attenuated locomotor hyperactivity in DAT KO mice. Furthermore, DAT KO mice with reduced, but not eliminated, 5 -HT 1 B receptor expression regained cocaine-stimulated locomotion, which was absent in DAT KO mice with normal levels of 5 -HT 1 B receptor expression. Further experiments demonstrated that the degree of habituation to the testing apparatus determined whether cocaine had no effect on locomotion in DAT KO or reduced locomotion, helping to resolve differences among prior reports. These findings of complementation of the locomotor effects of DAT KO by reducing 5 -HT 1 B receptor activity underscore roles for interactions between specific 5 -HT receptors and dopamine (DA) systems in basal and cocaine-stimulated locomotion and support evaluation of 5 -HT 1 B antagonists as potential, non-stimulant ADHD therapeutics...|$|R
5000|$|The Blochausen {{government}} tackled {{reform of}} the penal justice system. The penal code that was in force at the time, dated from 1810, and was no longer suited {{to the needs of}} the time. There were two models available to the Luxembourgish reformers: the German code of 1870, or the Belgian code of 1867. In his report to the Lieutenant-Governor Prince Henry in 1875, the Director-General for Justice Alphonse Funck recommended the adoption of the Belgian model: [...] "Our constitution, or most important social and political laws were drawn from Belgian legislation; our ideas and our needs are close to those of our neighbours to the West …." [...] The Belgian penal code was finally introduced in Luxembourg in 1879 with some adaptations. This eliminated the excesses of criminal theories founded exclusively on reparation and utility, and granted a more important place to <b>attenuating</b> <b>circumstances.</b>|$|E

50|$|In April 1950 the {{communist}} regime forbade religious orders within its borders and began to send their members to concentration camps. Zeman arranged for Salesians to travel to Turin - despite it being a grave risk since it was illegal - so that these religious could complete their studies without fear of persecution or suppression. He organized two such expeditions (one in August 1950 and another on 23 October 1950) for over 60 Salesians though the third attempt in April 1951 saw him and others arrested. He was subjected to a severe trial and {{was described as a}} traitor to the nation and risked receiving the death sentence though in consideration of some <b>attenuating</b> <b>circumstances</b> - on 22 February 1952 - he was sentenced to imprisonment until 1977 though received parole on 10 March 1964.

30|$|Excessive {{gambling}} {{has traditionally}} been associated in Chinese propaganda campaigns with the “scourges” of prostitution, drugs, and criminality. <b>Attenuating</b> <b>circumstances</b> such as mental illness are not recognized in explanations of the marginal behaviour in individuals; only poor social influences are considered {{as the source of}} the deviance and with that comes condemnation and punishment, sometimes re-education, constituting the main means of intervention. As Sing Lee says, in Chinese society, “people who gamble immoderately and ruin their life are considered bad rather than mad” (Lee, 1996). Gambling as a form of betting (with more or less significant wagers required) is so widespread that “only very extreme addicts are identified.” According to Wei Shujie (2000), a Shanghai psychologist who specializes in the trans-cultural study of mental illness, considering Western criteria, {{a large part of the}} population is at high risk, if not excessive gamblers, without knowing it.|$|E
