50|$|On 9 October 2009, the CAA {{issued a}} press release {{requesting}} the public's assistance in finding <b>a</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> {{from one of the}} engines. The cap, which possibly separated from the engine during takeoff, could not be found at the crash site or at the airport.|$|E
5000|$|A {{crankcase}} {{often has}} {{an opening in}} the bottom to which an oil pan is attached with a gasketed bolted joint. Some crankcase designs fully surround the crank's main bearing journals, whereas many others form only one half, with <b>a</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> forming the other. Some crankcase areas require no structural strength from the oil pan itself (in which case the oil pan is typically stamped from sheet steel), whereas other crankcase designs do (in which case the oil pan is a casting in its own right). Both the crankcase and any rigid cast oil pan often have reinforcing ribs cast into them, as well as bosses which are drilled and tapped to receive mounting screws/bolts for various other engine parts.|$|E
5000|$|The M21 is a {{circular}} U.S. anti-tank landmine {{that uses a}} Misznay Schardin effect warhead. The mine uses an M607 pressure fuse, which can be adapted as a tilt rod fuze. The mine is triggered either by pressure, or by the tilt rod being forced beyond 20 degrees from the vertical by a force of more than 1.7 kg, either of these actions results in pressure being transferred via <b>a</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> to a Belleville spring, which inverts, driving the firing pin into the M46 detonator. The M46 charge first ignites a black powder charge, which blows off the mine's cover, and clears any earth or debris {{that may have been}} on top of the mine. A fraction of a second later the main warhead detonates, driving and compressing a steel plate upwards, with enough force to penetrate 76 mm of armour at a distance of 530 mm. Approximately 200,000 M21 mines were produced in the U.S. and a licensed copies, the K441 and K442, were produced in South Korea.|$|E

50|$|Modena uses a {{different}} system {{to indicate the}} age of its balsamic vinegars (Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena). A white-coloured cap means the vinegar has aged for at least 12 years and <b>a</b> gold <b>cap</b> <b>bearing</b> the designation extravecchio (extra-old) shows the vinegar has aged for 25 years or more.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> cross-bolted <b>bearing</b> is <b>a</b> <b>bearing,</b> usually <b>a</b> {{crankshaft}} main <b>bearing</b> of <b>a</b> piston engine. Most <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> are {{retained by}} two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. <b>A</b> cross-bolted <b>bearing</b> has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> from each side.|$|R
50|$|Cystodermella is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Agaricaceae. The genus {{comprises}} about 12 species, noted for producing agaric fruit bodies, <b>bearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>cap,</b> white gills and stipe with a fine, ephemeral ring. The genus was devised by Harri Harmaja in 2002, dividing the older genus Cystoderma into three independent genera: Cystoderma, Ripartitella and Cystodermella largely {{on the basis of}} microscopic differences. Cystodermella species bear non-amyloid spores and sometimes cystidia. The spores, in contrast to Ripartitella are not echinulate.|$|R

Immediately the village headman grabbed him and accused him of poisoning the well. For three nights Huang was bound in a dark room, and paraded daily through the streets wearing <b>a</b> dunce <b>cap</b> <b>bearing</b> the legend [...] "Huang Xiang counterrevolutionary poisoner of wells." [...] He was only released when chemical analysis failed to detect any poison in the fish.|$|R

5|$|Amanita regalis, {{commonly}} known as the royal fly agaric or the king of Sweden Amanita, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family. Common in Scandinavian countries, it is also found in eastern and northern Europe. In North America, its distribution is restricted to Alaska. The fruit bodies of the fungus somewhat resemble the fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), and it was formerly regarded as a variety of this species. A.regalis differs from it in being larger, with <b>a</b> liver-brown <b>cap</b> <b>bearing</b> numerous scabs, and in having a stem which is yellow-ochre at the base, with patches or rings of patches. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains muscimol, the same psychoactive compound found in A.muscaria.|$|R
50|$|A 4-bolt main {{refers to}} the number of bolts {{attaching}} the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> to the block of an internal combustion engine. Four bolt mains are considered much stronger for high performance use than a 2 bolt main. Using 4 bolts to secure the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> reduces the amount of flex within the crankshaft as compared to 2 bolts.|$|R
5000|$|The Batman rapist is an English serial sex {{offender}} who has committed at least 17 attacks {{on women in}} the city of Bath, Somerset. He is the subject of Britain's longest-running serial rape investigation, codenamed Operation Eagle, and has eluded capture since 1991. Detective Inspector Paul James of Avon and Somerset Constabulary, leading the operation, said it is [...] "one of the most complicated and protracted investigations" [...] that the force has ever undertaken. He was nicknamed after leaving <b>a</b> baseball <b>cap</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>a</b> logo from the Batman film series at the scene of one attack. Police believe that there are more victims who have never come forward. The independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers UK have offered a £10,000 reward for information leading to his capture. He has also been referred to in the news media as the [...] "Riddler".|$|R
500|$|The largest {{member of}} its genus, Entoloma sinuatum has an {{imposing}} epigeous (aboveground) fruiting body (basidiocarp), <b>bearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> 6–15cm (2½–6in) wide, though diameters of 25cm (10in) have been recorded. It is convex to flat, {{often with a}} blunt umbo in its centre and wavy margins, ivory white to light grey-brown in colour, and darkening with age. The distant gills are sinuate (notched at their point of attachment to the stipe) to almost free, generally (but not always) yellowish white before darkening to pink and then red. Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stipe). When viewed from beneath, a characteristic groove colloquially known as a [...] "moat" [...] {{can be seen in}} the gill pattern circumnavigating the stalk. The form lacking yellow colour on the gills is rare but widespread, and has been recorded from Austria, France and the Netherlands.|$|R

The unknown assailant is known to have attempted to carjack a woman at knifepoint, leaving her wounded when she fought back and managed to escape, in the same area of the city a few hours before Hall was abducted. In spring of 2011, police investigating the murders of Sian O'Callaghan and Becky Godden-Edwards also began to look for a possible link between those murders and that of Melanie Hall.

50|$|On 28 March 1772, Breton {{navigator}} Louis Aleno de St Aloüarn {{landed on}} the island and became the first European to formally take possession of Western Australia in the name of French king Louis XV. This involved a ceremony (which took place on 30 March) during which one or more bottles were buried on the island. One bottle was recorded as containing an annexation document and a coin. In 1998 a bottle cap made of lead with an écu coin set in it, was first discovered at Turtle Bay by a team led by Philippe Godard and Max Cramer. This triggered a broader search by a team from the Western Australian Museum led by Myra Stanbury, with Bob Sheppard, Bob Creasy and Dr Michael McCarthy. On 1 April 1998, <b>an</b> intact bottle <b>bearing</b> <b>a</b> lead <b>cap</b> identical to the one recovered earlier, also with a coin set in it, was unearthed. No trace of an annexation document has yet been found.|$|R

Also new for the 1977 model year, 280Zs no longer received the full size spare tire, and instead had a [...] "space saver" [...] spare and a larger fuel tank. This resulted in a raised rear deck area made of fiberboard, reducing cargo space.
