40|$|Society {{is based}} on a set of norms and rules, {{compliance}} with which ensures the survival of that society. Within psychology, the two main issues of compliance with social norms are exhibition of violent behaviour and cooperation with <b>authorities</b> in order to promote further compliance. Extensive research suggests that among other social and psychological factors, relationships with institutional <b>authorities</b> {{are one of the most}} prominent factors of compliance in childhood and adolescence. In this chapter we discuss the research available on the role of <b>authorities</b> and warning signs associated with violence and cooperation with institutional <b>authorities.</b> Finally, we explore theories proposed to explain the relationship between compliance and <b>authorities,</b> as well as their relevance to prevention of non-compliance with social norms. In short, this chapter outlines research and theory suggesting that negative experiences with <b>authorities</b> lead to negative attitudes to <b>authorities</b> and norms regarding compliance. In turn, these attitudes and norms lead to exhibition of violent behaviours and lower cooperation with <b>authorities.</b> As such, we suggest that focusing resources on improving the relationships between <b>authorities</b> and youth will prevent non-compliance with social norms, namely, violence and non-cooperation with <b>authorities.</b> Estefanía Estévez nad Marina Rachitskiy 15...|$|R
