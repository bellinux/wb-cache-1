AAIB/N had the primary responsibility for investigations at the crash site, cooperation with the Norwegian police and the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, and writing the report. IAC was responsible for handling the investigations in Russia, the reading of the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder, the relationship with Vnukovo Airlines and a test flight. Both agencies agreed that English was to be the language of the final report; English is one of the ICAO languages.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{manuscript}} is to describe and compare regulatory aviation agencies according to their subordination and attributions to investigate <b>air</b> <b>accidents.</b> Possible consequences in identifying the contributory factors are also presented.
