40|$|AbstractThe thermal {{behavior}} of the novel CSP receiver based on Airlight Energy technology was analyzed by means of accurate 2 D steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Afterwards, its thermal insulation design was numerically optimized {{with the aim of}} minimizing the heat losses. Energy and radiation transport equations were numerically solved, using the finite-volume method approach, with Fluent code from ANSYS. In this innovative receiver design, air is used as heat transfer fluid (HTF) allowing to go beyond the operating temperature limits of conventional HTFs. However, <b>air</b> <b>receivers</b> need a larger heat transfer area and flow cross-section compared to the most common oil and molten salts receivers. Thus, the insulation becomes technically challenging. Due to a large thermal capacity, the use of conventional insulating material is not the best solution for air-based receivers. Instead, thanks to the advantages offered, thermal radiation shields were selected as main receiver insulation system. The analysis of the CFD simulations results drove the various modifications of the thermal insulation design; hence, a total of three versions were studied achieving, at the end, the final optimized solution which is implemented in the first full-scale 3. 9 MWth pilot plant under construction in Ait Baha (Morocco) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring the EU FP 7 -Solugas {{project the}} {{feasibility}} of the solar hybrid technology with a pressurized air receiver and a gas turbine was demonstrated. Over the last years the coupling of solar heat to air-Brayton cycles {{has been identified as}} a way to accelerate the CSP market penetration competing directly with conventional combined cycle plants. The path to the commercialization of this hybrid CSP product goes through the scaling of the solarized gas turbine capacity and the increase of the receiver outlet temperature. The Soltrec project focuses on the development, manufacturing and testing of a volumetric receiver, capable to raise the maximum temperature of the compressed air up to 1000 °C. The concept of volumetric <b>air</b> <b>receivers</b> is the most promising option for getting high efficiencies at these temperature levels, with solar shares of up to 80 % at design point operation. Transforming solar radiation into hot pressurized air at these temperatures levels leads to thermal and mechanical stresses that requires an innovate receiver design and the application of new heat resistant materials.

In this article, transient numerical simulation was conducted to simulate the heat transfer and flow processes in single quartz tube under concentrated solar radiation. The results showed that the distribution of solid particles temperature was uniform in the fluidized region, which could overcome the problem of overheating in the volumetric solar receiver. The temperature difference between solid particles and air was no more than 25 K, indicating that heat transfer between particles and air was very effective. Further, as the direct solar radiation increased, the average air temperature in the outlet increased while the thermal efficiency decreased. The high tube wall temperature caused heat loss to the environment by radiative and convective heat transfer. With the air inlet velocity increasing, the averaging air temperature in the outlet decreased while the efficiency of the receiver increased.
