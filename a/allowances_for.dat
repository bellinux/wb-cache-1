5|$|As Jarrow's representatives {{prepared}} to leave, six regional contingents {{of the sixth}} National Hunger March were taking the road to London, where they were due to arrive {{a week after the}} Jarrow marchers. A group of blind veterans, organised by the National League of the Blind and Disabled, was also on the march, demanding better <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> the country's 67,000 blind persons.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1877, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) {{announced}} it would reduce the wages of all workers by ten percent. One hundred miles would constitute a day's work, and crews would not receive <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> time spent on delays at stations. Various meetings of railroad employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but he declined to meet.|$|E
5|$|The {{breathing}} gas mixtures {{appropriate to}} a dive depend {{to a large}} extent on the maximum depth and the decompression obligations incurred by the planned duration of the dive and the time spent at each depth. The quantity of gases required for scuba will depend on the time spent at each depth, the breathing rate of the diver, the type of breathing apparatus to be used, and reasonable <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> contingencies.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary {{income is}} a net income concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance. There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> disability, special tax <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s allowance, fishermen’s <b>allowance,</b> special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> self-employed within agriculture, special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> high expenses linked to illness, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> payments to individual pension schemes, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> travel between home and work, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> donations to voluntary organisations, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> paid union fees, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|R

50|$|Basic <b>Allowance</b> <b>for</b> Housing (BAH) is a United States {{military}} privilege {{given to}} many military members. It was previously called Basic <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> quarters (BAQ) and {{is administered by}} the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO).|$|R
5|$|On 18 May 1987, the Australian Cabinet {{approved}} the final design: Kockums' Type471 submarine, fitted with the Rockwell system. The contract {{for construction of}} six submarines was signed on 3 June and valued at A$3.9 billion in 1986 prices, with <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> inflation and the changing value of the Australian dollar. The submarine acquisition project {{was at the time}} the most expensive project ever undertaken by the Australian Defence Force, but was unseated from this title by the Anzac-class frigate project a few years later.|$|E
5|$|At the time, his {{employers}} {{refused to}} make <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> him to play sport, forcing him to begin work at six in the morning. As a result, he considered moving to South Australia, where a grocery magnate offered him employment and financial incentives. However, he stayed after state officials intervened, with Sir Ronald Irish, the Australian chairman of Rothmans, providing him with a job in Sydney. At the time, O'Neill had another offer. Having represented his state in baseball and been nominated in the All-Australian team in 1957, he was approached by the New York Yankees, having had experience at a pitcher and short stop. O'Neill was offered a fee more than 25 times that for a single Test match, as well as travel costs and accommodation, to trial with the Yankees. He agreed, but Irish dissuaded him {{less than a week}} before his scheduled departure.|$|E
5|$|Piso {{was rumored}} to have been {{responsible}} for his death and with accusations coming in it wasn't long before the well known accuser, Lucius Fulcinius Trio, brought charges against him. The Pisones were longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with Octavian early on. The continued support of the Pisones and his own friendship to Piso made him hesitant to hear the case himself. After briefly hearing both sides, Tiberius deferred the case to the Senate, making no effort to hide his deep anger toward Piso. Tiberius made <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> Piso to summon witnesses of all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than the prosecutors, but it made no difference: before the trial was over Piso died ostensibly by suicide, but Tacitus supposes Tiberius may have had him murdered before he could implicate the emperor in Germanicus' death.|$|E

5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child <b>allowances.</b> <b>For</b> example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E
5|$|Before 2009, members {{received}} the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of 8,020.53 euro each in 2014, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs {{are entitled to a}} pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E

25|$|Age {{of consent}} may vary by {{the type of}} sexual act, the sex of the actors, or other {{restrictions}} such as abuse of a position of trust. Some jurisdictions also make <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> young people engaged in sexual acts with each other.|$|E
50|$|The rate {{at which}} patent {{applications}} are allowed can vary significantly from one technology to another. US patent applications {{in the field of}} electrical connectors, for example, get one <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> every two rejections. Business method patent applications, however, only get one <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> every 20 rejections.|$|R
30|$|Third, auctions {{should be}} {{introduced}} into the <b>allowance</b> allocation <b>for</b> takers. In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the allowance allocation. After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the allowance on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively. In the Guangdong industrial sectors, the enterprises must acquire a 3  % allowance through auction, and they can then activate a 97  % <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> free; for large public buildings, 100  % are allocated for free by benchmarking before the compliance period. At present, the government-allocated <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the enterprises is free in Beijing. However, the CET will eventually be completely adjusted by the market, {{as is the case}} for CET in the EU (European Union). Specifically, a certain level of auction, such as 3  %, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers; and a lesser amount for auction, which should be smaller than the proportion of auction in the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the givers; alternatively, 100  % can be free <b>for</b> the <b>allowance</b> of the givers.|$|R

25|$|The Third Modification Law (1974) {{extended}} individual entitlements {{to social}} assistance {{by means of}} higher-income limits compatible with receipt of benefits and lowered age limits for certain special benefits. Rehabilitation measures were also extended, child supplements were expressed as percentages of standard amounts and were thus indexed to their changes, and grandparents of recipients were exempted from potential liability to reimburse expenditure of social assistance carrier. The Third Social Welfare Amendment Act (1974) brought considerable improvements for the handicapped, those in need of care, and older persons, and a new fund of 100 million marks for disabled children was established. <b>Allowances</b> <b>for</b> retraining and advanced training and for refugees from East Germany were also increased, together with federal grants for sport. In addition, increases {{were made in the}} pensions of 2.5 million war victims. Following a sudden increase in the price of oil, a law was passed in December 1973 granting recipients of social assistance and housing allowances a single heating-oil allowance (a procedure repeated in the winter of 1979 during the Schmidt Administration). Improvements and automatic adjustments of maintenance <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> participants in vocational training measures were also carried out, and increased allowances were provided for training and retraining, together with special <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> refugees from East Germany.|$|E
