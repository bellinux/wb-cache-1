5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E

5|$|The {{eradication}} campaign {{led to the}} death of Janet Parker (c.1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University of Birmingham who worked in the same building as Bedson's smallpox laboratory.

5|$|Written {{during the}} Japanese {{occupation}} of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), while Pane was <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cultural Centre in Jakarta, Kami, Perempuan is similar to contemporary plays owing to its openly pro-Japanese message and emphasis on everyday issues experienced by average people. Discussions of the play have {{found it to be}} pro-Japanese propaganda, suggesting that men should join the military to please their women, though it has also been suggested that the play is in fact a warning against accepting the Defenders of the Homeland as being for Indonesia. Kami, Perempuan was performed numerous times in 1943, and its script has been compiled in a book.|$|E

In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.|$|E
5|$|Citizen Kane was {{the only}} film made under Welles's {{original}} contract with RKO Pictures, which gave him complete creative control. Welles's new business manager and attorney permitted the contract to lapse. In July 1941, Welles reluctantly signed a new and less favorable deal with RKO under which he produced and directed The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), produced Journey into Fear (1943), and began It's All True, a film he agreed to do without payment. In the new contract Welles was <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio and lost the right to final cut, which later allowed RKO to modify and re-cut The Magnificent Ambersons over his objections. In June 1942 Schaefer resigned the presidency of RKO Pictures and Welles's contract was terminated by his successor.|$|E

5|$|During a later press investigation, Oosthuizen {{claimed to}} have acted independently. Anton Rupert, the head of Rembrandt, {{endorsed}} this version, asserting that Oosthuizen had acted {{in his capacity as}} <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SASF. Rupert said this was an autonomous organisation, but according to Oborne the SASF constitution made it totally dependent on Rembrandt. Oborne writes that Oosthuizen's offers were rooted in the plans made by Vorster and Coy to bribe D'Oliveira indirectly by offering him work that would prevent him from playing for the MCC. Oborne surmises that the position and salary offered to D'Oliveira did not come from the SASF, but were actually part of a scheme involving Vorster and Rupert to remove the controversial player from the tour. Williams also concludes that the offer was effectively a bribe to stop D'Oliveira playing.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, Kinne and her {{traveling}} companion, Francis Puglise, {{were soon}} {{caught up in}} another criminal case when Kinne, claiming to have been acting in self-defense, shot and killed a Mexican-born American citizen named Francisco Parades Ordoñez, who she claimed attempted to rape her. Ordonez {{was shot in the}} back. <b>An</b> <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel in which the shooting occurred, responding to the sound of gunshots, was also wounded but survived. Investigation into the shootings showed that Ordoñez was shot with the same weapon that killed Patricia Jones. Kinne was convicted in October 1965 of the Mexican crimes and sentenced to ten years in prison, later lengthened to thirteen years after judicial review. Kinne escaped from the Mexican prison during a blackout in December 1969. Despite extensive manhunts, her whereabouts are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Rugby Football Union (RFU) {{had created}} the {{national}} side's emblem prior to an English team being sent to Edinburgh to play a Scottish side. A red rose was chosen to be the side's emblem. The white kit worn by the national team {{was taken from the}} kit used at Rugby School. Alfred Wright, <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rugby Football Union, is credited with the standardisation and new design of the rose, which up until 1920 had undergone many variations in its depiction. The Wright design is thought to have been used without minor alteration until the late 1990s. It was not until 1997 that the rose was modernised when Nike became the official strip supplier.|$|E
