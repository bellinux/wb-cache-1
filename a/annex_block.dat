50|$|The {{original}} {{campus was}} designed for a student population of 600 students. The academy has been facing space constraints as enrolment has gradually risen, prompting planning for campus expansion. The 334 Scheme further exacerbated the problem. In June 2012 the Legislative Council approved funding of $444.8 million for construction of a nine-storey <b>annex</b> <b>block,</b> and other campus improvements, presently under construction. The expansion will house classrooms, studios, laboratories, music rooms, offices, workshops and support facilities.|$|E

50|$|The school opened {{within one}} building. Buildings were added, the first being {{a set of}} typing huts, but these were {{replaced}} with an ICT and Maths building called The <b>Annex</b> <b>Block.</b> Other buildings included a Science building, Sports Hall and, most recently, an English and Performing Arts centre. There were temporary units such as The Magdalene Centre, chiefly used for special needs and general education; it was demolished in 2008. The T Blocks, used for extra classrooms, remained after other units were demolished, but this was removed in 2011. Three years after The Magdalene Centre was demolished a new learning support centre, 'The Newman Centre', was built.|$|E
5000|$|The former Officers' Quarters Compound, which {{includes}} the RAF Officers' Mess and an <b>Annex</b> <b>Block,</b> is located at No. 51 Kwun Tong Road.

50|$|Tiedtke's is {{a former}} grocery and {{department}} store chain based in Toledo, Ohio. At its peak, the store, which began life as a grocery, occupied a huge building at Summit Street and Adams downtown, maintained an <b>annex</b> store two <b>blocks</b> away, and a branch store in north Toledo. The family-founded store changed hands several times before all locations closed by 1973. The original store building was destroyed by fire two years later.|$|R
50|$|The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (between {{the victors}} of World War I and Austria) and the Treaty of Trianon (between the victors and Hungary) {{regulated}} the new borders of Austria and Hungary, leaving both as small landlocked states. The Allies assumed without {{question that the}} minority nationalities wanted to leave Austria and Hungary, and also allowed them to <b>annex</b> significant <b>blocks</b> of German- and Hungarian-speaking territory. As a result, the Republic of Austria lost roughly 60% of the old Austrian Empire's territory. It also had to drop its plans for union with Germany, as it {{was not allowed to}} unite with Germany without League approval. The restored Kingdom of Hungary, which had replaced the republican government in 1920, lost roughly 72% of the pre-war territory of the Kingdom of Hungary.|$|R
5000|$|Walker Building Annex. Beginning in the 2008-2009 school year, all freshmen {{classes were}} moved to the Walker <b>Annex,</b> located one <b>block</b> away from the main campus. Freshmen attend {{physical}} education, chorus, band, and orchestra classes on the main campus, but attend their basic science, math, English, and history courses in the Walker building. However beginning in 2012, freshman classes were switched back in the main building. The Walker Annex is now used for students with academic and attendance problems.|$|R
50|$|The {{tension and}} the summer heat start to get {{to them and they}} {{continually}} snap at each other. Food shortages are getting worse and the authorities have confiscated all radios. Luckily, Mr Kleiman secretly gives them a replacement. As the bombing raids get worse, Anne takes to {{running up and down the}} <b>annex</b> stairs to <b>block</b> out the sound. But they try to keep their spirits up and are thrilled when Miep finds some butter to bake a small cake for Edith's birthday.|$|R
5000|$|Along with Wright <b>Block,</b> the Clifford <b>Annex,</b> the Dinnie <b>Block,</b> and Golden Square, the Telephone Co. Building {{was one of}} many [...] "commercial vernacular brick {{buildings}} with classical revival details" [...] that were built during a major building boom, with high quality brickwork. [...] It was built in 1904 by the Northwestern Telephone Exchange Company, which later became Northwestern Bell. [...] This replaced a previous exchange that was located on the fourth floor of an office building, which had some accessibility problems. A 1901 author pointed out that the cable ran into the office from a nearby pole and was unsightly, and that the wiring inside the building was not very orderly either. The building was rather crowded. The company {{was in the process of}} buying a lot for the new exchange building.|$|R
50|$|Situated on sloping ground {{directly}} {{opposite the}} John C. Calhoun mansion of Fort Hill, Johnstone replaced {{a group of}} free-standing barracks dating from Clemson's early military college days. Six residence hall sections, A through F, existed on nine numbered levels, but with no single section boasting more than five floors, as the structure followed {{the contours of the}} site in an irregular horseshoe open on the north side. Harcombe Commons dining hall was attached to the A-section interior on level five. Cinder <b>block</b> <b>annex</b> wings were added onto the ends of A and F sections to increase capacity by the early 1960s. A central student resource center separated A and B sections. This separation would eventually allow females to be housed in A section, while the remaining sections remained all male.|$|R
50|$|During the Council of Constance (1414-18), the German king Sigismund of Luxembourg {{stayed at}} the Petershausen and the abbot was even given the pontifical vestments from Antipope John XXIII. However, the monastery {{declined}} during the 14th and 15th centuries, pressed hard by both the free imperial city and the prince-bishopric of Constance. The attempts of Prince-Bishop Hugo von Hohenlandenberg to <b>annex</b> Petershausen were <b>blocked</b> by Maximilian I. However Petershausen was to lose its independence {{to the city of}} Constance. The abbey is freed after Constance, which had officially become Protestant in 1530, is conquered by the Spanish troops of Charles V during the Schmalkaldic War, forcibly re-Catholicized, stripped of its status as a free imperial city and absorbed into Further Austria. In 1556, the monks returned to their restored monastery, which slowly recovers thanks to the help of the nearby nobility.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the Colman Building {{was finally}} resumed in February 1904 {{and by this}} time, {{architectural}} tastes had changed, and Colman hired Norwegian architect August Tidemand, who had designed the Colman <b>Block</b> <b>Annex,</b> to completely rebuild the building in a Chicago School style while still echoing the building's intended 1889 layout. Tenants were moved to the nearby Burke Building until construction finished. Perks of the new building would include 300 offices, fireproof construction and stair fire escapes. Another improvement over the old building would be the addition of three elevators with 24-hour operators. As construction began in early 1904 The Seattle Times noted the improved service over that of the Colman Building at the time: Reconstruction of the building involved removing most of the brick facade to be replaced with stone. Several cast iron elements including the entrance arch and storefront columns were retained and integrated into the new facade. When completed in 1906, the new building rose six stories high and cost $150,000.|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{instruction}} and data caches are extremely important for achieving good performance from modern high performance processors. Conventional cache architectures exploit locality, but do so rather blindly. By forcing all references through a single structure, the cache's effectiveness on many references is reduced. This paper presents a selective caching scheme for improving cache performance, implemented using a cache assist namely the annex cache. Except for filling a main cache at cold start, all entries {{come to the}} cache via the <b>annex</b> cache. A <b>block</b> from the <b>annex</b> cache gets swapped with a main cache block only if it has been referenced twice after the conflicting main cache block was referenced. Essentially, low usage items {{are not allowed to}} create conflict misses in the main cache. Items referenced only rarely will be excluded from the main cache, eliminating several conflict misses and swaps. The basic premise is that an item deserves to be in the main cache only if it can [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Today Sandown esplanade boasts {{some fine}} Victorian and Edwardian hotels (many {{of which have}} been unsympathetically {{extended}} by breeze <b>block</b> <b>annexes)</b> which overlook the golden sands of the beach below. Sandown Pier hosts a large amusement centre with arcade games and children's play areas, typical of a seaside resort. The pier is also well used for sea fishing with designated areas especially for the angler. Further north, there is the Isle of Wight Zoo (also known as Sandown Zoo) which specialises in tigers. Other facilities include an 18-hole golf course, the Dinosaur Isle geological museum and Sandham Gardens, offering a skate park, children's play park, crazy golf, bowls and putting green. In recent years, the town has started to experience urban decay as many of the hotels began to close and be replaced with Care homes, driving away tourists. A grant given to Sandown and Ryde in 2015 has raised hopes of regeneration within the town.|$|R
50|$|In 1888, James Colman {{commissioned}} architect Stephen Meany {{to design}} a large office building that would occupy his property. His design was an ornate five story Romanesque edifice faced in plaster and featuring a large central tower. While the cornerstone was laid in early 1889, Colman put off construction {{in order to keep}} collecting rents on buildings still on the property as long as possible. Construction of the building was made easier when the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 wiped out all of the buildings on the block. Construction commenced as soon as the debris was cleared. During the rebuilding of Seattle {{in the aftermath of the}} fire, a huge surplus of office space was being created with all of the multi-story structures being built simultaneously. Noticing this, Colman halted construction of the building, which had only reached its second floor. It remained in this unfinished form for the next fifteen years. In the meantime, the building housed many important businesses and social clubs like the Elks and the Seattle Bureau of Information, whose sole purpose was to keep the newspapers in on the East coast supplied with good news about the city. The Customs House operated within the Colman Building as well as the Circuit Court. Also during this time, Colman erected a stone warehouse occupying the other half of the block, known as The Colman <b>Block</b> <b>Annex,</b> which has since been demolished for a parking lot.|$|R
50|$|The {{school has}} 11 main buildings, A,B,C,D,E,H,J,K,L blocks, the Hall and the Canteen. A Block is mainly {{computer}} rooms, with one science lab {{in the lower}} part of the building. B block is where the Communications department have many rooms. A Technology lab and a Computer workshop, leased to the Rotary Club of Nundah are the exceptions. A dedicated Macintosh Lab, where Apple iMac's are used, and a Recording Studio, are also located in this block. C block is a multi-use block, with the Main Administration, Maths and Science classrooms being located here. D block is the Aeroskills Technology Block, where Manual Arts and Graphics takes place. The block has 3 workshops and one classroom, for Graphics. A laser cutter is located in this block. E <b>block</b> is an <b>annex</b> to A <b>block,</b> with a Multi Media Room (Theatre) and Career Education being housed here. H block is where the Hospitality kitchens are located, as well as theory classrooms, and a cabin-crew training area, with actual seats from a Boeing 767 being used for realism. J block is the dedicated Science block, with 4 science laboratories and a special room for Flight Simulator's inside J block. Most Science classes are held here, and are all fitted with smart-boards as standard. K Block is another name for the Library. The Library houses over 1000 books, and a gym underneath for HPE classes. There are also 2 annexes for classes to be held, or presentations to be given. L Block is where Art classes are held.
