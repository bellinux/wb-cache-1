5|$|During the 2015–16 season, Édouard {{played with}} both the U19 team and the CFA team. In January 2016, he won the 2015 Titi d'Or, an award voted for by the club's {{supporters}} for the best academy player for a particular season. The award was notably won by Kingsley Coman and Jean-Kévin Augustin in previous years. PSG <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the Youth League final but were ultimately beaten 2–1 by Chelsea. Édouard scored three goals and registered three assists during the competition.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration {{chose to}} make Clark State Forest a {{training}} {{center for the}} Civilian Conservation Corps, and <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> Indiana's largest CCC cantonment in November1933. They created artificial lakes within Clark State Forest, and built many bridges, to aid in water conservation, provide beauty spots within the forest, and teach forestry skills {{to members of the}} Civilian Conservation Corps. The state forest's proximity to the Jeffersonville Quartermaster Depot was key in the decision to focus so much attention on it.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{a target}} for planet finding {{programs}} because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder, it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe {{can be sent to}} Epsilon Eridani.|$|E

5|$|Speakers' Corner was {{launched}} on 1 September 2000 at Hong Lim Park, a historical venue for political speeches and rallies. The park's {{proximity to the}} Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> convenient for people to register {{to speak at the}} venue. In the first nine months, more than a thousand speeches were made.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage and the {{condition}} of West Bridge led to some erroneous reports of her loss. News articles on 24 August in both The New York Times and the Chicago Daily Tribune reported the loss of West Bridge, and the mistaken information <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> into book form. Authors Benedict Crowell and Robert Forrest Wilson, in their work The Road to France: The Transportation of Troops and Military Supplies, 1917–1918, repeat the misinformation {{about the loss of}} West Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with his}} wife, the late Grace Kelly, Prince Rainier not only {{restored}} the palace, {{but from the}} 1970s <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> the headquarters of a large and thriving business, which encouraged light industry to Monaco, the aim of which was to lessen Monaco's dependence on the income from gambling. This involved land reclamation, {{the development of new}} beaches, and high rise luxury housing. As a result of Monaco's increase in prestige, in 1993 it joined the United Nations, with Rainier's heir Prince Albert as head of the Monaco delegation.|$|E

5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the Taliban government <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> impossible for Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games {{after the fall of}} the Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the price}} of tickets had risen to $6 each, and popcorn was {{available}} for $1 per bag. Drinks, as well as brownies baked by Anthony Cacchio Jr., were also $1 each. The Theatre served as one of three screening locations for the Woodstock Film Festival, along with theaters in Rhinebeck and Woodstock. After years of resisting live entertainment, the Theatre allowed its stage {{to be used as}} a platform for a John Kerry rally on October26, 2004. It was the first time there had been such an event in the building in over 55years. By 2005, live performances were commonplace at the Theatre. The acoustics of the building <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> suitable for musical performances, beginning in autumn 2006 with a jazz performance by Kevin Mahogany.|$|E
5|$|Having {{realised}} the Hungarian Estates' growing dissatisfaction, Matthias held a Diet in November. The Diet again authorized him to levy {{an extraordinary}} tax, stipulating that {{the sum of}} all taxes payable per porta could not exceed one florin. The Estates <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> clear that they opposed the war in Bohemia. George of Poděbrady died on 22 March 1471. The Diet of Bohemia proper elected Vladislaus Jagiello king on 27 May. The papal legate Lorenzo Roverella soon declared Vladislaus's election void and confirmed Matthias's position as King of Bohemia, but the Imperial Diet refused Matthias's claim.|$|E

50|$|This movie <b>also</b> never <b>made</b> <b>it</b> out of Cameroon, but {{the young}} actress' {{personality}} was noticed by prolific producers like Agbor Gilbert and director Reginald Ebere from neighbouring Nigeria, home to the world's second largest film industry: Nollywood.|$|R
5|$|In 1929, Rabi {{returned}} to the United States, where Columbia offered him a faculty position. In collaboration with Gregory Breit, he developed the Breit–Rabi equation and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could be modified to confirm {{the properties of the}} atomic nucleus. His techniques for using nuclear magnetic resonance to discern the magnetic moment and nuclear spin of atoms earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. Nuclear magnetic resonance became an important tool for nuclear physics and chemistry, and the subsequent development of magnetic resonance imaging from it has <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> important to the field of medicine.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, Dream Theater {{announced}} some European tour {{dates for}} early 2016. The next month, they announced North American tour dates beginning in April and ending in May. As the band felt that The Astonishing would lend itself well to a live performance, {{they decided to}} play the album in full for each show and hired a production company to help with their presentation. They <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> a point to book historical concert halls and theaters such as Radio City Music Hall. Following {{the conclusion of the}} North American leg, the band moved on to South America before returning to the United States for another run of shows, officially wrapping up the tour in December 2016.|$|E
5|$|Political {{opposition}} in Congress <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> difficult {{to build the}} Pennsylvania-class. The House of Representatives refused to fund any new battleships {{for the fiscal year}} 1913, though the Senate would fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become Pennsylvania was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; bids were opened on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, Newport News, on 27 February 1913 at the quoted price of $7,260,000 without armor or armament. The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, but the final cost actually came in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).|$|E

5|$|Rising {{property}} prices in Surrey in the 1940s and 1950s made the LNC increasingly valuable, but <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{a target for}} property speculators. In 1959 a hostile takeover succeeded, and LNC's independence came to an end. From 1959 to 1985 a succession of owners stripped the profitable parts of the business from the company, leaving a rump residual company operating the increasingly derelict cemetery. In 1985 {{what remained of the}} company came into the ownership of Ramadan Güney, who set about reviving what remained. Links were formed with London's Muslim communities in an effort to encourage new burials, and a slow programme of clearing and restoring the derelict sections of the cemetery commenced. Although it was never as successful as planned, the LNC was very influential on both the funeral industry and the development of the area around Woking, and Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The LPF {{decided to}} {{maintain}} Fortuyn's candidacy, and delayed naming {{a new leader}} until after the election. The 2002 general election proved a great success for the LPF, yielding 17% of the votes and 26 seats in the House of Representatives—by far {{a record number of}} seats in the Netherlands for a new party—to become the second largest party. LN <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> into Parliament, with two seats. The Labour Party (PvdA) and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) saw their largest-ever losses, while the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) won large gains. CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende had earlier announced that his party would follow a tougher line towards asylum seekers, and he later agreed with much of Fortuyn's criticism of the purple coalition and Holland's multicultural society. As leader of the strongest party, Balkenende became the leading candidate for Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the Klondike Gold Rush {{challenged}} this policy, as the force soon became essential to controlling the borders in the far north. Moving the entire force to the remote region of the Yukon, though, would {{have more than doubled}} the cost of the police's training and support arrangements, and their existing bases therefore remained vital to the northern operations. The increasing demands from the railway companies and mining companies for police assistance, and appeals from the ranching community for continued support, <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> harder for the Liberals to consider cutting back the force. The Second Boer War then disrupted plans to create a replacement militia unit, while Herchmer's disastrous tour in South Africa enabled the Liberals to replace him with Perry, a Liberal supporter. As a result, the political argument began to swing back in favour of potentially retaining the force.|$|E

5|$|The sailing {{team has}} won {{fourteen}} national championships since 2001, {{as well as}} one World Championship in match racing. Over that time they have graduated 79 All-Americans and 6 College Sailors of the year. Georgetown has been nationally successful in both cross country and track and field, and in 2011, the women's cross country team won Georgetown's only other team NCAA Championship. The rowing teams are perennial contenders as well for national titles. The men's and women's lacrosse teams have both been ranked in the top ten nationally, as have both soccer teams, with the men making the national championship game in 2012, and the women making the national quarterfinals in 2010. The rugby club team <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the Division II Final Four in 2005 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|The updates also {{contribute}} to the main story mode; the first added Sandman as its boss, while the fourth added Doctor Octopus, the sixth added Mysterio, and Venom was added in the August 2016 update. New characters are frequently added through the updates, and some of them, such as Spider-Gwen, Silk, Spider-Punk, and Aracnido Jr., made their first appearances in Spider-Man Unlimited. Other common update content includes thematic fights against specific villains, such as Jack O'Lantern, Hydro-Man, and Silver Sable. The sixth improved objective counters for events, while the seventh added short mission-style events. Some updates like the first and the sixth also included bug fixes, while the first adapted it to run on Windows Phone devices with 512 megabytes of RAM, and the sixth <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> compatible with the MFi Program.|$|E
5|$|Trucks {{were first}} used {{extensively}} {{by the military}} during World War I. With the increase in construction of paved roads, trucking began to achieve a significant foothold in the 1930s. Public safety concerns made it necessary to implement various government regulations (such as the 1965 hours of service rule; recently revised with a compliance date of July 1, 2012) of how long drivers were allowed to work and drive each day/week. In 1956, Taxpayers provided funds to build the Interstate Highway System, an extensive network of highways and freeways that linked major cities across the continent. The addition of Interstate Highway System <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> possible for the trucking industry to grow substantially in the late 1950s and early 1960s and trucking has come to dominate the freight industry in the latter portion of the 20th century.|$|E
