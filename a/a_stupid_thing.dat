500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC, Thomas said that Morris and Beesley had been [...] "very adamant" [...] that the series had finished. On his co-stars, he added [...] "There is a bond there that I think would be <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to waste. You don't get that bond very often with other performers and we do have it and it's a valuable thing".|$|E
2500|$|On 11 June 2009 ex-communities {{secretary}} Hazel Blears, {{who chose}} to resign from the government just before the English county council and European elections, said that she regretted the timing of her decision. She also stated that her decision to wear a brooch with the words 'rocking the boat' {{on the same day}} as the resignation was a [...] "stupid thing to do". Speaking to the Manchester Evening News she said of the brooch [...] "It was a brooch my husband had given me. I'd had four weeks of intense media pressure, the like of which I have never known, not just on me but on my husband, my dad, my family. At that point I'd had enough. It was <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to do but I think it was just trying to put a brave face on—not going out cowed on the basis of expenses claims that genuinely are not true." ...|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E

"We always knew," [...] she said, [...] "that {{my brother}} had married an addle-pated, silly woman, {{one of the most}} unsuited to be the {{mistress}} of a clergyman's house that ever a man set eyes on; but I didn't think she'd allow herself to be led into such <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> as this." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 8 September 2006, Clarke gave an {{interview}} to the Evening Standard in which he criticised the 'presumption' that Gordon Brown would succeed Tony Blair as Prime Minister, helping trigger further disputes about the Labour leadership. Clarke said of Brown's reaction to the leadership crisis, [...] "A {{lot of people are}} very upset and cross about that. It was absolutely <b>stupid</b> - <b>a</b> <b>stupid,</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to do." [...] He named Alan Milburn as a politician who had the stature to be Prime Minister instead of Brown.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's an ugly {{thing to}} go to prison for," [...] he remarked, {{slipping}} it into his pocket. [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to do, anyhow, you know.

60|$|It is {{the bane}} of all conversation; and those who can't sit an hour without gaming, should never go into a club to spoil company.

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} bishop, when Mr. Archibald had {{finished}} {{what he had}} to say, [...] "there is nothing to thank me for.

6000|$|... "Yes, I have a {{particular}} reason for remembering that, for I had sat down hurriedly after he had signed it, and dipping my pen too deeply in the ink, made a blot. It was no doubt <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to do, but Brander was so unreasonably angry about it, and blew me up so roughly that I {{made up my mind}} there and then to stand it no longer, and wrote that very evening to my friend in my present office the letter which led to my getting the situation there two or three months later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{would be}} no great good in that.

But I found out long ago {{that it had been}} <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to go in for. When one has mastered the routine, it is awfully monotonous; and one {{has nothing to do with}} one's time or one's brains. I have felt many a time that I could keep straight better if I had something tougher to do." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{this old}} pupil {{who was being}} married. It was unsupportably {{conceited}} and selfish in the old pupil to be married. She was very vain, and very glad to show off; but it was highly probable that she wasn't pretty; and even if she were pretty (which Miss Kimmeens now totally denied), she had no business to be married; and, even if marriage were conceded, she had no business to ask Miss Pupford to her wedding. As to Miss Pupford, she {{was too old to}} go to any wedding. She ought to know that. She had much better attend to her business. She had thought she looked nice in the morning, but she didn't look nice. She was <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> old <b>thing.</b> G was another <b>stupid</b> old <b>thing.</b> Miss Pupford's assistant was another. They were all <b>stupid</b> old <b>things</b> together.|$|R
5000|$|Robotman first {{appeared}} in My Greatest Adventure #80 (June 1963) and was created by Arnold Drake and Bruno Premiani. According to Drake, the issue's co-writer Bob Haney was not brought on to the project until after Robotman was created. He commented on the character's original name, Automaton: [...] "That name was pretty stupid. I've been responsible for <b>a</b> lot of <b>stupid</b> <b>things,</b> but {{that was one of}} the stupidest, so, within two issues, I figured that out and changed his name to Robotman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{that date}} forward the infant began to grow--{{sometimes}} slowly, sometimes quickly, {{now and then}} by spurts--just like other infants, and a horribly spoiled and mismanaged baby it was at first. Those who see it now,--in the prime of its manhood, wielding its giant strength with such ease, accomplishing all but miraculous work with so great speed, regularity, and certainty, and with so little fuss,--can hardly believe what <b>a</b> cross-grained little <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> it was in those early days, or what tremendous difficulties it had to contend with.|$|R
60|$|Knowing all this, Sergeant Flanagan did {{not at all}} relish {{this night}} {{excursion}} into the hill fastnesses, where at any moment, as it seemed to him, they might miss their way. After all, they were but twelve men all told, and he accounted it <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to attempt {{to take a short}} cut across the hills for the purpose of overtaking an encumbered troop that must of necessity be moving at a very much slower pace. This was the way not to overtake but to outdistance. Yet since it was not for him to remonstrate with the lieutenant, he kept his peace and hoped anxiously for the best.|$|E
6000|$|... “Ha! {{the legendary}} Renouard of {{sensitive}} idiots—the ruthless adventurer—the ogre with a future. That was a parrot cry, Miss Moorsom. I don’t {{think that the}} greatest fool of them all ever dared hint such <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> of me that I killed men for nothing. No, I had noticed this man in a hotel. He had come from up country I was told, and was doing nothing. I saw him sitting there lonely in a corner like a sick crow, and I went over one evening to talk to him. Just on impulse. He wasn’t impressive. He was pitiful. My worst enemy could have told you he wasn’t {{good enough to be}} one of Renouard’s victims. It didn’t take me long to judge that he was drugging himself. Not drinking. Drugs.” ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{spoke of}} [...] "poor dear Bessie," [...] with such affection as was implied in [...] "Oh, {{she was such}} a darling! I got on with her immensely. Why didn't you send to me, though I don't know that Donald would have let me come," [...] and she insisted on {{learning}} the whole history, illustrating it profusely with personal experiences. Rachel was constantly hoping to be released from a subject so intensely painful; but curiosity prevailed through the chatter, and kept hold of the thread of the story. Mrs. Menteith decidedly thought herself defrauded of a summons. [...] "It was very odd of them all not to telegraph for me. Those telegrams are such a dreadful shock. There came one just as I set out from Timber End, and I made sure little Sandie was ill at home, for you know the child is very delicate, {{and there are so many}} things going about, and what with all this dreadful business, I was ready to faint, and after all it was only <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> for Uncle Colin from those people at Avoncester." ...|$|E
5000|$|Iommi would criticize Martin {{during this}} period in his book, to which Martin responded; [...] "It surprises me. I mean, they never said {{anything}} to me. Surely, if you've got a problem, the first person you should say something to is the person that's in the band with you... You don't wait ten years. It sounds like <b>a</b> really <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to say, as they didn't say anything to my face - and, if that's the case, then more fool them for not saying anything, because, you know, we could have fixed it. I said to them, endlessly, {{that if there was}} anything they wanted changed, done differently, just to say and we could fix it, but clearly they didn't, they hadn't got the guts to, obviously, and to write about it in a book afterwards seems a bit daft to me. I'm not bitter about it, but it is surprising...it seems <b>a</b> bit <b>stupid</b> to say that after the event".|$|R
6000|$|... "But I can't do {{as others}} do; I've tried, and failed. Last winter, when Prue made me go about, though people {{probably}} thought me <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> little <b>thing,</b> moping in corners, I was enjoying myself {{in my own}} way, and making discoveries that have been very useful ever since. I know I'm whimsical, and hard to please, and have no doubt the fault was in myself, but I was disappointed in nearly every one I met, though I went into what Prue calls 'our best society.' The girls seemed all made on the same pattern; they all said, did, thought, and wore about the same things, and knowing one {{was as good as}} knowing a dozen. Jessie Hope was the only one I cared much for, and she is so pretty, she seems made to be looked at and loved." ...|$|R
5000|$|Maher's lawyer, Michael Griffith, {{has said}} that Maher did indeed start the fire {{in order to gain}} {{acceptance}} from Mr. Safra and that [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>stupid,</b> most insane <b>thing</b> <b>a</b> human being could do,” says Griffith. “He did not intend to kill Mr. Safra. He just wanted Mr. Safra to appreciate him more. He loved Mr. Safra. This was the best job of his life.” [...] Safra left 50% of his assets to several charities. The details of Safra's death were discussed by media outlets including 60 Minutes, CBS 48 Hours, Dateline NBC and Dominick Dunne in Vanity Fair.|$|R
