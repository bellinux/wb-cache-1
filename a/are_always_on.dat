5|$|Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern flatfish is their asymmetry, with both eyes {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish) and in others they <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E
25|$|Farley Boats {{were high}} quality boats and built to last. However, {{because of high}} {{frequency}} of hurricanes {{and the fact that}} no new models have been built in 40 years, there are very few remaining Farley Boats.

25|$|As well, the {{publicly}} owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates four national radio networks, two each in English and French. The English Radio One and the French Première Chaîne provide {{news and information}} programming to most communities in Canada, regardless of size, on either the AM or FM band. The English Radio 2 and French Espace musique provide arts and culture programming, including classical music and opera, and <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> FM, generally serving larger communities only.|$|E
25|$|With {{occasional}} exceptions, a male tinamou {{maintains a}} territory and a nesting site during the breeding season which {{a succession of}} females will visit, laying their eggs in the same nest. Females will wander through several territories mating with, and laying eggs in the nests of, the resident males. Nests <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the ground, concealed in vegetation or among rocks. Eggs are relatively large and glossy, often brightly colored when laid, and are incubated by the males {{for a period of}} 2–3 weeks. The chicks can run soon after hatching and are largely self-sufficient at three weeks old.|$|E

25|$|The New England barn {{is from a}} {{different}} tradition than the Pennsylvania Barn. In New England the barn doors <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the gable end. The cows were on the main level, hay in a mow on the main level and/or above in haylofts, possibly grain storage on the main level, sometimes a tack room or workshop and the basement was used for manure management and other tasks. The New England barn developed in the early 19th century, became the most popular barn type after 1850 replacing the smaller, side-entry English barn and are almost always square rule framing.|$|E
25|$|Ae. albopictus also bites {{other mammals}} besides humans, {{as well as}} birds. The females <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> {{the search for a}} host and are {{persistent}} but cautious {{when it comes to their}} blood meal and host location. Their blood meal is often broken off before enough blood has been ingested for the development of their eggs, so Asian tiger mosquitoes bite multiple hosts during their development cycle of the egg, making them particularly efficient at transmitting diseases. The mannerism of biting diverse host species enables the Asian tiger mosquito to be a potential bridge vector for certain pathogens that can jump species boundaries, for example the West Nile virus.|$|E
25|$|A team {{consists}} of minimum seven (maximum 21) players, of which six <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the pitch, those being the three chasers, one keeper, and two beaters. Besides the seeker who is off-pitch, the six players {{are required to}} abide by the gender rule, which states that a team may have a maximum of four players who identify as the same gender, excluding the seeker, making quidditch one of the few sports that not only offers a co-ed environment but an open community to those who do not identify with the gender binary. Matches or games often run about 30 to 40 minutes but tend to be subject to varying lengths of time due to the unpredictable nature of the snitch catch. If the score {{at the end of the}} match including the 30 point snitch catch is tied (such that the team that caught the snitch was 30 points behind the other), the game moves to overtime where the snitch is constrained to the pitch's dimensions and the game ends after five minutes or when the snitch is legally caught.|$|E

500|$|Generally, Hygiea's {{properties}} {{are the most}} poorly known out of the [...] "big four" [...] objects in the asteroid belt. Its orbit is {{much closer to the}} plane of the ecliptic than those of Ceres, Pallas or Interamnia, but is less circular than Ceres or Vesta with an eccentricity of around 0.12. Its perihelion is at a quite similar longitude to those of Vesta and Ceres, though its ascending and descending nodes are opposite to the corresponding ones for those objects. Although its perihelion is extremely close to the mean distance of Ceres and Pallas, a collision between Hygiea and its larger companions is impossible because at that distance they <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> opposite sides of the ecliptic. [...] In 2056, Hygiea will pass 0.025AU from Ceres, and then in 2063, Hygiea will pass 0.020AU from Pallas. At aphelion Hygiea reaches out to the extreme edge of the asteroid belt at the perihelia of the Hilda family which is in 3:2 resonance with Jupiter. Hygiea is used by the Minor Planet Center to calculate perturbations.|$|E
2500|$|Enright was a {{television}} producer and director for RTÉ in Dublin {{for six years}} and produced the RTÉ programme Nighthawks for four years. She then worked in children's programming {{for two years and}} wrote on weekends. Enright began writing full-time in 1993. Her full-time career as a writer came about when she left television due to a breakdown, later remarking: [...] "I recommend it [...] having a breakdown early.

Speaking of the tests, General Hossein Salami, Air Force Commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, said [...] "Our hands <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the trigger and our missiles are ready for launch."

2500|$|Since their {{introduction}} in the 1980s, [...] "Spare Air" [...] cylinders {{have been}} the subject of debate within the diving community. The argument against them is that they do not have sufficient capacity to get a diver in many emergency situations back to the surface safely, and thus cause divers to feel a false sense of safety. The arguments in favour are that [...] "Spare Air" [...] cylinders are both less bulky and less complicated than pony bottles, as they <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> and have no hoses or pressure gauges, and that some air is better than none in an emergency.|$|E

Eve {{presents}} Michael with a final gift, a terrestrial globe as a souvenir of his journey around the earth. Lucifer appears, first as a gremlin who springs out of the globe and presents Michael with his own, smaller blue globe. Michael passes it around to the choir, which infuriates the gremlin, who makes threatening gestures and summons assistance.|$|E

2500|$|If {{there is}} a single {{criticism}} to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is [...] "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like [...] "quack", [...] "crank" [...] and [...] "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the side of the writer criticizing fringe groups because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.|$|E
2500|$|Sports {{facilities}} on {{the campus}} include a sports complex and fitness centre which incorporates: an aerobics studio, spinning studio, quiet studio, four sports halls, two squash courts, a glass-backed handball/racquetball court, a gallery that accommodates table tennis and a body conditioning arena, a floodlit astroturf hockey pitch and seven grass pitches {{for a variety of}} sports, eight enclosed five-a-side third generation rubbercrumb AstroTurf soccer pitches, an indoor climbing wall, a four-lane 75-metre indoor sprint track and a fully equipped gym outfitted with cardiovascular machines, free weights and resistance machines. Specialist sports trainers <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> hand in the Sports Complex to advise on fitness regimes.

2500|$|In early series, reviews were {{primarily}} conducted by one host, {{with the other}} not required to play the game. In more recent series, both of the hosts equally present the review, with certain games being reviewed by only one host – such as Bajo's review of Dark Souls II or Goose's review of Fract OSC. Gameplay footage is shown while the game is discussed, and is used to illustrate points {{as well as provide}} humorous punchlines. The crew are often sent games by developers or studios ahead of their release date for them to play and review. The date they arrive comes down to the platform, game, publisher, and how persistent the show is with their requests. Bajo explains, [...] "We never review the game unless we're told it's 'review code'." [...] The crew have a few determining factors in choosing games for review, and aim to look at games relevant to their audience. This includes AAA titles, and any releases that are generating buzz. The team <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the lookout for experimental or indie games, especially if they are generating interest within the Good Game offices or wider gaming community.|$|E
