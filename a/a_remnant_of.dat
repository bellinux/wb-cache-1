5|$|The 1526 {{death of}} Janusz III of Masovia, {{the last of}} the Masovian Piast dukes line (<b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> the {{fragmentation}} period divisions), enabled Sigismund I to finalize the incorporation of Masovia into the Polish Crown in 1529.|$|E
5|$|The Himalia {{group is}} spread over barely 1.4Gm in semi-major axes, 1.6° in {{inclination}} (27.5±0.8°), and eccentricities between 0.11 and 0.25. It {{has been suggested}} that the group could be <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> the break-up of an asteroid from the asteroid belt.|$|E
5|$|Curio Bay {{features}} the petrified {{remains of a}} forest 160 million years old.

5|$|During the Great Turkish War (1683–1698), Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia, {{which had}} been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, {{remained}} outside Croatian control. The present-day border between the two countries is <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> this outcome. Dalmatia, {{the southern part of the}} border, was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued {{variously}} that the Eskaya are <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> the original indigenous settlers on Bohol; that they migrated to Bohol from Sumatra {{in the seventh century}} A.D.; that they are descendants of the resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy; that they are a cult or secret society; or that they are a conscious reconstruction of an imagined pre-colonial society.|$|E
5|$|Middleton Park, <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> the manorial estate, {{contains}} {{a large area}} of ancient woodland and parts of it, where coal was mined, are designated a scheduled ancient monument. It was the location of Middleton Hall and Middleton Lodge, homes to the local gentry.|$|E

5|$|The {{observed}} {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone, so {{the main source}} of heat remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus is not enough to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean must be <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or the heat is produced through another mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The sceptre, a {{symbolic}} ornamental rod {{held by the}} monarch at a coronation, is most likely derived from the shepherd's staff, via the crozier of a bishop; it may, however, be <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> the ceremonial spear that was presented to kings and queens at coronations {{in different parts of}} the world in early history.|$|E
5|$|Third Reich {{authorities}} {{disapproved of}} {{his choice of}} a Catholic marriage ceremony, performed by Klawitter. Klawitter had been barred from membership in the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Culture Chamber) and was considered politically unreliable after a 1936 breach of the Pulpit Law, <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> the 1870s Kulturkampf that among other religions barred Catholics from criticizing the state from the pulpit.|$|E

5|$|Trolley buses {{gradually}} made way for motor buses {{until the}} last electric tram or bus service ran on 12 July 1963 leaving only the Glenelg tramline as <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> a once extensive light rail network. Except for the Glenelg Type H, the trams were sold or scrapped. Some were used as shacks, playrooms or preserved by museums.|$|E
5|$|Due to an asbestos-related {{concern for}} the safety of the buildings, the visitors' centre (including the planetarium) was mostly {{demolished}} in 2003 leaving <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> its far end; a large marquee was set up in its grounds. A new science centre was being planned at the time. Those rebuilding plans were shelved when Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST merged to become the University of Manchester in 2004, leaving the interim centre, which received around 70,000 visitors a year.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E

5|$|Hemorrhage from a Rathke's cleft cyst, <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> Rathke's pouch that {{normally}} regresses after embryological development, may cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is regarded {{by some as}} distinct from Sheehan's syndrome, where the pituitary undergoes infarction {{as a result of}} prolonged very low blood pressure, particularly when caused by bleeding after childbirth. This condition usually occurs {{in the absence of a}} tumor. Others regard Sheehan's syndrome as a form of pituitary apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, President Roosevelt first greatly {{expanded}} the reserve and then divided the reserve into four separate units, with Shoshone being the largest. Upon {{the creation of}} the U.S. Forest Service in 1905, the reserve was designated a National Forest, but the current wording and title were formulated forty years later in 1945. <b>A</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> the earliest years of the forest management is the Wapiti Ranger Station which is located west of Cody, Wyoming. The station was built in 1903 and is the oldest surviving ranger station in any national forest, and is now designated a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 7 was legislated onto its current alignment, with the {{northern}} terminus moved to the Nutley/Clifton border. The route was also realigned to head south on Washington Avenue between the Newark border and Rutgers Street in Belleville on what was Route 11N, <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> Pre-1927 Route 11, making Route 7 discontinuous. County Route 506 used to follow the southern portion of Route 7 but has been truncated to the intersection with Routes 7 and 21 in Belleville.|$|E

5|$|In {{the member}} states of the European Union, if the {{parliament}} has only one chamber, it is wholly directly elected in all cases. If there are two chambers, the lower house is directly elected in all cases, while the upper house can be directly elected (e.g. the Senate of Poland); or indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures (e.g. the Federal Council of Austria); or non-elected, but representing certain interest groups (e.g. the National Council of Slovenia); or non-elected (though by and large appointed by elected officials) as <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> a non-democratic political system in earlier times (as in the House of Lords in the United Kingdom).|$|E
5|$|M-143, {{also known}} as Michigan Avenue, is a {{previously}} unsigned spur state trunkline highway in the south central region of the US state of Michigan. The M-143 portion of Michigan Avenue runs from the East Lansing city limit to a junction with M-43 at Grand River Avenue. This highway {{is the second time}} that there has been an M-143 in Michigan. The first was a connection to the original Cheboygan State Park. The current is <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> M-43 in the Lansing area.|$|E
5|$|The adipose fin, {{which is}} present in over 6,000 teleost species, is often thought to have evolved once in the lineage and to have been lost {{multiple}} times due to its limited function. A 2014 study challenges this idea and suggests that the adipose fin {{is an example of}} convergent evolution. In Characiformes, the adipose fin develops from an outgrowth after the reduction of the larval fin fold, while in Salmoniformes, the fin appears to be <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> the fold.|$|E
