5|$|Better Off Ted {{revolves}} around the employees of a stereotypically evil company. The company, Veridian Dynamics, experiments on its employees, twists the truth, and will stop at nothing to achieve its goals. It has been mentioned that Veridian has swayed presidential elections, created killer pandas and robots, and weaponized pumpkins, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> only three governments {{left in the world}} which are more powerful than Veridian. Although not promoted as such, and rarely the focus of storylines, the show's frequent references to futuristic technologies, killer robots, sentient computers, etc., places Better Off Ted at least partially in the science fiction genre.|$|E
5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should be noted that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E

They concluded in December that this was not the case, as there were no indications of interferences <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no instances where electromagnetic interference has been a contributing cause to an aviation accident.|$|E

Realizing Pikachu's condition is critical, Ash pleads him to go inside his Poké Ball so that Ash can protect him from the approaching Spearow. Pikachu, after seeing how much Ash cares for it, performs a powerful Thunder attack which drives the Spearow away, but also destroys Misty's bike. As the rain-clouds part, a mysterious golden bird flies over a rainbow and Ash's Pokédex informs him {{that there is no}} current data on this Pokémon <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> several yet to be identified.

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are about 1031 viruses on Earth. Most of them are bacteriophages, and most are in the oceans.

Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life, and help maintain the ecological balance of different species of marine blue-green algae, and thus adequate oxygen production for life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In April 1995, the State Duma {{considered}} {{the first draft}} of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions. In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country. Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it worthwhile to substitute experts' medical reports for elections? In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by Alexander Podrabinek, author of the book Punitive Medicine, a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of inappropriate behavior. Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the Russian Mental Health Law should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with parliamentary or judicial immunity. A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment. In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.|$|E

25|$|The {{lanthanide}} metals are soft; their hardness increases {{across the}} series. Europium stands out, {{as it has}} the lowest density in the series at 5.24 g/cm3 and the largest metallic radius in the series at 208.4 pm. It {{can be compared to}} barium, which has a metallic radius of 222 pm. It is believed that the metal contains the larger Eu2+ ion <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> only two electrons in the conduction band. Ytterbium also has a large metallic radius, and a similar explanation is suggested.|$|E
25|$|In his A Little Book of The Green Man, {{as well as}} his website, Mike Harding gives {{examples}} of similar figures in Borneo, Nepal, and India: the earliest is a foliate head from an 8th-century Jain temple in Rajasthan.

The letter refuted the charge related to the Cinema Rex fire noting that Captain Taheri had never been in Abadan <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> documents proving that at that time he was on vacation elsewhere.

25|$|Governments now {{recognize}} {{the benefits of}} walking for {{mental and physical health}} and are actively encouraging it. This growing emphasis on walking has arisen because people walk less nowadays than previously. In the UK, a Department of Transport report found that between 1995/97 and 2005 the average number of walk trips per person fell by 16%, from 292 to 245 per year. Many professionals in local authorities and the NHS are employed to halt this decline by ensuring that the built environment allows people to walk <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> walking opportunities available to them. Professionals working to encourage walking come mainly from six sectors: health, transport, environment, schools, sport and recreation, and urban design.|$|E
25|$|Buddhist traditions also vary {{in their}} {{mechanistic}} details on rebirth. Theravada Buddhists assert that rebirth is immediate while the Tibetan schools hold {{to the notion of}} a bardo (intermediate state) that can last up to 49 days. The bardo rebirth concept of Tibetan Buddhism, along with yidam, developed independently in Tibet without Indian influence, and involves 42 peaceful deities, and 58 wrathful deities. These ideas led to mechanistic maps on karma and what form of rebirth one takes after death, discussed in texts such as The Tibetan Book of the Dead. The major Buddhist traditions accept that the reincarnation of a being depends on the past karma and merit (demerit) accumulated, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> six realms of existence in which the rebirth may occur after each death.|$|E
