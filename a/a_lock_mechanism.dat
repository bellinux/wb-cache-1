25|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock is <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> that uses pins of varying lengths {{to prevent the}} lock from opening without the correct key. Pin {{tumblers}} are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use. In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale, Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.|$|E

Diesel fuel in a gasoline engine — while creating large amounts of smoke — does not normally cause permanent damage if it is drained once the mistake is realized. However even a liter of petrol added to the tank of a modern diesel car can cause irreversible damage to the injection pump and other components through a lack of lubrication. In some cases, the car has to be scrapped because the cost of repairs exceeds its residual value. The issue is not clear-cut as older diesels using completely mechanical injection can tolerate some gasoline — which has historically been used to [...] "thin" [...] diesel fuel in winter.|$|E

5000|$|Hargarten campaigned {{against a}} bullet, {{proposed}} by the Black Talon brand in the 1990s, that unfolded into a petal-like pattern after entering a victim, arguing that it could promote the spread of infections when surgeons tried to remove it from a wound. Also in the 1990s, he proposed three changes to reduce handgun deaths, which, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, were: [...] "urging the use of trigger locks; an indicator {{to show that a}} gun is loaded; and <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> that allows only the owner to have use of the gun". His efforts opposing the bullet included writing an editorial on the subject in the Journal of Trauma and encouraging other physicians to campaign against it as well. He has said that armed civilians trying to stop mass shootings are more likely to exacerbate the situation than mitigate it, because {{they are less likely to}} hit their targets than police.|$|E

5000|$|Local or city {{ordinances}} {{are sometimes}} drafted to include specific classes of people {{not covered by}} the state criminal codes, such as individuals carrying folding knives with locking blades primarily for use as weapons. [...] For example, a San Antonio, Texas city ordinance makes it unlawful for anyone to knowingly carry within city limits [...] "on or about his person" [...] any folding knife with a blade less than 5.5 inches long with <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> that locks the blade upon opening. [...] This ordinance is designed to work in tandem with the Texas state statute making illegal the carrying of knives with blades longer than 5.5 inches. [...] The San Antonio ordinance allows police to charge persons carrying most types of lock blade knives without good cause with a criminal misdemeanor violation, allowing police to remove the knife from the possession of the offender, while providing exemptions from the ordinance designed to protect certain classes of people the city assumes to pose no threat to public order. [...] Occasionally, city and county ordinances conflict with state law. In one example, the city of Portland, Oregon initially passed a city ordinance banning all pocket knives, [...] until the measure was overturned by the Oregon Supreme Court as conflicting with state criminal statutes.|$|E
5000|$|Were {{the flame}} {{to go out}} in a lamp, then there was a temptation for the collier to relight it. Some opened the lamps to light tobacco pipes underground. [...] Both of these {{practices}} were strictly forbidden; they clearly negated {{the whole point of the}} safety lamp. The miner was expected to return to the shaft to perform relighting, a round trip of up to a few miles. For men on piece work, this meant a loss of income (perhaps 10% of their day's pay) and so was unpopular. From the mid-century onwards, and particularly after the 1872 act, lamps had to have <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> which prevented the miner opening the lamp. Two schemes existed; either a special tool was required which kept at the pit head or else opening the lamp extinguished the flame. The latter mechanism can be seen in the Mueseler, Landau and Yates lamps below. Such a lamp was known as a protector lamp, a term picked up and used as a company name. Only on the return to the bank could the lamp man open the lamp for refilling and service. Various different locking mechanisms were developed; miners tended to be ingenious in finding ways of circumventing them. A number of additional lamps were supposed to accompany each gang of men, but restricting the number was an obvious economy for the pit owners.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- ABSTRACT-The {{automobile}} technology had {{its birth}} since 18 th century. Tremendous changes {{took place in}} the design of automobiles such as aerodynamics, green fuels, electronic control unit. In the past decades the new design for the modern car doors were introduced. The modern car doors are less convenient during parking because of the space for the parking vehicle is less and congested. This design also creates a problem during heavy traffic situations. A new car door concept is designed mainly focused to avoid these problems. This also helps to avoid accidents during opening and closing of car doors.

40|$|As {{introduced}} by Taubenfeld, a contention-sensitive {{implementation of a}} concurrent object is an implementation such that the overhead {{introduced by}} locking is eliminated in the common cases, i. e., {{when there is no}} contention or when the operations accessing concurrently the object are non-interfering. This paper, that can be considered as an introductory paper to this topic, presents a methodological construction of a contention-sensitive implementation of a concurrent stack. In a contention-free context a push or pop operation does not rest on <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> and needs only six accesses to the shared memory. In case of concurrency a single lock is required. Moreover, the implementation is starvation-free (any operation is eventually executed). The paper, that presents the algorithms in an incremental way, visits also a family of liveness conditions and important concurrency-related concepts such as the notion of an abortable object...|$|E

To understand and see if this is possible, a research and an extensive patent search where done. Then to add structure to the project a Ganttschematic were developed. To generate good and solid ideas, different methods for product development were looked upon. When a method was chosen and applied, a series of concepts emerged. Now the focus was to design and construct all the pieces. The desired manufacture procedures were looked upon as well as materials. Lot of time where spent on designing <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> to meet the demands European Automotive Supplier AB hade given. To choose the right concept the team used a set of selection matrix for the different ideas. After the choices were made, different prototypes were made of the concepts.
