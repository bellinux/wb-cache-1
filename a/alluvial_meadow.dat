We {{studied the}} {{restoration}} success of flood plain meadows {{in the northern}} Upper Rhine valley, where between 1988 and 1992, 35 ha of arable land was converted into grass-land and subsequently managed for nature conservation. Remnant populations of typical <b>alluvial</b> <b>meadow</b> species were found in old meadows and along drainage ditches that dissect the whole area. We analysed the site conditions and phytosociological relevés in old and new meadows. Small differences in site parameters between old and new meadows contrasted with a clear floristic differentiation between the two meadow types. The vegetation of old meadows was much more differentiated along prevailing environmental gradients than the vegetation of new meadows. Despite the favourable site condi-tions for the re-establishment of species-rich meadows on the former arable land, restoration success {{was limited to the}} vicin-ity of remnant stands. In contrast to old meadows, indicator species of new grassland were still typical species of regularly disturbed ruderal and arable habitats, often capable of building up a persistent seed bank. The precise mapping of 23 target species revealed that even wind dispersal predominantly leads to re-establishment in the close circumference of parent plants. We found no indication that regular flooding, hay-making and autumnal grazing had an impact on recolonization of newly created grassland. Even under favourable conditions for the re-establishment of target species, restoration success in alluvial meadows proved to be strongly dispersal limited. We discuss the implications of our findings for future restoration management in grasslands...|$|E

40|$|Vascular plants {{serve as}} target species for the {{evaluation}} of restoration success as they account for most of the plant species diversity and vegetation cover. Although bryophytes contribute considerably to the species diversity of meadows, they are rarely addressed in restoration projects. This project is a first step toward making recommendations for including mosses in alluvial floodplain restoration projects. The opportunity to assess the diversity and ecological requirements of mosses on floodplain meadows presented itself within the framework of a vegetation monitoring that took place in 2014 on meadows located along the northern Upper Rhine. In this area, large-scale meadow restoration projects have taken place since 1997 in both the functional and fossil floodplains. Other studies have shown that bryophytes are generally present in green hay used in restoration, providing inadvertent bryophyte introduction. We compared bryophyte communities in donor and restored communities and correlated these communities with environmental variables-taking into account that the mosses on the restoration sites possibly developed from green hay. This analysis provided insights as to which species of bryophytes should be included in future restoration projects, what diaspores should be used, and how they should be transferred. Data on bryophyte occurrence were gathered from old meadows, and from restoration sites. We found distinct differences in bryophyte composition (based on frequency) in restored communities in functional flood plains compared to donor communities. Generally, restoration sites are still characterized by a lower species-richness, with a significantly lower occurrence of rare and red listed species and a lower species-heterogeneity. In conclusion, our research establishes what mosses predominate in donor and restored alluvial meadows along the northern Upper River, and what microsite conditions favour particular species. This points the way to deliberate introduction of moss diaspores for more complete <b>alluvial</b> <b>meadow</b> restoration...|$|E

The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} regularities of heavy metals accumulation and transformation in soils subjected to aerosol {{emissions from}} the power station {{on the basis of the}} fractional composition of their compounds. Studies have been conducted on the soils of monitoring plots distances from the power station (1. 0 – 20. 0 km) during 15 years. The monitoring plots located on fallow areas. Soil samples for the determination of soil properties and the contents of heavy metals compounds were taken from a depth of 0 – 20 cm. The soil cover in the region under study consisted of ordinary chernozems, meadow-chernozemic soils, and <b>alluvial</b> <b>meadow</b> soils. The total amount of heavy metals in soils was determined by X-ray fluorescence. Metals in soil extracts were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The fractional composition of heavy metals was determined using combined fractionation. A combined approach for fractioning metal compounds in soils on the basis of and parallel extractions (1 N NH 4 Ac, pH 8; 1 % EDTA in NH 4 Ac; and 1 N HCl) was used. Aerosol emissions from the power station are the major agents of technogenic impact on the soils under study in the Rostov oblast. The highest degree of contamination with metals (mg/kg: Ni - 64, Cd – 1. 3, Cr - 145 and As – 12) was observed for soils located within a radius of 5 km from the power station along the predominant wind direction. It was marked the rise of metals mobility in the polluted soils and predominant participation of Cr and Ni organic-mineral complexes among their mobile species. The increasing of Cd mobility was provided predominantly by exchangeable forms and specifically sorbed by Fe-Mn (hydr) oxides.

40|$|Head cabbage is a {{vegetable}} crop with enhanced uptake of nutrients {{resulting in a}} large vegeta-tive biomass accumulation for a relatively short period. Balanced mineral nutrition with macro-and micronutrients is a necessary precondition for the normal plant growth and high yields of good quality. Plants absorb nitrogen from the soil mainly as ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitro-gen. Cabbage is {{a good source of}} carbohydrates (mainly sugars), vitamins, minerals, amino acids and other biologically active substances (Huxsoll et al. 1989). In most non-leguminous crop plants, leafs are the dominant organ in the amino acid synthesis and distribution (Noctor et al. 2002). The leaf amino acid content increases with en-hanced supply of nitrogen during growth. The content of amino acids is a good indicator for the quality of vegetables. From about 80 known amino acids only 23 are important for the human diet. Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized de novo by the organism, and there-fore must be supplied in food. Nine amino acids generally regarded as essential for humans are: isoleucine, leucine, lysine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, valine, phenylalanine and histidine. Some essential amino acids have been observed to be deficient in different plant food products; for example lysine is deficient in wheat, tryptophan in maize, and methionine in legumes. Generally, fluctuations in the amino acid proportion in plants might reflect changes in the source of nitrogen for growth (Peoples et al. 1987). The aim of our study was to establish changes in different nitrogenous forms and in the composi-tion of amino acids synthesized in head cabbage leaves after treatments with different rates and sources of nitrogen fertilizers.

40|$|The {{long-term}} Steinach Grassland Experiment {{is probably}} one of the oldest still-running fertilised grass experiments in continental Europe. The experiment was established on an <b>alluvial</b> <b>meadow</b> Alopecurus pratensis in southeastern Germany in 1933. The meadow was divided into 75 plots and fertilised with both mineral and organic fertilisers of differing compositions and amounts. The aim of this study was to provide more detailed information about the effects of long-term fertilisation by natrium (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) on the contents of risk elements in soil. The effects of long-term fertilisation were investigated in the extracts of a) plant-available elements (extraction of CaCl 2), b) easily mobilised elements (extraction of EDTA), c) potentially mobilisable elements (extraction of HNO 3), the total concentration of elements (extraction of Aqua regia). Concentrations of risk elements As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn in the soil profile has increased substantially due to the phosphorus fertilisation; however, the limits for total trace elements concentration as set by the Czech legislation have been exceeded only twice, namely in the case of As and Cd. The total concentration of As (AsT) has been exceeded only once, on the plot fertilised only by nitrogen. The assumption is that that the increased level of AsT fraction in soil was probably caused in the past by fertilising with Thomas slag which is known to contain elevated concentrations of As. However, fertilising with the phosphorus-containing fertilisers has had the opposite effect on concentrations of Mn, Ni and Zn that are easily available to plants; concentrations of these elements in the soil extraction were substantially higher. In spite of the overall concentrations of Cd being lower than the Czech legislative standards, the results on several plots fertilised by mineral and organic fertilisers containing N, P and K showed higher concentrations of Cd and in one case reached the limit value. Plots fertilised by mineral fertilisers N 160 P 44 K 174 (NH 4) 2 SO 4 recorded higher Cr concentrations. In overview, it could be stated that under various types of fertilising no substantial effects of long-term fertiliser applications on a higher content of risk elements in soil has been detected. Only two plots have exceeded the limits set by Notice 13 / 1994 Sb., in one case it was a total concentration of As and in another one that of Cd...|$|E

No significant effect of AES was found on arthropod and plant assemblages, abundance/productivity or diversity (both α and β), but the number of rare plant species was higher in sites under AES. Prescriptions had little impact on most response variables considered; the only significant impact being the positive effect of high-amounts of fertilisers on spider α- and β-diversities. Conversely, systematic long-term effects of flooding were found on all response variables of spiders, carabids and plants, underlining the key role of this factor in <b>alluvial</b> <b>meadows.</b> Our study demonstrates that maintaining or enhancing hydrological functioning of ecosystems is even more important than regulating both the cutting-dates and the low input of fertilisers for conservation purposes in flooded, already naturally nutrient rich, meadow...|$|R

The {{fertility}} of the soil had given to these trees rapid growths, and they were generally of some stature; though not one among them had that great size which ought to mark the body and branches of a venerable tenant of the forest. This fact, of itself, proved that no one tree of them all was very old; a circumstance that was certainly owing to the ravages of the annual freshets. I say annual; for though the freshet which now encompassed us, was far more serious than usual, each year brought something of the sort; and the islands were constantly increasing or diminishing under their action. To prevent the last, a thicket of trees was left at the head of each island, to form a sort of barricade against the inroads of the ice in the spring. So low was the face of the land, or meadow, however, that a rise of a very few feet in the river would be certain to bring it entirely under water.

40|$|Since the {{properties}} of water in river beds began {{to be influenced by}} anthropogenic factor, is the flood impact much stronger and less predictable. This paper is focused on floods, which are caused by the injudicious alteration of the River Odra bed near the municipality of Albrechticky. Changes in the river bed caused overflow to the populated area instead of <b>alluvial</b> <b>meadows.</b> Suggested solution is the recovery of the parallel river bed. As the flow regime has never been controlled in this area, it was necessary to carry out new measurement. In this case it was methodology of flow measurement what has been used for the flow calculation. Flow measurement has been carried in five profiles. In some parts, where the channel has the smallest capacity, the measurment has been taken by the laser rangefinder. From these measured values was the maximal capacity determined by Chezy equation. Subsequently the proposal of flood control has been simulated by the hydrodynamic model REC-RAS. According to the results of the Chezy equation and consumption curves has been found capacity of parallel channel about 3 7 m(3). s(- 1) in the smallest parts. It means, that it is able to take about thirty days of the Odra's flow. By using hydrological modelling were compared inundation areas during the current and newly proposed route, and it has been found that the inundation area at the confluence of parallel troughs would decrease almost by the half. It would be appropriate to propose the connection of the River Odra bed and parallel river bed in the flood area, it would cause decrease of the flow. The advantage of the proposal of flood control is certainly its near-natural character. It will improve reserves of surface water in the floodplain and ecological status of river.
