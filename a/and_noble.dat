5|$|His wife having died by October 1441, {{within two}} years he married Katherine Strangways, née Neville, who was dowager duchess of Norfolk <b>and</b> <b>noble</b> in her own right, being sister of Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, and thus {{what would have been}} {{considered}} a great marital prize.

5|$|Selenium, and {{possibly}} boron, silicon, arsenic and tellurium, plus the organogen elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals, as they fall outside the halogens <b>and</b> <b>noble</b> gases. The first {{five of these}} (Se; B, Si, As, Te) differ from the organogens: none are universally required for life; arsenic is notoriously poisonous; and tellurium hydride is a fairly strong, rather than weak, acidic hydride.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{went on to}} star in many films, {{including}} 1987's Like Father Like Son (a body-switch comedy with Dudley Moore), {{which was}} a box office success. His next theatrical film, 1989's Listen to Me, performed poorly at the box office. When Growing Pains ended in 1992, Cameron went on to star in The WB sitcom Kirk which premiered in 1995 and ended two years later. In Kirk, Cameron played Kirk Hartman, a 24-year-old who has to raise his siblings. Cameron <b>and</b> <b>Noble</b> also worked together on Kirk.|$|E
5|$|Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, {{phosphorus}} and sulfur {{are sometimes}} referred to or categorised as organogens, CHONPS elements or biogens. Collectively these six nonmetals are required for all life on Earth. They are further distinguished—in comparison to the halogens (F, Cl, Br, I, At) <b>and</b> <b>noble</b> gases—by their general capacity (or potential) to form allotropes; high atomisation energies; intermediate electron affinities; reactivity combined with low toxicity; ability to form alloys with metals; and the weak or neutral acid-base character of their group hydrides.|$|E

5|$|Reactions of {{elemental}} fluorine with metals require varying conditions. Alkali metals cause {{explosions and}} alkaline earth metals display vigorous activity in bulk; to prevent passivation from {{the formation of}} metal fluoride layers, most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered, <b>and</b> <b>noble</b> metals require pure fluorine gas at 300–450°C (575–850°F). Some solid nonmetals (sulfur, phosphorus) react vigorously in liquid air temperature fluorine. Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide combine readily with fluorine, the latter sometimes explosively; sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity, requiring elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|She {{also became}} {{the theme of}} {{paintings}} by several artists of the epoch, among them Hyppolyte Bellange, Achille Deveria, Philipp Veit, Francois de Villain and Wojciech Kossak. In 1842, J. K. Salomoński published a short biography of Plater in New York, under the title of Emily Plater, The Polish Heroine; Life of the Countess Emily Plater. A lithograph by F. De Villaine, based on Deveria's work, {{became one of the}} most recognizable portraits of her, popularizing her image as a delicate <b>and</b> <b>noble</b> female warrior.|$|E

The uncle is {{disappointed}} with Soelarsa and considers Soedrajat the better man. Being considered high class, he is unwilling to associate with people of the lower classes. Ultimately Soedrajat falls for a beautiful young woman, Koestijah. Meanwhile, Soelarsa saves Koestijah's life while driving a truck through her village; the two fall in love at first sight. By manipulating Koestijah's father, Soedrajat arranges for her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|The Borobudur reliefs {{also pay}} close {{attention}} to Indian aesthetic discipline, such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and aesthetic value. The reliefs of noblemen, <b>and</b> <b>noble</b> women, kings, or divine beings such as apsaras, taras and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in tribhanga pose, the three-bend pose on neck, hips, and knee, with one leg resting and one upholding the body weight. This position is considered as the most graceful pose, such as the figure of Surasundari holding a lotus.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{generally}} saw the Knights as heroic <b>and</b> <b>noble</b> men {{who brought}} Christianity and civilization to the east. In August 1914, during World War I, Germany won a battle against Russia near the site. When the Germans realized its propaganda potential, they named the battle the Battle of Tannenberg, despite it having actually taken place {{much closer to}} Allenstein (Olsztyn), and framed it as revenge for the Polish–Lithuanian victory 504 years earlier. Nazi Germany later exploited the sentiment by portraying their Lebensraum policies as {{a continuation of the}} Knights' historical mission.|$|E

Their father was the elderly Tiberius Gracchus the Elder (or Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus) who was tribune of the plebs, praetor, consul, and censor. Their mother was a patrician; Cornelia Africana daughter of Scipio Africanus himself considered a hero by the Roman populace {{for his part in}} the war against Carthage. Their parents had 12 children, but only one daughter - who later married Scipio Aemilianus (Scipio Africanus the Younger) - and two sons, Tiberius and Gaius, survived childhood.|$|E
5|$|The icon of fearless <b>and</b> <b>noble</b> Dacians as {{predecessors}} {{to modern}} Romanians was augmented and impressed by nationalist {{movements in the}} late 1920s and 1930s. On the one hand, Dacians have {{a significant role in}} creating a history of an ethnically pure origin for Romanian people. However, at the same time, they have a much more relegated role in describing Romania as a civilized and cosmopolitan nation, less so than Romans do.|$|E

Hal vows to Henry to be a good <b>and</b> <b>noble</b> king. Henry finally has faith in Hal and advises him on how to be a king. Henry dies and Hal tells his men that he is now King Henry V.|$|E

During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. Sometime during late 1965, the Tea Set began calling itself the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and by early 1966, Pink Floyd.|$|E

5|$|Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit {{in front}} of a warm fire, {{continuing}} from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart.
