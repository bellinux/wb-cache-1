500|$|In {{his book}} , author J. Randy Taraborrelli {{describes}} the song as a [...] "somber, sarcastic, all-the-world's-a-stage song about unrequited love... whose phoniness might have fooled everyone else, but not her." [...] He {{goes on to}} say that in the song Madonna tells the subject of her unrequited love to take a bow for [...] "rendering a great, transparent performance in life and love." [...] Alongside the betrayal of her lover, the lyrics <b>also</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Madonna trying to understand the reasons behind adultery. As the song progresses, the listener realizes that through the lyrics the singer was talking about herself—"One lonely star and you don't know who you are". According to Musicnotes.com, the song has a moderate calypso feel and is set in the time signature of common time and progresses in 80 beats per minute. The composition is set in the key of A major with Madonna's vocal ranging from E3 to C5. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] contains a basic sequence of A–Bm7/E–A–Fmaj7 during the opening strings, and A–A/G–Fm7 during the verses as its chord progression.|$|E

It begins with a soft piano sound and then changes into a high-energy electro song. The composition is in a sing-along style, with Gaga belting out [...] "I don't want be alone forever, but I can be tonight" [...] during the chorus, talking about navigating an unknown road based only on her instincts. The lyrics <b>also</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> falling in love while being true to oneself, which was the initial inspiration for the track. She compares herself with [...] "Dorothy on a yellow brick, Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick", referring to the fictional yellow brick road traveled by Dorothy Gale in the 1939 film, The Wizard of Oz. The line refers to the singer approaching a crossroad in her relationships, however she feels safe with her fans. Ericka Welch of The Huffington Post explained that [...] " [...] with the looming sense of loss, Gaga can't be sad when she sees all the stamps on her passport and realizes that she has the whole world in front of her." ...|$|E

For instance, if the spot price for USD/JPY is 120, and the forward price one year hence is 110, then a call struck at 110 is ATMF but not ATM.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion of}} computability of a {{function}} can be relativized to an arbitrary set of natural numbers A. [...] A function f is defined to be computable in A (equivalently A-computable or computable relative to A) when it satisfies {{the definition of}} a computable function with modifications allowing access to A as an oracle. [...] As with the concept of a computable function relative computability can be given equivalent definitions in many different models of computation. [...] This is commonly accomplished by supplementing the model of computation with an additional primitive operation which asks whether a given integer is a member of A. [...] We can <b>also</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> f being computable in g by identifying g with its graph.|$|E
2500|$|Ruth Firer of the Harry S. Truman Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Sami Adwan, a {{professor}} of education at Bethlehem University in Bethlehem compared Palestinian and Israeli textbooks in 2002. Of the Palestinian textbooks they found [...] "According to the everyday experience of Palestinians, modern-day Israelis are presented as occupiers. The texts include examples of Israelis killing and imprisoning Palestinians, demolishing their homes, uprooting fruit trees, and confiscating their lands and building settlements on them. The texts <b>also</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the right of return for the 1948 Palestinian refugees when describing how those refugees live in camps." [...] The Israeli textbooks are generally [...] "presented without the national-political debate". Their 2004 study of 13 Israeli textbooks and 9 Palestinian textbooks found that [...] "neither side's books {{tell the story of the}} conflict from the other's viewpoint, both ignore the other side's suffering and each counts only its only victims".|$|E

2500|$|By 1988, {{several people}} demanded reform within the Communist Party itself. At the 19th Conference, the first party conference held since 1941, several delegates {{asked for the}} {{introduction}} of term limits, {{and an end to}} appointments of officials, and to introduce multi-candidate elections within the party. Some called for a maximum of two term-periods in each party body, including the Central Committee, others supported Nikita Khrushchev's policy of compulsory turnover rules, which had been ended by the Brezhnev leadership. Other people called for the General Secretary to either be elected by the people, or a [...] "kind of party referendum". There was <b>also</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> introducing age limits, and decentralising, and weakening the party's bureaucracy. The nomenklatura system came under attack; several delegates asked why the leading party members had rights to a better life, at least materially, and why the leadership was more-or-less untouchable, as they had been under Leonid Brezhnev, even if their incompetence was clear to everyone. Other complained that the Soviet working class was given too large a role in party organisation; scientific personnel and other white-collar employees were legally discriminated against.|$|E

2500|$|... "We want to {{add value}} through skills acquisition. But in doing this, we have {{found out that the}} main problem is getting finance at {{affordable}} interest rates. The Federal Government talks about this and the banks <b>also</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it. But I want to state here that the banks have not been helpful. They always say money is available. Where is the money? There is no small scale industrialist who walks into a bank and gets a loan. It is difficult for SMEs to get loans from banks because they always demand for collaterals. The collateral they ask for is over and above the worth of the loan. So, the banks are not keen on lending to small scale businesses at all. They say this sub-sector is risk infested. They may claim that they have given some amount of money as loans to the SMEs; but you will find out that this is not true. For instance, what can a loan that is given to 2,000 people in a nation of about 167 million people do? The last statistics conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that there were about 17 million small scale industrialists in Nigeria and you are talking about empowering 2,000 people with loans. What is that? So, the banks are paying lip service to funding SMEs." ...|$|E
2500|$|While analysts {{generally}} {{agree that}} the CPC has rejected orthodox Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought (or at least basic thoughts within orthodox thinking), the CPC itself disagrees. Some Western commentators <b>also</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a [...] "crisis of ideology" [...] within the party; {{they believe that the}} CPC has rejected communism. Wang Xuedong, the Director of the Institute of World Socialism, said in response, [...] "We know there are those abroad who think we have a 'crisis of ideology,' but we do not agree." [...] According to Jiang Zemin, the CPC [...] "must never discard Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.” He said that “if we did, we would lose our foundation.” He further noted that Marxism in general [...] "like any science, needs to change as time and circumstances advance." [...] Certain groups argue that Jiang Zemin ended the CPC's formal commitment to Marxism with the introduction of the ideological theory, the Three Represents. However, party theorist Leng Rong disagrees, claiming that [...] "President Jiang rid the Party of the ideological obstacles to different kinds of ownership [...] He did not give up Marxism or socialism. He strengthened the Party by providing a modern understanding of Marxism and socialism—which is why we talk about a ‘socialist market economy’ with Chinese characteristics." [...] Marxism in its core is, according to Jiang Zemin, methodology and the goal of a future, classless society, not analyses of class and of the contradictions between different classes.|$|E
2500|$|... "Teenage Dream" [...] is a midtempo {{love song}} {{with a strong}} beat that follows the retro sound of {{previous}} single [...] "California Gurls". It is predominantly a power pop and electropop song, which features influences of disco and pop rock. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of B major, and moves at a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It starts with the sequence of B–B2 played by a guitar.

The general chord progression of the song is made from the progression E - Gm – F. [...] Perry's vocals in the song span from the note of B3 to the note of F5. The song starts with relatively high vocals, with Perry singing in head voice; it also continues during the second verse. Amos Barshad of New York said that [...] "if not for a bluntly muscular chorus ('You! ..... make! ..... me!'), [...] is nearly a ballad." [...] The lyrics refer to being with a lover that makes one feel like a teenager. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the lyrics refer to being in love, and about the feelings of commitment and security that it brings. They <b>also</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> taking the relationship further in lines such as: [...] "Let's go all the way tonight / No regrets, just love / We can dance until we die / You and I / We'll be young forever".|$|E
