25|$|Bovine {{papillomavirus}} (BPV) is a {{group of}} DNA viruses of the family Papillomaviridae that are common in cattle. Infection causes warts (papillomas and fibropapillomas) of the skin and <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract,</b> and more rarely cancers of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract</b> and urinary bladder. They are also thought to cause the skin tumour equine sarcoid in horses and donkeys.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common {{locations}} for a foreign body is the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract.</b>|$|E
25|$|BPV-4 causes {{squamous}} cell carcinomas of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract,</b> and BPV-1/2 causes carcinomas and haemangioendotheliomas of the urinary bladder, {{in both cases}} in animals that have fed on bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). Such cancers are common in locations where grazing land is infested with bracken, such as the western Scottish Highlands, southern Italy and the Nasampolai Valley in Kenya. Bracken contains several immunosuppressants and mutagens, including quercetin and ptaquiloside. Consumption of large quantities by cattle leads to an acute poisoning syndrome with symptoms of bone marrow depletion, while at lower levels of long-term consumption it acts as a cancer cofactor. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process; tumours also contain activated Ras, as well as mutation or downregulation of the tumour suppressor genes p53 in <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract</b> cancers and fragile histidine tetrads (FHIT) in urinary bladder cancers. Viral particles are not produced in either <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract</b> or urinary bladder tumours.|$|E
50|$|Many {{specimens}} of B. higginsi show {{some form of}} exceptionally preserved, non-biomineralised tissue. Structures interpreted as <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts</b> and probable digestive glands are commonly preserved. The slender antennas are rarely preserved.|$|R
50|$|Many endoparasites and ectoparasites, due {{to their}} {{parasitic}} behaviour, are transported by other animals. For example, tapeworms attach themselves {{to the inside of}} the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts</b> of other animals and do not locomote within the animal. They do however depend on movement of the host to distribute their eggs.|$|R
25|$|Since diatoms form an {{important}} part of the food of molluscs, tunicates, and fishes, the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts</b> of these animals often yield forms that are not easily secured in other ways. Marine diatoms can be collected by direct water sampling, though benthic forms can be secured by scraping barnacles, oyster shells, and other shells.|$|R
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae can infect a {{range of}} animal hosts, and both {{subspecies}} are of importance. However, the bacterium is frequently encountered as a colonizer of healthy animals, especially in the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract</b> and genital region.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae {{subspecies}} equisimilis (SDSE) is a commensal {{in human}} <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract</b> and genital tract. Occasionally it is isolated from skin, but usually {{in relation to}} a chronic skin condition or some breach of the epithelial barrier.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicity}} or irritating {{ability is}} usually not high, but it is sometimes enough to cause problems for the skin or for the tissues of the respiratory tract or <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract</b> (e.g., the mouth, larynx, esophagus, trachea, or lungs).|$|E
5000|$|The plant disperses by {{movement}} of seeds [...] - [...] on the wool or fur of animals, the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts</b> of grazing animals or birds, movement {{in water and}} most importantly as a contaminant of hay or grain.

30|$|TAE {{has become}} the {{first-line}} therapy {{for the management of}} acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding which is resistant to endoscopic treatment [6]. TAE was also effective for intercostal AEF in terms of the accuracy and rapidity of hemostasis. Esophageal bypass for patients with esophago-respiratory fistula makes it possible to divide the respiratory and <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts,</b> which can prevent pulmonary sepsis caused by the continuous supply of saliva, digestive juice, and/or necrotic tissue from the tumor [7]. In the present case, esophageal bypass was performed to control mediastinitis and allow for the resumption of oral intake by dividing the focus of infection and the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts</b> under the same concept as that reported by Nakajima et al. [7]. The feasible and radical treatment for intercostal AEF was esophageal bypass because mediastinitis {{was one of the main}} causes of intercostal AEF. Due to successful TAE and esophageal bypass, the present case did not suffer from rebleeding after TAE.|$|R
25|$|While the old cuticle {{is being}} digested, the new layer is secreted. All cuticular {{structures}} are shed at ecdysis, including the inner {{parts of the}} exoskeleton, which includes terminal linings of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract</b> and of the tracheae if they are present.|$|E
25|$|A crop, or croup, is a {{thin-walled}} expanded {{portion of}} the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract</b> used for the storage of food prior to digestion. In some birds it is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds.|$|E
25|$|A more bizarre {{example of}} {{commensalism}} occurs between the slim, eel-shaped pinhead pearlfish and a particular species of sea cucumber.

50|$|Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), {{also known}} as {{oncogene}} 24p3 or neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LCN2 gene. NGAL is involved in innate immunity by sequestrating iron that in turn limits bacterial growth. It is expressed in neutrophils and in low levels in the kidney, prostate, and epithelia of the respiratory and <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts.</b> NGAL {{is used as a}} biomarker of kidney injury.|$|R
50|$|A botfly, {{also written}} bot fly, bott fly or bot-fly in various combinations, is any {{fly in the}} family Oestridae. Their lifecycles vary greatly {{according}} to species, but the larvae of all species are internal parasites of mammals. Largely according to species, they also are known variously as warble flies, heel flies, and gadflies. The larvae of some species grow in the flesh of their hosts, while others grow within the hosts' <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts.</b>|$|R
50|$|FMRFamide is an {{important}} neuropeptide in several phyla such as Insecta, Nematoda, Mollusca and Annelida. It is the most abundant neuropeptide in endocrine cells of insect <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts</b> along with allatostatin and tachykinin families, however the neuropeptide’s function is not known. Generally, the neuropeptide is encoded by several genes such as flp-1 through flp-22 in C. elegans. The common precursor of the FaRPs is modified to yield many different neuropeptides all having the same FMRFamide sequence. Moreover, these peptides are not functionally redundant.|$|R
25|$|Promastigote {{is formed}} in the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract</b> of the sandfly. It is an {{extracellular}} and motile form. It is considerably larger and more highly elongated, measuring 15–30µm in length and 5µm in width. It is spindle-shaped, tapering at both ends. A long flagellum (about the body length) is projected externally at the anterior end. The nucleus lies at the centre, {{and in front of}} which are kinetoplast and basal body.|$|E
25|$|In children, {{abdominal}} radiography {{is indicated}} in the acute setting in suspected bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation, foreign body in the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract,</b> suspected abdominal mass and intussusception (latter {{as part of the}} differential diagnosis). Yet, CT scan is the best alternative for diagnosing intra-abdominal injury in children. For acute abdominal pain in adults, an abdominal x-ray has a low sensitivity and accuracy in general. Computed tomography provides an overall better surgical strategy planning, and possibly less unnecessary laparotomies. Abdominal x-ray is therefore not recommended for adults presenting in the emergency department with acute abdominal pain.|$|E
25|$|At four (4) {{weeks of}} gestational development, the neural crest cells (the {{precursors}} of the nose) begin their caudad migration (from the posterior) towards the midface. Two symmetrical nasal placodes (the future olfactory epithelium) develop inferiorly, which the nasal pits then divide into the medial and the lateral nasal processes (the future upper lip and nose). The medial processes then form the septum, the philtrum, and the premaxilla of the nose; the lateral processes form {{the sides of}} the nose; and the mouth forms from the stomodeum (the anterior ectodermal portion of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract),</b> which is inferior to the nasal complex.|$|E
40|$|From 1981 to 1991, 37, 666 human, animal, {{food and}} {{environmental}} samples were cultured for Yersinia pseudotuberculosis using direct plating methods and/or cold enhancement techniques.

40|$|Microscopic {{examination}} of <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts</b> of fourteen Neomys teres (Miller, 1908) from a mountainous region in northern Armenia produced the first {{data on the}} diet of this almost unknown species of conservation concern. Twenty-three different prey types were distinguished in summer-caught shrews, all invertebrates (14 terrestrial and 9 aquatic in origin). The dominant dietary items were Coleoptera and Diptera adults, Araneae, Opiliones and Lumbricidae plus freshwater crustaceans and Trichoptera larvae. Prey ranged from 16 mm in length but those eaten most frequently were 6 - 10 mm in length. Although it was captured beside streams and rivers, aquatic prey comprised only 27 % of dietary composition. Despite its morphological similarity to N. fodiens, its foraging niche more closely resembles that of upland populations of N. anomalus and its reliance on aquatic habitats remains equivocal...|$|R
25|$|Boring's minor {{research}} strayed too {{far from}} Titchener's definition of psychology. It was at Titchener's suggestion {{that he decided to}} do his thesis on visceral sensibility. He conducted the study by placing a stomach tube in his own stomach {{to learn more about the}} sensations of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract.</b> The results indicated that the stomach and esophagus were more sensitive to temperature and pressure than had been realized. The studies indicate his interest, from an early age, in the physical and experimental components of psychology. In 1914, Boring's efforts were rewarded when he received his Ph.D.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae is a gram positive, beta-haemolytic, coccal {{bacterium}} {{belonging to}} the family Streptococcaceae. It is capable of infecting both humans and animals, but is most frequently encountered as a commensal of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract,</b> genital tract, or less commonly, {{as a part of}} the skin flora. The clinical manifestations in human disease range from superficial skin-infections and tonsillitis, to severe necrotising fasciitis and bacteraemia.

Several different animal species are susceptible to infection by S.dysgalactiae, but bovine mastitis and infectious arthritis in lambs (joint ill) have been most frequently reported.|$|E
25|$|Galen {{notes that}} the {{exanthem}}a covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby {{where there was no}} ulceration. He states that those that were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually {{in the form of a}} blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract</b> via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, catarrh, cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.|$|E
40|$|The <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts</b> of 12 {{species of}} Antarctic squid were {{examined}} visually and serologically {{for the presence}} of Euphausia superba. Only four species, Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Galiteuthis glacialis, Martialia hyadesi and Psychroteuthis glacialis, contained material which was identifiable to species visually. Myctophid fish and euphausiids were the most common prey item. Serology showed that specimens of six species had eaten euphausiids. Where antisera showed cross-reactions with other potential prey species, biogeographical and haul data was used to determine the species of Euphausia consumed. P. glacialis (n= 19) had consumed E. superba. Mastigoteuthis psychrophila (n= 10) had eaten E. superba and/or E. triacantha. Brachioteuthis picta (n= 6), M. hyadesi (n= 27), and two Moroteuthis spp. (n= 2) had consumed unidentified euphausiids.

40|$|The {{evidence}} {{offered in the}} first of these studies indicative of a causative relationship between Rickettsia ruminantium and heartwater is supplemented by the following observations concerning the ticks which carry the disease. When larvæ, which had taken no food since hatching, were allowed to feed upon cases of heartwater, they acquired Rickettsiœ which appeared to be identical with those in the tissues of animals suffering from heartwater, whereas control larvæ hatched from eggs deposited by the same female and fed on normal animals remained free of Rickettsiœ. After larvæ presumably infective had moulted, the resultant nymphæ containing Rickettsiœ in their <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts,</b> when fed upon susceptible animals produced in them typical attacks of heartwater, which the control nymphae, devoid of Rickettsiœ, failed to do.

40|$|Mice {{deficient}} for phagocyte oxidase (Phox) and {{nitric oxide}} synthase 2 (NOS 2) (gp 91 phox−/−/NOS 2 −/−), defective {{in the production of}} both reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI), were used to investigate the role of phagocytic cells during mucosal and systemic candidiasis of endogenous origin. The <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts</b> of germfree mice were colonized with Candida albicans wild type or each of two hyphal signaling-defective mutants (efg 1 /efg 1 and efg 1 /efg 1 cph 1 /cph 1). All Candida-colonized gp 91 phox−/−/NOS 2 −/− mice were moribund within 12 to 15 days after oral inoculation. C. albicans wild-type and mutant strains colonized the <b>alimentary</b> <b>tracts</b> equally well and were able to translocate, most likely via Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, to the internal organs and trigger the formation of abscesses; however, the wild-type and mutant strains did not survive in the abscessed murine tissues. Surprisingly, {{there was no significant difference}} in the ability of peritoneal exudate cells from gp 91 phox−/−/NOS 2 −/−, NOS 2 −/−, gp 91 phox−/−, or immunocompetent C 57 BL/ 6 mice to kill C. albicans in vitro. This suggests that anti-Candida factors other than ROI and RNI can control the growth of C. albicans and that gp 91 phox−/−/NOS 2 −/− mice die due to the inability of the host to control its inflammatory response to Candida. Correspondingly, reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed increased expression of the cytokines gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and the chemokines MIP- 2 and KC at the site of infection, while interleukin- 15 expression remained relatively unchanged between germfree and infected tissues. These studies indicate that defects in ROI and RNI enabled C. albicans to translocate and disseminate to the internal organs, resulting in an uncontrolled immune response, severe pathology, and death; however, ROI and RNI were not required for the killing of phagocytized C. albicans, indicating that other anti-Candida factors either compensate or are sufficient for the killing of phagocytized Candida...|$|R
500|$|Poliovirus is an enterovirus. Infection occurs via the fecal–oral route, {{meaning that}} one ingests the virus and viral {{replication}} {{occurs in the}} <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract.</b> Virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals. In 95% of cases only a primary, transient presence of viremia (virus in the bloodstream) occurs, and the poliovirus infection is asymptomatic. In about 5% of cases, the virus spreads and replicates in other sites such as brown fat, reticuloendothelial tissue, and muscle. The sustained viral replication causes secondary viremia and leads {{to the development of}} minor symptoms such as fever, headache, and sore throat. Paralytic poliomyelitis occurs in less than 1% of poliovirus infections. Paralytic disease occurs when the virus enters the central nervous system (CNS) and replicates in motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex, resulting in the selective destruction of motor neurons leading to temporary or permanent paralysis. In rare cases, paralytic poliomyelitis leads to respiratory arrest and death. In cases of paralytic disease, muscle pain and spasms are frequently observed prior to onset of weakness and paralysis. Paralysis typically persists [...] from days to weeks prior to recovery.|$|E

He also described the first known tracheotomy performed on a pediatric patient. A 14-year-old boy swallowed a bag containing 9 gold coins in an attempt to prevent its theft by a highwayman. The object became lodged in his esophagus, obstructing his trachea. Habicot performed a tracheotomy, which allowed him to manipulate the bag so that it passed through the boy's <b>alimentary</b> <b>tract,</b> apparently with no further sequelae. Habicot suggested that the operation might also be effective for patients suffering from inflammation of the larynx.
