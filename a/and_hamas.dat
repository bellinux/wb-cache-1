5|$|A 15-member {{municipal}} council currently administers Deir al-Balah. Although {{thought to be}} a stronghold of Fatah, Hamas members defeated Fatah's candidates in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections by a large margin, taking 13 seats. Despite their political affiliations, all candidates ran as Independents. Two female candidates also gained seats. Local sheikh, school operator <b>and</b> <b>Hamas</b> member Ahmad Harb Kurd garnered the most votes making him the current head of the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah has close {{relations}} with Iran. It also has {{ties with the}} leadership in Syria, specifically President Hafez al-Assad (until his death in 2000) supported it. It's also a close Assad ally, and its leader pledged support to the embattled Syrian leader. Although Hezbollah <b>and</b> <b>Hamas</b> are not organizationally linked, Hezbollah provides military training as well as financial and moral support to the Sunni Palestinian group. Furthermore, Hezbollah is {{a strong supporter of}} the ongoing Al-Aqsa Intifada.|$|E
5|$|Gaza fell to British forces during World War I, {{becoming}} {{a part of}} Mandatory Palestine. As {{a result of the}} 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Gaza was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, but in 1993, the city was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah <b>and</b> <b>Hamas,</b> resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. Egypt and Israel consequently imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing in 2011 to pedestrians.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, which began with the Hezbollah terror group's attack across the {{international}} border, Harper defended publicly Israel's [...] "right to defend itself," [...] and described the Israeli response as [...] "measured". Harper stated that Hezbollah <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> release of Israeli prisoners (Hezbollah held the bodies of two dead Israeli soldiers who were killed in the initial attack) would {{bring an end to the}} conflict.|$|R
50|$|During the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, Sawant unsuccessfully {{urged the}} Seattle City Council to condemn both Israel's attacks on Gaza <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> attacks on Israel, {{and called on}} President Obama and Congress to {{denounce}} the Israeli blockade of Gaza and to cut off all military assistance to Israel. Sawant's call to condemn Israel's actions prompted a response from Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer, calling for Sawant to retract the statement.|$|R
50|$|After the {{election}} of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, Rabbi Froman stepped up his efforts to organize meetings between Israeli and Palestinian religious leaders. He met and conducted negotiations with current Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, Sheikh Mahmoud Abu Tir, with the goal of drafting a ceasefire agreement that will end the killings in Gaza and the West Bank and lift the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, Israel withdrew {{its troops}} from the Gaza Strip and removed the {{thousands}} of Israelis who had settled in the territory. See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004. Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organization Fatah. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip <b>and</b> <b>Hamas</b> members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Currently, Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control {{of the city and}} Strip.|$|E
25|$|Five {{years and}} four months after Shalit was {{captured}} by Palestinian militants in southern Israel, a deal was reached between Israel <b>and</b> <b>Hamas</b> to release Shalit in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners. The deal was brokered by German and Egyptian mediators and signed in Egypt on 11 October 2011. Its first phase was executed on 18 October, with Israel releasing 450 Palestinian prisoners <b>and</b> <b>Hamas</b> transferring Shalit to Cairo.|$|E
25|$|They {{concluded}} that Israel <b>and</b> <b>Hamas</b> {{have yet to}} establish a convincing basis for any claims that contradict {{the findings of the}} mission's report contradicting Goldstones claims.|$|E
50|$|In August 2006, Sieradski and two fellow yeshiva {{students}} {{organized a}} benefit concert in Jerusalem attended by 80 people, that {{raised more than}} NIS4,500 or around $1,000, for Israeli and Lebanese victims of that summer's war between Israel and Hezbollah. In January 2009, Sieradski led a similar effort to express empathy for victims {{on both sides of}} the Arab-Israeli conflict. Responding to the renewed violence in Gaza, he organized a demonstration in New York City, attended by fewer than 50 people, condemning both Israel's <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> attacks on civilians.|$|R
50|$|Etymologists have {{tentatively}} {{linked the}} biblical חבצלת {{to the words}} בצל beṣel, meaning 'bulb', <b>and</b> חמץ <b>ḥāmaṣ,</b> which is understood as meaning either 'pungent' or 'splendid' (The Analytical Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon).|$|R
50|$|Since the Palestinian {{legislative}} election, 2006, Israel {{has been}} negotiating with Mahmoud Abbas and the PLO, {{but has been}} simultaneously targeting and bombing Hamas activists and militants <b>and</b> arresting <b>Hamas's</b> elected legislative counsel politicians.|$|R
25|$|Hagel {{was criticized}} by the Christian Science Monitor and many Republicans, {{including}} senator John McCain, for opposing some sanctions against Iran, and for calling for dialogue with Iran <b>and</b> <b>Hamas.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 11 October 2011, the Pan-Arabist Al Arabiya network {{reported}} that Israel <b>and</b> <b>Hamas</b> had {{reached an agreement}} on Shalit. Netanyahu convened a special Cabinet meeting to approve the Shalit deal.|$|E
50|$|The Palestinians who {{negotiated}} the 2008 cease-fire believed that commerce in Gaza {{was to be}} restored to the levels preceding Israel's 2005 withdrawal <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> electoral victory. Israeli policy tied the easing of the blockade to success in reducing rocket fire. Israel permitted a 20% increase in goods trucked into Gaza in the pre-lull period, up from 70 to 90 truckloads a day, including not only humanitarian supplies but also clothes, shoes, refrigerators, and construction materials. Fuel supplies increased from 55MW worth to 65MW worth. BBC News reported on 11 November that Gaza was then receiving only 28% {{of the amount of}} goods traded before the Hamas takeover.|$|R
50|$|In early 2012, due to {{internal}} economic disagreement between the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas Government in Gaza, decreased supplies from Egypt and through tunnel smuggling, <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> refusal to ship fuel via Israel, the Gaza Strip {{plunged into a}} fuel crisis, bringing increasingly long electricity shut downs and disruption of transportation. Egypt attempted to stop the use of underground tunnels for delivery of Egyptian fuel purchased by Palestinian authorities, and severely reduced supply through the tunnel network. As the crisis deepened, Hamas sought to equip the Rafah terminal between Egypt and Gaza for fuel transfer, and refused to accept fuel delivered via the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza.|$|R
5000|$|More in general, in 2014 al-Arouri was {{in charge}} of several Hamas {{military}} cells both in the West Bank and in Jordan. The US Treasury claimed that by then, he had [...] "facilitated the transfer {{of hundreds of thousands of}} dollars to Hamas, including to the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, for the purchase of arms and storage facilities for weapons." [...] Al-Arouri succeeded in establishing solid ties between the West bank cells <b>and</b> <b>Hamas’s</b> U.S.-based financiers. In this connection, terror finance expert Matthew Levitt claimed that al-Arouri [...] "played a critical intermediary role between otherwise compartmented elements of <b>Hamas’s</b> external leadership <b>and</b> on-the-ground operatives." ...|$|R
25|$|Following the {{conflict}} that erupted {{between the two}} main Palestinian parties, Fatah <b>and</b> <b>Hamas,</b> Hamas {{took control of the}} Gaza Strip, splintering the Palestinian Authority into two polities, each claiming to be the true representatives of the Palestinian people. Fatah controlled the Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank <b>and</b> <b>Hamas</b> governed in Gaza. Hostilities between Gaza and Israel increased. Egypt brokered the 2008 Israel–Hamas ceasefire, which lasted half a year beginning on 19 June 2008 and lasted until 19 December 2008. The collapse of the ceasefire led to the Gaza War on 27 December 2008.|$|E

25|$|A {{day after}} the attack, the {{following}} organizations {{claimed responsibility for the}} operation – the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (the armed wing of Hamas), the Popular Resistance Committees (which includes members of Fatah, Islamic Jihad, <b>and</b> <b>Hamas),</b> and a previously unknown group calling itself the Army of Islam.|$|E

50|$|From 2003 to 2008, Stalinsky penned {{a weekly}} column for The New York Sun, {{focusing}} on {{aspects of the}} post-9/11 world and the Iraq War. During this period, Stalinsky wrote about numerous issues concerning extremism and terrorism years before they became widely understood and discussed as they are today. For example, his columns detailed how terrorists were beginning to use social media, such as YouTube, {{and how they were}} filming and disseminating graphic videos of beheadings and executions for propaganda purposes. Stalinsky also commented on conspiracy theories in the Middle East; on Islamic extremism on satellite TV programs broadcast in the West, including those of Al Jazeera; on the rise of Islamism in Turkey, propelled by then-Turkish prime minister Recep Erdogan and his AKP party; and more. His columns included several series devoted to such topics as Hezbullah's Al-Manar TV <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> Al-Aqsa TV.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{years of}} {{uprising}} and Israeli military actions, siege of West Bank cities and President Arafat's de facto house arrest, {{it was hard}} to imagine the situation getting worse for Palestinians. It has. On all fronts [...] Palestinian/Palestinian, Palestinian/Israeli and Palestinian/ international [...] prevailing dynamics are leading to a dangerous breakdown. Subjected to the cumulative effects of a military occupation in its 40 th year and now what is effectively an international sanctions regime, the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority (PA) government cannot pay salaries or deliver basic services.
