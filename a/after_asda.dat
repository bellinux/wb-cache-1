5000|$|In 2008, Ajinomoto sued British {{supermarket}} chain Asda, part of Wal-Mart, for a malicious falsehood action concerning its aspartame product when the chemical {{was listed as}} excluded from the chain's product line along with other [...] "nasties". In July 2009, a British court found in favour of Asda. In June 2010, an appeal court reversed the decision, allowing Ajinomoto to pursue a case against Asda to protect aspartame's reputation. At that time, Asda {{said that it would}} continue to use the term [...] "no nasties" [...] on its own-label products, [...] however, the suit was settled out of court in 2011 <b>after</b> <b>Asda</b> removed references to aspartame from its packaging.|$|E
5000|$|A large Asda Supercentre is {{situated}} on the Minworth border with Walmley. This opened on 3 May 1977 as a Carrefour hypermarket, before being {{taken over by the}} Dee Corporation that owned Gateway Foodmarkets and the larger Gateway Superstores in 1987. Since late 1989 it has been an Asda hypermarket, which <b>after</b> <b>Asda</b> was taken over by Walmart in 1999 was branded as an Asda Wal*Mart Supercentre in 2001. By 2007, however, the building was becoming outdated and Asda decided to rebuild it, but after haggling with the local authority Asda decided against this due to the costs demanded for environmental incentives and planning conditions deemed to be excessive by the company. The original store still remains there today. [...] However, the interior of the store was completely remodelled and more or less rebuilt. The exterior was also refreshed and from 2008, the store signage was changed to Asda SupercentreÂ„ and the Walmart branding was removed.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} opened for the East Barnet Gas and Water Company (formed 1866) which in 1872 took over two local gas {{companies}} {{and became the}} Barnet & District Gas and Water Company. The company was nationalised in 1949 and {{became part of the}} Eastern Gas Board. Some time <b>after</b> 2000, <b>Asda</b> supermarkets acquired the site but plans for housing and a supermarket were not approved and they sold the area to the social housing provider One Housing.|$|R

Research conducted by the company has shown 49.5% of visitors to the site will go onto purchase in-store within 48 hours.|$|R
50|$|The {{branch of}} Somerfield in Wells, Somerset, England had {{featured}} {{prominently in the}} film Hot Fuzz and Somerfield branding was clearly visible. In the film {{the manager of the}} supermarket Simon Skinner, played by Timothy Dalton, is a charming but sinister individual. The film includes a gun battle scene in the supermarket between police and staff members in full Somerfield uniforms, and a scene involving hand-to-hand combat. Simon Skinner was also injured after tripping on a miniature Somerfield lorry in a model village, landing on the model church and getting severely injured in the throat. The Somerfield shop also appeared on BBC's Top Gear, during an interview between actor Simon Pegg and host Jeremy Clarkson. The reason the store was chosen was due to the director of the film Edgar Wright having formerly worked at the store. Wright also made an amateur film called Dead Right that had scenes in the same store which is featured on the bonus DVD editions of Hot Fuzz. The gameshow Dale's Supermarket Sweep for its 1993-1999 run on ITV had the supermarket set modelled and furnished <b>after</b> <b>Asda,</b> between 1993 to 1994, complete with their own label products, then Somerfield of the era between 1995 to 1997, and then the Co-op until the original series ended in 1999. The 2007 revival series had a similar look.|$|E
50|$|In August 2010, <b>after</b> much anticipation, <b>Asda</b> {{announced}} Crescent Link {{as being}} its location for its debut Derry store. The unit which currently houses Homebase will be altered and extended, allowing {{the addition of}} a large 40,000sq ft retail unit whilst retaining the Homebase retail outlet at the site.Plans have also been lodged for a competitive development, further south on the A514, of the Kilfennan Roundabout. This will be home to a new Sainsburys along with Petrol Station, a Premier Inn hotel and six screen cinema, along with other facilities for the local population.It is largely recognised that Crescent Link has benefited from passing trade along the A514, as this road is the main link between the Foyle Bridge and Belfast bound road. It will need to be seen what impact will occur to this passing trade when the high quality dual carriage way is built from 2012, which will start at the Gransha Roundabout and continue 20 mi to its terminus at the eastern edge of Dungiven.|$|R
50|$|On 8 February 2009, Arriva {{reduced the}} {{frequency}} of services 7 and 8 to some areas, which angered some residents in Hockley and Hawkwell, as it made {{it very difficult for}} them to get to and from Southend Hospital and Clements Hall Leisure Centre on time due to the 7 and 8 either running very late in the Shoebury area, or buses turning back before reaching their terminating point. The move also dismayed Rochford councillors. The Hockley Residents' Association also said that the figures for low customer numbers used to justify the frequency reduction were flawed. After receiving numerous complaints from Hockley residents, on 7 June 2009 Arriva Southend extended some service 7 buses to Hockley Spa instead of terminating at Ashingdon Schools. It is likely that this extra service is now going to stay after a review in December 2009. Hawkwell residents then sent further complaints to the Essex County Council about service 8 not having evening services after 6:30pm since 2002. They demanded that one of the service 7 evening buses to become an 8 and divert to Hawkwell. Essex County Council said it would not be possible to add an evening service to service 8. Arriva Southend have also been criticised for running all of their services in the Shoeburyness area via <b>Asda,</b> <b>after</b> they changed the route of Service 1 to run through Asda instead of Elm Road.|$|R
