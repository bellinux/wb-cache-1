One of the unusual features of the original bill establishing domestic partnerships was that it allowed partnerships to be created between people who were related by blood (e.g., siblings or a parent and <b>adult</b> <b>child,</b> provided both were single). All couples registered as domestic partners are entitled to the same rights as family members and spouses to visit their domestic partners in the hospital and jail and to make decisions concerning the treatment of a domestic partner's remains and estate after the partner's death.|$|E

However, research shows that the death of a parent in an adult's midlife is not a normative event by any measure, but is a major life transition causing an evaluation of one's own life or mortality. Others may shut out friends and family in processing the loss of someone with whom they have had the longest relationship.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate if <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> who have returned home to live affect their parents' marital satisfaction. The contributing factors that preceded the return of these <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> were also examined. To measure marital satisfaction, the Kansas Marital Satisfaction (KMS) Scale was used. The Marital Conventionalization Scale (MCS) was also utilized to measure marital social desirability distortion. Seventy-seven married individuals, recruited from the general population, were divided into three subgroups consisting of parents whose <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> have either returned, departed from, or remained at home. Participants were administered a questionnaire containing specific questions regarding one's <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> along with the two test instruments.

2500|$|As {{the first}} {{generation}} of law-enforced only-children came of age for becoming parents themselves, one <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> was left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. Called the [...] "4-2-1 Problem", this leaves the older generations with increased chances of dependency on retirement funds or charity in order to receive support. If personal savings, pensions, or state welfare fail, most senior citizens would be left entirely dependent upon their very small family or neighbours for assistance. If, for any reason, the single child is unable to care for their older adult relatives, the oldest generations would face a lack of resources and necessities. In response to such an issue, all provinces have decided that couples are allowed to have two children if both parents were only children themselves: By 2007, all provinces in the nation except Henan had adopted this new policy; Henan followed in 2011.|$|E

Because of its amorphous nature, Smile inspired a community of fans who create, exchange and disseminate innumerable versions of the album. As visual artist Jeremy Glogan writes: [...] "Smile and conceptual art both emerged from the same Era. Each signaled a radical from what had preceded in popular music and art respectively, and each heralded a shift away from 'the art object', whether LP record or formal art object, as a definitive self-referential statement. ... Smile was to dematerialize only to instantaneously rematerialize with new signification as bootleg, as MP3, as rumor and as myth." [...] Van Dyke Parks has since attributed Smile to be a [...] "pioneering event" [...] for interactive record design.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> of alcoholics and neurotic perfectionism. Neurotic perfectionism was determined by examining five different areas of the Almost Perfect Scale- Revised which are Standards and Order, Discrepancy, Relationships, Procrastination, and Anxiety. One hundred and nineteen students enrolled in the general psychology course at the university chosen participated in this study. Of the total participants, nineteen were identified as <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> of alcoholics by their scores on the Children of Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST). <b>Adult</b> <b>children</b> of alcoholics were identified as those individuals scoring a 6 orii higher on the Children of Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of older adults 2 ̆ 7 functional capacity, self-management ability, and intergenerational solidarity on the subjective well-being of older adults and their <b>adult</b> <b>children.</b> The data were collected from older adults who were 65 years of age or older, as well as from one of their children. Participants of this study included 148 older adults, with a mean age of 80. 05, and 87 <b>adult</b> <b>children,</b> with a mean age of 51. 99. The older adults were asked to self-rate on all these measures, whereas the <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> were asked to provide their perception of their parents. Older adults reported higher overall perceived health, lower self-management ability, and more positive sentiments in affectual solidarity than <b>adult</b> <b>children.</b> Furthermore, older <b>adults</b> reported higher levels of life satisfaction than <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> did. Older <b>adults</b> 2 ̆ 7 subjective well-being was predicted by better functional capacity, higher levels of self-management ability, and positive intergenerational solidarity, whereas <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s subjective well-being was predicted by higher levels of intergenerational solidarity. In addition, a couple of suppressor effects were found. Older adults 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of self-management ability and intergenerational solidarity suppressed the effect of older adults 2 ̆ 7 functional capacity on older adults 2 ̆ 7 subjective well-being, and <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of intergenerational solidarity suppressed the effect of geographic proximity on <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s subjective well-being. The results suggest that older adults 2 ̆ 7 self-management ability is the most predictive factor of their subjective well-being. Intergenerational solidarity was the only factor that predicted both older adults 2 ̆ 7 and <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s subjective well-being. For the future care of older adults, it is important to consider how older adults 2 ̆ 7 self-management ability and staying closely connected with their <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> can be enhanced...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how family relationships and financial exchange influence the depressive symptoms of <b>adult</b> <b>children.</b> In contemporary U. S. society, <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> face challenges {{that may influence}} their depressive symptoms. Compared with their older parents, contemporary <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> have limited financial and social resources to overcome crises in their lives. If <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> cannot solve these problems, their financial stress will increase their depressive symptoms. This research proposes that <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s unemployment and the parent-children financial relationship influence the depressive symptoms of <b>adult</b> <b>children.</b> The data for the research comes from Add Health, a longitudinal study of a nationality representative sample of adolescent to adult health. The sample for this research consists of respondents aged 25 - 34. The thesis uses several indicators to analyze the effects of parent-child financial and social relationships. Key independent variables include unemployment, financial exchange, and related social relationship. The dependent variable is a commonly used measure of depressive symptoms (CES-D). This thesis uses regression and descriptive statistics to analyze five hypotheses. The findings show three findings. Firstly, unemployment is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Secondly, both financial supports from parents and to parents are associated with higher depressive symptoms. Finally, social supports from parents have multiple influences on <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s depressive symptoms. The quality of communication with mother has influences on <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s depressive symptoms. Further research should pay attention to two perspectives: 1) relationship with other family members 2) small sums of financial supports...|$|R
