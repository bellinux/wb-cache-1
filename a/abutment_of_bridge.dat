5000|$|One of {{the common}} formats for postmiles are located on a freeway on bridges over cross streets.

50|$|Other Grade II listings at {{the station}} include the two bridges: the {{surviving}} piers and <b>abutment</b> <b>of</b> Brunel's <b>bridge</b> over the Wye, and the bridge providing access to the steam mill and ironworks site.|$|R
50|$|The provincial {{government}} was outraged and Premier J. Walter Jones staged {{a publicity stunt}} at the Charlottetown <b>abutment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge,</b> boarding a bulldozer and demanding in front of local media, that the bridge be reopened.|$|R

50|$|On August 28, 2011, one <b>of</b> the <b>abutments</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> {{received}} damage due to flooding {{caused by}} Hurricane Irene. It appears the bridge itself was not damaged, {{but it remains}} closed until the abutment can be repaired.|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} River aux Vases was a {{breeding}} center for mules. Mining was also {{prominent in the}} area and River aux Vases sandstone was used in the <b>abutments</b> <b>of</b> Eads <b>Bridge</b> in downtown St. Louis, with decorative onyx and limestone quarried nearby.|$|R
5000|$|The Birmingham Bridge {{is notable}} {{for the dead}} end lanes that were {{originally}} {{to be part of}} a city belt system. The project was canceled and the bridge rerouted. A pedestrian walkway runs along the downstream side <b>of</b> the <b>bridge,</b> ending at steps at the south <b>abutment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge.</b>|$|R

40|$|Bridges are a {{significant}} component of the ground transportation infrastructure in the United States. With about sixty percent <b>of</b> <b>bridge</b> failures due to hydraulic causes, primarily scour, application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis techniques to the assessment <b>of</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>bridge</b> failure under flood conditions can provide increased accuracy in scour risk assessment at a relatively low cost. The analysis {{can be used to}} make optimum use of limited federal and state funds available to maintain and replace bridges and ensure public safety while traveling on the nation’s roads and highways during and after floods. Scour is the erosion of riverbed material during high flow conditions, such as floods. When scouring of the supporting soil around the piers and <b>abutments</b> <b>of</b> <b>bridges</b> takes place, ris...|$|R
50|$|Close to {{the site}} <b>of</b> the <b>abutments</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> that crossed the lake {{embedded}} in a wall by {{the southern edge of}} the lake is an ornate grade II listed stone doorway* (1703-05).This was originally from the demolished Bradford Hall on Kirkgate, relocated here pre 1926.|$|R
50|$|West of Themelthorpe the ENR {{originally}} passed {{under the}} Midland and Great Northern, and the <b>abutments</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> {{can still be}} seen. The line then continues to Foulsham. The section between Themelthorpe and Foulsham is the longest-closed section of the route, having been totally abolished in 1952.|$|R
5000|$|... {{owing to}} a defect in one <b>of</b> the <b>abutments</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> {{crossing}} the River Taff at Pontypridd, men are pulling {{it down and}} propping the girders with timber, so that many months must now elapse before the reconstruction will be completed. The opening of the railway for traffic will therefore be retarded.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{takes its}} name from the {{previous}} bridge which was completed in Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee year <b>of</b> 1897. The <b>abutments</b> <b>of</b> the old <b>bridge</b> are still visible to the north <b>of</b> the current <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the past, Alphington had a halt {{on the old}} Teign Valley railway-line, {{but this}} was closed on 9 June 1958. It is still {{possible}} to see the <b>abutments</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> that used to carry the railway-line over Church Road, and also smaller scale masonry remains at the previous overbridge in Ide Lane.|$|R
50|$|Just west of Wennington {{railway station}} lies Wennington {{junction}} where the Furness and Midland Joint Railway leaves the Leeds to Morecambe {{section of the}} Midland Railway. On 11 August 1880 the 12:15 Leeds to Lancaster train completely derailed at the junction points then continued for 166 yards before striking the <b>abutment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Near {{the east}} end of Vienna, the poured {{concrete}} <b>abutment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>bridge</b> that carried an interurban trolley line, the Washington-Virginia Railway, over the W&OD Railroad remains {{on the north side of}} the trail. [...] An inscription showing the month and year <b>of</b> the <b>abutment's</b> construction (July 1904) is visible on the structure's east side.|$|R
5000|$|Kemere is a one-arch bridge. Up until recently, {{the bridge}} was over a pebble {{embankment}} area. After dredging, now the channel has been opened to sea traffic. The width of the sea channel between the mainland and the island is only about 35 m. Currently the <b>abutment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> is being repaired by the governorate of Bartın.|$|R
5000|$|A {{falsework}} platform {{was used}} and continually relocated as construction <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> segments progressed. Foundation piles were driven up to 39 metres {{into the sea}} bed, which were then reinforced with concrete and capped with concrete headstock and girders. [...] The bridge was then fitted with concrete barriers, guard rails and electrical conduit. The southern and northern <b>abutment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> included land reclamation works involving a seawall and embankment.|$|R
50|$|The {{attraction}} {{is located on}} Tooley Street, in vaults below the southern <b>abutment</b> <b>of</b> London <b>Bridge,</b> immediately outside London Bridge Station and originally a rival attraction, the London Dungeon, which has since {{moved closer to the}} London Eye.
