5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} input into {{certain parts of}} the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E
5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} extremely complex actions take place. The longest {{of these are}} a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building {{in the middle of}} a raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.|$|E
5|$|During rehearsal, Marge {{struggles with}} <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Blanche is {{supposed}} to break a glass bottle and attack Stanley, but she cannot muster enough anger towards Stanley to break the bottle.

5|$|After {{a series}} of previsualisation tests, {{including}} <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Chitti jumps on a train to save Sana, Mohan eventually {{decided to use the}} technique in 40out of the 60visual effects scenes featured in the film, consisting of 2,000takes. Further previsualisation supervision was conducted by P. C. Sanath of Firefly Creative Studios, a visual effects company based in Hyderabad. 3D storyboards were constructed using 3Danimation programs for every scene in the film and were shot from different angles. In an interview with Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu, Mohan said that all the pre-production work took one and a half years to complete.|$|E
5|$|After filming, {{parts of}} the {{interior}} sets of the So'na ships were added using CGI. Stage 15 on the Paramount lot {{was used for the}} climactic scene between Picard and Ru'afo. Because of the dangers of the four-story scaffolding-like set, the actors were attached by safety cables at all times. Paramount's B tankwhich was used to represent San Francisco Bay in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Homewas used to shoot footage of Picard, Data and Anij at the Ba'ku lake. For <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Data walks along a lake-bed, the actor's tricorder prop was covered with plastic to make it watertight.|$|E

5|$|Each episode {{typically}} follows Bauer, {{officials in}} the U.S. government, and the conspirators behind {{the events of the}} day, often simultaneously. 24 is known for employing plot twists which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal drama, delving into the private lives of the characters. As part of a recurring theme, characters are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas. Examples of this are a bombing in Season 2, which can only be prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in Season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Season 4 is also notable for <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> two men — one of whom possesses crucial information — are dying in a room with only one surgeon.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{while working}} for the Balboa Amusement Producing Company, William Jossey wrote the {{screenplay}} for the first feature-length film adaptation. Filming took place in Long Beach, California, where the Balboa studios were located. Footage of an actual church under construction {{across the street from}} the studio was used for <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> one was built by St. Elmo. Contemporary writers credited Bertram Bracken as director, as do some modern sources, including the American Film Institute. Others consider the film the directorial debut of J. Gordon Edwards. Both men subsequently had long careers directing for Fox Film.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Gutawa voiced a {{character}} in Meraih Mimpi (Chasing Dreams), the Indonesian adaptation of Sing to the Dawn; the voice recording took four months. She later cited it as a good learning experience. The following year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, Love in Perth, in which she played a shy student studying in Perth, Australia. She considered it challenging; for the most difficult part, <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> she had to cry, she practised {{in front of a}} mirror. In May 2011 she began dating her Love in Perth costar Derby Romero; the couple split up sometime before January 2012.|$|E

5|$|Kami, Perempuan premiered in 1943 in Jakarta. It {{received}} multiple {{performances that}} year, some in Jakarta, some {{in other parts}} of Java. In 1950 Pane included Kami, Perempuan in his book Djinak-Djinak Merpati dengan Tjerita2 Sandiwara Lain, a collection of his stage plays. For this publication Pane removed <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> two neighbours came to visit the family, which included further conversation. Pane considered this scene to be anti-climactic, whereas without it the play's title became more appropriate. Another, smaller, change to the play was the removal of the names of Japan's enemies during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{highlighted}} what {{he perceived}} as scenes in Red Rackham's Treasure which reflected common themes in The Adventures of Tintin. He {{pointed out that}} in being a stowaway aboard the ship, Calculus {{was one of many}} stowaways in the series, and that the treasure represented the theme of jewels and precious stones which also cropped up in The Broken Ear, Tintin in the Congo, and The Castafiore Emerald. He noted Tintin's misreading of the parchments and stated this was {{one of a number of}} calculation mistakes that the character makes in the series. He suggested that <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the shark submarine pushes between Haddock's buttocks was a form of sexual innuendo referencing anal sex, highlighting similar innuendo in The Broken Ear and The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{worked with}} Alan Splet {{to design the}} film's sound. The pair {{arranged}} and fabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is densely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels. Sounds were created {{in a variety of}} ways—for <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub, and recorded the sound of air blown through the bottle. After being recorded, sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch, reverb and frequency.|$|E
