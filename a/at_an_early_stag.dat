(Electrical & Electronic Engineering Science) The need to industrialise South Africa {{has been}} an effort of {{government}} to increase manufacturing and Gross Domestic Products (GDP) while also creating decent work. Manufacturing industry has been striking with organisations closing and moving. Organisations have been established and fail {{to compete in the}} market due to lack of expertise to produce products that meet the customer`s requirements. Due to the opportunities of industrialisation in Africa the focus to develop equipment for these industries is necessary. This research objective is to develop a Systematic Approach of Product Development for Industrial Processing Equipment manufacturers that supply various organisations. The research will respond to the following question while also defining the development process:-  Will product development be helpful in industrialising South Africa and building sustainable manufacturing businesses?  Define a process feedback diagram of a systematic approach of product development to be used by industrial processing equipment? The research is done with the use of literature review form published sources which is validated by survey questions that were sent to sustainable successful organizations that supply industrial equipment. The research finding demonstrates the success phases and steps to be followed when developing product. The phases and their steps are;- 1. Marketing phase stages are Identifying Market Opportunities, Evaluating Potential Markets, Identifying Customer`s Needs and Product specification 2. Concept Development phase stages are system engineering for requirements identification & allocations, Internal & external Search of solution, concept selection and concept testing 3. System Level Design phase stages is Product Architecture 4. Detailed Design Phase stages are industrial design and design for manufacturing 5. Refinement and testing phase stages are designing for reliability, prototyping and testing. These are the phases the research focused on. The Survey revealed that success sustainable organisation have been using product development, marketing and system engineering methodologies as one of their common weapon to stay in business and grow in today’s competitive market place. This systematic approach process feedback diagram in product development has a lot of phase overlap. All phases interact even though there is still a feed process from one phase to the next.

40|$|Introduction: Human ageing is {{a dynamic}} process {{depending}} on intrinsic and extrinsic factors and its evolution is a continuum of transitions, involving multifaceted processes at multiple levels. It is recognized that frailty and sarcopenia are shared by the major age-related diseases, thus contributing to elderly morbidity and mortality. They are major health issues in elderly populations, given their high prevalence and association with several adverse outcomes. Due to their complex phenotypes and underlying pathophysiology, the need for robust and multidimensional biomarkers is now essential to move towards a more personalized care and prevention. Methods: The NU-AGE project [1] regroups 1250 free-living elderly people (65 – 79 y. o., men and women), free of major diseases, recruited within 5 European centres. Twenty percent of the subjects were pre-frail {{as defined by the}} criteria proposed by Fried et al. [2]. Six hundred twenty five volunteers were randomly assigned to an intervention group (1 -year Mediterranean diet). A sub-cohort consisting in first, 120 subjects, half pre-frail randomly selected from the Italian and Polish centres, and secondly, 92 subjects shifting their frailty status were included for untargeted serum metabolomics at T 0 (recruitment) and T 1 (after diet intervention). Results: Metabolomics enables to discriminate sub-phenotypes of pre-frailty both at the gender level and depending on the pre-frailty progression and reversibility. Additionally, early and/or predictive markers of pre-frailty were identified in both populations. Conclusion: These results open the door, through multivariate strategies, to a possibility of monitoring the disease progression over time and/or in response to interventions <b>at</b> <b>a</b> very <b>early</b> <b>stag...</b>|$|R

The phenomenon was first observed in interspecific crosses between D. melanogaster females and males of its closest relatives which normally produce unisexual female hybrid progeny. Whereas hybrid sons from these crosses die as third instar larvae, the presence of the particular X balancers in the mother allows a low percentage of sons to survive. Similar sterile males are also observed among non- hybrid flies.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of moral modelling in schools, based on psychological and neuroscientific theories of moral development, uses grounded theory analysis of interviews, lesson observations and field notes {{to examine the}} effect of empathic teachers on developing positive behaviour and learning specifically with children with emotional and behavioural difficulties. These students are at high risk of disaffection, low achievement and reduced self-esteem in school which can impact on the learning and lives of others both in classrooms and beyond. The paper concludes that behaviour and learning can clearly be improved by empathic teachers in specific contexts but that general classroom conditions in schools inhibit the profoundly empathic relationships needed for moral development, with substantial implications for longer term morality for these children, both in school and wider society.

Adoption of these recommendations would generally correct deficiency diseases and would reduce the incidence of health complications which are linked to excessive intakes of fat, sodium, alcohol and other substances. Carpenter also drew attention to malnutrition, the solution of which he believed to have become largely political and economic although the fact remains that very many people still do not receive or grow enough food.

The potential danger of dual TCR expression is a rescue of autoreactive TCRs during selection in the thymus and subsequent development of autoimmunity. In this study, {{we examine the}} reason(s) for replacing an autoreactive TCR and for allowing the survival of cells carrying two TCRs. We compared development of TCR transgenic CD 4 � CD 8 � thymocytes in {{the presence or absence}} of MHC class II autoantigen that does not induce deletion of thymocytes. Contrary to the expected negative effect of the presence of autoantigen, � 100 % more CD 4 � CD 8 � thymocytes were found in the presence of MHC class II autoantigen than in the neutral background. A further increase in the strength of autoantigenic signal via expression of a human CD 4 transgene led to an additional increase in the numbers of CD 4 � CD 8 � thymocytes. Thus, editing autoreactive TCR results in more efficient positive selection, and this may be both a reason and a reward for risking autoimmunity. The Journal of Immunology, 2002, 169 : 1729 – 1734.

40|$|An easily {{accessible}} screening test can be valuable {{in the prevention}} of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The Dutch National Hearing Foundation developed 'Earcheck', an internet-based speech-in-noise test, presenting CVC-words in stationary broadband noise. However, its sensitivity to detect NIHL appeared to be low, 51 % (Leensen et al, 2011, part 1). The aim of the current study is to examine ways to improve Earcheck's sensitivity for (early) NIHL using different forms of noise filtering. The test's stationary broadband masking noise is replaced by six alternatives, including noises that have been temporally modulated, spectrally filtered by high-pass or low-pass filters, and combinations of temporal modulation and spectral filtering. In this multi-centre study, 49 normal-hearing and 49 subjects with different degrees of NIHL participated. Hearing-impaired subjects deviated more clearly from normal performance when executing the test with alternative masking noises, except for the high-pass filtered conditions. Earcheck with low-pass filtered noise made the best distinction between normal hearing and NIHL, without reducing test reliability. The use of this noise condition improved the sensitivity of Earcheck to 95 %.

40|$|Porphyrins from 38 {{cases of}} {{different}} types of porphyria were separated chromato-graphically and analyzed. Patients with different types of porphyria eliminated por-phyrins with different patterns. Simple paper chromatography of the methyl ester of the total porphyrin of a urine sample revealed a chromatographic pattern of the por-phyrins characteristic of the type of porphyria. The relative abundance of the hepta-carboxylic and uroporphyrins in a sample also differentiated porphyria cutanea tarda from acute intermittent or congenital porphyria. The isomer compositions of the por-phyrins were also disclosed. While one type of isomer might dominate one type of porphyria, the magnitude of predominance was by no means unanimous, or even re-versed, among the porphyrins from uro- through the intermediates to coproporphyrins. For example, in cutanea tarda, Type I isomer dominates uro- and pentacarboxylic porphyrins, and Type Ill isomer dominates the hepta-, hexa- and coproporphyrins. The complexity of the enzymatic reaction involved in the decarboxylation of the porphyrins is thus indicated.

The files of 75 patients (16 girls and 59 boys) operated on between 1977 and 1991 were reviewed. Questionnaires were analysed on 63 (12 girls and 51 boys) over 2 years of age. The median age at completing {{the questionnaire was}} 6. 6 years. Forty-one of these 63 patients had aganglionosis of the rectosigmoid, 15 of a long colonic segment, and 7 of the total colon. Of 14 children age 4 or less, 6 had severe constipation, whereas 8 had regular spontaneous defaecation. Ten of the 49 over 4 years of age were continent without constipation, 22 had soiling and/or constipation, and 17 were incontinent, one of whom had a permanent colostomy. There was no correlation between age or sex and anorectal function. Anorectal function in children with long segment was not worse than in those with rectosigmoid aganglionosis, but only 1 of 7 with total colonic aganglionosis was continent. Because many adapt themselves to the handicap, symptoms are often underreported. A detailed questionnaire {{appears to be a}} reliable tool for elucidating the real situation.

A panel of seven different mAbs was obtained; six of them were directed against neoepitopes that are expressed on ACT after interaction with proteases (inactivated ACT) and one mAb was directed against an epitope that is exposed both on native and inactivated ACT. The mAbs against neoepitopes could discriminate native ACT from complexed and inactivated ACT in vitro as shown in binding experiments {{in the presence of}} either native or inactivated ACT. With the mAbs against ACT we found that: (a) besides classical congophilic plaques, amorphous noncongophilic beta/A 4 -positive plaques were stained; (b) amorphous and classical plaques reacted with both types of mAbs against ACT indicating that this ACT was either complexed to a protease or proteolytically inactivated; (c) vascular amyloid was not stained for ACT.

This paper documents the difficulties in reaching <b>an</b> <b>early</b> diagnosis. We describe {{the case of an}} 85 -year-old man with non-specific abdominal complaints for 20 years, who presented with sudden onset central abdominal pain. An acute median laparotomy under general anaesthesia was performed during which a 360 ° clockwise rotation of the small bowel around the mesenteric pedicle of the superior mesenteric artery and vein was found. Malrotation is considered any deviation of the normal rotation of the midgut in embryological development, causing intermittent episodes of gastrointestinal obstruction or acute events of midgut volvulus. Although mainly a paediatric diagnosis, some cases do present in adult life. Radiologic investigations include: upper gastrointestinal contrast studies, Doppler sonography and a contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen. If a true malrotation is diagnosed or found by coincidence, a Ladd's procedure is advised, even if the patient is asymptomatic. There is no proven surgical strategy for preventing the recurrence of small bowel volvulus in case of malfixation of the midgut. Non-specific recurrent abdominal complaints in adults of any age should raise suspicion of the possibility of a midgut malrotation or malfixation with or without intermittent volvulus.

METHODS: Consecutive patients with chest pain {{were included in the}} study. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess optimal timing of blood sampling and cutoff values. RESULTS: A total of 309 patients were included, of whom 162 patients had a diagnosis of AMI. ROC analysis revealed that the diagnostic accuracy of myoglobin concentration as indicated by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) increased significantly from 3 (0. 89 +/- 0. 026) and 4 hours (0. 93 +/- 0. 019) to 5 hours after onset of symptoms (0. 96 +/- 0. 014; P=. 0040 and. 035, respectively). At 5 hours (the earliest time point with maximal AUC), sensitivity was 87 % and specificity was 97 % using a myoglobin cutoff value of 90 microg/L. With a myoglobin cutoff value of 50 microg/L, sensitivity was 95 % (95 % confidence interval 90 % to 98 %), but specificity was 86 % (95 % confidence interval 80 % to 93 %). CONCLUSION: Myoglobin has maximal diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of AMI at 5 hours after the onset of symptoms, using a cutoff value of 50 microg/L.

The underlying mechanism has not been elucidated, although an immune-based destruction of melanocytes is supposed. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide evidence of an effective immunosurveillance of pigment lesions in a patient at high risk of melanoma. A patient with the dysplastic nevus syndrome and a history of melanoma was included in this study. Since 2003, a marked regression of almost all nevi was observed. Immunohistochemistry was performed and the antigen specificity of T-cells was analyzed on T-cells isolated from a regressing nevus by flow cytometry using HLA-A 2 -peptide tetramers containing Mart- 1 (26 - 35), gp 100 (280 - 288), gp 100 (209 - 217) and tyrosinase(369 - 377). Immunohistochemistry of the regressing nevi showed a strong infiltrate of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated the presence of a CD 8 + T-cell response against gp 100 (280 - 288) and Mart- 1 (26 - 35) both in peripheral blood and in a regressing nevus. These findings indicate that an immune reaction against melanocyte differentiation antigens can target specifically nevi without signs of vitiligo and suggests that boosting the anti-melanocyte immune response in patients at high risk for melanoma may prevent tumor development <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stag...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: High-resolution proton {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy was performed on tissue specimens from 33 patients with astrocytic tumors (22 astrocytomas, 11 glioblastomas) and 13 patients with meningiomas. For all patients, samples of primary tumors and their first recurrences were examined. Increased anaplasia, with respect to malignant transformation, resulting in a higher malignancy grade, was present in 11 recurrences of 22 astrocytoma patients. Spectroscopic features of tumor types, as determined on samples of the primary occurrences, were in good agreement with previous studies. Compared with the respective primary astrocytomas, characteristic features of glioblastomas were significantly increased concentrations of alanine (Ala) (p 0. 005), increased metabolite ratios of glycine (Gly) /total creatine (tCr) (p 0. 0001) and glutamate (Glu) /glutamine (Gln) (p 0. 004). Meningiomas showed increased Ala (p 0. 02) and metabolite ratios [Gly, total choline (tCho), Ala] over tCr (p 0. 001) relative to astrocytomas, and N-acetylaspartate and myo-inositol were absent. Metabolic changes of an evolving tumor were observed in recurrent astrocytomas: owing to their consecutive assessments, more indicators of malignant degeneration were detected in astrocytoma recurrences (e. g. Gly, p 0. 029; tCho, p 0. 034; Glu, p 0. 015; tCho/tCr, p 0. 001) {{in contrast to the}} comparison of primary astrocytomas with primary glioblastomas. The present investigation demonstrated a correlation of the tCho-signal with tumor progression. Significantly elevated concentrations of Ala (p 0. 037) and Glu (p 0. 003) and metabolite ratio tCho/tCr (p 0. 005) were even found in recurrent low-grade astrocytomas with unchanged histopathological grading (n 11).

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} one of the causes of death around the world, because of its {{aggressiveness}} in advanced stages, so investigators proposed early detection and prevention of this disease. Currently, one of the techniques used to tumor detection is the low dose computed tomography, but it has some limitations, which is why they are looking for alternatives that can complement the diagnostic. The objective is to reach a kit of biomarkers associated with lung cancer that can be diagnosed in peripheral blood. This detection could be realized with conventional PCR or real-time PCR, it could determine a low cost technique, could perform the test with relatively short time and there was the possibility of repeating without impact on the patient. The possibility of achieving a method with all of these advantages is what makes it so attractive alternative. So far many research groups have been studying this possibility and they found several regions of the genome in peripheral blood related to lung cancer. Epigenetic changes in DNA (aberrant DNA methylation and microRNA) are leading the molecular markers studied in peripheral blood of Caucasian patients with lung cancer. The aberrant methylation in certain loci has been implicated in carcinogenesis. This may affect genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, cell adhesion, signal transduction, apoptosis and differentiation. MicroRNAs also have been involved in lung cancer, and represent non-coding part of the genome; these molecules may alter the expression of certain genes. The objective of this strategy is to reach sets of biomarkers that display a high sensitivity and specificity, which have high effectiveness in diagnosing this disease in <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stag...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: More {{and more}} {{quantitative}} information is becoming available {{about the risks}} of complications arising from medical treatment. In everyday practice, this raises the question whether each and every risk, however low, should be disclosed to patients. What could be good reasons for doing or not doing so? This will increasingly become a dilemma for practitioners. OBJECTIVE: To report doctors' views on whether to disclose or withhold information on low risks of complications. METHODS: In a qualitative study design, 37 respondents (gastroenterologists and gynaecologists or obstetricians) were included. Focus group interviews were held with 22 respondents and individual in-depth interviews with 15. RESULTS: Doctors have doubts about disclosing or withholding information on complication risk, especially in a risk range of 1 in 200 to 1 in 10, 000. Their considerations on whether to disclose or to withhold information depend on a complicated mix of patient and doctor-associated reasons; on medical and personal considerations; and on the kind and purpose of intervention. DISCUSSION: Even though the degree of a risk is important in a doctor's considerations, the severity of the possible complications and patients' wishes and competencies have an important role as well. Respondents said that low risks should always be communicated when there are alternatives for the intervention or when the patient may prevent or mitigate the risk. When the appropriateness of disclosing risks is doubtful, doctors should always tell their patients that no intervention is without risk, give them the opportunity to gather all the information they need or want, and enable them to detect a complication <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stag...</b>|$|E

One hundred children with CHD aged between 8 - 18 years and their parents answered a health-related quality of life-questionnaire during their visit to the paediatric cardiology outpatient department. CHD children reported reduced motor functioning and autonomy compared to healthy children. Parents of children with CHD reported their children to have a reduced {{quality of life in}} the domains of. motor functioning, autonomy and cognitive functioning. Agreement between child and parent reports was moderate. Children systematically reported lower health related quality of life on the domain of positive emotions than did parents. Health related quality of life in children with CHD appeared not to be influenced by severity of the disease. In conclusion, regardless of the severity of the disease, children with CHD reported their health related quality of life on several domains to be lower than that of healthy children. This means that on several domains, the emotional impact of problems in health status is greater for children with CHD than for healthy children. When CHD patients visit the clinic, it is important that physicians actively ask patients as well as parents about the child's motor functioning, autonomy and cognitive functioning. Children with problems in these domains can then be identified, and psychological interventions can take place <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stag...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} and prevalence {{of heart failure}} (HF) has increased over the last decades. The main reasons for this increase are the ageing population {{and an increase in}} survival rate after myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases. Although, pharmacotherapy has significantly improved survival, the prognosis of HF is still rather poor. Total mortality is high and approximately half of the deaths are sudden and unexpected. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) -inhibitors generally given with diuretic and digoxin are the standard treatment for patients with HF. Despite the established benefits of ACE-inhibitors {{there is a need for}} new pharmacological tools for the treatment of HF. Recent experimental evidence has shown that activity of the Na(+) /H(+) -exchanger in the heart (NHE- 1) is increased in HF. Because NHE- 1 exchanges intracellular H(+) for extracellular Na(+) in a one by one stoichiometry, the intracellular ionic changes resulting from increased activity, will be a increased pH(i) and intracellular sodium ([Na(+) ](i)). Activation of NHE- 1 results only in a small increase in pH(i), under physiological conditions where bicarbonate-dependent mechanisms are active. However, a considerable increase in [Na(+) ](i) was always present. The elevation of [Na(+) ](i) might be responsible for the increase of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2 +) ](i)) levels mediated by the Na(+) /Ca(2 +) -exchanger (NCX). Increases in [Na(+) ](i), pH(i) and [Ca(2 +) ](i), features of cardiac myocytes isolated from failing hearts, are recognized as a cell growth signal And thus may play a role in the hypertrophic response, cellular remodeling and finally the development of HF. Acute application of cariporide, an inhibitor of NHE- 1, on failing myocytes not only normalized [Na(+) ](i) but also cytoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium handling and the propensity to develop delayed after depolarizations (DAD's). In several animal models of HF it has been shown the chronic inhibition of NHE- 1 attenuates the development of hypertrophy and whole heart remodeling. Recently, in a volume and pressure overload model of HF in rabbits it has been demonstrated that chronic treatment also prevents the development of HF and cellular ionic and electrophysiological remodeling.
