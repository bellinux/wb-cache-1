5000|$|The Indian cobra (Naja naja) {{also known}} as the spectacled cobra, <b>Asian</b> <b>cobra</b> or binocellate cobra is a species of the genus Naja found in the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal) {{and a member of the}} [...] "big four" [...] species that inflict the most snakebites on humans in India. [...] This snake is revered in Indian mythology and culture, and is often seen with snake charmers. It is now {{protected}} in India under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972).|$|E
25|$|Thus, the Australian {{terrestrial}} elapids are technically 'hydrophiines', {{although they}} are not sea snakes. It is believed that the Laticauda and the 'true sea snakes' evolved separately from Australasian land snakes. <b>Asian</b> <b>cobras,</b> coral snakes, and American coral snakes also appear to be monophyletic, while African cobras do not.|$|R
50|$|King Cobra is a 1999 Trimark Pictures direct {{to video}} horror/sci-fi film about an escaped genetically {{engineered}} hybrid of an <b>Asian</b> King <b>Cobra</b> and an Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake.

5000|$|Ophiophagus hannah {{belongs to}} the {{monotypic}} genus Ophiophagus in the family Elapidae, while most other cobras {{are members of the}} genus Naja. They can be distinguished from other cobras by size and hood. King cobras are generally larger than other cobras, and the stripe on the neck is a chevron instead of a double or single eye shape that may be seen in most of the other <b>Asian</b> <b>cobras.</b> Moreover, the hood of the king cobra is narrower and longer. A key to identification, clearly visible on the head, is the presence of a pair of large scales known as occipitals, located {{at the back of the}} top of the head. These are behind the usual [...] "nine-plate" [...] arrangement typical of colubrids and elapids, and are unique to the king cobra.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCrystals of the neurotoxin-I (NTX-I) {{from the}} venom {{of the middle}} <b>Asian</b> <b>cobra</b> Najanajaoxiana have been grown by vapour {{diffusion}} and dialysis methods. The crystals belong to space group P 21212 with dimension of a = 25. 19 Å, b = 75. 59 Å, c = 36. 09 Å and diffract to 1. 9 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule (Vm = 2. 2 Å/Da). Using the molecule of α-cobratoxin (CTX) as a starting model for NTX-I structure determination coordinates of Cα atoms of the NTX-I molecule were obtained and the position of NTX-I in the unit cell was derived...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) {{were developed}} against neurotoxin I (NT- 1), a protein from central <b>Asian</b> <b>cobra</b> (Naja naja oxiana) venom which binds specifically to {{nicotinic acetylcholine receptor}} (AchR). All of the mAbs cross-reacted with another long-chain post-synaptic neurotoxin, Bungarus multicinctus alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BT), but not Naja naja kaouthia alpha-cobratoxin, in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (e. l. i. s. a.). Short-chain post-synaptic neurotoxins like Naja naja atra cobrotoxin, Laticauda semifasciata erabutoxin b, or N. n. oxiana neurotoxin II did not cross-react with the NT- 1 mAbs, but an antigen(s) found in Dendroaspis polylepis, Acanthophis antarcticus and Pseudechis australis venoms was immunoreactive. The e. l. i. s. a. readings for dithiothreitol-reduced NT- 1 and NT- 1 mAbs ranged from 13 to 27 % of those for native toxin but reduced alpha-BT was not immunoreactive. Synthetic NT- 1 peptides were used in epitope-mapping studies and two, non-contiguous regions (Cys 15 -Tyr 23 and Lys 25 -Gly 33 or Pro 17 -Lys 25 and Asp 29 -Lys 37) were recognized by the NT- 1 mAbs. The NT- 1 mAbs individually inhibited 31 - 71 % of alpha-BT binding to AchR in vitro and afforded a slight protective effect in vivo with a toxin: antibody mole ratio of 1 : 1. 5. This report {{is the first to}} describe mAbs which recognize and protect against a heterologous, long-chain, post-synaptic neurotoxin from snake venom...|$|E
40|$|The CTs (cytotoxins) I and II are {{positively}} charged three-finger folded proteins from venom of Naja oxiana (the Central <b>Asian</b> <b>cobra).</b> They belong to S- and P-type respectively based on Ser- 28 and Pro- 30 residues within a putative phospholipid bilayer binding site. Previously, we investigated {{the interaction of}} CTII with multilamellar liposomes of dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol by wide-line 31 P-NMR spectroscopy. To compare interactions of these proteins with phospholipids, we investigated the interaction of CTI with the multilamellar liposomes of dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol analogously. The effect of CTI on the chemical shielding anisotropy and deformation of the liposomes in the magnetic field was determined at different temperatures and lipid/protein ratios. It was found that both the proteins do not affect lipid organization in the gel state. In the liquid crystalline state of the bilayer they disturb lipid packing. To get insight into the interactions of the toxins with membranes, Monte Carlo simulations of CTI and CTII {{in the presence of}} the bilayer membrane were performed. It was found that both the toxins penetrate into the bilayer with the tips of all the three loops. However, the free-energy gain on membrane insertion of CTI is smaller (by ≈ 7  kcal/mol; 1  kcal≡ 4. 184  kJ) when compared with CTII, because of the lower hydrophobicity of the membrane-binding site of CTI. These results clearly demonstrate that the P-type cytotoxins interact with membranes stronger than those of the S-type, although the mode of the membrane insertion is similar for both the types...|$|E
40|$|Snake {{envenomation}} is {{a serious}} public health threat {{in the rural areas}} of Asia and Africa. To date, the only proven treatment for snake envenomation is antivenom therapy. Owing to the difficulties in the diagnosis of the biting species, {{there is a need to}} develop polyvalent antivenoms that could cross-neutralize venoms of medically important venomous snakes in the various regions. Recently, Thai Red Cross Society from Thailand has developed a new polyvalent antivenom for treatment of cobra and krait venoms. The polyvalent antivenom, termed “Neuro Polyvalent Snake Antivenom (NPAV),” is raised against venoms of two Thai cobras and two Thai kraits. Our results indicated that the polyvalent antivenom can effectively neutralize venoms from many Southeast <b>Asian</b> <b>cobras,</b> kraits and king cobra but is less effective against Indian cobra venoms. Studies using anesthetized rats showed that NPAV can effectively protect against cobra venom-induced cardio-respiratory depressant and neuromuscular blocking effects, confirming that the antivenom can effectively neutralize the major lethal toxins of common cobra venoms. This new antivenom may find potential application in the treatment of elapid bites in Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia, a neighboring nation of Thailand...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} ability of anticholinesterase drugs to reverse the {{potentially}} fatal paralytic effects of cobra venom, we conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial of intravenous edrophonium (Tensilon) in 10 adults with neurotoxic envenoming caused by bites of the Philippine cobra (Naja naja philippinensis). There was significantly more improvement in ptosis and endurance of upward gaze after edrophonium than after placebo. Five minutes after injection, the mean difference (+/- SD) {{in the percentage of}} the iris that was uncovered was 39 +/- 5. 47 (70 vs. 31 percent; P less than 0. 01), and the mean difference in the number of seconds of upward gaze was 33. 1 +/- 9. 29 (39. 7 vs. 6. 6 seconds; P less than 0. 01). The expiratory and inspiratory pressures, forced vital capacity, and ability to cough, speak, and swallow also improved after edrophonium. In both the patients who were studied electromyographically, pretreatment and postplacebo responses were typical of myasthenia gravis and became normal after edrophonium. We conclude that anticholinesterases are beneficial in the management of neurotoxic envenoming by <b>Asian</b> <b>cobras</b> (Naja naja), and we recommended a test of edrophonium in any patient with signs of neurotoxic envenoming after snakebite...|$|R
40|$|The lethal and enzymatic {{activities}} of venom from Naja sumatrana (Equatorial spitting cobra) were determined and compared to venoms from three other Southeast <b>Asian</b> <b>cobras</b> (Naja sputatrix, Naja siamensis and Naja kaouthia). All four venoms exhibited the common characteristic {{enzymatic activities}} of Asiatic cobra venoms: low protease, phosphodiesterase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase and L-amino acid oxidase activities, moderately high acetylcholinesterase and hyaluronidase activities and high phospholipase A 2. Fractionation of N. sumatrana venom by Resource® S cation exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare, USA) yielded nine major protein peaks, with all except the acidic protein peak being lethal to mice. Most of the protein peaks exhibit enzymatic activities, and L-amino acid oxidase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, acetylcholinesterase, 5 '-nucleotidase and hyaluronidase exist in multiple forms. Comparison of the Resource® S chromatograms {{of the four}} cobra venoms clearly indicates that the protein composition of N. sumatrana venom is distinct from venoms {{of the other two}} spitting cobras, N. sputatrix (Javan spitting cobra) and N. siamensis (Indochinese spitting cobra). The results support the revised systematics of the Asiatic cobra based on multivariate analysis of morphological characters. The three spitting cobra venoms exhibit two common features: the presence of basic, potentially pharmacologically active phospholipases A 2 and a high content of polypeptide cardiotoxin, suggesting that the pathophysiological actions of the three spitting cobra venoms may be similar...|$|R
5000|$|A {{genetics}} laboratory run by Dr. Irwin Burns (Joseph Ruskin) {{to research}} aggressive behavior has an accident, {{resulting in a}} chemical fire and explosion, and the escape of a thirty foot long hybrid snake with traits of both the <b>Asian</b> King <b>Cobra</b> (in the film, it {{is referred to as}} the African King Cobra, even though the King Cobra species doesn't inhabit the African Subcontinent) and the Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake. Loose in the countryside and filled with the experimental aggressiveness drug, the snake, nicknamed [...] "Seth", eventually outgrows his woodland prey, it begins hunting the residents of the small brewery town of Filmore. Doc Kragen (Scott Hillenbrand) conducts an autopsy on a recently found body and determines that the death was caused by a huge snake. He and Police Chief Jo Biddle (Casey Fallo) go to the Mayor (Hoyt Axton) and demand he cancel an upcoming town lager festival. The Mayor refuses, but after more deaths, the town eventually brings in snake expert and hunter Nick Hashimoto (Pat Morita).|$|R
40|$|The {{cytotoxicity}} of {{the venom}} of 25 species of Old World elapid snake was tested and {{compared with the}} morphological and behavioural adaptations of hooding and spitting. We determined that, contrary to previous assumptions, the venoms of spitting species are not consistently more cytotoxic than those of closely related non-spitting species. While this correlation between spitting and non-spitting was found among African cobras, it was not present among <b>Asian</b> <b>cobras.</b> On the other hand, a consistent positive correlation was observed between cytotoxicity and utilisation of the defensive hooding display that cobras are famous for. Hooding and spitting are widely regarded as defensive adaptations, but it has hitherto been uncertain whether cytotoxicity serves a defensive purpose or is somehow useful in prey subjugation. The {{results of this study}} suggest that cytotoxicity evolved primarily as a defensive innovation and that it has co-evolved twice alongside hooding behavior: once in the Hemachatus + Naja and again independently in the king cobras (Ophiophagus). There was a significant increase of cytotoxicity in the Asian Naja linked to the evolution of bold aposematic hood markings, reinforcing the link between hooding and the evolution of defensive cytotoxic venoms. In parallel, lineages with increased cytotoxicity but lacking bold hood patterns evolved aposematic markers in the form of high contrast body banding. The results also indicate that, secondary to the evolution of venom rich in cytotoxins, spitting has evolved three times independently: once within the African Naja, once within the Asian Naja, and once in the Hemachatus genus. The evolution of cytotoxic venom thus appears to facilitate the evolution of defensive spitting behaviour. In contrast, a secondary loss of cytotoxicity and reduction of the hood occurred in the water cobra Naja annulata, which possesses streamlined neurotoxic venom similar to that of other aquatic elapid snakes (e. g., hydrophiine sea snakes). The results of this study make an important contribution to our growing understanding of the selection pressures shaping the evolution of snake venom and its constituent toxins. The data also aid in elucidating the relationship between these selection pressures and the medical impact of human snakebite in the developing world, as cytotoxic cobras cause considerable morbidity including loss-of-function injuries that result in economic and social burdens in the tropics of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
