40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Fluid intake and regulation are implicated in the control of energy balance and appetite. The studies in this thesis have {{examined the effects of}} fluid manipulation on appetite and energy intake. Fifty-eight young, predominantly Caucasian males were recruited to five studies. The age, height and body mass of the subjects were: 24. 9 ± 3. 8 y, 1. 79 ± 0. 1 m, 80. 1 ± 14. 8 kg (mean ± SD) respectively. In Chapter 3, 13 h of hypohydration after exercise in the heat did not influence energy intake at an <b>ad-libitum</b> buffet meal (P= 0. 436) compared to a euhydrated trial, although greater thirst (P< 0. 001) and lower fullness (P< 0. 01) was reported in the hypohydration trial. Chapter 4 demonstrated that {{there was no difference in}} energy intake or appetite after 24 h of hypohydration either with or without fluid during a semi-solid <b>ad-libitum</b> breakfast. Thirst and fluid intake were greater during the hypohydrated with fluid (HYPO-F; 618 (251) mL) than the euhydrated with fluid (EU-F; 400 (247) mL) trials (P< 0. 01). Chapter 5 and 6 showed that a bolus of water (500 mL) immediately before an <b>ad-libitum</b> porridge breakfast reduced energy intake in both healthy and overweight and obese subjects (P< 0. 001). The water preload increased fullness and decreased hunger compared to pre-trial in both studies (P< 0. 001). In Chapter 7, 75 minutes before an <b>ad-libitum</b> lunch a post-exercise milk (MILK) based drink reduced energy intake (6746 (2035) kJ) compared to an isoenergetic flavoured carbohydrate (CHO) and water based drink (7762 (1921) kJ; 7672 (2005) kJ) (P< 0. 05). This thesis has shown that when subjects are hypohydrated, either after exercise or after 24 h of fluid restriction energy intake is not different at an <b>ad-libitum</b> meal. However, there is an increased thirst and subsequent fluid intake before an <b>ad-libitum</b> meal (chapter 3 and 4). This effect was more acutely displayed when a bolus of water was provided immediately before an <b>ad-libitum</b> breakfast meal and subsequently decreased energy intake in both normal and overweight/ obese subjects (chapter 5 and 6). The possible mechanism for this was gastric fill and distension creating satiety before a meal. Chapter 7 has showed that when subjects consume isoenergetic drinks with different energy densities (milk vs CHO and water), before an <b>ad-libitum</b> lunch, energy intake was decreased when milk was consumed. Milk having an increased energy density due to larger protein fractions (casein) may further explain the decrease in energy intake found in chapters 5 and 6 by a similar mechanism. Therefore, gastric fill before a meal decreases <b>ad-libitum</b> energy intake by either the intake of water immediately before a meal or by milk as a more delayed response (75 min). The hydration status however, did not affect energy intake directly in our finding, although it did affect subsequent fluid ingestion, which may have affected findings in chapters 3 and 4...|$|E

The objective of this work research was investigate the possibility of improving growth performances, digestibility and welfare of broilers using ad libitum, split and restricted feeding. Formulated diet was given in four different forms <b>Ad-libitum</b> (Treatment 1) twice a day meal/split feeding (Treatment 2) thrice a day feeding (Treatment 3) 3 hours restriction feeding (Treatment 4). Experimental design was completely randomized design. 240 broilers were randomly allotted to four treatments with 6 replicates and 10 birds per replicate. Birds were weighed weekly to evaluate their performances, faeces was collected on day 42, to determine digestibility and rectal temperature was taken {{as a measure of}} bird’s wellbeing. Results showed that {{there were no significant differences}} (p≥ 0. 05) in performance of birds across treatments but values from birds fed <b>Ad-libitum</b> were higher.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of hydration status and fluid availability on appetite and energy intake. Sixteen males completed four 24 h trials, visiting the laboratory overnight fasted on two consecutive days. Standardised foods were provided during the 24 h and on day two an <b>ad-libitum</b> semi-solid porridge breakfast was provided. Water intake during the 24 h (0 or 40 mL∙kg- 1) and fluid provision during the <b>ad-libitum</b> breakfast were manipulated so subjects were euhydrated with (EU-F) and without fluid (EU-NF) available at breakfast; and hypohydrated with (HYPO-F) and without fluid (HYPO-NF) available at breakfast. Blood samples (0 and 24 h), urine samples (0 - 24 h) and subjective responses (0, 24 and 24. 5 h) were collected. HYPO trials decreased body mass by ~ 1. 8 %. Serum and urine osmolality increased and plasma volume decreased during HYPO trials (P< 0. 001). Total urine output was greater during EU than HYPO trials (P< 0. 001). <b>Ad-libitum</b> energy intake was not different between trials: 2658 (938) kJ (EU-F), 2353 (643) kJ (EU-NF), 2295 (529) kJ (HYPO-F), 2414 (954) kJ (HYPO-NF), (P= 0. 131). Fluid intake was ~ 200 mL greater during HYPO-F than EU-F (P< 0. 01). There was an interaction effect for thirst (P< 0. 001), but not hunger or fullness.

40|$|The {{first two}} {{chapters}} identified that {{in comparison to}} mature multiparous ewes, fewer hoggets are bred, a greater proportion return to oestrus, have a lower proportion that ovulate and of those that do ovulate, the ovulation rate is lower, {{and there is a}} greater reproductive loss in early to mid pregnancy, fewer and lighter singleton counterparts lambs at birth, poorer mothering ability and lighter and fewer lambs at weaning. As a result of these findings, nutritional management experiments were designed to investigate the effects of nutrition on the reproductive performance of hoggets. The results indicate that offering <b>ad-libitum</b> levels of herbage prior to ram introduction can increase the proportion of hoggets bred which leads to a better pregnancy rate. However, <b>ad-libitum</b> levels herbage immediately after the completion of the breeding period could be associated with hoggets that were bred returning to oestrus. The efficiency of lamb production was reduced when the hoggets were offered <b>ad-libitum</b> levels of herbage during pregnancy. However. when twin-bearing hoggets were offered <b>ad-libitum</b> levels of nutrition from mid- to late- pregnancy the efficiency of lamb production was similar between nutritional levels. The twin-bearing hoggets may have both been offered a level of nutrition that did not lead to a sufficient nutritional intake restriction in the medium group to allow for hogget live weight differences to occur. Hoggets that were offered <b>ad-libitum</b> levels of nutrition during pregnancy were heavier than the hoggets offered medium levels of nutrition. Weaning single lambs born to hoggets at 10 weeks of age whilst weaning twin lambs at 9 weeks of age did not have an impact on hogget or lamb live weight compared to weaning at 13 or 14 weeks of age. This thesis has identified reproductive differences between hoggets and mature multiparous ewes and the impact of nutritional management on hogget reproductive performance and the effect of weaning age on lamb and hogget live weight. Implementing the results from the nutritional experiments into farm practice could improve hogget reproductive performance and help alleviate the issue of the negative impact of hogget breeding on subsequent breeding live weight, while also offering options to the farmer when planning the management of weaning lambs born to hoggets...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Sub-optimally nourished rats show reduced growth, {{biochemical}} {{and physiological}} changes. However, {{no one has}} assessed metabolic rate adaptations in rats subjected to chronic suboptimal nutrition (CSN). In this study energy expenditure (EE; kcal/ 100 g body weight) and physical activity (PA; oscillations in weight/min/kg body weight) were assessed in rats subjected to three levels of CSN. Results Body weight gain was diminished (76. 7 ± 12. 0 and 61. 6 ± 11. 0 g) in rats fed 70 and 60 % of the <b>ad-libitum</b> fed controls which gained more weight (148. 5 ± 32. 3 g). The rats fed 80 % gained weight similarly to controls (136. 3 ± 10. 5 g). Percent Fat-free body mass was reduced (143. 8 ± 8. 7 and 142. 0 ± 7. 6 g) in rats fed 70 and 60 % of <b>ad-libitum,</b> but not in those fed 80 % (200. 8 ± 17. 5 g) as compared with controls (201. 6 ± 33. 4 g). Body fat (g) decreased in rats fed 80 % (19. 7 ± 5. 3), 70 % (15. 3 ± 3. 5) and 60 % (9. 6 ± 2. 7) of <b>ad-libitum</b> in comparison to controls (26. 0 ± 6. 7). EE and PA were also altered by CSN. The control rats increased their EE and PA during the dark periods by 1. 4 ± 0. 8 and 1. 7 ± 1. 1 respectively, as compared with light the period; whereas CSN rats fed 80 and 70 % of <b>ad-libitum</b> energy intake had reduced EE and PA during the dark periods {{as compared with the}} light period EE(7. 5 ± 1. 4 and 7. 8 ± 0. 6 vs. 9. 0 ± 1. 2 and 9. 7 ± 0. 8; p Conclusion CSN rats adapt to mild energy restriction by reducing body fat, EE and PA mainly during the dark period while growth proceeds and lean body mass is preserved.

40|$|The current thesis {{aimed to}} explore the {{relationship}} between disinhibition and alcohol consumption in non-dependent drinkers. Specifically, whether (dis) inhibition {{can be considered a}} ‘state’ variable, which is responsive to motivational biases, cues and training. It was examined whether any fluctuations in (dis) inhibition could influence subsequent <b>ad-libitum</b> alcohol consumption, in sober individuals (de Wit, 2009). Furthermore, the effects of beliefs about disinhibition, exclusively in relation to alcohol-seeking, were also examined with respect to possible effects on alcohol-seeking. These general research questions were examined in a heavy drinking, student population. Chapter One discussed in detail the relationship between disinhibition and alcohol consumption by examining evidence from relevant models of addiction. Chapter Two described the general methods used in the experimental chapters of the thesis. In the first experimental chapter (Chapter Three) individuals were primed with different motivational biases on how to respond on a stop-signal task, before <b>ad-libitum</b> consumption was measured. Different motivational biases led to group differences in inhibition performance, it was demonstrated that a restrained mental set led to a reduction in alcohol consumption in the laboratory. Expanding this finding, Chapter Four examined the effect of these motivational biases on neuropsychophysiological measures (Event Related Potentials and Source dipole analyses) of inhibitory control; associations between inhibition indices and <b>ad-libitum</b> consumption were discussed. Chapter Five set out to examine whether inhibitory control could be trained specifically to alcohol cues, and whether this training could serve to reduce alcohol consumption in the laboratory (Experiment One and Two) and outside the laboratory (Experiment One) in response to emerging research (Houben et al 2011 a). Two different types of inhibition training, motor and oculomotor, were compared in this chapter. Results demonstrated some success for motor, but not oculomotor inhibition, in both training behaviour and reductions in alcohol consumption, highlighting the fundamental differences in these constructs. Chapter Six examined whether alcohol cues could cause disinhibition in heavy social drinkers, but found no evidence for cue-related disinhibition. However, some evidence for disinhibition and cue-reactivity was established and possible methodological issues discussed. In the final experimental chapter (Chapter Seven) restraint beliefs were examined in relation to <b>ad-libitum</b> alcohol consumption. It was found that beliefs could influence <b>ad-libitum</b> alcohol-seeking, however results were at first glance paradoxical to behavioural research. The overall results of this thesis offer some of the first experimental support for the causal relationship between state disinhibition and alcohol consumption in sober, non-dependent individuals. Support was offered for the theories of addiction that postulate the association between disinhibition and alcohol consumption, specifically recent models that suggest disinhibition is a state which can influence drinking behaviour. Finally, support for recent theories that suggest targeting controlled processes may serve to reduce alcohol consumption in populations at high risk for alcohol abuse...|$|E

Although the FR-dependent en-hancement of total B disappears in aged rats, {{increased levels of}} the bioavailable fraction, free B, appear to be maintained. In young rats, we previously found that the FR-induced increase in the diurnal peak of total B is associated with increased adrenal response to corticotropin, also know as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Here we show that the FR-enhanced adrenal re-sponse of total B to ACTH disappears with age but that the enhanced response of free B is main-tained. We measured the endogenous diurnal peak and the response to ACTH of total and free B in 10 -, 16 -, and 22 -month-old <b>ad-libitum</b> fed and FR male Fischer 344 rats in the afternoon, when plasma B peaks.

The result showed no significant (P> 0. 05) genotype effects in the body temperature of both the parents and their progeny. This implies that neither progeny nor generation had effect on body temperature. The Alpha strain exhibited more resting behaviour than did the exotic and the pure native types. Majority of the birds rested in the afternoon at 2. 00 pm. This could be attributed to the fact that at 2. 00 pm the weather is hot and birds search for a quiet and cool place to reduce thermal stress...|$|E
40|$|Carbohydrate {{and protein}} {{ingestion}} post-exercise {{are known to}} facilitate muscle glycogen resynthesis and protein synthesis, respectively, but the effects of post-exercise nutrient intake on subsequent appetite are unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether protein induced satiety that has been reported at rest was still evident when pre-loads were consumed in a post-exercise context. Using a randomized, double blind, crossover design, 12 unrestrained healthy males completed 30 min of continuous cycling exercise at ~ 60 % VO 2 peak, followed by five, 3 min intervals at ~ 85 % VO 2 peak. Ten min post-exercise, subjects consumed 500 ml of either a low energy placebo (15 kJ) (PLA); a 6 % whey protein isolate drink (528 kJ) (PRO); or a 6 % sucrose drink (528 kJ) (CHO). Sixty min after drink ingestion, a homogenous <b>ad-libitum</b> pasta lunch was provided and energy intake at this lunch was quantified. Subjective appetite ratings were measured at various stages of the protocol. Energy consumed at the <b>ad-libitum</b> lunch was lower after PRO (5831 ± 960 kJ) than PLA (6406 ± 492 kJ) (P 0. 315). Considering the post-exercise drink, total energy intake was not different between trials (P= 0. 383). There were no differences between trials {{for any of the}} subjective appetite ratings. The results demonstrate that where post-exercise liquid protein ingestion may enhance the adaptive response of skeletal muscle, and this may be possible without affecting gross energy intake relative to consuming a low energy drink...|$|E
40|$|Summary. In {{the first}} experiment, {{the effects of}} food {{availability}} on growth and repro-duction were assessed by placing male musk shrews on 3 different feeding schedules, i. e. fed ad libitum, fed 50 % of the amount eaten by the <b>ad-libitum</b> controls or fed 25 % of the amount eaten by the <b>ad-libitum</b> controls. After 25 days, growth and sexual maturation were significantly retarded in both of the food-restricted groups compared to the control group. In the second experiment, the combined effects of food avail-ability and social cues were investigated in juvenile males that were either fed ad libitum(during the day) or placed on a restricted diet known to inhibit growth and repro-duction. Half of these males were either housed alone or with an adult female (separated from female during the day by a wire barrier, but in full contact at night). The ad-libitum-fed males living with a female ate more food, gained more body weight and were more sexually mature than ad-libitum-fed animals living alone. Furthermore, males in the two food-restricted groups had lower body weights and were sexually immature compared with males in both of the ad-libitum-fed groups. Finally, there were little or no differences in growth and reproduction between animals in the two food-restricted groups. These results suggest that food availability is an important environmental regulator of the timing of sexual maturation, and that stimulatory social cues cannot override the inhibitory effects of an inadequate diet...|$|E
40|$|Wheaten straw diets were {{supplemented}} with urea or protein (casein or gluten) and offered <b>ad-libitum</b> to sheep. Intakes and digestibilities of the diets were similar {{irrespective of the}} nitrogen source. The breakdown of cotton thread suspended in the rumen for 48 h was substantially increased when protein was substituted in the diets. Despite this increase in cellulolytic activity in the rumen there was little change in the digestion of roughage-cellulose. Ruminal concentrations of isobutyric, isovaleric and n-valeric acids were also increased by substitution of urea with pro-tein. Ruminal ammonia and precipitable protein concentrations were similar with rumen. The factors which limit roughage intake and utilization are discussed. I...|$|E
40|$|Objective: An acute bout of high {{intensity}} intermittent exercise suppresses <b>ad-libitum</b> energy intake at the post-exercise meal. The present {{study examined the}} effects of 12 weeks of {{high intensity}} intermittent exercise training (HIIT) compared with moderate intensity continuous exercise training (MICT) on appetite regulation. Methods: Thirty overweight, inactive men (BMI: 27. 2 +/- 1. 3 kg/m 2; V[spacing dot above]O 2 Peak: 35. 3 +/- 5. 3 mL. kg- 1. min- 1) were randomised to either HIIT or MICT (involving 12 weeks of training, 3 sessions per week) or a control group (CON) (n = 10 per group). <b>Ad-libitum</b> energy intake from a laboratory test meal was assessed following both a low-energy (LEP: 847 kJ) and a high-energy preload (HEP: 2438 kJ) pre and post-intervention. Perceived appetite and appetite-related blood variables were also measured. Results: There was no significant effect of the intervention period on energy intake at the test meal following the two different preloads (p >= 0. 05). However, the 95 % CI indicated a clinically meaningful decrease in energy intake after the HEP compared with LEP in response to HIIT (516 +/- 395 kJ decrease), but not for MICT or CON, suggesting improved appetite regulation. This was not associated with alterations in the perception of appetite or the circulating concentration of a number of appetite-related peptides or metabolites, although insulin sensitivity was enhanced with HIIT only (p = 0. 003). Conclusion: HIIT appears to benefit appetite regulation in overweight men. The mechanisms for this remain to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of restricting silage feeding on time of calving and calving performance in Holstein-Friesian cows. In the treatment group (n = 1, 248 cows, 12 herds) silage feeding commenced in the evening (17 : 00 to 20 : 00 h), {{after a period of}} restricted access (2 to 10 h) while in the control group <b>ad-libitum</b> access to silage was provided over the 24 h period (n = 1, 193 cows, 12 herds). Daytime and nighttime calvings were defined as calvings occurring between the hours of 06 : 30 and 00 : 29 and between 00 : 30 and 06 : 29, respectively. Restricting access to silage resulted in less calvings at night compared to cows with <b>ad-libitum</b> access to silage (18 vs 22 %, P < 0. 05). Cows with restricted access to silage had a higher percentage of difficult calvings (11 vs 7 %, P < 0. 001) and stillbirths (7 vs 5 %, P < 0. 05) compared to cows in the control group. The percentage of calvings at night was lower (13 %) when access to silage was restricted for 10 h compared to 2, 4 or 6 h (22, 18, 25 %, respectively) (P < 0. 001). Calf sire breed, calf gender or cow parity did not influence time of calving. In conclusion, offering silage to pregnant Holstein-Friesian cows in the evening, after a period of restricted access, reduced the incidence of nighttime calvings, but increased the incidence of dystocia and stillbirth. peer-reviewedIrish Dairy Levy Research Fun...|$|E
40|$|Effect of sow {{feed intake}} during {{gestation}} {{on the growth}} performance of progeny to slaughter It was hypothesised that a strategic increase in sow’s gestation feed levels may increase the growth potential of pigs. Following insemination using semen from meat-line sires, 46 parity two to four L x LW sows were fed at 30 MJ DE/d. Sows were blocked on parity and weight and {{assigned to one of}} two nutritional treatments: 30 MJ DE/d or 60 MJ DE/d between day 25 and 50 of gestation. From day 50 to 110 of gestation sows were fed at 30 MJ DE/d. A gestation diet (6. 2 g lysine/kg; 12. 8 MJ DE/kg) was used. From day 110 of gestation to weaning a lactation diet (8. 6 g lysine/kg; 14 MJ DE/kg) was fed to appetite. Progeny were weaned at 27 ± 0. 1 days of age (mean ± SE) and one mixed sex pair of pigs of average weight was penned from each litter. In total, 46 mixed sex pairs of pigs were offered <b>ad-libitum</b> an identical sequence of diets to day 47 post-weaning. From day 47 to slaughter at 131 days post-weaning, pigs were formed into single sex groups of 12 pigs. They were offered the same finisher diet <b>ad-libitum</b> using a transponder feeding system and individual feed intakes were recorded. The number born alive (10. 9 ± 0. 75 pigs) and the number born dead (0. 9 ± 0. 32 pigs) were similar for both treatments.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate and compare the responses of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the circulation of hydrated, dehydrated, and dehydrated losartan - treated camels; and to document the cardiac storage form of B-type natriuretic peptide in the camel heart. Eighteen male camels were used in the study: control or hydrated camels (n = 6), dehydrated camels (n = 6) and dehydrated losartan-treated camels (n = 6) which were dehydrated and received the angiotensin II (Ang II) AT- 1 receptor blocker, losartan, at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight intravenously for 20 days. Control animals were supplied with feed and water <b>ad-libitum</b> while both dehydrated and dehydrated-losartan treated groups were supplied with feed <b>ad-libitum</b> but no water for 20 days. Compared with time-matched controls, dehydrated camels exhibited a significant decrease in plasma levels of both ANP and BNP. Losartan-treated camels also exhibited a significant decline in ANP and BNP levels across 20 days of dehydration but the changes were not different from those seen with dehydration alone. Size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography of extracts of camel heart indicated that proB-type natriuretic peptide is the storage form of the peptide. We conclude first, that dehydration in the camel induces vigorous decrements in circulating levels of ANP and BNP; second, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has little or no modulatory effect on the ANP and BNP responses to dehydration; third, proB-type natriuretic peptide is the storage form of this hormone {{in the heart of the}} one-humped camel...|$|E
