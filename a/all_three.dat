5|$|<b>All</b> <b>three</b> of the Radetzky-class battleships were {{commissioned}} {{only a few}} years prior the beginning of World War I. Prior to the war, <b>all</b> <b>three</b> battleships were assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, along with the Tegetthoff-class battleships in the 1st Division. <b>All</b> <b>three</b> battleships conducted training exercises in the Mediterranean Sea from 1910 to 1911. In 1913, they participated in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea that protested the Balkan Wars. During World War I, the ships had very limited service careers, hardly ever leaving port. However, in October 1914, the three ships bombarded French positions on Mount Lovƒçen during the Austro-Hungarian invasion of Montenegro. After Italy declared war on Austro-Hungary in 1915, the Radetzky-class battleships participated in the bombardment of the Italian city of Ancona. Following these operations, the three battleships' contributions to the war effort became minimal. They remained in port {{until the end of the}} war. Following Austria-Hungary's defeat in World War I, <b>all</b> <b>three</b> battleships were handed over to Italy and later broken up for scrap between 1920 and 1926.|$|E
