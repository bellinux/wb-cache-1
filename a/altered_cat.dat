40|$|To {{develop a}} {{technique}} for identifying Bacillus subtilis genes whose products affect transcription from promoters recognized by sigma 37 -containing RNA polymerase (E-sigma 37), we cloned the promoter region {{of a gene}} (ctc) that is actively transcribed in vitro by E-sigma 37 into a plasmid (pPL 603 B) so that a transcriptional fusion was created between ctc and a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. CAT levels in B. subtilis carrying the ctc/CAT fusion plasmid varied {{in a manner that}} was consistent with the known pattern of ctc RNA synthesis. Mutagenesis of cells harboring the ctc/CAT plasmid led to the isolation of bacterial clones which displayed altered chloramphenicol resistance. Analysis of the mutants demonstrated that CAT activity was substantially changed in the mutant cells. Several of the B. subtilis mutants, both CAT overproducers and underproducers, also had acquired a sporulation-deficient phenotype. The mutations responsible for <b>altered</b> <b>CAT</b> expression were not carried on the plasmid. Analysis of RNA synthesized by mutant cells indicates that at least a portion of the mutants may be altered in the level of transcription from the ctc promoter and, hence, are likely to define B. subtilis genes which influence this process...|$|E
40|$|Mismatch repair {{mutations}} are {{the cause}} of generalized genomic instability and are particularly evident at microsatellite loci, which is known as microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI is present in 85 % to 90 % of colorectal cancers and occurs in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). The National Cancer Institute recommends the “Bethesda panel” for MSI screening. Recently, a novel T 25 mononucleotide marker was described, termed CAT 25. This microsatellite marker displays a quasi-monomorphic pattern in normal tissues. The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of CAT 25 in HNPCC patients and to compare its reliability {{with the results of}} the Bethesda panel. We tested 55 tumor tissues from HNPCC patients using both the Bethesda panel and the CAT 25 mononucleotide marker. One hundred healthy blood donors were used as controls. The CAT 25 microsatellite was found to be altered in all 13 colorectal cancers classified as MSI-H using the standard Bethesda panel. Colorectal tumors that showed a stable Bethesda pattern did not show <b>altered</b> <b>CAT</b> 25 repeats. Additionally, CAT 25 showed a monomorphic allele pattern in all tissue samples. In our series, the concordance between the Bethesda panel and CAT 25 in identifying colorectal cancers with high MSI reached 100 %. Our results suggest that the CAT 25 microsatellite represents a sensitive and specific marker for MSI and could be, at least, included in the panel of markers for the identification of HNPCC patients...|$|E

40|$|AG to A {{transition}} {{at position}} - 76 in the promoter {{region of the}} apoAI gene was previously identified, and the A- 76 {{has been shown to}} be associated with high apoAI levels. The functional significance of the point mutation was assessed by analysing the DNA-protein binding and promoter activities of the different alleles. This data would suggest that the point mutation alters the function of the apoAI promoter as gel retention assays revealed that the G fragment (- 140 to + 10) formed an extra DNA-protein complex compared to the A fragment (- 140 to + 10). Concurrent with the altered DNA-protein interaction between the G and the A fragments, the transcriptional activities of the apoAI gene were found to also be <b>altered.</b> <b>CAT</b> assays have indicated a 1. 91 fold increase in promoter activity of the A fragment as compared to the G fragment (- 256 to + 397). The difference in promoter activity was, however, highly dependent on the particular fragment used, as no difference was observed between the alleles when a fragment {- 256 to + 68) was used. In this study elements were identified in the region + 68 to + 397 that causes a reduction in the promoter activity of the G allele by 3. 6 fold, whilst reducing the A allele activity by 2 fold.

In this study, we examined the presence and localization of cat S by immunocytochemistry in 21 control, 24 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 10 Down syndrome (DS) postmortem brains. An antiserum to a human cat S fusion protein was affinity purified and its specificity confirmed by abolition of immunoreactivity after adsorption with cat S but not cat L fusion protein. A small minority of control cases showed light, focal staining of scattered cortical neurons. Many control cases, {{as well as most}} AD and DS cases, showed prominent staining of vascular smooth muscle cells, particularly in leptomeningeal vessels. Both AD and DS brain tissue showed increased immunoreactivity in a subset of neocortical and hippocampal neurons and glia. Cat S immunoreactivity occurred in a granular, cytoplasmic pattern in some neurons or in a more dense staining pattern in certain neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons. Cat S-positive neurons were also present in amygdala and basal forebrain in AD brains. A subset of astrocytes were immunoreactive with the cat S antibody in AD and DS but not in control brains. In rare AD cases, cat S immunostaining was observed in astrocytes in the periphery of amyloid-beta-containing plaques. These results suggest that cat S is up-regulated in AD and DS brain. The association of cat S immunoreactivity with tangle-bearing neurons, astrocytes, and rare senile plaques implies a role for <b>altered</b> <b>cat</b> S activity in the pathogenesis of AD...|$|E

40|$|Top-predators {{can play}} {{important}} roles in terrestrial food webs, fuelling speculation that top-predators might be used as biocontrol tools against invasive mesopredators. Feral cats {{are believed to be}} largely responsible for the current declines of native fauna across tropical northern Australia, where substantial beef cattle production occurs. Dingoes are known to impact cattle production there and are predicted to impact native fauna also. However, dingoes are forecasted to curtail the impacts of cats and reverse native fauna declines. We review (1) empirical studies investigating the relationships between dingoes and cats, and dingo control and cats, (2) records of cat remains in dingo diets, and (3) historical records of lethal dingo control using 1080 -poisoned baits across Australia between 1999 and 2008 to show how two naturalised invasive species can interact in dynamic agro-ecological landscapes. From the 35 studies assessed, most reported no detectable relationship between dingoes and cats; negative or positive relationships were seldom detected. Dingoes do not appear to exclude cats beyond fine scales, but may <b>alter</b> <b>cat</b> activity periods under certain conditions. Cat remains were found in only 0. 63 % of over 31, 000 dingo diet records. Lethal dingo control occurs (in varying degrees) across about two-thirds of Australia and does not appear to substantially influence dingo-cat relationships. We conclude that the presently available data provides little evidence that bolstering dingo populations will reduce the impacts of cats. Much more work is needed to identify situations where top-predators might be used as effective biocontrol tools against invasive mesopredators in agro-ecological systems...|$|R

This modulation requires cyclic GMP synthesis via {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS) -NO stimulation, but upstream and downstream mechanisms remain un-defined. To determine this, adult cardiac myocytes from genetically engineered mice and controls were studied by video microscopy to assess sarcomere shortening (SS) and fura 2 -AM fluorescence to measure calcium transients (CaT). Enhanced SS from isoproterenol (ISO, 10 nM) was suppressed a parts per thousand yen 50 % by the PDE 5 A inhibitor sildenafil (SIL, 1 mu M), without <b>altering</b> <b>CaT.</b> This regulation was unaltered despite co-inhibition of either the cGMP-stimulated cAMP-esterase PDE 2 (Bay 60 - 7550), or cGMP-inhibited cAMP-esterase PDE 3 (cilostamide). Thus, the SIL response could not be ascribed to cGMP interaction with alternative PDEs. However, genetic deletion (or pharmacologic blockade) of beta 3 -ARs, which couple to NOS signaling, fully prevented SIL modulation of ISO-stimulated SS. Importantly, both PDE 5 A protein expression and activity were similar in beta 3 -AR knockout (beta 3 -AR(-/-)) myocytes as in controls. Downstream, cGMP stimulates protein kinase G (PKG), and we found contractile modulation by SIL required PKG activation and enhanced TnI phosphorylation at S 23, S 24. Myocytes expressing the slow skeletal TnI isoform which lacks these sites displayed no modulation of ISO responses by SIL. Non-equilibrium isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis showed SIL increased TnI phosphorylation above that from concomitant ISO in control but not beta 3 -AR(-/-) myocytes. These data support a cascade involving beta 3 -AR stimulation, and subsequent PKG-dependent TnI S 23, S 24 phosphorylation as primary factors underlying the capacity of acute PDE 5 A inhibition to blunt myocardial beta-adrenergic stimulation...|$|R

The aim of this study was to evaluate the fecal microbiome in cats with diarrhea. Fecal samples were obtained from healthy cats (n = 21) and cats with acute (n = 19) or chronic diarrhea (n = 29) and analyzed by sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes, and PICRUSt was used to predict the functional gene content of the microbiome. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) revealed significant differences in bacterial groups between healthy cats and cats with diarrhea. The order Burkholderiales, the families Enterobacteriaceae, and the genera Streptococcus and Collinsella were significantly increased in diarrheic cats. In contrast the order Campylobacterales, the family Bacteroidaceae, and the genera Megamonas, Helicobacter, and Roseburia were significantly increased in healthy cats. Phylum Bacteroidetes was significantly decreased in cats with chronic diarrhea (> 21 days duration), while the class Erysipelotrichi and the genus Lactobacillus were significantly decreased in cats with acute diarrhea. The observed changes in bacterial groups were accompanied by significant differences in functional gene contents: metabolism of fatty acids, biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids, metabolism of biotin, metabolism of tryptophan, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, were all significantly (p< 0. 001) <b>altered</b> in <b>cats</b> with diarrhea.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the importance of}} the 3 '-untranslated region (UTR) of the mouse cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (cyp 7) mRNA in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of the cyp 7 gene, chimaeric genes encoding mRNA containing the structural sequence of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) linked to either the 3 '-UTR of the mouse cyp 7 mRNA or the SV 40 early gene mRNA were constructed. The human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was used to drive the expression of all the chimaeric genes. Thus the transgenes had identical sequences in the promoter, the regions encoding the 5 '-UTR and translated sequence but differed in the region encoding the 3 '-UTR of their respective mRNA species. The transgene containing the entire cyp 7 3 '-UTR (designated CMV. CAT. CYP 7) gave rise to CAT activity in transfected hepatoma cells that was one-quarter of that obtained in cells transfected with the transgene containing the SV 40 3 '-UTR (designated CMV. CAT. SV 40). The 3 '-UTR of the cyp 7 mRNA contains sequences resembling AU-rich elements (AREs). Deleting eight of nine putative AREs from the CYP 7 3 '-UTR sequence increased the CAT activity to a level greater than that observed for CMV. CAT. SV 40, whereas deletion of the intron region had no effect. These results show that the AREs of the 3 '-UTR of the cyp 7 mRNA decrease transgene expression. Bile acids are known to repress the expression of the cyp 7 gene. To test whether the 3 '-UTR of the cyp 7 mRNA has a role in this process, the expression of the chimaeric genes was evaluated in hepatoma cells competent for bile acid uptake. Conjugated bile acids, but not unconjugated bile acids, further decreased the expression of the CMV. CAT. CYP 7 transgene. The same bile acids had no effect on the expression of the CMV. CAT. SV 40 transgene. Deletion of the intron from the cyp 7 sequence did not <b>alter</b> the <b>CAT</b> activity compared with the parental plasmid, and also did not alter the sensitivity of the transgene to the conjugated bile acids. Deletion of the AREs from the cyp 7 3 '-UTR, which increased the expression of the transgene, did not abolish the sensitivity of the transgene to repression by conjugated bile acids. Thus the 3 '-UTR of the mouse cyp 7 mRNA also contains elements that facilitate the further repression of transgene expression in the presence of conjugated bile acids. The results indicate that the 3 '-UTR of the mouse cyp 7 mRNA contains information specifying regulation at the post-transcriptional level...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la 4 th International Conference on Analytical proteomics, celebrada en Caparica (Portugal) del 7 al 9 de septiembre de 2015. [Purpose]: Chilling injury (CI) {{constitute}} {{a set of}} physiological disorders causing detrimental effects on quality of fruits when stored after harvest at low temperatures to retard postharvest ripening and to extend their shelf-life. We have applied proteomics analysis to identify potential protein markers of CI and cold stress, and to detect biological processes affected by CI or involved in the plant organ response {{to deal with the}} cold stress. [Experimental description]: Fruits (bell peppers and tomatoes) were subjected to postharvest storage and posterior reconditioning at room temperature (20 ºC). Storage was performed at a low temperature causing CI (1 and 2 ºC respectively) for one batch of fruits and at a higher non-chilling temperature (10 and 12 ºC respectively) for another batch used as control. Physiological parameters were determined, such as electrolyte leakage, ethylene production by GC-FID, respiration rate by GC-TCD, lipid peroxidation by MDA production, and sugars, organic acids and ascorbic acid by HPLC-RID/UV. Transmission electron microscopy studies were performed in bell pepper fruit sections. After extraction proteins were separated by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) and proteins spots were identified after trypsin digestion with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The search for peptides was fulfilled in batch mode using GPS Explorer v 3. 5 software with a licensed version of MASCOT, using viridiplantae and SGN databases. [Results and Conclusions]: A comparative proteomics analysis between fruits stored at chilling and non-chilling temperatures with posterior reconditioning was carried out. In tomato fruits storage at low temperature was ended just before visible CI symptoms appeared, but in bell pepper fruits this storage was extended until development of these symptoms. The proteomic study has allowed for the identification of processes occurring in fruit biology that are critically affected by chilling injury such as the activation of stress defense mechanisms starred by stressresponsive proteins (LEAs, HSPs and PRs), and alterations in carbohydrate/energy metabolism, particularly in enzymes from glycolysis, TCA and Calvin cycle, but also involved in stress signaling such as GAPDH, OGDH, INV and aldose- 1 -epimerase, this last one a potential new protein marker in cold stress. In tomato a remarkable down-regulation of a chloroplastic ATP synthase occurred, which may lead to depletion of intracellular ATP. In bell pepper fruits where CI progress was more advanced the proteomics analysis revealed alterations in redox homeostasis, protein abundance in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle is <b>altered</b> and <b>CAT</b> down-regulated.

Systolic blood pressure was normal in all the cats. pw-DTI systolic (S′), early (E′) and late diastolic (A′) velocities were assessed from standardised sites within the myocardium, and the relationships between these and disease group, age and heart rate were then assessed. In cats with HCM, the E′ velocity was decreased at various sites. Conversely, the HiT 4 cats demonstrated increased S′ velocities. The only site at which the age of the cat was significantly related to myocardial velocities was the S′ velocity from the apical mid-septum. There were also significant positive relationships between heart rate and the magnitude of myocardial S′, E′ and A′ velocities of radial motion and S′ and A′ velocities of longitudinal motion. pw-DTI detected diastolic dysfunction in untreated cats with HCM and increased systolic function in HiT 4 cats.

40|$|Green {{inheritance}} in {{the form}} of medicinal plants is a golden hallmark to combat challenges of the modern world e. g. cancer, infections, diabetes, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases etc. Carissa opaca is a medicinal plant used traditionally for the management of cardiovascular troubles, jaundice, hepatitis and asthma. Carissa opaca was also certified scientifically for its strong pharmacological potencies. Dicliptera roxburghiana is used traditionally as general tonic and for wound healing. This research scenario was designed to explore the phytochemical characterization of C. opaca and pharmacological potential of D. roxburghiana. To ascertain their biological worth, powder of leaves of both plants was separately extracted with methanol to obtain methanol extracts which were successively partitioned with different solvents e. g. n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform and n-butanol to get various solvent fractions and residual aqueous fraction. Following bioassay-guided fractionation by column chromatography of C. opaca extract/fractions for reduction of DPPH; purified compounds obtained were characterized by 1 H, 13 C, COSY, HSQC, HMBC, NOESY and 1 D TOCSY. Isolated compounds were characterized as Naringin, Prunin, Ursolic acid, Uvaol and Procrim a. Naringin, Ursolic acid and Prunin were endowed with excellent antioxidant (in vitro antioxidant assays) and antimicrobial characteristics whereas Uvaol and Procrim a; were moderately active. All compounds were proven to be non-cytotoxic when tested on Hela cell lines. GCMS and LC/MS/MS of the methanol fraction confirmed the presence of various important constituents specially flavonoids. Preliminary phytochemical screening of D. roxburghiana indicated the existence of various classes of secondary metabolites; flavonoids, phenolics, alkaloids, saponins, coumarins, tannins, phlobatannins, anthraquinones and cardiac glycosides. Antiradical proficiencies of methanol extract/fractions indicated the effectiveness for methanol, ethyl acetate and n-butanol fraction but with low activity for n-hexane and aqueous fraction. Positive correlation was determined between the antiradical potential with flavonoid and phenolic contents. An appreciable level of antibacterial activity was established for the methanol extract and n-hexane fraction of D. roxburghiana against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae through agar well diffusion method. For antifungal demonstrations, various fungal strains e. g. Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium solani were used. Methanol extract and n-hexane fraction demonstrated an appreciable level of antifungal activity. Anticancer and cytotoxic screening established the fact that n-hexane fraction was very active for nitrite inhibition, chloroform fraction was active for QR 1 induction whereas ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions were very active against NF?B inhibition. For antiproliferative screenings, it was determined that n-butanol fraction was active against 1 c 1 c- 7 and MYCN- 2 cell lines whereas ethyl acetate, chloroform and n-butanol fractions were active against SK-N-SH cancer cell line. For in vivo pharmacological evaluation of methanol extract of D. roxburghiana (DRME), CCl 4 was used to induce toxicity in Balb C male mice. Seven groups were formed which were treated with their respective doses at alternate days for one month. Toxicity was instigated by CCl 4 (1 ml/kg b. w.; 20 % in olive oil) whereas protection was monitored by using silymarin (50 mg/kg b. w.) and DRME 40 and 60 mg/kg b. w. After dissection, blood was collected to analyze the level of serum markers. Toxicity was monitored in five organs e. g. liver, kidney, heart, lungs and testis through various enzymatic and biochemical markers and DNA fragmentation assay. Histoarchitecture of each tissue was also examined microscopically. Hepatoprotective potential of D. roxburghiana, instigated by CCl 4 was confirmed by normal levels of serum markers e. g. AST, ALT, ALP, ?-GT and lipid profile (cholesterol, triglycerides, low and high density lipoproteins). Marked alteration for renal toxicity by CCl 4 and protective effects of DRME was assessed by urine analysis (pH, specific gravity, RBC and WBC, urobilinogen, creatinine and urea) and by measuring serum albumin, globulins, bilirubin, creatinine etc. Excessive elevation in the levels of CK and CKMB in serum was provoked by CCl 4 that was recovered by plant extract treatment. <b>Altered</b> level of <b>CAT,</b> SOD, POD, GST, GR and ?-GT in various organs by CCl 4 was ameliorated when treated with DRME. Anomalies in histoarchitecture of various organs induced by CCl 4 e. g. necrosis, pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, inflammatory cells infiltration in various tissues and degeneration of germ cells were ameliorated by the DRME treatment. All these findings demonstrated the pharmacological worth of D. roxburghiana...|$|R
