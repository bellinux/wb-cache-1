5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E

25|$|The Early Christian and the tuatha {{communities}} existed {{side by side}} {{across the}} Irish landscape, sometimes in harmony, sometimes not. Often the kings of the tuatha found it advantageous to become patrons of their local religious community as it gave them prestige. The people of the tuatha were usually the extended family of the king. They would have included many generations of relatives and also children of other tuatha who were given “fosterage” by a different tuatha and treated with as much love <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> children of the king. This extended family was the army with which the territorial battles were fought between kings.|$|E
25|$|In the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP), {{participants}} are informed {{that they will}} receive tasks to complete while watching a video on a television screen.

A distractor task is given {{at a certain point}} in order to test for prospective memory. Titov and Knight (2001) used a PRVP with a video consisting of a pedestrian walking through a shopping district and required participants to make decisions on whether to buy certain items <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> pedestrian. Shopping requires many prospective memory intentions such as remembering what items are needed and what items can be purchased another day.|$|E
25|$|The {{reactions}} {{by modern}} readers to his poetry have varied widely. The papyrologists and historians that first examined them were not impressed. Influenced by their backgrounds in Classical poetry, they compared the Dioscorian verses primarily to Classical standards. The most frequent objection {{was that his}} verses were obscure: the editors thought that the lines did not make sense – or at least, were not saying what the editors expected them to say. A more positive assessment was offered by Leslie MacCoull, who insisted that a reader must take Dioscorus’s Coptic background into consideration when reading the poetry. Many of the poems seemed to be praising unknown dignitaries – including an Emperor and several Dukes – and some papyrologists concluded that Dioscorus wrote the poems to get favors from government administrators (whom the papyrologists vaguely and inconsistently identified). Clement Kuehn, however, proposed that the poems be viewed not from a Classical, Hellenistic, or even a strictly Egyptian perspective, but through a lens of Byzantine culture and spirituality, in which Dioscorus and the Thebaid were so deeply immersed. Kuehn demonstrated that the poems fit neatly and masterfully into the allegorical style that was pervasive in the pictoral art and literature of the Early Byzantine Era. That is: Dioscorus, influenced by allegorical commentaries on the Homeric epics and Bible, and by the allegorical icons and church art of the 6th century, was praising Christ, Old Testament patriarchs, and the saints in heaven <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Emperor, kings, and dignitaries in a Byzantine court.|$|E

25|$|Other pilots at {{the charter}} company told NTSB that pilot Richard Conry and first officer (co-pilot) Michael Guess had both {{displayed}} below-average flying skills. Conry had a well-known tendency to allow copilots {{to take over}} all aircraft functions <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> sole pilot during flights. After the crash, three copilots told of occasions on which they had had {{to take control of}} the aircraft away from Conry. After one of those incidents, only three days before the crash, the copilot (not Guess) had urged Conry to retire. In a post-accident interview, Conry's longtime friend and fellow aviator Timothy Cooney said that he had last spoken to Conry in June 2001 and had expressed concerns about difficulties he had flying King Airs as late as April of that year, 18 months before the accident. Significant discrepancies were also found in the captain's flight logs in the course of the post-accident investigation, indicating he had probably greatly exaggerated his flying experience, most of which had been accrued before a 9–10 year hiatus from flying due to a fraud conviction and poor eyesight. He had had Lasik surgery but it had improved his vision to only 20/50 or 20/30 and he was required by FAA regulations to wear corrective lenses, but the pilot's wife and Cooney said Conry did not wear lenses after the surgery. The coroner who examined his badly burned body was unable to determine whether Conry was wearing contact lenses at the time of the crash.|$|E
25|$|In 62 BC Pompey {{returned}} to Italy {{after winning the}} Third Mithridatic War against Pontus and Armenia (in present-day eastern Turkey) and annexing Syria. He wanted the senate to ratify the acts of the settlements he had made with the kings and cities in the region en bloc. He was opposed by the optimates led by Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who carried {{the day in the}} senate with the support of Cato the Younger. Pompey had taken over the command of the last phase of that war from Lucullus, who felt that he should have been allowed to continue the war and win it. Moreover, when he took over the command of the war Pompey ignored the settlements Lucullus had already made. Lucullus demanded that Pompey should render account for each act individually and separately instead of asking for the approval of all his acts at once in a single vote <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> acts of a master. The character of the acts was not known. Each act should be scrutinised, and the senators should ratify those that suited the senate. Appian thought that the optimates, particularly Lucullus, were motivated by jealousy. Crassus cooperated with Lucullus on this matter. Plutarch wrote that when Lucullus {{returned to}} Rome after being relieved from his command the senate hoped that it would find in him an opponent of the tyranny of Pompey and a champion of the aristocracy. However, he withdrew from public affairs. Those who looked on the power of Pompey with suspicion made Crassus and Cato the champions of the senatorial party when Lucullus declined the leadership. Plutarch also wrote that Pompey asked the senate to postpone the consular elections so that he could be in Rome to help Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus to canvass for his candidacy. Cato swayed the senate to reject this. Plutarch also noted that according to some sources since Cato was the major stumbling-block for his ambitions, he asked for Cato’s elder niece's hand for himself and the hand of the younger one, whereas according to other sources he asked for the hand Cato’s daughters. The women were happy with this because of Pompey’s high repute, but Cato thought that this was aimed bribing him by means of a marriage alliance and refused.|$|E

He {{was inspired by the}} way she [...] "treated the extraordinary as something perfectly natural." [...] The house was filled with stories of ghosts and premonitions, omens and portents, all of which were studiously ignored by her husband. According to García Márquez she was [...] "the source of the magical, superstitious and supernatural view of reality". He enjoyed his grandmother's unique way of telling stories. No matter how fantastic or improbable her statements, she always delivered them <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> irrefutable truth.

500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{depictions of}} the death or murder of Troilus are on shield bands {{from the turn of}} the 7th into the 6th century BC found at Olympia. On these, a warrior with a sword is about to stab a naked youth at an altar. On one, Troilus clings to a tree (which Boitani takes for the laurel sacred to Apollo). [...] A crater contemporary with this shows Achilles at the altar holding the naked Troilus upside down while Hector, Aeneas and an otherwise unknown Trojan Deithynos arrive in the hope of saving the youth. In some depictions Troilus is begging for mercy. On an amphora, Achilles has the struggling Troilus slung over his shoulder as he goes to the altar. Boitani, in his survey of the story of Troilus through the ages, considers it of significance that two artifacts (a vase and a sarcophagus) from different periods link Troilus' and Priam's death by showing them on {{the two sides of the}} same item, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> beginning and end of the story of the fall of Troy. [...] Achilles is the father of Neoptolemus, who slays Priam at the altar during the sack of Troy. Thus the war opens with a father killing a son and closes with a son killing a father.|$|E
500|$|There {{is rapidly}} growing {{interest}} in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as [...] "open-ended, {{in the sense that}} subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger). Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that [...] "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity {{in the face of a}} frightening or unfathomable parent". However, [...] "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response." [...] For example, [...] "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person." ...|$|E
