2500|$|In 2007 Alan Canfora, one of {{the wounded}} students, located a static-filled copy of an <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shootings in a Yale library archive. The {{original}} 30-minute reel-to-reel audio tape recording was made by Terry Strubbe, a Kent State communications student who turned on his recorder and put its microphone in his dormitory window overlooking the campus. At that time, Canfora asserted that an amplified version of the tape reveals the order to shoot, [...] "Right here! Get Set! Point! Fire!". Lawrence Shafer, a guardsman who admitted he fired during the shootings {{and was one of}} those indicted in the 1974 federal criminal action with charges subsequently dismissed, told the Kent-Ravenna Record-Courier newspaper in May 2007: [...] "I never heard any command to fire. That's all I can say on that." [...] Referring to the assertion that the tape reveals the order, [...] Shafer went on to say, [...] "That's not to say there may not have been, but with all the racket and noise, I don't know how anyone could have heard anything that day." [...] Shafer also said that [...] "point" [...] would not have been part of a proper command to open fire.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2015, the Los Angeles Times {{released}} a [...] "note to readers" [...] stating that Rall {{had been dropped}} from the paper because of allegations that he had lied about a police encounter in 2001.

[...] The LAPD provided an <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encounter that the Times found to [...] "raise {{serious questions about the}} accuracy of Rall's blog post". [...] Rall stood by his version of the incident. [...] Another version of the recording, which Rall posted online after having it restored by sound engineers, included sounds of bystanders talking.

[...] In it, they reported they had the tape investigated by two audio and video forensics experts and it still did not support Rall's version of the event. In March 2016, Rall filed suit against the Times for defamation of character and wrongful termination; in June 2017, the judge in the case dismissed claims against four individuals for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress; claims against the former and current Times corporate ownership remain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws upon}} the {{deliberations}} of a Panel Discussion which addressed this {{question at the}} sixth Accounting History International Conference held in Wellington, New Zealand in August 2010. The panellists were the last four named authors. The first named author took responsibility for initiating this overview paper based on the speakers’ notes, including bullet point summaries, and an <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> session’s proceedings. Building from a Panel Discussion held at the sixth Accounting History International Conference, a resounding “yes” is offered {{in response to the}} question of whether accounting history matters. However, reflecting the viewpoint that accounting history can and should matter more, various suggestions are presented for advancing the quality, relevance and significance of historical research in accounting, commencing with the need to redress persistent misconceptions about the discipline. Practical strategies for enhancing the impact of accounting history scholarship are then developed around the themes of promoting its contemporary relevance and implications, fostering engagement with diverse groups of scholars, writing accounting history in informative and engaging ways, and articulating and developing appropriate methodologies. Finally, the role of accounting historians as “change agents” is explored and advocated...|$|E

40|$|No {{two people}} {{perceive}} {{the world around}} them in exactly the same way. Each of us first filters thesights, sounds and sensations surrounding us through our sensory systems before sending these perceptions on to be processed by and stored in our brains. Understanding exactly how we make sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world around us caught <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> psychologist, Richard Bandler and the linguist, John Grinder in the 1970 ’s. Working together at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> California at Santa Cruz, Bandler and Grinder began to study excellence in communication in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> psychotherapy. Based on the premise that modeling successful people and defining exactly what they do can lead to successful communica-tion, Grinder and Bandler made video and <b>audio</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renowned therapists, Virginia Satir (family therapy), Fritz Perls (Gestalt therapy), and Milton Erickson (hypnotherapy). They then carefully scrutinized their speech patterns and developed a system of coding them, {{in order to be able}} to teach these isolated elements of communication to others. This was <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> what we know today as Neuro-Linguistic Program-ming (NLP). The name Neuro-Linguistic Programming refers to <b>the</b> re-lationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body and mind. «Neuro » represents the brain where all human behavior is created, «Linguistic » refers to the language we use to express our thoughts and feelings, and «Pro-gramming » deals with the organized patters we use to produce results and achieve our goals. NLP suggests that it is possible to observe people, both through their habits and their language, in order to determine exactly how someone is thinking at the mo-ment by becoming aware of their preferred channel of communica-tion.

40|$|This study uses {{focus group}} discussions {{as a means}} for {{understanding}} <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> ethics in <b>the</b> decision making processes of student affairs professionals. A second purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study is to consider <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> <b>the</b> focus group discussion itself as a means to enable dialogue and conversation among student affairs professionals about ethical issues. ^ The problem is explored through four research questions: (1) Do ethical considerations enter into the decision making processes utilized by student affairs professionals? (2) How do actual decision making processes as described by the student affairs professionals relate to prescriptions for ethical decision making in the literature? (3) To what extent is an ethic of caring exhibited? (4) Does the focus group forum itself contribute to developing a campus environment which promotes dialogue on ethical decision making?^ In this study, 26 staff at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Southern Maine participated in three focus group discussions. The participants were grouped according to position level: entry-level, mid-level, and director level. The discussion topics designed for the moderator 2 ̆ 7 s outline included two hypothetical case situations, as well as opportunities to discuss real work situations. Data were gathered from <b>the</b> transcription <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discussions, and analyzed in relation to the research questions. Data specific to research question four were also gathered from responses to a follow-up questionnaire administered one month after the focus group interviews. ^ The findings suggest that ethical considerations do enter into the decision making processes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> student affairs staff. The focus group discussions were shown to be a valuable intervention for a campus. The method can help produce an environment which is conducive to dialogue on important matters and in which considerations of ethics are perceived as valuable. Additional findings suggest that organizational considerations are an important part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision making processes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> student affairs participants. Regularized focus group discussion among student affairs staff can serve to promote such dialogue in the larger campus community, and therefore is an important step towards <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> an appropriate institutional environment for ethical decision making. ...|$|R

Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: [...] "While we did replicate EVP in <b>the</b> weak sense <b>of</b> finding voices on <b>audio</b> <b>tapes,</b> none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phenomena found in our study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence we have failed to replicate EVP in the strong sense." [...] The findings were published in <b>the</b> Journal <b>of</b> Scientific Exploration in 2001, and include a literature review.|$|R
