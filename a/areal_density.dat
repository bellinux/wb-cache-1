25|$|HDD data {{transfer}} rate depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor, which creates more heat. While <b>areal</b> <b>density</b> advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk {{and the number of}} sectors per track, only the latter increases the {{data transfer}} rate for a given rpm. Since {{data transfer rate}} performance tracks only one of the two components of <b>areal</b> <b>density,</b> its performance improves at a lower rate.|$|E
25|$|The rate of <b>areal</b> <b>density</b> {{growth has}} dropped below the {{historical}} Moore's law rate of 40% per year, and the deceleration {{is expected to}} persist through at least 2020. Depending upon assumptions on feasibility and timing of these technologies, the median forecast by industry observers and analysts for 2020 and beyond for <b>areal</b> <b>density</b> growth is 20% per year {{with a range of}} 10–30%. The achievable limit for the HAMR technology in combination with BPR and SMR may be 10Tbit/in2, which would be 20 times higher than the 500Gbit/in2 represented by 2013 production desktop HDDs. As of 2015, HAMR HDDs have been delayed several years, and are expected in 2018. They require a different architecture, with redesigned media and read/write heads, new lasers, and new near-field optical transducers.|$|E

25|$|As {{bit cell}} size decreases, more {{data can be}} put onto a single drive platter. In 2013, a {{production}} desktop 3TB HDD (with four platters) would have had an <b>areal</b> <b>density</b> of about 500Gbit/in2 which would have amounted to a bit cell comprising about 18 magnetic grains (11 by 1.6 grains). Since the mid-2000s <b>areal</b> <b>density</b> progress has increasingly been challenged by a superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size, grain magnetic strength and ability of the head to write. In order to maintain acceptable signal to noise smaller grains are required; smaller grains may self-reverse (electrothermal instability) unless their magnetic strength is increased, but known write head materials are unable to generate a magnetic field sufficient to write the medium. Several new magnetic storage technologies are being developed to overcome or at least abate this trilemma and thereby maintain the competitiveness of HDDs with respect to products such as flash memory-based solid-state drives (SSDs).|$|E

The usage share of HDDs is declining and could drop below 50% in 2018–2019 according to one forecast, because SSDs are replacing smaller-capacity (less than one-terabyte) HDDs in desktop and notebook computers and MP3 players.|$|E

For comparison, this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of Jupiter's moon Europa (although the sail is a flat disc, not a sphere), or the distance between San Francisco and Kansas City. Such a structure would, however, have a mass quite a lot less than many asteroids.
