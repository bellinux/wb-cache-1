40|$|This Diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the issue of nursing care of <b>acute</b> {{abdominal}} <b>pain</b> in children under six years old. The abdominal pain of children can be the first symptom of an <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> which can directly endanger a child´s life. Neglecting these troubles can lead to great health problems of a complicated character. Four research goals were set within the research. The first objective was to find specifics of <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pains</b> of children up to six years old. The second objective was to find possible results of <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pains</b> in children under six years old in the post-operative period. The third goal was to monitor the issue of <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pains</b> in childhood {{from the point of view}} of a nurse and the fourth should have found the knowledge of parents about <b>acute</b> abdomeninal <b>pains</b> in childhood. The Diploma thesis strived to penetrate into the issue of this large chapter of acute medicine, highlight its specifics related to <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pains</b> in childhood and find out how parents are informed about the existence of this type of illness. To complete the objectives of this Diploma thesis, we used a qualitative research model. This research was done by the technique of a semi-structured interview. The first research group consisted of eight nurses working in a standard paediatric ward or in a paediatric ward of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The second group consisted of parents, specifically mothers who responded based on their knowledge and general awareness gained. A technique of open coding a method of pencil and paper was used for processing the results of these interviews. Seven research questions were set: 1. What are the specifics of nursing care in <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> in childhood? 2. What medical complications appear during <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> in childhood? 3. What are the specifics of pre-operative and post-operative care in <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> in childhood? 4. What is the post-operative period in children with <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain?</b> 5. What results can appear in <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> in childhood? 6. How do nurses see the issue of sudden <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> in childhood? 7. What is the parents´ knowledge about <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pains</b> in childhood? Within the process of this Diploma thesis, a booklet was created. This should serve as information material for parents, which will help them to explain various terms and potential situations within this extensive diagnosis. This booklet will be at disposal in day nurseries and the outpatient department of the paediatric ward in České Budějovice...|$|R

5|$|Pain: <b>acute</b> <b>pain</b> {{is mainly}} due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. <b>Acute</b> <b>pain</b> due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E

40|$|Aim: <b>Acute</b> {{abdominal}} <b>pain</b> is a frequently encountered {{complaint of}} children seen in pediatric emergency medical services. Many cases of <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> are benign, but some require rapid {{diagnosis and treatment}} to minimize morbidity. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the role of history, physical examination, laboratory work-up and imaging studies in the diagnosis of <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> in children. Material and Methods: The study population consisted of 200 consecutive children aged 5 - 17 years with <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain.</b> Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic data were recorded in all patients. Results: Common medical causes of <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> include upper respiratory tract infections (eg. acute pharyngitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis) and acute gastroenteritis. Although most children with <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> have self-limited conditions, the pain may herald a surgical or medical emergency (eg, acute appendicitis, acute pyelonephritis, pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Surgical emergencies can be overlooked easily in children. The most common surgical cause of <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> is <b>acute</b> appendicitis. Surgical consultation is necessary if a surgical cause is suspected or the cause is not obvious after a thorough evaluation. The etiology of abdominal pain can be diagnosed through the history and physical examination in most instances. Diaphoresis and vomiting were the most commonly associated symptoms in patients with <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain.</b> Signs of rigidity, marked abdominal tenderness, and rebound abdominal tenderness were more common in acute surgical abdomen than in medical conditions. The laboratory investigations and imaging studies are important in helping to come to a diagnosis. The most common pathologic laboratory finding was leukocytosis. The primary imaging of choice in abdominal emergencies in childhood is a radiograph of the abdomen, followed by ultrasound. Conclusion: The most frequent causes of <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> are <b>acute</b> gastroenteritis and upper respiratory tract infections but acute abdomen, acute pyelonephritis, diabetic ketoacidosis and pneumonia should always be kept in mind so that appropriate medical or surgical intervention can be done without delay...|$|R
5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific <b>acute</b> <b>pain</b> or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up.

5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for <b>acute</b> <b>pain,</b> but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. Low back pain may be classified by duration as <b>acute</b> (<b>pain</b> lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve {{within a few weeks}} from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of pain. For <b>acute</b> <b>pain,</b> low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain. For <b>acute</b> <b>pain</b> that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Shoulder pain is {{a common}} {{presentation}} in general practice. Data on prognosis, treatment and compliance for <b>acute</b> shoulder <b>pain</b> are lacking but would be valuable for guiding decision making. This study collected data on <b>acute</b> shoulder <b>pain</b> and its outcome over 6 months. METHODS A prospective observational study of 100 <b>acute</b> shoulder <b>pain</b> patients from 21 general practices in southeast Queensland. RESULTS Disability levels at presentation were {{the best predictor of}} outcome at 6 months. Patients who had not fully recovered at 6 months had higher risk of depression at presentation. The biggest improvements in pain and disability scores occurred in the first month of management, with almost 60 % of patients fully recovered at 6 months. Over 40 % of patients had at least one radiological investigation for their pain.

The use of radiological investigations may be higher than is clinically necessary. Early multimodal management of <b>acute</b> shoulder <b>pain</b> patients needs consideration. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{diagnostic}} {{value of}} {{helical computerized tomography}} was investigated in this retrospective study evaluating 285 patients. The study was aimed to compare the diagnostic efficiency of unenhanced helical computerized tomography (helical CT), ultrasound examination (US), abdominal plain film and intravenous urography (IVU) {{in the management of}} patients with <b>acute</b> flank <b>pain</b> for the diagnosis of ureteral calculi. Additionally the diagnostic efficiency of helical CT and ultrasound examination in the research of patients with unclear <b>acute</b> diffuse abdominal <b>pain,</b> abdominal pain and fever and abdominal pain because of surgical procedures was assessed. During a period of 3 years 110 patients with <b>acute</b> flank <b>pain</b> were examined with helical CT, US, abdominal plain film and IVU. These patients were defined to be either true positive or negative for ureterolithiasis based on the follow- up data. The other patients with unclear <b>acute</b> diffuse abdominal <b>pain,</b> abdominal pain and fever and abdominal pain because of surgical procedures were examined with helical CT and US. Results: In 50 of 110 patients with <b>acute</b> flank <b>pain</b> was caused by an ureteral calculus. Unenhanced helical CT reaches a distinctively increased diagnostic value (sensitivity 98 %, specifity 98 %) in the evaluation of <b>acute</b> flank <b>pain</b> as compared to US (sensitivity 6 %, specivity 100 %) and conventional radiologic imaging (abdominal plain film- sensitivity 49 %, specifity 92 % and IVU- sensitivity 56 %, Specifity 95 %). In 39 of 58 patients with <b>acute</b> flank <b>pain</b> with no evidence of ureterolithiasis alternative diagnosis could be made by helical CT. In the groups of patients with <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> the detection rate of pathological findings was also higher with helical CT than with US. Conclusion: Unenhanced helical CT is more effective and faster than US, abdominal plain film and IVU in the management of patients with <b>acute</b> flank <b>pain.</b> This non- invasive procedure is to be considered as method of choice for patients with clinically unclear flank pain. Apart from the exact determination of the calculus size and the detection of urinary obstruction this method may allow to diagnose non- urologic causes for <b>acute</b> flank <b>pain</b> within in a few minutes. The higher radiation exposure must be considered as disadvantage of helical CT in comparison with US, abdominal plain film and IVU...|$|R
40|$|Torsion of an epiploic {{appendix}} {{is seldom}} diagnosed preoperatively {{because of the}} difficult differential diagnosis with other diseases causing <b>acute</b> abdominal <b>pain,</b> particularly appendicitis.

5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal in}} the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of <b>acute</b> <b>pain.</b> Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E
