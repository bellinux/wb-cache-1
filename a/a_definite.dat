5|$|The {{class of}} determiners {{is used to}} specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness, where the marks <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> noun and a or an an {{indefinite}} one. <b>A</b> <b>definite</b> noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we discuss some {{properties}} of <b>a</b> positive <b>definite</b> solution of the matrix equation X + A∗X− 2 A = I. Two effective iterative methods for computing <b>a</b> positive <b>definite</b> solution of this equation are proposed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of <b>a</b> positive <b>definite</b> solution are derived. Numerical experiments are executed with these methods...|$|R

This marked <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> break of Christianity from the Judaic tradition. From then on the Roman Julian Calendar, a solar calendar, was given precedence over the lunisolar Hebrew Calendar among the Christian churches of the Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|In {{mid-19th century}} America, the Wesleyan holiness {{movement}} began to teach that entire sanctification was less a process {{and more of}} a state that one entered into by faith at <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> moment in time. This second blessing, as it was commonly called, allowed Christians to be freed from the power of sin. Among adherence of the holiness movement, baptism in the Holy Spirit was synonymous with second blessing sanctification.|$|E

We {{show that}} either E admits <b>a</b> {{positive}} <b>definite</b> 2 -homogeneous polynomial or every 2 -homogeneous polynomial on E has an infinite dimensional subspace on which it is identically zero. Under addition assumptions, we show that such subspaces are non-separable. We examine analogous results for nuclear and absolutely (1, 2) -summing 2 -homogeneous polynomials and give necessary and sufficient conditions on a compact set K so that C(K) admits <b>a</b> positive <b>definite</b> 2 -homogeneous polynomial or <b>a</b> positive <b>definite</b> nuclear 2 -homogeneous polynomial. ...|$|R

Also, we give a relation for the cosine of the angle between two given real matrices.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{in the field of}} linguistics, {{semantics}} to be precise. <b>A</b> class of <b>definite</b> articles exists which behaves differently than the classical account would predict. These definites we call weak definites. This thesis will look at the definites which appear with hyponyms of restaurant. For these words an experiment was set up to determine which words can appear with <b>a</b> weak <b>definite</b> and which with <b>a</b> regular <b>definite.</b> The results from this experiment were then analysed. This analysis was done with two factors in mind which might play a role in determining whether or not a noun can appear with <b>a</b> weak <b>definite.</b> These factors are entrenchment and inclusivity. The results from this analysis were then presented in the conclusions...|$|R

In some orders of insects the cross-veins are so numerous that the whole venational pattern becomes a close network of branching veins and cross-veins. Ordinarily, however, there is <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> number of cross-veins having specific locations. The more constant cross-veins are the humeral cross-vein (h) between costa and subcosta, the radial cross-vein (r) between R and the first fork of Rs, the sectorial cross-vein (s) between the two forks of R8, the median cross-vein (m–m) between M2 and M3, and the mediocubital cross-vein (m-cu) between media and cubitus.|$|E

Nicholls' body was found on 12 December near Levington, naked but not sexually assaulted, and also posed in the cruciform position; <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> cause of death could not be established, but her breathing had been hampered.|$|E
5|$|Character Designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nicolas Marlet {{worked on}} setting {{the design and}} overall look of the {{character}}s. Drawing on various inspirations for the widely known characters, the team of character designers worked on designs that had a more realistic feel than the usual animated characters up to that time. Both character design and art direction worked to set <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> distinction between the symmetrical, more angular look of the Egyptians versus the more organic, natural look of the Hebrews and their related environments. The Backgrounds department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts. Within the film, approximately 934 hand-painted backgrounds were created.|$|E

In {{this note}} we study an analogy between <b>a</b> {{positive}} <b>definite</b> quadratic form for elliptic curves over finite fields and <b>a</b> positive <b>definite</b> quadratic form for elliptic curves over the rational number field.

5|$|Coins are {{the only}} items in the Hoxne Hoard for which <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> date and place of {{manufacture}} can be established. All of the gold coins, {{and many of the}} silver coins, bear the names and portraits of the emperor in whose reign they were minted. Most also retain the original mint marks that identify where they were minted, illustrating the Roman system of regional mints producing coins to a uniform design. The coins' manufacture has been traced back to a total of 14 sources: Trier, Arles and Lyon (in Gaul), Ravenna, Milan, Aquileia, Rome (in modern Italy); Siscia (modern Croatia), Sirmium (modern Serbia), Thessaloniki (Greece), Constantinople, Cyzicus, Nicomedia, and Antioch (modern Turkey).|$|E
5|$|In 1738, the Synod {{moved to}} {{restrict}} itinerant preaching and to tighten educational requirements for ministers, actions the New Side resented. Tensions {{between the two}} sides continued to escalate until the Synod of May 1741, which ended with <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> split between the two factions. The Old Side retained control of the Synod of Philadelphia, and it immediately required unconditional subscription to the Westminster Confession with no option to state scruples. The New Side founded the Synod of New York. The new Synod required subscription to the Westminster Confession in accordance with the Adopting Act, but no college degrees were required for ordination.|$|E
5|$|In Keegan's first season, 1971–72, Liverpool {{missed out}} on winning the League Championship by a single point, the title going to Brian Clough's Derby County. Shankly {{maintained}} that Liverpool were denied <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> penalty in their crucial away match against Derby and then had a good goal disallowed {{towards the end of}} their final match against Arsenal. Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place. Shankly took encouragement from the team's overall form, especially as they made a strong finish to the season, and he was confident of success in 1972–73.|$|E

5|$|Some very fragmentary fossils {{belonging}} to pteranodontian pterosaurs, and possibly Pteranodon itself, {{have also been}} found on the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States.

Some remains from Japan have also been tentatively attributed to Pteranodon, but their distance from its known Western Interior Seaway habitat makes this identification unlikely.|$|E
