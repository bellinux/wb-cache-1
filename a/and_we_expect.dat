By 3 March the source of the outbreak was still unclear but sabotage had been ruled out. A spokesman for the restaurant said [...] "All this leads us to believe that it [...] has not come from the restaurant <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to be given the all clear." [...] On 6 March it was reported that 400 people had stated they had felt unwell after eating at the restaurant.|$|E
500|$|Some bookmakers {{made the}} Yankees a 15-to-1 Series favorite, while others, like New York's top betting commissioners, thought the teams were evenly matched. One New York Times writer found [...] "little {{justification}} for installing either team as the favorite". Regardless of the odds, players from both teams were confident of victory. Hornsby said, [...] "We're {{going to come}} through winners. We have the better pitching staff, the better hitters and the greater experience. That's {{what it takes to}} win. ...

500|$|Varietys Brian Lowry {{called it}} [...] "clever, irreverent, satirical and outfitted" [...] {{but that it}} was [...] "just barely" [...] capable of {{sustaining}} a running time longer than a television episode. Lisa Schwarzbaum praised the voice cast but stated that the [...] "'action' sequences sometimes falter". When comparing the film to the early episodes of the show, Stephen Rowley concluded that the film [...] "has more going for it than the show in its later years, but {{is still a long way}} short of what made it so invigorating". The Monthly critic Luke Davies echoed Lowry's concerns about the length: [...] "everything moves with the whip-crack speed of a half-hour episode. And that's the paradox: it makes the film feel like three episodes strung together. We're in a cinema, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> something epic." [...] He opined that [...] "in the great arc that is the history of The Simpsons, this film will come to be seen as oddity rather than apotheosis." ...|$|E

500|$|The Fraternity Hymn {{was written}} by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. {{when he was a}} {{prospective}} member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, [...] "We know that you play [...] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there {{and come up with a}} hymn. We'll come back in three hours, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> a hymn." [...] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words—for example, [...] "Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below" [...] became [...] "K K Psi, as we go through this wilderness here below." [...] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.|$|E
500|$|In January 2014 the ENO {{announced}} Gardner's departure {{as music}} {{director at the}} end of the 2014–15 season, to be succeeded by Mark Wigglesworth. [...] At the time ENO had accumulated an £800,000 deficit, exacerbated by reductions in public subsidy; The Times commented that the incoming music director had a reputation for [...] "steely, even abrasive determination" [...] and that he would need it. From late 2014 the company went through a further organisational crisis. The chairman, Martyn Rose, resigned after two years in the post, following irreconcilable differences with Berry. Henriette Götz, the company's executive director, who had a series of public disagreements with Berry, resigned soon after. In February 2015, the Arts Council of England announced the unprecedented step of removing ENO from the national portfolio of 670 arts organisations that receive regular funding, and instead offered [...] "special funding arrangements" [...] because of continuing concerns over ENO's business plan and management. The council recognised that the company was [...] "capable of extraordinary artistic work", but [...] "we have serious concerns about their governance and business model <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> them to improve or they could face removal of funding." [...] In March 2015 Cressida Pollock, a management consultant, was named the interim CEO of ENO. [...] In July 2015, Berry resigned as artistic director of ENO.|$|E
500|$|Rumors of {{a multimillion-dollar}} bidding war over Jackson's {{recording}} contract began to circulate in spring 1991. Jet magazine reported: [...] "A recording company has offered {{in excess of}} $50 million to sign superstar Janet Jackson to a recording contract, making the 24-year-old singer/songwriter/dancer/actress the key player {{in one of the}} hottest bidding wars among today's major record companies." [...] Reports indicated that Capitol, Virgin and Atlantic were all bidding for Jackson's contract, as her ties to A would soon expire; by March, she had signed with Virgin. The New York Times declared [...] "Janet Jackson has signed what {{is believed to be the}} most lucrative contract in the history of recording. The 24-year-old singer, songwriter and actress signed an exclusive contract with Virgin Records it was announced yesterday." [...] Her new contract guaranteed a twenty-two percent royalty payment, in addition to her then-historic signing bonus. Chuck Philips of the Los Angeles Times reported that it had been the largest bidding war in recent memory and that [...] "ne reason the bidding was so heavy, various industry observers have noted, was that Jackson-at just 24-is still a relatively fresh face on the pop scene and that her dance-pop style is ideal for today's pop/video climate." [...] In addition, her potential as an international superstar proved to be the primary motivation for the label's investment. Jeff Ayeroff, co-managing director of Virgin in the US stated: [...] "Janet is a world-class artist <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> her growth to be enormous." [...] Chairman Richard Branson spoke with Jackson privately to seal the deal. He commented: [...] "A Rembrandt rarely becomes available... When it does, there are many people who are determined to get it. I was determined." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the Salt Lake Valley, the Mormon pioneers found no {{permanent}} settlement of Indians. Other areas along the Wasatch Range were occupied {{at the time of}} settlement by the Northwestern Shoshone and adjacent areas by other bands of Shoshone such as the Gosiute. The Northwestern Shoshone lived in the valleys on the eastern shore of Great Salt Lake and in adjacent mountain valleys. Some years after arriving in the Salt Lake Valley Mormons, who went on to colonize many other areas of what is now Utah, were petitioned by Indians for recompense for land taken. The response of Heber C. Kimball, first counselor to Brigham Young, was that the land belonged to [...] "our Father in Heaven <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to plow and plant it." [...] The land was treated by the United States as public domain; no aboriginal title by the Northwestern Shoshone was ever recognized by the United States or extinguished by treaty with the United States.|$|E

2500|$|The loss of Adado {{meant that}} it became the third to fall to the {{advancing}} Ethiopian forces, after Bandiradley and Beledweyne. This has left the ICU vulnerable, with Jowhar their furthermost stronghold ( [...] north-east of Mogadishu) after losing vast amounts of territory {{as quickly as they}} had gained several months ago. [...] Unconfirmed reports now say that this is due to a change in strategy by the ICU so as to employ guerilla warfare against the more technologically advanced Ethiopian military. [...] The leader of the Council of Islamic Courts executive body appeared to confirm this: [...] "The war is entering a new phase… we will fight Ethiopia for a long, long time <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> the war to go everyplace." [...] Other Islamic leaders did explicitly threaten guerilla war within Ethiopia, by placing Addis Ababa as a target for suicide bombings.

2500|$|In August 2009, UN {{mediator}} Matthew Nimetz expressed pessimism {{regarding the}} Greek {{response to the}} names he proposed in his July meetings. Nimetz said [...] "Efforts to solve the name issue continue, even though Greece’s answer is not positive". According to the Greek representative, Athens would not accept a proposed formulation that was only intended for use in bilateral relations, and insisted that any name that is decided must be used internationally. In late August, Nimetz met Zoran Jolevski, the ethnic Macedonian negotiator who said that [...] "Macedonia is committed to active participation in the talks over the name <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> a mutually acceptable solution, which will ensure preserving of the identity, dignity and integrity of the Macedonian citizens {{on the basis of}} Euro-Atlantic values and democratic principles."

Near {{the end of the}} game, Perry then assisted on Bobby Ryan's empty-netter as the Ducks won 5–3. In Game 3, Perry recorded another two assists, but the Ducks fell 4–3.
