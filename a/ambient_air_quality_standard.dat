In 2008, Toronto Star listed Ürümqi {{as one of}} the Top Ten worst places to live in the world due to sulphurous pollution. Heavy haze is extremely common in winter, which frequently affects air traffic. Officials believed that severe winter air pollution in Ürümqi is mainly caused by energy-heavy industries and the outdated coal-firing winter heating system. According to a report by Department of Environmental Science and Engineering of Fudan University, the average PM2.5 and TSP concentrations in the winter of 2007 were 12 times higher than USA standard for PM2.5 and 3 times the National <b>Ambient</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Standard</b> of China for TSP. The sulfur dioxide from industrial emissions mixed with the local anthropogenic aerosol with the transported soil dust from outside the city was the main sources of the high concentration of sulfate, one of the main factors causing the heavy air pollution over Ürümqi.|$|E

Seven out of the eleven cities measured (63.6 percent) did not reach the National <b>Ambient</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Standard</b> annual limit of 25 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and all 11 cities measured did not reach the World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline annual limit of 25 μg/m3.

In {{the first six months}} of 2017, Greenpeace Thailand monitored PM2.5 in 14 provinces, as they have done since 2015, and found that every station recorded levels higher than the WHO recommendation of less than 10 milligrams per cubic meter of air. PM2.5 refers to airborne particulates smaller than 2.5 microns, particles so small that they can be inhaled into the blood system and cause cancer and heart disease. Chiang Mai, Tak, Khon Kaen, Bangkok, and Saraburi were among the worst cities with the highest PM2.5 levels in 2017.|$|E
50|$|Awareness of the {{toxicity}} of terrestrial dusts has increased greatly since the original Apollo flights, which occurred circa 1970, {{in which the}} crew members were exposed to lunar dust for a relatively brief time. The first National <b>Ambient</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Standard</b> (NAAQS) was issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1971 and was indexed to total suspended particles (TSP) on a mass per unit volume basis. In 1987, this NAAQS was refined to include only particles that were of less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) because this was the size that was most likely to reach the bronchial tree {{and deeper into the}} lung. Finally, in 1997, the EPA Administrator issued standards for particles that were less than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) based primarily on epidemiological associations of increased mortality, exacerbation of asthma, and increased hospital admissions for cardiopulmonary symptoms. None of these standards specified the composition of the particles. In fact, the last standard was a bit contentious because mechanisms of toxic action were not understood.|$|E
