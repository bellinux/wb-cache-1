500|$|Captured, Pechersky soon {{contracted}} typhus, but {{survived the}} seven-month-long illness. In May 1942, he escaped along {{with four other}} prisoners of war, {{but they were all}} recaptured the same day. He was then sent to a penal camp at Borisov, Belarus, and from there to a prisoners of war (POW) camp located in the forest next to the city of Minsk. During a mandatory medical examination it was discovered that he was circumcised. Pechersky recalled a German medical officer asking him: [...] "Do you admit to being a Jew?" [...] He admitted it, since any denial would result in a whipping, and was thrown into a cellar called [...] "the Jewish grave" [...] along with other Jewish POWs (prisoners of war), where for 10 days he sat in complete darkness, being fed 100grams (3.5oz) of wheat and <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> every second day.|$|E

500|$|The Jet VTOL {{ship from}} Ultramans Science Patrol descends {{out of the}} sky toward Earth, as a school girl, {{carrying}} her randoseru, observes from behind a tree. The Science Patrol offer the girl <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and ask her to deliver it to [...] "DAICON". The girl salutes and races away, but she quickly experiences trouble as Punk Dragon blocks her path. He summons a mecha from Starship Troopers, and it and the girl begin battling. The girl tosses the mecha aside and Gomora rises from the earth. Using a booster concealed in her backpack, the girl flies up into the sky and evades Gomora's blast, with the mecha flying after her. They continue their battle in mid-air. A blow from the mecha sends the girl falling, imperiling her cup of water. At the last moment, she has a vision of the Science Patrol and regains consciousness. She snatches the cup before it crashes to the ground. Resuming her battle with the mecha, she catches one of its missiles and hurls it back at the mecha, causing a huge explosion. The destroyed mecha launches a rocket, summoning Godzilla with the Ideon symbol. With King Ghidorah and Gamera chasing her, the girl flies through the air with her jet-propelled backpack. A Star Destroyer, a TIE fighter, and Martian fighting machines from the film The War of the Worlds (1953) cross the background. Reaching into her backpack, the girl pulls out a bamboo ruler, which magically becomes a lightsaber. After slicing an Alien Baltan in half, the girl launches a number of miniature missiles from her backpack. Hit by one of the missiles, a Maser Tank from the Godzilla series catches fire. The Atragon breaks in two as the Yamato, the USS Enterprise, an X-wing fighter and Daimajin explode in complete chaos. The girl pours her cup of water on a shriveled daikon buried in the ground. As the daikon absorbs the water, it turns into the spaceship Daicon. Bathed in light, and now wearing a naval uniform, the girl boards the ship, where the film's producers, Toshio Okada and Yasuhiro Takeda, sit at the controls. As the landing gear retracts, Daicon departs for {{the far reaches of the}} universe.|$|E

It is also not uncommon for a fourth guest to be involved. Often guests will be given <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> after fighting, ostensibly to [...] "cool off," [...] but inevitably, the guests toss the water at each other, thus resuming the altercation.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace's {{adventure}} {{story is}} told {{from the perspective of}} Judah Ben-Hur. On occasion, the author speaks directly to his readers. Wallace understood that Christians would be skeptical of a fictional story on Christ's life, so he was careful not to offend them in his writing. Ben-Hur [...] "maintains a respect for the underlying principles of Judaism and Christianity". In his memoirs, Wallace wrote:The Christian world would not tolerate a novel with Jesus Christ its hero, and I knew it ... He should not be present as an actor in any scene of my creation. The giving <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to Ben-Hur at the well near Nazareth is the only violation of this rule ... I would be religiously careful that every word He uttered should be a literal quotation from one of His sainted biographers.|$|E
