5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} {{elevated levels of}} pesticides in wax and pollen, but the amounts of pesticides were similar in both failing <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young <b>and</b> <b>healthy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> plants is not possible.|$|E

5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The {{cause of the problem}} was simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode <b>and</b> <b>healthy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fly larvae {{can be used}} as a {{biomedical}} {{tool for}} wound care and treatment. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is the use of blow fly larvae to remove the dead tissue from wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> wound healing. The larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic wounds.|$|E

5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems. In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. Sustainability science {{is the study of}} sustainable development and environmental science.|$|E

Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E

5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly {{reproduce}} HeLa cells {{in a laboratory}} setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, by 1954, Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the polio vaccine. To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory. Additionally, Chester M. Southam, a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> individuals in order to observe if cancer could be transmitted {{as well as to}} examine if one could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent the {{healthcare}} system from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high premiums for the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured. Studies by the CBO, Gruber and Rand Health concluded that a mandate was required. The mandate increased the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs. Experience in New Jersey and Massachusetts offered divergent outcomes.|$|E
