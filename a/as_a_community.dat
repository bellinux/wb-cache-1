5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>community,</b> interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem.

An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
