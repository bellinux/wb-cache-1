40|$|We {{model and}} examine the {{research}} and development (R&D) intensity of <b>a</b> focal <b>industry</b> from <b>an</b> inter-industry network perspective. More specifically, we estimate how <b>a</b> focal <b>industry’s</b> R&D investment is affected by partner (suppliers and customers) industries’ R&D expenditure. We also investigate the impact of the overall economy on the focal industry’s R&D expenditure and finally how <b>a</b> focal <b>industry’s</b> position in the supply chain network moderates the overall economy’s impact on the focal industry’s R&D expenditure. We found that, in general, <b>a</b> focal <b>industry’s</b> R&D intensity is positively associated with its partner industries’ R&D intensity. In addition, <b>an</b> <b>industry’s</b> R&D intensity is positively associated with the growth rate of the overall economy.

40|$|A {{large scale}} {{electricity}} industry {{can be regarded}} as a complex technological system that must address many challenges including adapting to climate change, responding to climate change mitigation policy, operating in an environment where there is increased global competition for primary energy resources and addressing the issue of interconnections to other electricity industries. The operation of <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry</b> must account for not only the connection and subsequent operation of physical components and systems but also the uncertain consequences of human decision-making. This thesis adopts an industry-level approach to defining, analysing and organising formal decision-making processes in <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry,</b> leading to the concept of a decision-making framework for <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry.</b> The approach also identifies the importance of reconciling the different decision-making methodologies and different decision-making styles associated with different disciplines that influence the operation and evolution of <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry.</b> In this way, the uncertain consequences of decision-making within <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry</b> can be narrowed to those outcomes that society deems acceptable. The industry-level approach is sufficiently generic to be applied to a number of specific and diverse case studies that focus on short-term operational issues in <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry.</b> Among others, the case studies include the integration of non-storable stochastic primary energy resources into <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry,</b> <b>a</b> security envelope to protect <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry</b> against frequency collapse following separation contingencies and the interface between a security decision-making regime and a commercial decision-making regime in <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry.</b> The application of the industry-level approach in the case studies demonstrates the importance of designing interfaces and specifying boundaries between formal decision-making processes that constrain, inform and coordinate different sets of decisions-makers in <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry.</b> The thesis concludes that developing and applying a coherent decision-making framework for <b>an</b> electricity <b>industry</b> provides <b>an</b> appropriate balance between <b>industry</b> robustness against <b>a</b> wide range of uncertainties and flexibility to address new challenges as they arise...|$|R

5|$|As {{the second}} English {{football}} club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, {{with which it}} further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success {{in that part of}} the world.|$|E
