5|$|Given a {{set with}} <b>an</b> <b>addition</b> operation, one cannot always define a {{corresponding}} subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines <b>an</b> <b>addition</b> operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group {{can be described as}} a set that is closed under subtraction.|$|E

40|$|Adsorption {{of arsenic}} onto soil was {{investigated}} {{as a means}} of understanding arsenic-induced release of phosphate. In batch adsorption experiments As adsorption was accompanied by P desorption. At low <b>As</b> <b>additions,</b> the ratio <b>As</b> adsorbed: P desorbed remained constant. At higher <b>As</b> <b>additions,</b> P desorption reached a maximum while As adsorption continued to increase. The P desorption maximum coincided with an increase in pH. Barley plants were grown on soils spiked with arsenate (0 - 360 mg As kg(- 1)) to investigate the effect on plant growth and P uptake. As arsenic concentration increased, above ground plant yield decreased and the plants showed symptoms typical of As toxicity and P deficiency. At low <b>As</b> <b>additions</b> to the soil, uptake of As and P by barley increased. At higher <b>As</b> <b>additions</b> P uptake decreased. It is argued that this was due to the change in As:P ratio in the soil solution. It is concluded that input of arsenic to the soil could mobilise phosphate. Crop yield is likely to be affected, either due to reduced phosphate availability at low arsenic additions or arsenic toxicity at higher additions...|$|R

40|$|Fertilization {{has become}} one of the {{essential}} measures for enhancing efficiency of phytoremediating contaminated soils with heavy metal. In order to screen optimal P fertilizer for As-phytoremediation, a greenhouse study was conducted on the growth, As-accumulation and uptake of N, P and K by Pteris vittata L. in As-contaminated soils with different forms of P fertilizers. The results indicated that the biomass of plant with <b>As</b> <b>addition</b> decreased compared to no As-addition treatments except fused calcium magnesium phosphate (CaMg-P) treatment. The plants in <b>As</b> <b>addition</b> soils with CaMg-P, calcium dihydrogen phosphate (CDP) and di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) had higher biomass than those with other P fertilizer and control (0. 83 g/pot). The As accumulations of plant aboveground in <b>As</b> <b>addition</b> soils are in order of CDP > CaMg-P > DAP > Potassium Phosphate Monobasic > Monosodium phosphate > control very much greater than Calcium superphosphate. The efficiency of As removal from <b>As</b> <b>addition</b> soils with CDP was the highest, 7. 28 %. Thus it can be seen the ability of phytoremediation using P. vittata could be improved by P fertilization, which CDP should be recommended preferentially and CaMg-P and DAP is considered as replaceable fertilizer for sake of pH, N, P and available As in phytoremediated soils...|$|R
5|$|Another {{manner in}} which the proofs might be {{undermined}} is if 1−0.999... simply does not exist, because subtraction is not always possible.

5|$|Many {{changes were}} made in 1960 to the routing of US10. A new freeway opened for I-75/US10/US23 between M-13 {{northeast}} of Saginaw and the M-20 freeway in Bay City. US10 replaced the M-20 designation on the freeway between Midland and Bay City. M-47 replaced US10 between Midland and Saginaw, and M-81 replaced US10 {{in the city of}} Saginaw. <b>An</b> <b>addition</b> segment of US10 between Saginaw and Bridgeport was renumbered BLI-75.

40|$|A {{glasshouse}} {{pot experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization by Glomus mosseae BEG 167 on the yield and arsenate uptake of tomato plants in soil experimentally contaminated with five As levels (0, 25, 50, 75 and 150 mg kg(- 1)). Mycorrhizal colonization (50 - 70 % of root length) was little affected by As application and declined only in soil amended with 150 mg As kg(- 1). Mycorrhizal colonization increased plant biomass at As application rates of 25, 50 and 75 mg kg(- 1). Shoot As concentration increased with increasing <b>As</b> <b>addition</b> up to 50 mg kg(- 1) but decreased with mycorrhizal colonization at <b>As</b> <b>addition</b> rates of 75 and 150 mg kg(- 1). Shoot As uptake increased with mycorrhizal colonization at most <b>As</b> <b>addition</b> levels studied, but tended to decrease with addition of 150 mg As kg(- 1). Total P uptake by mycorrhizal plants was elevated at As rates of 25, 50 and 75 mg kg(- 1), and more P was allocated {{to the roots of}} mycorrhizal plants. Mycorrhizal plants had higher shoot and root P/As ratios at higher As application rates than did non-mycorrhizal controls. The soil of inoculated treatments had higher available As than uninoculated controls, and higher pH values at <b>As</b> <b>addition</b> levels of 25, 50 and 75 mg kg(- 1). Mycorrhizal colonization may have increased plant resistance to potential As toxicity at the highest level of As contamination studied. Mycorrhizal tomato plants may have potential for phytoextraction of As from moderately contaminated soils or phytostabilization of more highly polluted sites. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
