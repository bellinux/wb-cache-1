40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} the planning <b>and</b> <b>interviewing</b> practices of police recruits engaging in investigative interviews with witnesses. The study analyses how {{the content of}} plans <b>and</b> <b>interviews</b> prepared by 23 police recruits changes on four occasions during their training at the Western Australia Police Academy, and {{whether there is a}} relationship between the content of plans <b>and</b> <b>interviews.</b> On each occasion, undergraduate students acted as witnesses, watching a short film depicting a mock crime before being interviewed by one of the recruits. To facilitate analysis, the items in plans and the questions <b>and</b> statements in <b>interviews</b> were coded according to what aspect of the PEACE model of interviewing they related (e. g., Engage and explain, Account, clarification and challenge [Account] or Closure). The findings show that recruits emphasise the Account stage in their plans <b>and</b> <b>interviews</b> while neglecting the Engage and explain and Closure stages of the model. Further, findings show an association between the content of plans <b>and</b> <b>interviews,</b> particularly with regard to the Engage and explain stage of the model. Encouragingly, recruits were found to increase the proportion of items relating to the Closure stage in plans <b>and</b> <b>interviews</b> following training. Implications of the findings are discussed with particular regard to their application in training recruits...|$|R
