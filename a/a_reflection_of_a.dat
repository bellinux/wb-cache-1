5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an impetus {{for the application of}} the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may {{have been one of the}} early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E

25|$|Scholz regards this preoccupation as <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{belief in}} a divine will and control of history. Many of the worse omens also {{parallel}} growing dissatisfaction with Louis the Pious, which immediately {{after the end of}} the annals spilled into civil war between him and his sons. Divine intervention through the relics of saints play an important role as well, with mention of Hilduin’s translation of the relics of St. Sebastian to the Abbey of St. Medard, and Einhard’s transport of the relics of SS. Marcellinus and Peter into Francia.|$|E
25|$|Like his {{predecessor}} Pius XII, Paul VI put {{much emphasis on}} the dialogue with all {{nations of the world}} through establishing diplomatic relations. The number of foreign embassies accredited to the Vatican doubled during his pontificate. This was <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new understanding between Church and State, which had been formulated first by Pius XI and Pius XII but decreed by Vatican II. The pastoral constitution Gaudium et spes stated that the Catholic Church is not bound to any form of government and willing to cooperate with all forms. The Church maintained its right to select bishops on its own without any interference by the State.|$|E
25|$|In the 1580s, Pilon {{began work}} on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb of Catherine de' Medici and Henry II at the {{basilica}} of Saint Denis. Among these, the fragmentary Resurrection, now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel. This work owes a clear debt to Michelangelo, who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the Medici chapels in Florence. Pilon openly depicted extreme emotion in his work, sometimes {{to the point of}} the grotesque.

500|$|Scrooge {{could also}} be based on two misers: the {{eccentric}} John Elwes, MP, or Jemmy Wood, {{the owner of the}} Gloucester Old Bank who was also known as [...] "The Gloucester Miser". According to the sociologist Frank W. Elwell, Scrooge's views on the poor are a reflection of those of the demographer and political economist Thomas Malthus, while the miser's questions [...] "Are there no prisons?... And the Union workhouses?... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?"

500|$|A {{large amount}} of {{critical}} debate also surrounds the poem {{as it relates to}} the bi-cultural political landscape of the time. Some argue that Bertilak is an example of the hybrid Anglo-Welsh culture found on the Welsh–English border. They therefore view the poem as <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hybrid culture that plays strong cultures off one another to create a new set of cultural rules and traditions. Other scholars, however, argue that historically much Welsh blood was shed well into the 14th century, creating a situation far removed from the more friendly hybridisation suggested by Ingham. To support this argument further, it is suggested that the poem creates an [...] "us versus them" [...] scenario contrasting the knowledgeable civilised English with the uncivilised borderlands that are home to Bertilak and the other monsters that Gawain encounters.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} intense debates within the Indian women's {{movements}} {{about the relationship}} between Western and Indian feminisms. [...] Many Indian feminists simultaneously claim a specific [...] "Indian" [...] sensitivity as well as an international feminist solidarity with groups and individuals worldwide. The rise of liberal feminism in the West in the 1970s focused deeply on demands for equal opportunities in education and employment, as well as ending violence against women. [...] To a large extent, the emerging feminist movement in India was influenced by Western ideals. These called for education and equal rights, but also adapted their appeals to local issues and concerns, such as dowry-related violence against women, Sati, sex selective abortion and custodial rape. [...] Some Indian feminists have suggested that these issues are not specifically [...] "Indian" [...] in nature but rather <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wider trend of patriarchal oppression of women.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{identified}} {{elements within}} the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within The Adventures of Tintin. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac's jewels reflected Hergé's use of jewellery as a theme throughout the series, and that the scene in which Tintin commands the sun god to do his bidding reflects a wider theme throughout the series in which [...] "sacred authority" [...] manifests through voice. The scene in which Haddock causes an avalanche of snow by sneezing reflected what McCarthy considered a wider theme {{of the danger of}} sound, while Zorrino's decision to stay among the Inca was interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wider theme of adoption. Commenting on the execution scene, McCarthy believed that it represented Haddock being [...] "sacrificed on the altar of his own illegitimacy", a concept that he felt had been echoed throughout the series.|$|E
500|$|Her fourth {{book in the}} series, Journey to a Woman, {{published}} in 1960, again shows parallels between Bannon's own life and her plots. Beth, of Laura's affair in Odd Girl Out, is living {{with her husband and}} children in Southern California. She tries to find Laura again nine years after college, and escapes a deranged woman who has a fixation on her, <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relationship Bannon had with a beautiful, but [...] "very bewildered and unstable person." [...] Beth writes to an author of lesbian books in New York, and goes to meet her in hope of finding Laura. They have a brief relationship, after which Beth finds Laura married to Jack and with a child, then discovers Beebo as well. A fifth book, The Marriage, also {{published in}} 1960, again addresses issues of love outside the realm of socially acceptable relationships, although it is not primarily about homosexuality. In it, Jack and Laura are friends with a young married couple who discover they are brother and sister, and must decide whether they will stay together or conform to societal standards.|$|E

500|$|DVD Talk's John Sinnott {{rated the}} first series {{four and a}} half out of five stars, writing that it [...] "keeps a lot of the charm and {{excitement}} of the original (as well as the premise), while making the series easily accessible for new viewers". Sinnott praised the faster pace and the design changes that made it feel [...] "fresh", as well as Eccleston's Doctor. However, he felt that Piper only did a [...] "credible" [...] job as Eccleston eclipsed her, and said that the writing was [...] "uneven" [...] with many of the episodes [...] "just slightly flawed". Looking back on the series in 2011, Stephen Kelly of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Eccleston's Doctor may have had many faults– looking like an EastEnders extra and bellowing [...] "FANTASTIC!" [...] at every opportunity being two of them– but he was merely <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> show that, at the time, still didn't know what it wanted to be. The first series of the revived Doctor Who– which featured farting aliens– was a world away from the intelligent, populist science-fiction we know it as now. But then, it is thanks to Eccleston that it got this far at all– a big, respectable name who laid the foundations for Tennant to swag away with the show." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stephanie Barczewski {{notes the}} {{contrast}} between the approaches taken by the American and British inquiries. The British inquiry was much more technical, [...] "the more learned and erudite of the two", while the American inquiry's report was <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comparatively poorly managed inquiry that had frequently allowed itself to get sidetracked. However, the American report took a much more robust stance on the failures that had led to the disaster. As Barczewski puts it, it [...] "bristles with criticisms of established seafaring traditions and of the conduct of the Titanics builders, owners, officers and crew", and conveys [...] "righteous indignation" [...] and a [...] "passion to right the wrongs" [...] done to the victims of the disaster and to prevent any recurrence. The authors of the two reports took markedly different interpretations of how the disaster had come about. The American report castigated the arrogance and complacency that had led to the disaster and held Captain Smith, the shipping industry and the Board of Trade culpable for their failures. The British report emphasized that [...] "the importance of this Enquiry {{has to do with the}} future. No Enquiry can repair the past." ...|$|E
