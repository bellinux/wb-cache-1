40|$|The {{development}} of e-learning has progressed to a stage {{where it is}} becoming part of mainstream provision in higher education. Therefore the issue of assessing and sustaining the quality of e-learning must now come to the fore. Quality assessment in higher education is well-established in relation to learning and teaching generally, but what methods {{can be used to}} establish quality in the domain of e-learning? The E-xcellence methodology for assessing quality in e-learning (EADTU 2009) is securing recognition by European and international learning organisations. It was designed to be applied to the design and delivery of e-learning in both distance learning and blended learning contexts. It supports a range of uses, from accreditation by external agencies to process improvement through internal review. The methodology presents principles of good practice in six domains of e-learning: strategic management; curriculum design; course design; course delivery; student support; and staff support. A total of 33 benchmark statements cover these domains, and are supported by a handbook for practitioners and guidance for assessors. The handbook includes principles for quality e-learning and exemplars of good practice. Amongst the tools is an online ‘QuickScan’ self-evaluation questionnaire based on the E-xcellence benchmarks which is highly valued as a focus for collaborative review of e-learning programmes. The e-learning landscape has changed since the E-xcellence methodology was first developed. In particular, the use of Open Education Resources (OECD 2007) and the application of social networking tools (Mason & Rennie 2008) were not explicitly considered in the original benchmarks. Accordingly, the E-xcellence NEXT project was instigated to produce and evaluate a revision of the benchmark criteria, associated handbook and exemplars. This paper describes the project process and initial recommendations. A consultation exercise was carried out among E-xcellence participants. Feedback from this was brought to participatory workshops at a European Seminar on QA in e-learning in June 2011. Following this exercise, the benchmark statements were revised and are now available in beta version. The project resources (Quickscan and manual) are being used for a series of self-evaluation and <b>assessment</b> <b>seminars</b> held at European higher education institutions. Feedback from these <b>assessment</b> <b>seminars</b> will be used to finalise materials for publication late in 2012. At that point the E-xcellence Next project will offer to the higher education community a set of self-evaluation and quality assessment tools which are fully updated to encompass social networking, Open Educational Resources and other recent developments in e-learning.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is based on}} international teacher students` experiences of a learning assessment on environmental and sustainability challenges. In Teaching for sustainability (15 credits, [URL]), a course offered once a year by Malmö University, the perspective is learner oriented with a holistic approach on education and sustainability. The heterogeneous group of students {{has a variety of}} knowledge on sustainability issues, different experiences of learning activities and examination forms. Consequently, a common platform for progression of knowledge formation among the students is needed. One of the first learning activities is to read World on the Edge (Brown, 2011) and to formulate three questions on environmental and sustainability challenges that the student considers important. Prior to the first out of three assessments in the course, the lecturer selects one question per student and during the <b>assessment</b> <b>seminar</b> the student directs the discussion of the selected question among a group of 5 - 7 students. During the seminar, the students share their thoughts, experiences and knowledge for meaning-making through discussions. The learning outcome {{is to be able to}} describe what effect humans have upon their environment. Students are graded “Passed with distinction”, “Passed” or “Fail”, whereas the full course has a six-pointed grading system (Passed with distinction; A-B, Passed; C-E, Failed; F). Our aim of the research study is to investigate how heterogeneous groups of teacher students experiences a student-driven, non-traditional learning assessment, their learning process and meaning-making within environmental and sustainability education. Qualitative group interviews, semi-structural questions, and analysis were carried out through a phenomenographic approach. Focus was on previous experiences of assessments, ways of reading the book and formulating questions, expectations and reflections, and learning processes for meaning-making. The interviews with the international teacher students (n= 41) in 2012 and 2014 were recorded, transcribed and thematically categorised. To many students the assessment was a new learning experience. While reading the book students were mainly concentrating on bigger concepts. A few students were afraid and nervous as they were unfamiliar with planning and taking responsibility for a discussion. However, the participatory and collaborative learning assessment with sharing of experiences among the students resulted in a rewarding meaning-making process. After the assessment students continued to reflect and talk about the questions raised. According to them, it generated a deep learning opportunity compared to written examination. A tentative result shows some categories of the students’ experiences of meaning-making: developing critical thinking, focusing on learning and understanding, learning by collaboration, seeing a bigger picture, and taking responsibility in learning for understanding. When students share their knowledge and experiences of global environmental and sustainability challenges, sustainability literacy for understanding seems to develop. The students describe their learning processes as on-going after closing the seminar...|$|E

In specific terms, college tutors routinely deviate from criteria of assessment as indicated on schedules of assessment, privileging factors entirely irrelevant to teaching effectiveness. It also came to light that inexperienced tutors tend to be particularly prone to bias when assessing teaching practice. The study recommended team assessment whereby more experienced tutors work with their less experienced counterparts as a way of mitigating bias in assessment of teaching practice.

The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate the caregivers’ knowledge of vaccination, and to assess effectiveness of a health education seminar for improving caregivers’ {{knowledge on}} immunization. Methods: pre- and post-assessment design was adopted for a single group {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the health education seminar on vaccination. The seminar consisted of a lecture using simple understandable language. Improvements in total knowledge score before and after the seminar were assessed using a validated questionnaire that included ten questions. Description analysis and non-parametric tests were applied to evaluate and compare the vaccination knowledge level before and after the seminar. Results: 378 caregivers participated in this study. The majority were mothers. Of the ten questions, the correct response rates had significantly increased for nine questions after the education seminar. The mean total score of the <b>assessment</b> before the <b>seminar</b> was 5. 2 ± 1. 2 while that was 8. 4 ± 0. 9 for the <b>assessment</b> after the <b>seminar,</b> with a significant increase of 3. 18 points.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies of the reliability of peer assessment has been inferred by comparing marks from peer raters with those obtained from teachers. These approaches, whether employing correlation analysis or mark differences, are based on an implicit assumption that the teacher marks represent the benchmark or 'gold standard' by which the reliability or accuracy of peer scores can be gauged. This paper reports the outcomes of teacher and peer assessments of 119 final year engineering students' oral presentation skills within a fourth year Communication subject in 1996.

40|$|Seminar {{learning}} Veterinarians nowadays need to {{be equipped}} with knowledge and skills such as critical scientific thinking, analysing information, problem solving, and making decisions. Development of these skills demands other instructional methods than the traditional ‘transmission of knowledge’ through lecturing. Based on the socio-constructivist theory of learning, health sciences curricula have introduced active group-learning methods. A commonly used activating group learning method is the seminar, the central topic of this thesis. A seminar is defined as: “a learning session facilitated by a content expert during which a group of some 25 students discusses questions and issues emerging from assigned readings, with the underlying idea being that students learn through confrontation with problems of practical relevance. ” In this thesis we intend to develop {{a greater understanding of}} seminar learning by answering the general research question: “How do students, teachers and context contribute to the effectiveness of seminar learning in a hybrid veterinary curriculum?” Five specific research questions are investigated to address this general question: 1. Which aspects influence seminar learning according to students? 2. Which aspects influence seminar learning according to teachers? 3. What are the relations between factors that relate to seminar learning? 4. How do factors that relate to seminar learning predict students’ academic achievement? 5. How do factors that influence seminar learning explain the teaching performance in seminars? To be able to answer these questions a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was used. Focus group studies with students and teachers demonstrated diverse aspects that affect seminar learning according to these stakeholders: seminar teacher, student, seminar goals and questions, facilitating methods used within the seminar, group functioning, preparation, facilities, course schedule and alignment, and assessment. These key aspects contain sub-aspects, such as the amount and type of seminar questions, group size, atmosphere, interaction and amount and clarity of preparatory materials. Through questionnaire studies, using statistical methods like principal factor analysis, reliability analysis and multi-level regression analysis, the relationships between abovementioned aspects and their effect on teaching performance and end-of-course exams were investigated. 988 questionnaires on 80 seminar groups with 36 teachers in six different courses in a veterinary curriculum were analysed. Results showed that relationships between the abovementioned aspects are rather complex. ‘Group interaction’ in seminars had a firm positive relationship with ‘teaching performance’, indicating that students relate good teaching performance with the ability for group interaction. Correlations between the factors ‘extent of student’s preparation’ on one hand and ‘group interaction’, ‘seminar content’ and ‘teaching performance’ on the other hand were small and not statistically significant. The effect of ‘group size’ on ‘teaching performance’ was small and negative. It appeared that abovementioned factors could not sufficiently predict end-of-course exam scores. This calls for further investigation of the relation between the objectives of <b>seminar</b> learning and <b>assessment</b> of <b>seminar</b> learning. This thesis ends with practical strategies on how to ensure that seminars can be used to their full advantage, e. g. by clarifying and training the underlying philosophy of seminar learning to teachers and students...|$|R
40|$|Without a {{sense of}} {{adventure}} and an awareness that we all - students, teachers and educational developers - are on an endless journey of discovery, the good learning assessment (Sonesson & Nordén, 2015) or the good teaching does not take place. At {{the beginning of their}} teaching careers Prosser & Trigwell (2001) thought, as well as many teachers in science do, that the essence of good teaching was about to get knowledge in a scientifically correct manner and develop their teaching skills in presenting subject knowledge for the students. As teachers, they searched reliable ways to measure student learning, rather than trying to find valuable indications of the students´ understanding. No attempt was made to help students see how the topic they introduced related to the students´ previous subject studies. They did not about to sensitize students about their preconceptions or previous experiences, which might be needed again (Prosser & Trigwell, 2001). In-depth learning (with a deep learning approach) the learner searches meaningfulness and want to understand the behind-lying ideas (Marton & Booth, 1997). Enthusiastically and curiously integrating and relating the learning in a strategic manner to all the individual experiences, besides theorizing and being fully aware of that the words just are carriers of meanings. The meaning of the arguments is focused. On the contrary, with surface learning approaches, the learner focuses - without any reflection on the purpose or strategy of life-long learning - on the least possible effort to root memorize information (Tsui, 2004) only for the knowledge exam without any thought of enhanced meaning-making or understanding (Lundström et al, 2016). The focus is then on the text, formulas or words, actual data and they represent purely symbolically knowledge formation (Prosser & Trigwell, 2001). Anderberg (1999) argues that the expression of intent is of great importance regarding the student´s opportunities to develop meaningful theoretical conclusions and deep learning approaches. Thereby, the importance of experienced knowledge formation situations is emphasized. By activating students' experiences of word meanings and understanding, as during an assessing literature seminar, promotes access to their prior knowledge and could develop extended learning processes and deeper understanding within in higher education. Thus, for their upcoming teaching they are offered new opportunities heading for deep learning approaches based on the theoretical part (Anderberg, 1999). Teacher education is of particular importance for developing competences and knowledge capabilities (Nordén, 2016) required for societal changes towards sustainability (Mochizuki & Yarime, 2016; UE 4 SD, 2015; Wals 2014; Rauch & Steiner 2013). This research is based on international teacher students´ learning experiences. In the campus course Teaching for sustainability (15 credits) at Malmö university,the perspective is learner focused with a holistic approach on education of the environmental and sustainability challenges in local-global contexts (Avery & Nordén, 2017). The heterogeneous group of students has a variety of knowledge on sustainability issues, different experiences of learning activities and examination forms, since attending the course in Sweden from different continents, cultures and countries worldwide. Consequently, a common foundation for further progression of knowledge formation among the students is valuable to achieve at the course start. One initial learning activity is to read World on the Edge (Brown, 2011) and thereafter construct three questions on environmental and sustainability challenges that the student considers urgent and of particular interest. These questions are sent to the lecturer, who chooses one question from each student. The student that raised it prepares and directs a discussion in the teacher student group with 5 - 7 students in a student-driven literature seminar. The student thereby introduces the topic, has the responsibility for actively chairing the discussion through the seminar, and sums up the shared thoughts, opinions and knowledge for meaning-making afterwards. Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources Used The learning outcome is that the student will be able to describe what effect humans have upon their environment, actively discuss the scope of environmental problems and challenges in sustainable development in the participants´ respective home country and worldwide. The aim of this research is to investigate how heterogeneous groups of teacher students experience a student-driven, non-traditional literature <b>seminar</b> for learning <b>assessment</b> purposes within the extended learning process in higher education, and offered for meaning-making within environmental and sustainability learning and teaching (Anderberg, Nordén & Hansson, 2009; Lundström et al, 2016). Qualitative group interviews with semi-structural questions and analysis were conducted by a phenomenographic approach. Previous experiences of assessments, ways of reading the course literature and formulating questions, expectations and reflections, and student-centered learning processes were focused. The group interviews with the international teacher students (n= 63) in 2012, 2014 and 2016 took place in 11 group meetings. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically categorised from the reflected experiences made visible through the analysis of the qualitative data gathered. (P. M. This is work in progress and when analysis has been carried out more details will be avilable, which could be presented if accepted for the ECER 2017 [...] .) Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or Findings The analysis of the <b>assessment</b> <b>seminars</b> suggests that for many students this form of assessment was a new learning experience. While reading the book students were mainly concentrating on bigger concepts. A few students were afraid as they were unfamiliar with planning and taking responsibility for a discussion. However, the participatory and collaborative learning assessment with sharing of experiences among the students resulted in a rewarding challenge based learning process. After the assessment students continued to reflect and talk about the questions raised. According to them, it generated a deep learning opportunity compared to written examination. This meant that they had {{a deeper understanding of the}} questions at hand, and they could draw on richer contextualised resources from their own experience to develop school oriented subject matters through the discussion. A tentative result shows some categories of the students’ experiences of meaning-making: developing critical thinking, focusing on learning and understanding, learning by collaboration, seeing a bigger picture, and taking responsibility in learning for understanding. Besides assessing the learning outcome, the learning needs are identified through the learning activity to be promoted for continued learning in the course. When students share their knowledge and experiences of global environmental and sustainability challenges, extended learning processes for sustainability enhanced literacy seems to develop. The students describe their learning processes as consistent and progressively on-going also after the closing of the seminar (Sonesson & Nordén, 2015) ...|$|R

All participants expressed a desire to continue the exchange of information and discussion of ongoing work. There was positive and enthusiastic support for the need to develop better mechanisms for collaborating in research and in establishing co-ordination of activities in this area. The agreed conclusions of the seminar were: 1. There is an urgent need to develop a national framework for ecological risk management and protocols for undertaking the various assessment stages within the framework. 2. An ecological database should be made a high priority by all the agencies. 3. A national communication network should be established as soon as possible to allow information exchange and co-ordination of activities. Tom Beer undertook to see if the CSIRO network system could be made available to a wider range of agencies. In the medium to longer term, there was considered to be great value in establishing a national co-ordination centre for ecological risk, which would be separately but jointly funded by the agencies and industry. 4. In the short term, a list of capabilities among the agencies should be established. This should also indicate contact people for the various topics. 5. A National Case Study was considered to be important in giving focus to the development of methods and in allowing collaboration on a well-defined project. 6.

However, many if not most other aspects of the regional outlook were considered far more problematic.

All of these factors were seen as sources of continuing debate, differences, and even of possible conflict in the region. Another major theme at the Seminar was the absence or weakness of international and regional institutions capable of dealing with the many issue areas identified. An increasing level of peacekeeping and peace-restoring activities by the international community was noted, particularly under the auspices of the United Nations. A major new area of interest is the rising emphasis on the "right" of the international community to conduct "humanitarian interventions" where fundamental human rights are being endangered even as a result of internal conflicts within states. Nevertheless, the general <b>assessment</b> of the <b>Seminar</b> was that international institutions, procedures, and norms for dealing with conflict still face serious obstacles and lag far behind the challenges posed in today's world, challenges that seem bound to become even more complex in the future. In the absence of an effective international framework to deal with issues of global order, the lack of strong regional institutions in the Asia Pacific has even more serious potential consequences...|$|R
