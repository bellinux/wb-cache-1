Suetonius treats the religious beliefs of Augustus long because he regards them as very important. Augustus wanted to enhance the sacred character of his principate, therefore he acquired membership in several priesthoods. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. 21 α-hydroxylase {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} frequent cause of virilization in patients with female karyotype due to exposure of a female fetus to excess of androgen. We report anatomical and cosmetic results of feminizing genital reconstruction of two related patients (second cousin) with XX karyotype born with urogenital sinus anomalies (UGS) and not treated at birth. Materials and Metods. Patient 1 is 6 -years old with ambiguous genitalia graded as Prader V and never undergone therapy or surgery. Patient 2 is 10 -years old, graded as Prader IV and subjected to hormonal therapy and clitoral amputation {{at the age of}} 6. Mobilization of urogenital sinus, pull-through of vagina and tubulization of urethra was performed in both after placement of Foley chateters in vagina and bladder by cisto-vaginoscopy. Genitoplasty involved refashioning the tissues to create minora and majora labia and, after removal of corpora, partial clitorectomy was carried in patient 1 and clitoridal reconstruction in patient 2. Result. Vaginal introitus was positioned in the vestibule region below urethral meatus. Foley chateters was removed after two weeks in narcosis and the cosmetic and anatomic result was good. Conclusion. Goals of feminizing genitoplasty are to restore, soon as possible, anatomy achieving a more feminine <b>appareance</b> with a vagina for menstruation, to preserve reproductive capacity and to prevent urological sequelae but it’s also important to contribute in a development of a more stable gender identity. This procedure in two stage, based on an accurate diagnosis, is good to create feminine genital <b>appareance</b> in children with female pseudohermaphroditism expecially if not treated at birth...|$|E

It {{is an attempt}} to give a contribution to a new interesting research area in image processing, which tries to boost image segmentation combining information about <b>appareance</b> (e. g. color) and information about spatial arrangement. The proposed algorithm firstly partition the image into small subsets of pixels, in order to reduce computational complexity of the subsequent phases. Two different distance measures between each pair of pixels subsets are then computed, one regarding color information and one based on spatial-geometric information. A similarity measure between each pair of pixel subset is then computed, exploiting both color and spatial data. Finally, pixels subsets are modeled into an evolutionary game in order to group similar pixels into meaningful segments. After a brief review of image segmentation approaches, the proposed algorithm is described and different experimental tests are carried up to evaluate its segmentation performanc...|$|E
40|$|Perfectivity {{is often}} assumed to entail the {{completion}} of the event described by event-denoting stems and their arguments. Although some scholars have noted that perfective markers do not always entail completion, their formal definitions contradict their informal descriptions. We show that these traditional models of perfective aspect cannot account for the aspectual system of Thai. In Thai, perfective markers do not entail that the event was completed: the resulting state of sentences that are in <b>appareance</b> telic in their 'inner aspect' need not have been reached. We call these non-completive perfective markers semi-perfectives. We propose a formal model of semi-perfectivity within Discourse Representa-tion Theory that relies on the inclusion of an imperfective operator in the lexical meaning of Thai accomplishment verbs as well as the notion of maximal event relative to an event description. We show that this latter notion is strictly weaker than the traditional notion of telicity, thus demonstrating that (a) telicity is not the sole property of event descriptions relevant to the semantics of grammatical aspect.

40|$|L. cordatum (L.) Mill. is a Ligurian {{endemism}} of the Northern Mediterranean area. Human use od {{the coast}} and seaside resorts has modified the areas where this plant has its habitat. Reviews of the literature and field investigations have enabled a progressive decrease in the population and {{in the number of}} specimens in the areas occupied by the species to be measured. Micropropagation tests pointed out the possibility of ex situ multiplication activities. The use of eplants from the basan part of the inflorescence stems was very successful in obtaining many new vegetative buds producing shoots with a normal <b>appareance</b> and development. In L. cordatum, low BA concentrations increase the rate of production of new shoot but had an inhibitory effect on rooting; on the contrary, the addition of auxin to the medium leads to increased root formation but inhibits shoot development.

Se tiene en cuenta que es un trastorno que se presenta habitualmente en adolescentes sin obesidad acusada, sólo con un discreto sobrepeso. Estudios realizados muestran significativa relación entre los síntomas y el funcionamiento interpersonal de los adolescentes anoréxicos, pues estos tienden al aislamiento o buscan la compañía de muchachos más jóvenes. También son características de este cuadro los trastornos obsesivos-compulsivos que se relacionan o no con la comida. La restricción dietética conlleva a cambios biológicos y físicos importantes, y se destaca la alteración del sistema hipotalámico y endocrino, que da lugar a la aparición de signos y síntomas como la amenorrea, intolerancia al frío e hipotensión, entre otros. Los cambios neuroquímicos presentes en la anorexia nerviosa también se han atribuido a la desnutrición, y es probable que puedan perpetuar las alteraciones conductuales.

Se determinó la zona de ubicación de la lesión y por medio del interrogatorio se conoció el hábito de uso de las prótesis en estos pacientes. El 70 % de los pacientes estudiados presentaron una mucosa alterada, con un predominio de estomatitis subprótesis grado II en el 44, 3 % y de grado III con menor frecuencia (21, 4 %).
