25|$|Tesla coils {{can produce}} output {{voltages}} from 50kilovolts to several million volts for large coils. The <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> output {{is in the}} low radio frequency range, usually between 50kHz and 1MHz. Although some oscillator-driven coils generate a continuous <b>alternating</b> <b>current,</b> most Tesla coils have a pulsed output; the high voltage consists of a rapid string of pulses of radio frequency <b>alternating</b> <b>current.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{device that}} uses {{permanent}} magnets to produce <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> {{is called a}} permanent magnet alternator (PMA). A permanent magnet generator (PMG) may produce either <b>alternating</b> <b>current,</b> or direct current {{if it has a}} commutator.|$|R
50|$|With the {{extension}} of the S-Bahn to Stade, new dual-system trains have been deployed. These are identical to the type 474 units but with a pantograph on the central carriage to collect 15 kV <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> from overhead lines.|$|E
50|$|In May 2016 a double-circuit 380 kV HVAC (high voltage <b>alternate</b> <b>current)</b> {{land and}} {{submarine}} cable system was {{handed over to}} the utility company. It was installed along a total route of approximately 44 km between the power stations of Villafranca Tirrena in Sicily and Scilla in Calabria.|$|E
50|$|Several {{different}} systems combinations of {{voltage and frequency}} were considered in the initial design. Due to the relatively large distances involved, transmission at high voltages using <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> was recognized as being unavoidable. An architecture similar to commercial DC utilities and urban railroads was considered using high voltage transmission lines, rotary converters, and overhead DC catenary. The studies of the time assumed an electrical efficiency of only 75 percent for this architecture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> is {{different}} from direct current in that the current can flow through what would ordinarily {{seem to be a}} physical barrier. In a series circuit, a capacitor blocks direct <b>current</b> but passes <b>alternating</b> <b>current.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{superimposing}} square, sine and triangular <b>alternating</b> <b>currents</b> on a direct current during the electroplating of thin films of Fe-Ni alloys from acidic and alkaline citrate baths under various plating conditions are studied. The {{composition of the}} alloys is found {{to depend on the}} ratio of <b>alternating</b> to direct <b>current,</b> the a. c. frequency and the waveform. The effect of the <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> diminished with increase in the frequency and the <b>alternating</b> to direct <b>current</b> ratio. In addition, the effects of pH and temperature on the alloy composition are also reported. The <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> slightly shifted the cathodic polarization towards the noble direction and decreased the grain size, resulting in smooth and bright deposits. A plausible mechanism for the action of the <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> is proposed. Â© 1982...|$|R
25|$|Electric motors {{are cheap}} and quiet for static compressors.

50|$|First {{successful}} electrical - {{hydraulic hybrid}} control system in China. Instead {{of a direct}} current or an <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> electrical propulsion system, the propulsion system of Osprey class submersible adopted a highly risky propulsion system that is not hydraulic either, but a hybrid system that was a cross between hydraulic and electrical systems. The resulting hybrid system not only provided good handling characteristics, but was also economical, with much lowered operating cost in comparison to other systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{battery pack}} also {{contains}} relays, or contactors, which control {{the distribution of}} the battery pack’s electrical power to the output terminals. In most cases there will be a minimum of two main relays which connect the battery cell stack to the main positive and negative output terminals of the pack, those supplying high current to the electrical drive motor. Some pack designs will include <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> paths for pre-charging the drive system through a pre-charge resistor or for powering an auxiliary buss which will also have their own associated control relays. For obvious safety reasons these relays are all normally open.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{waveform}} of <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> in most {{electric power}} circuits is a sine wave. In certain applications, different waveforms are used, such as triangular or square waves. Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of <b>alternating</b> <b>current.</b> These types of <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> carry information encoded (or modulated) onto the AC signal, such as sound (audio) or images (video).

5|$|Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to {{participate}} in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in a building devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> system. Tesla showed a series of electrical effects related to <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> as well as his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.|$|R
50|$|Transcranial {{random noise}} {{stimulation}} (tRNS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique and {{a form of}} transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). Terney et al from Göttingen University was the first group to apply tRNS in humans in 2008. They showed that by using an <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> along with random amplitude and frequency (between 0.1 and 640 Hz) in healthy subjects, the motor cortex excitability increased (i.e. increased amplitude of motor evoked potentials) for up to 60 minutes after 10 minutes of stimulation. The study included all the frequencies {{up to half of}} the sampling rate (1280 samples/s) i.e. 640 Hz, however the positive effect was limited only to higher frequencies. Although tRNS has shown positive effects in various studies, the optimal parameters, as well as the potential clinical effects of this technique, remain unclear.|$|E
50|$|A basic Nv {{network is}} built upon several Nv neurons in a loop. The loop's timing is often varied by input sensors. This {{difference}} in timing is often meant {{to affect the}} output pattern of the Nv loop. An example {{of this can be}} seen in a simple BEAM walker robot utilizing a bicore network (2 neurons). The neural network is set up to <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> going to the main motor in a way where under equal input from the main sensors, the neurons oscillate at an equal pace to each other, producing a steady walking gait. When input (e.g. from light sensors) is present, the timing of each neuron in the loop is varied based on the input from the sensors, affecting the pace at which the loop oscillates. This affected pace is often used to alter the walking gait of a robot in order to steer it based on the input from its sensors.|$|E
50|$|The {{brain of}} Explorer AUV {{consists}} of three computers: central control computer, positioning computer, and imagery computer. In addition to controlling the interface tracing the traveling path and the interface controlling the surveillance of the system, the central control computer controls the interface controlling remotely operated module so {{that in addition to}} being able to operate as an AUV, the Explorer AUV can also be operated as a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROUV). To accurately provide the positional parameters of the Explore AUV in the water such as pitch, row, yaw, depth, distance and location, the navigational system of the Explorer AUV utilizes a number of methodologies, including GPS, Doppler Velocity Measurement, directional gyro, short baseline positioning, ultra short baseline positioning, visual tracking and fluxgate compass. Information provided by these subsystems are fed and processed by the navigational computer on board. The compressed underwater television images are handled by the imagery computer. These on board electronics are powered by the main propulsion system consisted of lead-acid batteries with 120 V direct current, which is converted to 220 V <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> to power the electronic equipment.|$|E

5000|$|Important {{names in}} the 18th century are Maximilian Hell (astronomer), János Sajnovics (linguist), Matthias Bel (polyhistor), Samuel Mikoviny (engineer) and Wolfgang von Kempelen (polyhistor and co-founder of {{comparative}} linguistics). Ányos Jedlik physicist and engineer invented the first electric motor(1828), the dynamo, the self-excitation, the impulse generator, and the cascade connection. Important name in 19th century physics is Joseph Petzval,one {{of the founders of}} modern optics. The invention of the transformer (by Ottó Bláthy Miksa Déri and Károly Zipernowsky), the AC electricity meter and the electricity distribution systems with parallel-connected power sources decided the future of electrification in the War of Currents, which resulted in the global triumph of <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> systems over the former direct current systems. Roland von Eötvös discovered the weak equivalence principle (one of the cornerstones in Einsteinian relativity). Rado von Kövesligethy discovered laws of black body radiation before Planck and Wien.Hungary is famous for its excellent mathematics education which has trained numerous outstanding scientists. Famous Hungarian mathematicians include father Farkas Bolyai and son János Bolyai, designer of modern geometry (non-Euclidean geometry) 1820-1823. János Bolyai is together with John von Neumann considered as the greatest Hungarian mathematician ever. The most prestigious Hungarian scientific award is named in honor of János Bolyai. Paul Erdős, famed for publishing in over forty languages and whose Erdős numbers are still tracked;and John von Neumann, Quantum Theory, Game theory a pioneer of digital computing and the key mathematician in the Manhattan Project. Many Hungarian scientists, including Zoltán Bay, Victor Szebehely (gave a practical solution to the three-body problem, Newton solved the two-body problem), Mária Telkes, Imre Izsak, Erdős, von Neumann, Leó Szilárd, Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller emigrated to the US. The other cause of scientist emigration was the Treaty of Trianon, by which Hungary, diminished by the treaty, became unable to support large-scale, costly scientific research; therefore some Hungarian scientists made valuable contributions in the United States. Thirteen Hungarian or Hungarian-born scientists received the Nobel Prize: von Lenárd, Bárány, Zsigmondy, von Szent-Györgyi, de Hevesy, von Békésy, Wigner, Gábor, Polányi, Oláh, Harsányi, and Herskó. All emigrated, mostly because of persecution of communist and/or fascist regimes. Names in psychology are János Selye founder of Stress-theory and Csikszentmihalyi founder of Flow- theory. Tamás Roska is co-inventor of CNN (Cellular neural network) Some highly actual internationally well-known figures of today include: mathematician László Lovász, physicist Albert-László Barabási, physicist Ferenc Krausz, biochemist Árpád Pusztai and the highly controversial former NASA-physicist Ferenc Miskolczi, who denies the green-house effect. According to Science Watch: In Hadron research Hungary has most citations per paper in the world. In 2011 neuroscientists György Buzsáki, Tamás Freund and Péter Somogyi were awarded one million Euro with The Brain Prize ("Danish Nobel Prize")" [...] for [...] ".. brain circuits involved in memory..."After the fall of the communist dictatorship (1989), a new scientific prize, Bolyai János alkotói díj, has been established (1997), politically unbiased and of the highest international standard.|$|E
