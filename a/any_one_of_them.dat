5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> personally, {{and did not}} respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E
5|$|Rebirth and {{realms of}} {{existence}} are foundational teachings of Mahavira. According to the Acaranga Sutra, Mahavira comprehended life {{to exist in}} myriad forms, such as animals, plants, insects, water bodies, fire bodies, wind bodies, elemental forms, and others. He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> including plants, never swim in water, nor light a fire or extinguish it, nor thrash their {{arms in the air}} as such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder—in Fletcher's body—is dragged {{away by the}} soldiers, Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} whether what Mulder {{told her about the}} body-swap was true. Fletcher—in Mulder's body—approaches Scully and apologizes for telling Kersh and she feigns acceptance of it. After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is confined in a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs his way through the meeting, and claims that the real proof is safe and that he did not tell them about the scheme because he did not know if he could trust his colleagues, thinking <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> could be the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E

5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{operating}} system and applications all share a single memory space, {{it is possible for}} a bug in <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> to corrupt the entire operating system, and crash the machine. This is not particularly annoying under a single-application model, in which case the application crashes anyway. But under MultiFinder, any crash will crash all the other running programs as well. The multitasking of multiple applications potentially increases the chances of a crash, making the system potentially more fragile.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomena}} {{for which}} Plato had to account were of three kinds, ethical, epistemological, and ontological. In {{each of these}} spheres there had been developed {{by the end of}} the fifth century doctrines so extremely paradoxical that there seemed to be no possibility of reconciling them with one another or <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> with the observable facts of human experience. The dialogues of Plato, I believe, will furnish evidence to show that he considered it necessary to find a single hypothesis which would at once solve the problems of these several spheres and also create a rationally unified cosmos by establishing the connection among the separate phases of experience.|$|E
25|$|Another {{version of}} this {{objection}} argues that for every religion that promulgates rules, there exists another religion that has rules of the opposite kind. If a certain action leads one closer to salvation in the former religion, it leads one further away from it in the latter. Therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion could be negative. Or, one could also argue that there are {{an infinite number of}} mutually exclusive religions (which is a subset of the set of all possible religions), and that the probability of <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> being true is zero; therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion is zero.|$|E

25|$|In {{the most}} {{straightforward}} case, {{such as the}} sampling of a batch of material from production (acceptance sampling by lots), it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in our sample. However, in the more general case this is not usually possible or practical. There {{is no way to}} identify all rats in the set of all rats. Where voting is not compulsory, {{there is no way to}} identify which people will actually vote at a forthcoming election (in advance of the election). These imprecise populations are not amenable to sampling in any of the ways below and to which we could apply statistical theory.|$|E
25|$|Bremmer uses 'pivot state' to {{describe}} a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture—in terms of security or economy—at {{the hands of a}} single country. In his book, Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains how, in a volatile G-Zero world, the ability to pivot will take on increased importance. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum are shadow states that are frozen within the influence of a single power. The United States' neighbors illustrate the terms very well. With significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia and formal security ties with NATO, Canada is a good example of a pivot state that is hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. Mexico, on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{and game}} mechanics {{fall into the}} subgenre of Grand Theft Auto clones. As such, Montana can commandeer vehicles (cars and boats), can move around the map on foot, can interact with civilians and NPCs both hostile and non-hostile, can engage in primary and sub-missions, and can wield a variety of weaponry; pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, a sniper rifle, a rocket launcher, a chainsaw, and various melee weapons, such as pipes and machetes. In a departure from most Grand Theft Auto-style games, Montana cannot kill innocent people. If the player tries to shoot a non-aggressive target, Montana will refuse; if the player tries to hit an innocent person with a car, they will only be injured. However, as the game progresses, the player acquires access to some of Montana's employees; a driver, a boat pilot, a weapons dealer, an enforcer and an assassin. When these employees have been unlocked, the player can switch control from Montana to <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> (except the weapons dealer), and when playing as the enforcer or the assassin, the player can kill innocent people.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of correlation of parts was also Cuvier's {{way of understanding}} function in a non-evolutionary context, without invoking a divine creator. In the same 1798 paper on the fossil remains of an animal found in plaster quarries near Paris, Cuvier emphasizes the predictive power of his principle, writing,Today comparative anatomy has reached such a point of perfection that, after inspecting a single bone, one can often determine the class, and sometimes even the genus of the animal to which it belonged, above all if that bone belonged to the head or the limbs... This is because the number, direction, {{and shape of the}} bones that compose each part of an animal's body are always in a necessary relation to all the other parts, in such a way that—up to a point—one can infer the whole from <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and vice versa.Though Cuvier believed that his principle's major contribution was that it was a rational, mathematical way to reconstruct fossils and make predictions, in reality it was difficult for Cuvier to use his principle. The functional significance of many body parts were still unknown at the time, and so relating those body parts to other body parts using Cuvier's principle was impossible. Though Cuvier was able to make accurate predictions about fossil finds, in practice the accuracy of his predictions came not from application of his principle, but rather from his vast knowledge of comparative anatomy. However, despite Cuvier's exaggerations of the power of his principle, the basic concept is central to comparative anatomy and paleontology.|$|E

[...] The judge considered the captain's diabetes and self-administration of insulin probably contributed significantly to the accident but he stopped short of making this his official conclusion.|$|E

The three hydraulic systems were separate, so that failure of <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> would leave the crew with full control, but lines {{for all three}} systems shared the same narrow passage through the tail where the engine debris had penetrated, and thus control surfaces were inoperative.

Baylor's starting quarterback, Blake Szymanski, was questionable for the game because of a mild concussion he suffered {{in a game against}} Kansas. Although Szymanski had been physically cleared to play, back-up quarterbacks Michael Machen and John David Weed were sharing snaps in practice and Baylor coaches said <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> could get the start against Texas.

500|$|The members {{agreed that}} an armed attack against <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in Europe or North America would be {{considered}} an attack against them all.

The treaty does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor. Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so. This differs from ArticleIV of the Treaty of Brussels, which clearly states that the response will be military in nature. It is nonetheless assumed that NATO members will aid the attacked member militarily. The treaty was later clarified to include both the member's territory and their [...] "vessels, forces or aircraft" [...] above the Tropic of Cancer, including some overseas departments of France.|$|E
