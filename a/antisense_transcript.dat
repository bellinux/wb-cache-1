50|$|This gene locus has {{a highly}} complex {{imprinted}} expression pattern. It {{gives rise to}} maternally, paternally, and biallelically expressed transcripts that are derived from four alternative promoters and 5' exons. Some transcripts contains a differentially methylated region (DMR) at their 5' exons, and this DMR is commonly found in imprinted genes and correlates with transcript expression. An <b>antisense</b> <b>transcript</b> exists, and this <b>antisense</b> <b>transcript</b> {{and one of the}} transcripts are paternally expressed, produce noncoding RNAs, and may regulate imprinting in this region.

50|$|The {{complexity}} of the transcriptome, and our evolving understanding of its structure may inform a reinterpretation of the functional basis for many natural polymorphisms associated with disease states. Many SNPs associated with certain disease conditions are found within non-coding regions and the complex networks of non-coding transcription within these regions make it particularly difficult to elucidate the functional effects of polymorphisms. For example, a SNP both within the truncated form of ZFAT and the promoter of an <b>antisense</b> <b>transcript</b> increases the expression of ZFAT not through increasing the mRNA stability, but rather by repressing {{the expression of the}} <b>antisense</b> <b>transcript.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{splicing}} of mRNA can induce its {{translation and}} functionally diversify the repertoire of proteins it encodes. The Zeb2 mRNA, {{which has a}} particularly long 5’UTR, requires the retention of a 5’UTR intron that contains an internal ribosome entry site for efficient translation. However, retention of the intron {{is dependent on the}} expression of an <b>antisense</b> <b>transcript</b> that complements the intronic 5’ splice site. Therefore, the ectopic expression of the <b>antisense</b> <b>transcript</b> represses splicing and induces translation of the Zeb2 mRNA during mesenchymal development. Likewise, the expression of an overlapping antisense Rev-ErbAa2 transcript controls the alternative splicing of the thyroid hormone receptor ErbAa2 mRNA to form two antagonistic isoforms.|$|E

40|$|Background: MicroRNAs {{are small}} non-coding {{transcripts}} that have regulatory {{roles in the}} genome. Cis natural <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts</b> are transcripts overlapping a sense transcript at the same loci in the genome, but at the opposite strand. Such <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts</b> {{are thought to have}} regulatory roles in the genome, and the hypothesis is that miRNAs might bind to such <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts</b> and thus activate the overlapping sense transcript. Aim of study: The following two aims have been identified during this project: (1) investigate whether the non-coding transcript of cis-NATs show significant enrichment for conserved miRNA seed sites, and (2) to correlate miRNA expression with expression of the sense side of targeted cis-NAT pairs. Results: Seed sites within such <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts</b> gave significant enrichment, suggesting that miRNAs might actually bind to such <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts.</b> There is a significant negative correlation between the expression of mir- 28 and the expression of its targeted <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts,</b> whereas the other miRNAs have no significant correlations. Also, the 3 UTR of the sense side of cis-NAT pairs is longer and more conserved than random transcripts.

These transcripts seem {{to be involved in}} various biological functions and may govern the expression of their respective sense partner. Very little, however, is known about the degree of evolutionary conservation of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts.</b> Furthermore, none of the earlier analyses has studied whether antisense relationships are solely dual or involved in more complex relationships. Here we present a systematic screen for cis- and trans-located <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts</b> based on open reading frames (ORFs) from five fungal species. The relative number of ORFs involved in antisense relationships varies greatly between the five species. In addition, other significant differences are found between the species, such as the mean length of the antisense region. The majority of trans-located <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts</b> is found to be involved in complex relationships, resulting in highly connected networks.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} thousands of sense-antisense gene pairs across different genomes by computational mapping of cDNA sequences. These {{studies have shown}} that approximately 25 % of all transcriptional units in the human and mouse genomes are involved in cis -sense-antisense pairs. However, the number of known sense-antisense pairs remains limited because currently available cDNA sequences represent {{only a fraction of the}} total number of transcripts comprising the transcriptome of each cell type. Methods To discover novel <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts</b> encoded in the antisense strand of important genes, such as cancer-related genes, we conducted expression analyses of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts</b> using our custom microarray platform along with 2376 probes designed specifically to detect the potential <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts</b> of 501 well-known genes suitable for cancer research. Results Using colon cancer tissue and normal tissue surrounding the cancer tissue obtained from 6 patients, we found that <b>antisense</b> <b>transcripts</b> without poly(A) tails are expressed from approximately 80 % of these well-known genes.
