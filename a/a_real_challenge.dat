After few injections the whole mass forms a solid polymer, which is then excised. During excision there is remarkably minimum bleeding.

500|$|The {{choice of}} [...] gun and {{the mix of}} quadruple and twin turrets for the main battery of the King George Vs had been {{dictated}} by the Second London Naval Treaty, which limited battleships to [...] standard displacement and a main calibre of 14inches. The treaty was meant to prevent a costly naval arms race that Britain could ill afford. However, when the Japanese Government refused to agree to its terms, the maximum calibre allowed reverted to 16inches in April 1937. The Board of Admiralty then began preliminary design work on a 35,000-ton ship armed with 16-inch guns and they were promising enough that the Director of Naval Construction (DNC) was ordered to further investigate such designs, providing for several aircraft as well. To save design time, many {{of the features of}} the King George Vs were incorporated in the new design, but the limited size of the ship was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> for the designers. In order to maintain the same speed, protection, and secondary armament as the preceding King George Vs while using 16 inch guns, the design displacement rose to 41,000-tons, mainly due to the increased weight of the main armament. Hoping to remain within treaty limits, the increased weight of the main armament was compensated for by a slight reduction in the overall weight of armour and the elimination of two twin [...] gun turrets.|$|E

The home conditions helped three of Somerset's batsmen pass 1,000 first-class runs in the season, including Craig Kieswetter and Arul Suppiah, who were both awarded their county caps after passing the landmark. Trescothick's 1,817 runs were the most by any batsman in the 2009 competition, finishing over 200 runs ahead of the next most prolific batsman, and he was named as both PCA Player of the Year and the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year for 2009.

The last open instance to be solved took one week CPU time on a pool of 3 PCs with a quite specific search algorithm in 2002. It represents <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>challenging</b> problem especially for Parallel Combinatorial Search. The paper presents a general framework for parallel resolution of combinatorial problems formulated as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). A first step consisting in a simple decomposition strategy of the Tree Search is sketched. This enables the choice of initial variables to generate independent tasks. The scalability {{of this approach is}} studied within the shared memory model using the standard OpenMP library. Because of its irregularity the load balancing question is crucial for parallel combinatorial search. Different static and dynamic policies offered by OpenMP are studied. The experiments were carried out running on the Silicon Graphics Origin’ 3800 500 MHz R 14 K parallel machine. For the Langford’s problem we obtain close to linear speed-ups until 256 processors with some breakdown depending of the granularity.
