5|$|After leaving Rogers County, {{the next}} county along US-412 is Mayes County. South of Chouteau, the route {{provides}} access to US-69 via an interchange. Just west of US-412's crossing of the Grand River, the highway intersects SH-412B, which connects US-412 to SH-69A. After crossing the river, US-412 comes to <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> the road; {{one half of the}} fork is the Cherokee Turnpike, which mainline US-412 follows, while the other is US-412 Alternate, which runs parallel to the turnpike on an old alignment of US-412.|$|E
5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward. Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> the road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E
5|$|NY185 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY9N and NY22 in Crown Point. The route progresses eastward as a two-lane highway named Bridge Road. Heading {{away from the}} western terminus, there is <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> the road: to the left is NY185, {{and to the right}} is a road to a housing development. Most of NY185 runs along the lowlands around Lake Champlain, making curves at intersections, and heading on relatively flat elevations. As the highway approaches the lake, it makes a curve to the north. There, it intersects with County Route48 (Lake Road) and begins to follow the lake shore.|$|E

5|$|CR106 {{originated}} in 1824, when {{the road was}} chartered for the New Turnpike and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, what is now Southfields was known as Monroe. The New Turnpike started at a nail factory in Monroe to a crossing over the Ramapo River, and progressed eastward, passing Lake Stahahe (then known as Car Pond). The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> the road. At the fork, part of the road became NY210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering. In 1910, when the park opened, the road {{became known as the}} Southfields Road. Three years later, it became part of the Seven Lakes Drive. Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway416. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of the road was reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making up part of the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY17A.|$|E
5|$|Edward and Karl find <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> {{the road}} and travel down {{separate}} paths. Edward follows a path through a swamp and discovers the secret town of Spectre, the cheery locals claiming he was expected. There, he befriends Ashton poet Norther Winslow and the mayor’s daughter Jenny. However, Edward leaves Spectre, unwilling to settle down but promises Jenny he will return. In the present day, Joséphine speaks to the bed-ridden Edward and asks him {{to tell her the}} story of how he met his wife Sandra, with Will listening outside the door. Returning to his reminisces, Edward reunites with Karl and they visit the Calloway Circus, where Edward {{falls in love with a}} beautiful woman. Karl and Edward get jobs in the circus where the ringmaster Amos Calloway reveals to Edward one detail about the woman at the end of every month.|$|E
5|$|The game {{keeps track}} of the player's {{completed}} percentage of the storyline, increased by viewing the scenarios comprising each Episode. If 100% {{of the game is}} completed, an additional ending will be unlocked. The game features <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> its plot, allowing the player to make a choice that changes what scenes they see and the number of percentage points they acquire afterward. It is impossible to see all of the game's content on a single playthrough, due to this fork in the storyline, although it is possible to achieve 100% storyline completion in a single playthrough. However, a 100% storyline completion can only be achieved through one of the two possible storylines. When the game is completed for the first time, it unlocks a New Game Plus option that allows the player to restart the game with all of the items, Garment Grids, dresspheres and storyline completion percentage achieved previously. However, all character levels are set back to one.|$|E

While OpenIndiana is <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> the technical sense, it {{is a continuation}} of OpenSolaris in spirit: the project intends to deliver a System V family operating system which is binary-compatible with the Oracle products Solaris 11 and Solaris 11 Express. However, rather than being based around the OS/Net consolidation like OpenSolaris was, OpenIndiana became a distribution based on illumos (the first release is still based around OS/Net). The project uses the same IPS package management system as OpenSolaris.|$|E

25|$|The {{highway that}} would later become part of CR106 {{originated}} in 1824. That is when the road was chartered as the New Turnpike, which stretched from what is now Southfields (formerly known as Monroe) to <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> the road, which part later became NY210. When the park opened in 1910, CR106 was known as Southfields Road. In 1913, it became part of Seven Lakes Drive, with another designation coming three years later as County Highway 416. During the period of 1919 and 1920, the road was reconstructed, with a bridge being built three years later. A new route was assigned that year making up the old Warwick Turnpike as NY17A.|$|E
25|$|Now in Boonville, NY46 {{becomes a}} two-lane woods road through town, soon {{entering}} Pixley Falls State Park.

Winding northward through Boonville, NY46 remains rural before turning northwest at <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> the road. Just north of Jackson Hill Road, the route begins to become residential as it reaches the village of Boonville. At the junction with Academy Street, the route gains the moniker of Post Street and becomes a two-lane residential street at the southwestern end of the village.

25|$|NY245 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY21 immediately {{in the northeastern}} portion of the village of Naples, located {{in the town of}} same name, in Ontario County. Shortly after leaving the village, the route heads to the northeast along the base of a series of mountains delimiting the Canandaigua Lake valley, entering Yates County and the town of Italy before following the valley surrounding the West River at <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> the primary valley near the southern end of Canandaigua Lake. NY245 follows {{the eastern edge of the}} valley to the town of Middlesex, where it intersects NY364 in the hamlet of the same name's center. NY245 and NY364 run concurrent for a block before NY364 splits from NY245 to ascend the eastern edge of the valley and continue towards Potter. North of Middlesex, the valley becomes less prominent as NY245 progresses northward. Near the Ontario County line, NY245 turns northeast to serve the dual-county village of Rushville, located in the towns of Potter and Gorham. Within the village, NY245 meets NY247. The two routes embark on an overlap northward into Ontario County.|$|E

500|$|From 1930 to 1982, NY210 {{extended}} eastward into Rockland County. This [...] extension {{was primarily}} {{made up of}} several highways that were previously part of a privately maintained road.
