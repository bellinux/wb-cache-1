40|$|Transmission control {{protocol}} (TCP) {{is a connection}} oriented protocol for several types of distributed applications. TCP is reliable particularly for traditional fixed networks. With emergence of faster wireless networks, TCP has been performing poorly in its original format. The performance of TCP is affected due to <b>assorted</b> <b>factors</b> including congestion window, maximum packet size, retry limit, recovery mechanism, backup mechanism and mobility. To overcome deficiency of original TCP, Several modifications have been introduced to improve network quality. The mobility is a major hurdle in degrading the performance of mobile wireless networks. In this paper, we introduce and implement new TCP variant University of Bridgeport (UB) that combines the features of TCP Westwood and Vegas. We examine the performance of TCP-UB, Vegas and Westwood using different realistic scenarios. NS 2 simulator demonstrates the stability of TCP-UB as compared with TCP Vegas and Westwood in highly congested networks from the mobility point of view. Comment: 13 Pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{maintain}} technical performances (i. e. skills) throughout soccer match-play {{is considered to be}} crucial in determining the outcome of competitive fixtures. Consequently, coaches dedicate a large proportion of time to practicing isolated skills, such as passing, shooting and dribbling. Unlike other elements that contribute to team sport performances, it is unusual for coaches to use methods other than observations to assess changes resulting from technical training. Researchers have employed various tests to measure isolated soccer skills; however, reliance on outcome measures that include number of contacts (ball juggling tasks), time (dribbling tasks) and points scored (criterion-based passing and shooting tests) means that the outcomes are difficult for coaches to interpret. Skill tests that use video-analysis techniques to measure ball speed, precision and success of soccer skills offer valid and reliable alternatives. Although equivocal results are published, skill performances can be affected by <b>assorted</b> <b>factors</b> that threaten homeostasis, including match-related fatigue, dehydration and reductions in blood glucose concentrations. While acknowledging methodological constraints associated with using skill tests with limited ecological validity and cognitive demands, the effects of these homeostatic disturbances might vary according to the type of skill being performed. Shooting performances appear most susceptible to deterioration after exercise. Strategies such as aerobic training, fluid-electrolyte provision and acute carbohydrate supplementation have been found to improve proficiency in technical actions performed after soccer-specific exercise. However, mechanisms that cause deterioration in skill during soccer-specific exercise remain to be fully elucidated and strategies to optimize technical performance throughout match-play are warranted...|$|R

40|$|Workers seriously {{interested}} in genetic problems have long deplored {{emphasis in the}} clinical literature on case reports concerning disease occurring in both members {{of a pair of}} identical twins (concordant). The value of reporting cases of illness appearing in one member of a pair (discordant) is obvious, yet such reports appear only sporadically. Increased attention {{to the role of the}} family and society in the genesis of schizophrenia has given new prominence to the study of mental disease in twins. Case reports are now appearing with considerable detail. This, interestingly enough, has been paralleled in medical research by an increased awareness of the significance of twin disease, in part because of the results of organ transplants in identical twins. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss some of the problems in evaluating twin case reports and to emphasize the value of the study of twin cases in the examination of psychosomatic concepts. The methodology of twin study deserves some comment. At first it might seem that the chief value of case reports of discordant disease in twins would be to lend support to hypotheses concerning the environmental (or at least the "other than genetic") factors in the genesis of disease. As will be shown later, this cannot be accomplished by finding one discordant case. The statistical techniques introduced by Kaliman have limited usefulness in establishing the genetic background of disease, but cannot assess the importance of the <b>assorted</b> <b>factors</b> that make up "environment. " In controversies over such issues, the suggestion of study of identical twins reared apart from birth arises. Early studies were not rewarding from the viewpoint of modern personality theory; their chief value has been a negative one: to demonstrate that many human attributes ar...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSteam {{conversion}} and hydroconversion {{of a series}} of monoalkylbenzenes (C 6 H 5 R, R = C 2 H 5, n-C 3 H 7, i-C 3 H 7, tert-C 4 H 9) and of dialkylbenzenes (o- and p-xylenes) are studied at 713 K and atmospheric pressure on supported rhodium catalysts (Rh/Al 2 O 3, Rh/SiO 2 and Rh/TiO 2), and compared to the toluene steam dealkylation previously studied on the same catalysts. Three types of reaction, namely dealkylation (C [...] -C rupture on the side chain), dehydrogenation (on the side chain), and degradation (i. e., ring opening) account for virtually the whole product spectrum. Isomerization, transalkylation, and dehydrocyclization reactions may, in general, be discounted. In the presence of steam, the main initial product of monoalkylbenzene dealkylation is invariably benzene, but the splitting of the C [...] -C bonds in the middle or end of the side chain always increases with conversion. As a rule, the specific activities (per metal site) in dealkylation decrease with the degree of substitution in the alkyl group (primary > secondary > tertiary > quaternary carbon). On the other hand, the specific activities in ring opening remain constant for all the hydrocarbons and even for the benzene. In the presence of hydrogen, multiple C [...] -C bond splittings are invariably observed and benzene is no longer, in general, the principal initial product. The activities in ring opening are equally constant, but at a lower level than in steam conversion. These results are in overall agreement with the model of the dual active sites: sites I appear operative for dealkylation and dehydrogenation, whereas ring opening takes place at sites II with a high probability, independent of the alkyl group size. Possible adsorbed species on each type of site are described. An attempt is made to rationalize the effects of <b>assorted</b> selectivity-determining <b>factors</b> (metal particle size, support effects, selective poisons such as S and CO) in terms of electronic or geometric effects...|$|R

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for detection of aPL against phosphatidyl-L-serine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl- DL-glycerol, phosphatidic acid, annexin V, cardiolipin, and beta 2 -GPI. Thrombophilic mutations factor V Leiden (F 5 G 1691 A), F II G 20210 A, and MTHFR C 677 T and A 1298 C variants were determined using a melting curve analysis of the PCR amplification product detected by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). PAI 1 (- 675) 4 G/ 5 G, PROZ intron F G 79 A, PROZ A(- 13) G and PROZ R 255 H variants were determined using standard PCR-RFLP method. Genotypes distribution and allelic frequencies were calculated. Correlation between aPL and thrombophilic factors was tested by chi-square and Fisher exact test. Our results showed significantly increased prevalence of aPL against phosphatidylinositol (17 - 19. 6 % dependent on number of spontaneous miscarriages) and against phosphatidyl-L-serine (18 - 25 %). aPL in IgG prevailed.
