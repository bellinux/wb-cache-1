500|$|The shows {{featured}} couture costumes {{designed by}} fashion house Ralph and Russo. Designer Tamara Ralph said Beyoncé {{asked them to}} be [...] "really creative" [...] while creating items with [...] "an ultra-glamorous feel to them". The duo's inspiration was [...] "modern showgirl", {{paying attention to the}} [...] "comfort and flexibility of each outfit and the ease of getting {{in and out of the}} pieces with quick costume changes". All the crystals for the show were provided by Swarovski; a team of 20 couturiers worked to complete the looks, which were embellished with more than 500,000 crystals from Swarovski Elements in four weeks.

It was an absolute pleasure to work with her to create exquisite pieces that dazzle on stage." ...|$|E

When in opposition he never hesitated to put firmly his party's case. When in office he took a smoother approach towards his supporters and opponents alike. Although he left the House of Commons in 1987 he continued to follow political life and it was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to meet with him. We have lost a major figure from our political landscape".|$|E

2500|$|He fought Pacquiao for {{the third}} time in a non-championship title bout, on November 18, 2006. Morales was {{defeated}} by a knockout in three rounds. After the fight, Morales said [...] "Maybe it's time I should no longer be doing this." [...] He sat speechless in his corner for five minutes afterward. [...] "I did everything in camp necessary to win this fight. I didn't win it. It wasn't my night...it just wasn't meant to be." [...] Asked by Larry Merchant whether he would retire from boxing, Morales offered, [...] "Maybe this is the way to end it. It's a beautiful night, and there's a lot of good people (here in the audience)...it was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to give the public great fights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cecil is {{also very}} serious when doing this {{research}} to develop games that have strong ties to historic locales and myths, [...] "I take the historical research and research of our locations very seriously and will generally visit the locations to undertake recces. Of course this is almost <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> – the games aim to feature locations that are exciting and interesting." [...] In the same interview he stated that the name Broken Sword may have been chosen {{because it is a}} symbol of peace. He also added that {{it might have been a}} fate of history that this name was chosen: [...] "I live in the city of York in England and a few years ago a statue of Constantine the Great was erected next to the cathedral to commemorate his coronation in the city in 306AD. The statue depicts Constantine sitting atop a broken sword; it seemed a fun coincidence, or perhaps it is down to fate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Egyptologists {{who knew}} Omm Sety were {{impressed}} by her knowledge of ancient Egypt. Klaus Baer of the Oriental Institute commented that [...] "she had visions and worshipped the ancient Egyptian gods. But she understood the methods and standards of scholarship, which is usually {{not the case with}} nuts," [...] nor did she [...] "desire to convert anyone." [...] Omm Sety was impressed by Hermann Junker, [...] "one of the elders of 20th century archaeology," [...] who had taught Selim Hassan. He advocated a more honest approach to the study of ancient Egyptian religion, believing that [...] "nobody had made a real effort to go deeply enough into it." [...] She admired his open-mindedness, especially since Junker was also a Catholic priest. [...] One noted Egyptologist, who didn't wish to be named, commented [...] "I was deeply shocked when, one night, I attended a party given by Dr. Ahmed Fakhry behind the Great Pyramid...and there under the full moon was Dorothy Eady belly dancing! I couldn't believe my eyes!"

5000|$|The {{first single}} from {{the album was}} [...] "Lluvia", a song made in the 1980s by the singer-songwriter Luis Ángel. Pedro notes, [...] "I love the song.

2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a C, saying [...] "In the Shrek films, the joke of Puss in Boots, with his trilled consonants and penchant for chest-puffing sword duels, {{is that no}} one this cuddly should try to be this dashing. But in Puss in Boots, that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots doesn't break any new ground in the {{storytelling}} department, and its reliance on go-go-go state-of-the-art action sequences grows wearying by the end, but the movie has a devilish wit that works for parent and child alike." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "It's <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to find a family film that respects its audience {{all the way up the}} line." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Remember that toy where you yank a string and hear the sound of a barnyard animal? [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has about half as much entertainment value." [...] Olly Richards of Empire gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Like most kittens, it's not always perfectly behaved, but at least this new Puss adventure doesn't have you reaching for the cinematic spray bottle. And thank goodness the spin-off does nothing to neuter the charismatic cat's appeal." [...] Stan Hall of The Oregonian gave the film a B, saying [...] "Puss in Boots isn't particularly deep, nor does it take itself seriously -- it just wants to seek glory, win affection and cash in. Done, done and done." ...|$|E

5000|$|Huppert {{expressed}} disappointment at {{the lack}} of scientific understanding amongst MPs. Although he was described by Cambridge Liberal Democrats and The Independent newspaper as [...] "the only scientist" [...] in the House of Commons, in November 2012, Huppert acknowledged other scientists in the House of Commons saying: [...] "Although {{it has been said that}} I am the only scientist in the House, that is sadly not true.

Our arrival at the hotel was concurrent with the usual lively glimpses of festivity <b>always</b> prevalent at <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> resort upon the approach of evening. A gush of music, the ripple of laughter, the tripping of feet, and the spontaneous rush of cherubs in white frocks to investigate our arrival constituted for Mariposilla and Marjorie a prime reception.|$|R
5000|$|Music has <b>always</b> been <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> {{and active}} pursuit at St. Luke's, from early choir groups to {{community}} musical events. Contributing {{to this is}} the good acoustics of the current Sanctuary, {{as well as its}} musical instruments. In the choir loft, below a rose window by Gabriel Loire, is a pipe organ built in 1890 by W. K. Adams. The organ is highly versatile and musical - one of the best examples of historic American organ building in the Northwest. It is a special and rare instrument because of its long history, and because it utilizes mechanical ("tracker") action to control the pipes. This sort of action is the most sensitive and most reliable way to build an organ ...|$|R
6000|$|It is <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to {{come across}} an American poet who is not national, and who tries to give {{expression}} to the literature that he loves {{rather than to the}} land in which he lives. The Muses care so little for geography! ...|$|E

500|$|Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Wheels" [...] a [...] "great, great episode", {{stating that}} it made him cry several times. MTV's Aly Semigran also commented that the episode brought her to tears, {{suggesting}} that Lynch's performance was Emmy-worthy and deeming [...] "Wheels" [...] "a truly standout hour of TV". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal reviewed the episode positively, calling Artie's rendition of [...] "Dancing With Myself" [...] "catchy" [...] and [...] "upbeat" [...] and praising Rachel's [...] "Defying Gravity" [...] audition, which he wrote: [...] "leaves us wanting for more." [...] Kennedy described the episode as [...] "sheer perfection", and James Poniewozik of Time made the pun: [...] "Glee <b>always</b> been <b>a</b> <b>pleasure,</b> but if it raises its storytelling ambitions this way, it can really defy gravity." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{private person}} {{who worked in}} solitude, she worked intensely, believing, as Carles had maintained, that in {{painting}} [...] "you put everything in your life into it." [...] Speaking of students she had taught, she said {{it took more than}} just talent to sustain a professional career: [...] "You must be able to tolerate yourself for long periods of time, working in the isolation of a studio." [...] She was unusually disciplined and rarely took time off. Despite family responsibilities (raising two daughters and moving the family about as her husband's career evolved), she once said a six-month hiatus was the longest time she had spent out of the studio. [...] "Observers should feel that the act of painting was effortless - that it happened, it just happened," [...] she said in a 1977 magazine interview. [...] "Which of course," [...] she added, [...] "is not true." [...] A few years later she said, [...] "Painting is <b>a</b> <b>pleasure,</b> even though painful. It will <b>always</b> be <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> for me, because it is the thing I want to do the most." ...|$|R

6000|$|I.--Little enough, I agree. But {{the thing}} is that there must be a [...] great number of men at work, for us to make sure of the man of [...] genius: he is one out of a multitude.

Have you never noticed, monsieur," [...] he continued, [...] "the difference? They do not plod here as do your English people. There is a buoyancy in their footsteps, a mirth in their laughter, an expectancy in the way they look around, as though adventures were everywhere. I cannot understand it, but one feels it directly one sets foot in Paris." ...|$|E
60|$|The November {{cabinets}} had commenced, {{and this}} brought all the chiefs to town, Sidney Wilton among them; and his society was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> great <b>pleasure</b> to Endymion; the only social pleasure now left {{to him was}} a little dinner at Mr. Wilton's, and little dinners there abounded. Mr. Wilton knew all the persons that he was always thinking about, but whom, it might be noticed, they seemed to agree now rarely to mention. As for the rest, there was nobody to call upon in the delightful hours between official duties and dinner. No Lady Roehampton now, no brilliant Berengaria, and not even the gentle Imogene with her welcome smile. He looked in at the Coventry Club, a club of fashion, and also much frequented by diplomatists. There were a good many persons there, and a foreign minister immediately buttonholed the Under-Secretary of State.|$|R

60|$|Rollo had no very {{definite}} idea {{of being}} able to fish while on the raft, but there was a sort of instinct which prompted him always to take his fishing line whenever he went on any excursion whatever that was connected with the water. Mr. George had a pretty definite idea {{that he would not be}} able to fish; but still he thought it a good plan for Rollo to take the line, for he observed that to have a fishing line in his pocket, on such occasions, was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> source of <b>pleasure</b> to <b>a</b> boy, even if he did not use it at all.|$|R
