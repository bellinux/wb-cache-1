5|$|Craig Conway as Sol, Kane's son and {{the leader}} of the marauders. He has a {{biohazard}} sign tattooed on his back and a large scar <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Even though he is Kane's son, he distanced himself from him and formed his own army. He was a young child in the original 2008 quarantine.|$|E
5|$|Zampanò {{makes his}} living as an {{itinerant}} street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina's naïve and antic nature emerges, with Zampanò's brutish methods presenting a callous foil. He teaches {{her to play}} the snare drum and trumpet, dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he relies on intimidation and even cruelty at times to maintain his domination.|$|E
5|$|Nandanar {{entered the}} holy fire {{chanting}} {{the name of}} Shiva and reappeared in a new purified form. He looked like a Brahmin sage, wearing matted hair (characteristic of a Shaiva) and the sacred thread worn by Brahmins <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> His body was smeared with sacred ash. The gods showered flowers on the Nayanar from heaven and the Brahmins cheered. With the Brahmins, Nandanar went in the garbhagriha and saw Nataraja. The Nayanar disappeared {{in the image of}} Nataraja and became one with Shiva.|$|E
5000|$|He {{has many}} tattoos, {{including}} the logo of Pogoń <b>across</b> <b>his</b> left <b>chest.</b>|$|R
60|$|Thuvia glanced quickly toward Carthoris. He was {{standing}} erect, with high-held head and arms folded <b>across</b> <b>his</b> broad <b>chest.</b> A haughty smile curved his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, miss, 'is coffin lay above, and 'is wife's below, {{as might}} be expected, seeing that she died thirty years or so before 'im. The coffins was very much broken, an' we could see 'im as clear us I can see you. When we first looked in I saw 'im lying quite plain--a short thick figure of a man--with <b>'is</b> 'ands <b>across</b> <b>'is</b> <b>chest.</b> And then, just as we looked at 'im, 'e crumbled in, as you might say, <b>across</b> <b>'is</b> breast bone, an' just quietly settled down into a 'uddle of dust.

5|$|The groom Shiva {{is shown}} calm and young, while Parvati is {{depicted}} as shy and emotional. Her head is tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (kalash). Brahma, the priest, is squatting {{on the floor to}} the right tending the yajna fire (agni mandapa).|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands as it ran <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> as he lay in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E
5|$|The Boers and {{the local}} Tswana and Basotho chiefdoms were in near-constant conflict, mainly over land. Kruger was elected field cornet of his {{district}} in 1852, and in August that year he {{took part in the}} Battle of Dimawe, a raid against the Tswana chief Sechele I. The Boer commando was headed by Pretorius, but in practice he did not take much part as he was suffering from dropsy. Kruger narrowly escaped death twice—first a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head but only knocked him out, then later a Tswana bullet swiped <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> tearing his jacket without wounding him. The commando wrecked David Livingstone's mission station at Kolobeng, destroying his medicines and books. Livingstone was away at the time. Kruger's version of the story was that the Boers found an armoury and a workshop for repairing firearms in Livingstone's house and, interpreting this as a breach of Britain's promise at the Sand River not to arm tribal chiefs, confiscated them. Whatever the truth, Livingstone wrote about the Boers in strongly condemnatory terms thereafter, depicting them as mindless barbarians.|$|E
50|$|On May 14, 2005, after {{commanding}} his son {{to strip}} naked, Malone disciplined his son for failing grades and misbehavior by striking his bared body repeatedly with a leather belt. Without the protection of clothing, the son developed extensive welts <b>across</b> <b>his</b> back, <b>chest,</b> stomach, legs and buttocks.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the lots}} were all drawn, and one man, {{apparently}} a young pirate, stepped out from among his fellows. His head was bowed, {{and his arms}} were folded <b>across</b> <b>his</b> manly <b>chest.</b> The captain spoke a few words, and the young pirate advanced alone {{to the side of}} the deep hole.|$|R
5000|$|As {{election}} day rapidly approaches, Detectives Lupo and Bernard discover the disfigured {{remains of a}} man with the word [...] "FED" [...] written <b>across</b> <b>his</b> bare <b>chest.</b> Missing a crucial piece of evidence, the detectives decide to retrace the steps of the victim, a campaign volunteer. After the victim's perplexing past emerges and the list of suspects multiplies, the detectives find themselves dealing with more than just dirty politics.|$|R
25|$|St. Demetrios was {{initially}} depicted in icons and mosaics {{as a young}} man in patterned robes with the distinctive tablion of the senatorial class <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Miraculous military interventions were attributed to him during several attacks on Thessaloniki, and he gradually became thought of as a soldier: a Constantinopolitan ivory of the late 10th century shows him as an infantry soldier (Metropolitan Museum of Art). But an icon of the late 11th century in Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai shows him as before, still a civilian. This may be due to iconic depiction customs on how saints are depicted.|$|E
25|$|At Trémaouézan's Église Notre-Dame (see Trémaouézan Parish close) {{the statue}} of Saint Trinité in the right side niche in the porch {{buttress}} {{on the right side}} is attributed to Bastien Prigent. God the Holy Father is depicted sitting with the body of his dead son across his knees. At Commana, see Commana Parish close Bastien Prigent is attributed with the statues of the Virgin Mary (Vierge de la Nativitė) and Joseph (Saint Joseph de la Nativitė) placed on the porch buttresses. Joseph stands with his pilgrim's stick held <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> The Virgin Mary is depicted at prayer. At Ploudiry, see Ploudiry Parish close, Bastien Prigent was responsible for {{the statue of}} Saint Sebastian in the right side buttress.|$|E
500|$|Richey Edwards had had {{long-term}} {{problems with}} alcohol abuse, depression and self-harm. During 1994, these problems had, according to Wire, [...] "escalated {{to a point}} where everybody got a bit frightened" [...] and Edwards had also begun to suffer from anorexia nervosa. During April and May, when the band played concerts in Thailand and Portugal, Edwards was habitually cutting himself and appeared onstage in Bangkok with self-inflicted wounds <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
60|$|Silas {{stood with}} arms folded <b>across</b> <b>his</b> broad <b>chest.</b> As {{he gazed at}} his sister great tears coursed down his dark cheeks and splashed on the hands which so tenderly clasped his own. Betty stood before him transformed; all signs of weariness had vanished; her eyes shone with a fateful resolve; her white and eager face was surpassingly {{beautiful}} with its light of hope, of prayer, of heroism.|$|R
50|$|Bender is {{rushed to}} a hospital, where the doctor informs {{him that he}} will never move again. He falls into a depression, but revives upon finding out that Beck's disembodied head is in the next bed, having checked in to get a {{mannequin}} body attached. Beck loans Bender a pair of neck-mounted robotic arms, which Bender uses to scrape <b>across</b> <b>his</b> mangled <b>chest,</b> and invites him to join Beck's tour as a washboard player.|$|R
60|$|But the praefect stood quietly beside him, {{with arms}} held very tightly <b>across</b> <b>his</b> mighty <b>chest,</b> <b>his</b> dark eyes fixed upon the raving {{figure on the}} couch. No one had ventured to {{approach}} him, for the feeling of superstitious awe which he had aroused in them a while ago had not wholly died down, and now {{there was such a}} look of contempt and of wrath in his face that instinctively the most sober drew away from him, and those whose minds were obscured with wine looked upon him in ever growing terror.|$|R
500|$|He {{took off}} his hat, crossed his hand <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and knelt in obeisance nine times {{offering}} worship to {{the sun and the}} mountain. He spent three days on the mountain offering prayers and thus established a strong bond of spirituality with the mountain and derived special strength from it. In the Secret History of the Mongols, [...] Genghis Khan, who later became the [...] "World Conqueror" [...] believing in his own destiny, said: ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson has {{a number}} of tattoos. On his left shoulder, he has a dragon to honor his father, which {{represents}} the [...] "protection from fear" [...] that Wilson's dad gave him. <b>Across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> he has the words [...] "In nomine patris" [...] ("In the name of the father"), and on his right wrist he has a Celtic cross with lettering that says [...] "All Honor To Him" [...] in Gaelic; both of these tattoos symbolize his Christian faith. Finally, he has Japanese Kanji characters on his arm, which symbolize his faith; they say, [...] "Father. Son. Eternal Strength." ...|$|E
500|$|University of Wyoming Associate Professor Tracey Patton sees Woo as the {{embodiment}} of the Asian fantasy woman, the seductive temptress expert in eroticism who is knowledgeable in the art of sexual pleasure unknown to the Western world. In one episode, she agreed to have sex only after her partner signed a health waiver and confidentiality agreement to protect her sexual secrets. [...] In another episode, Ling is hired by Richard Fish as an attorney in his firm, in exchange for sexual favors. [...] Ling's sexual foreplay with Richard Fish included sucking his fingers, dropping hot wax on him, and performing a [...] "hair-tickling massage" [...] on his bare chest. [...] "What she offered was not too far from an Oriental massage - hair splayed <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> his stricken face, the whole interracial thing", said Yang. [...] "It's clearly something that plays off so many deep-seated fantasies about Asian American women." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{her lips}} set firmly. Though the descent was made easier by her aid, {{the man was}} well shaken {{by the time they}} laid him {{in the bottom of the}} canoe,--so well shaken that some last shreds of {{consciousness}} were aroused. He opened his eyes and whispered hoarsely, [...] "Jacob Welse [...] . despatches [...] . from the Outside." [...] He plucked feebly at his open shirt, and <b>across</b> <b>his</b> emaciated <b>chest</b> they saw the leather strap, to which, doubtless, the despatch-pouch was slung.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly {{a slight}} noise {{brought him to}} his feet. For an instant it seemed to his dazed senses {{that one of the}} {{pictures}} opposite had walked from its frame. There, beside the table, and almost within arm's length of him, was standing a huge man, silent, motionless, with no sign of life save his fierce-glinting eyes. He was black-haired, olive-skinned, with a pointed tuft of black beard, and a great, fierce nose, towards which all his features seemed to run. His cheeks were wrinkled like a last year's apple, but his sweep of shoulder, and bony, corded hands, told of a strength which was unsapped by age. His arms were folded <b>across</b> <b>his</b> arching <b>chest,</b> and <b>his</b> mouth was set in a fixed smile.|$|R
500|$|The Mixed Tag Team Match between King Kong Bundy and his {{professional}} wrestling team of Lord Littlebrook and Little Tokyo against Hillbilly Jim {{and his own}} team of The Haiti Kid and Little Beaver was next. The rules were that only midgets could fight midgets and that neither Bundy nor Hillbilly was allowed to attack the midgets, though at one point Bundy tagged in and Little Beaver refused to tag out immediately, even hitting the [...] "Walking condominium" [...] with a drop kick to no effect before bailing with a tag to Hillbilly Jim. King Kong Bundy's team was disqualified when Bundy attacked Little Beaver, because Bundy {{was not supposed to}} be in the ring with the midgets. After Beaver had [...] "attacked" [...] Bundy on occasion during the match, he finally got caught and Bundy attacked Little Beaver, hitting him with a body slam before dropping an elbow <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. If I have to lose my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|Pandemonium reigned. Hats were flung in the air, rifles fired, {{shouts and}} curses rose and blended into one terrifying note. Gradually, {{in the midst}} of this mad uproar, the crowd became aware that another man was {{standing}} upon the stump from which Nicholas Temple had leaped. [...] "Cozby!" [...] some one yelled, [...] "Cozby!" [...] The cry was taken up. [...] "Huzzay for Cozby! He'll lead us into Caroliny." [...] He was the huge, swarthy man I had seen riding hard with Nick that morning. A sculptor might have chosen his face and frame for a type of the iron-handed leader of pioneers. Will was supreme in the great features,--inflexible, indomitable will. His hunting shirt was open <b>across</b> <b>his</b> great <b>chest,</b> <b>his</b> black hair fell to his shoulders, and he stood with a compelling hand raised for silence. And when he spoke, slowly, resonantly, men fell back before his words.|$|R
60|$|Beside him Pythagoras {{looked like}} the full stop in a semi-colon, for he was but little over five feet in height and very fat. His doublet of thick green cloth had long ago burst its buttons <b>across</b> <b>his</b> protuberent <b>chest.</b> <b>His</b> face, which was round as a full moon, was highly {{coloured}} even {{to the tip of}} his small upturned nose, and his forehead, crowned by a thick mass of red-brown hair which fell in heavy and lanky waves down to his eyebrows, was always wet and shiny. He had a habit of standing with legs wide apart, his abdomen thrust forward and his small podgy hands resting upon it. His eyes were very small and blinked incessantly. Below his double chin he wore a huge bow of starched white linen, which at this moment was sadly crumpled and stained, and his collar which also had seen more prosperous days was held together by a piece of string.|$|R
60|$|While Ned stood {{rooted to}} the spot, turning the subject over in his mind, {{and trying to find}} out by what process of {{chemical}} or mechanical action so remarkable a transformation could have been accomplished, he became aware that his uncle, old Mr Shirley, was {{standing in the middle of}} the cave regarding him with a look of mingled sarcasm and pity. He observed, too, that his uncle was not made of gold, like the people around him, but was habited in a yeomanry uniform. Mr Shirley had been a yeoman twenty years before his nephew was born. Since that time his proportions had steadily increased, and he was now a man of very considerable rotundity--so much so, that his old uniform fitted him with excessive tightness; the coat would by no means button <b>across</b> <b>his</b> capacious <b>chest,</b> and, being much too short, shewed a very undignified amount of braces below it.|$|R
2500|$|In 2014, August welcomed a {{baby boy}} named Royal August, with his then girlfriend, Desiree Twyman. [...] He has [...] "Royal" [...] tattooed <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An English missionary {{describes}} how an nganga looks during his healing performance: Thick circles of white around the eyes, {{a patch of}} red across the forehead, broad stripes of yellow are drawn down the cheeks, bands of red, white, or yellow run down the arms and <b>across</b> the <b>chest....</b> <b>His</b> dress consists of the softened skins of wild animals, either whole or in strips, feathers of birds, dried fibres and leaves, ornaments of leopard, crocodile or rat's teeth, small tinkling bells, rattling seedpods...|$|R
5000|$|At {{about the}} age of twenty a Peramangk man was ready to undergo his final {{initiation}} into full adulthood. He would be taken off to a sacred place far from the main camps of his family group and would be tattooed (Mangka Bakkendi - to make incisions in the body), <b>across</b> <b>his</b> shoulders and <b>chest</b> with a sharpened, sacred piece of rock crystal (Kauwemuka: large rock crystal which Aboriginal men conceal from women and young men until the latter are tattooed the last time, which ceremony is performed with small splinters of the rock crystal). Eyre described the various stages of this long and painful process, during which time the young man would live apart from his family and travel around to all the different places sacred to his people.|$|R
60|$|He was a big, dark-skinned {{fellow and}} carried a thick blanket folded <b>across</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. His feet and the most part of his thin legs were bare, <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and arms were powerful, and he looked truculent. He glanced at Marston curiously {{and then turned to}} Wyndham.|$|R
