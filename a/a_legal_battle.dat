5|$|British Rail {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to close the station on 15 March 1984, pending a statutory consultation process. Closure notices were posted at Marylebone. The proposals proved controversial and faced strong opposition from local authorities and the public, leading to <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>battle</b> which lasted for two years. Despite the pending closure, passenger numbers only dropped by about 400 per day from 1968 levels.

5|$|The {{year after}} the Olympics, Dix began {{the season with a}} world-leading time of 10.00seconds in Tallahassee in April. He also set a world-leading relay time of 37.92seconds with Travis Padgett, Shawn Crawford and Darvis Patton at the Penn Relays. However, he failed to {{maintain}} this strong form through the rest of 2009. Coach Teddy Long planned to improve Dix's start and acceleration in his races, but the two parted company in April. He placed third behind Michael Rodgers and Asafa Powell at the Prefontaine Classic but, unusually, this proved to {{one of the highlights of}} a low-profile year for Dix. He competed at the US Championships, but injuries forced him out of both the 100m and 200m races and he did not qualify for the World Championships. Furthermore, he entered <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>battle</b> with his management company, regarding whether they merited the 20% portion of his multimillion-dollar sponsorship contract with Nike. The dispute with his agent Kimberly Holland was resolved in July: although the terms were undisclosed, Dix left Holland's Icon Management and decided to be his own agent. With his father as his coach, <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>battle</b> and no major races to prepare for, Dix ran only a handful of local meetings in the rest of 2009.|$|E

Volcano Entertainment—the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after his death, <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>battle</b> arose over Banks' estate and the {{disposition}} of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth {{said that he had}} amended his will in October without her knowledge. The new will left all of Banks' assets to his longtime caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his will. A Chicago funeral home sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay the funeral home costs.|$|E

Ticket sales were slow in the {{weeks leading up}} to the bowl, and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12,000 tickets. Tech representatives said they might have to return as many as 8,000 tickets due to the difficulty of selling tickets for a game more than 20 hours away by car.|$|E

Although there were other lynchings as brutal as Washington's, the availability of images and the setting of his death made it a cause célèbre.

5|$|Born into {{a family}} of African royalty, Massaquoi {{grew up in the}} care of an aunt in Njagbacca, in the Garwula District of Grand Cape Mount County of {{southern}} Liberia. After seven years, she returned to the northwestern part of the country in Montserrado County, where she began her schooling. In 1922 she accompanied her father, a diplomat, to Hamburg, Germany, where she completed her school education and started a course medicine at the University of Hamburg. In 1937 she moved to the United States for further education, studying sociology and anthropology at Lane College, Fisk University and Boston University. While in the US, she collaborated on a dictionary of the Vai language and wrote her autobiography, though <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>battle</b> ensued over the rights to her story. She won an injunction barring others from publishing and returned to Liberia in 1946, immediately beginning collaboration to establish a university there, which would become the University of Liberia.|$|E
5|$|Five former Rams players also {{jumped to}} the Browns in 1946: center Mike Scarry, tackle Chet Adams and backs Gaylon Smith, Tommy Colella and Don Greenwood. Their move gave rise to <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>battle</b> with the Rams, who left Cleveland for Los Angeles shortly after winning the 1945 NFL {{championship}} rather than compete with the Browns. Reeves, the Rams' owner, filed an injunction against Adams in federal court after he signed with the Browns, claiming the tackle unlawfully broke his contract {{to play for the}} Rams. Adams argued he had no obligation under his contract to play for the Rams because the team had changed to the Los Angeles Rams following the move. At the end of August 1946, federal judge Emerich Freed denied the Rams' injunction, allowing Adams to play for the Browns. The judge rejected the Rams' contention that Adams had signed to play for Reeves, not a specific team. He ruled the Cleveland Rams had ceased to exist, and that Adams therefore was not bound to fulfill a contract with the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, two {{publishers}} started <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>battle</b> for {{the right}} to the names of the newspapers and magazines. Vandersteen, caught in the middle, worked a while for both, but eventually switched to the new owners of De Standaard. He continued to work for Ons Volkske, which was now renamed 't Kapoentje for a few more months. The publishers of De Standaard also continued the album series of Suske en Wiske, which started modestly with one album in 1946 and one in 1947. By 1947, seven albums were available, and the first ones were already reprinted. The first albums of De Familie Snoek had also appeared by then. Supported by large publicity campaigns, they sold very well: the first Snoek album was in its third impression by 1948. The popularity of Vandersteen, and the impact comics had in Flanders, is attested by the 25,000 readers who switched to the Standaard {{at the same time as}} Vandersteen did.|$|E

Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012.

By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners. On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1786, Marshall had been implicating several {{prominent}} Kentucky politicians in {{a scheme to}} take Kentucky out of the Union and into alliance with Spain. After the expiration of his Senate term, he resumed these charges {{through the pages of}} the Western World newspaper. His allegations resulted in a legislative investigation of Kentucky Court of Appeals judge Benjamin Sebastian, who was found to be receiving a pension from Spain and resigned from the bench. Federal judge Harry Innes was also a target of Marshall's allegations, and the two became embroiled in <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>battle</b> that lasted almost a decade. Innes hired William Littell to write and publish a book giving Innes' version of his dealings with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most widely read history of the state at the time. Marshall and Innes ended their legal battle with an agreement, signed in 1815, that neither would publish anything negative about the other again. Innes upheld his part of the agreement, but in 1824, years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated edition of his History of Kentucky which was just as vitriolic as the previous version had been. Marshall faded from public life during his later years. He died at the home of his son in Lexington, Kentucky on July 3, 1841.|$|E
