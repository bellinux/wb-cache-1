25|$|Walking {{for normal}} able bodied {{children}} is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> walking for below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical {{for the children}} who are amputees. Research was conducted in order to find {{the best way to get}} the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children. Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E

Jimmy Eat World also released the album's track-listing, consisting of ten songs, and [...] June 11, 2013 as the official release date.

Sayle's material covered {{a broad range of}} topics, but one of his favourite subjects remained politics. His angry persona, coupled with his vociferous delivery, gave immense bite to his material. A typical example of Sayle's humour was his attack on American phrases: [...] "If you travel to the States ... they have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of <b>different</b> words <b>than</b> like what we use.

2500|$|Otis Redding {{recorded}} a rendition of [...] "Satisfaction" [...] for his album Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul, released in 1965. Redding {{claimed that he}} did not know the lyrics of the song. [...] "I use <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of words <b>different</b> <b>than</b> the Stones' version," [...] he noted. [...] "That's because I made them up." [...] Of that session, Steve Cropper said, [...] "...if you ever listened to the record you can hardly understand the lyrics, right? I set down to a record player and copied down what I thought the lyrics were and I handed Otis a piece of paper and before we got through with the cut, he threw the paper on the floor and that was it." [...] Music writer Robert Christgau described it as an [...] "anarchic reading" [...] of the Stones' original. Redding's soul-style arrangement featured horns playing the main riff, as Keith Richards had originally intended. In 2003, Ronnie Wood noted that the Rolling Stones' later concert renditions of the number reflect Redding's interpretation.|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 472 {{weanling}} pigs (initially 13. 5 lb) {{were used in}} two experiments to evaluate the effects of wheat gluten source (WG) and combinations with spray-dried animal plasma (SDAP) on growth performance of nursery pigs. In Exp. 1, the five dietary treatments included a control diet containing 6 % SDAP, wheat gluten that was enzymatically hydrolyzed (Source 1), and a non-hydrolyzed wheat gluten (Source 2). The wheat gluten sources replaced L-lysine HCl and replaced 50 % or 100 % of the spray-dried animal plasma. From d 0 to 7, 7 to 14, and 0 to 21, increasing wheat gluten decreased (linear; P< 0. 05) ADG. There were no differences between wheat gluten sources. Average daily feed intake decreased similar to ADG, with the exception that ADFI of pigs fed wheat gluten Source 2 had only a slight decreasing trend (P< 0. 11) from d 0 to 7. Pigs fed the diet containing 6 % SDAP had the greatest ADG and ADFI from d 0 to 21. When the SDAP was replaced with either wheat gluten source, ADG and ADFI linearly decreased (P< 0. 01) but F/G improved (P< 0. 04). When pigs were fed the common diet from d 21 to 35, {{there were no differences}} (P< 0. 05) in ADG, ADFI or F/G. In Exp. 2, the six dietary treatments included a negative control with no SDAP or WG (0 : 0 ratio), 9 % WG (100 : 0 ratio), 6. 75 % WG and 1. 25 % SDAP (75 : 25 ratio) combination, 4. 5 % WG and 2. 5 % SDAP (50 : 50 ratio) combination, 2. 25 % WG and 3. 75 % SDAP (25 : 75 ratio) combination, and a positive control with 5 % SDAP (0 : 100 ratio). The wheat gluten (Source 1) was enzymatically hydrolyzed, but from <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>lot</b> <b>than</b> Exp. 1. From d 0 to 14, pigs fed 6 % SDAP had numerically greater ADG and ADFI compared to pigs fed the negative control diet. However, replacing SDAP with increasing amounts of WG tended to decrease (P< 0. 10) ADG and ADFI. These results confirm the improved ADG and ADFI of pigs fed SDAP immediately after weaning. In these experiments, replacing SDAP with WG resulted in decreased ADG...|$|R
