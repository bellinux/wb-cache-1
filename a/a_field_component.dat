40|$|The earth's {{magnetopause}} is {{the boundary}} between a hot tenuous plasma in the magnetosphere and a cooler denser plasma in the magnetosheath. Both of these plasmas contain magnetic fields whose directions are usually different but whose magnitudes are often comparable. Efforts to understand {{the structure of the}} magnetosphere have been hampered by the variability and complexity of this boundary. Waves on the magnetopause surface propagate toward the magnetotail and produce the multiple boundary crossings frequently seen by spacecraft. Boundary velocities are poorly known and range anywhere within an order of magnitude of 10 km/s. Typical thicknesses are probably of the order of a few hundred km, which is a few times the gyroradius of a thermal proton.

40|$|The energy [...] {{momentum}} tensor and the tensor {{continuity equation}} {{serve as the}} conservation laws of energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum for a continuous flow. Previously, we derived equations of motion for macroscopic electromagnetic fields in a homogeneous linear dielectric medium that is draped with a gradient-index antireflection coating (J.

40|$|A {{convergent}} second-order Cartesian grid finite difference {{scheme for}} {{the solution of}} Maxwell’s equations is presented. The scheme employs a staggered grid in space and represents the physical location of the material and metallic boundaries correctly, hence eliminating problems caused by staircasing, and, contrary to the popular Yee scheme, enforces the correct jump-conditions on the field components across material interfaces. A {{detailed analysis of the}} accuracy of the new embedding scheme is presented, confirming its second-order global accuracy. Furthermore, the scheme is proven to be a bounded error scheme and thus convergent. Conditions for fully discrete stability is furthermore established. This enables the derivation of bounds for fully discrete stability with CFL-restrictions being almost identical to those of the much simpler Yee scheme. The analysis exposes that the effects of staircasing as well as a lack of properly enforced jump-conditions on the field components have significant consequences for the global accuracy. It is, among other things, shown that for cases in which <b>a</b> <b>field</b> <b>component</b> is discontinuous along a grid line, as happens at general two- and three-dimensional material interfaces, the Yee scheme may exhibit local divergence and loss of global convergence. To validate the analysis several one- and two-dimensional test cases are presented, showing an improvement of typically 1 to 2 orders of accuracy at little or no additional computational cost over the Yee scheme, which in most cases exhibits first order accuracy. c © 2001 Academic Press Key Words: finite difference schemes; Maxwell’s equations; complex geometries; embedded interfaces; stability; staircasing...|$|E

This assay builds on currently used methods, but represents a significant improvement. Walleye pollock recruitment in the eastern Bering Sea is poorly understood but the larval stage may be important. Starvation may significantly contribute to mortality during the larval stage and our project provides a relatively quick and simple way to monitor and quantify this. Our study has a laboratory component that completes {{the development of the}} assay, and <b>a</b> <b>field</b> <b>component</b> that applies the assay to walleye pollock larvae collected from the eastern Bering Sea. The assay consists of staining larval muscle cell nuclei, using a flow cytometer to determine the fraction of cells in the S and G 2 phases of the cell cycle based on fluorescence of the nuclei, and then classifying the condition (healthy or unhealthy) of the larvae with a Discriminant Analysis model using cell cycle information, temperature, and larval size as variables. An advantage to using flow cytometry to assess condition is that many individual larvae can be analyzed over a short period of time. An improved understanding of the environmental processes affecting larval walleye pollock survival in the eastern Bering Sea will result from this project. Furthermore, this knowledge will enhance recruitment models used for managing the fishery and also expand our understanding of eastern Bering Sea ecology...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} divided into two volumes. This volume (Volume I) {{summarizes}} a structural health monitoring (SHM) system that was developed for the Iowa DOT to remotely and continuously monitor fatigue critical bridges (FCB) to aid in the detection of crack formation. The developed FCB SHM system enables bridge owners to remotely monitor FCB for gradual or sudden damage formation. The SHM system utilizes fiber bragg grating (FBG) fiber optic sensors (FOSs) to measure strains at critical locations. The strain-based SHM system is trained with measured performance data to identify typical bridge response when subjected to ambient traffic loads, and that knowledge is used to evaluate newly collected data. At specified intervals, the SHM system autonomously generates evaluation reports that summarize the current behavior of the bridge. The evaluation reports are collected and distributed to the bridge owner for interpretation and decision making. Volume II summarizes the development and demonstration of an autonomous, continuous SHM system {{that can be used to}} monitor typical girder bridges. The developed SHM system can be grouped into two main categories: an office component and <b>a</b> <b>field</b> <b>component.</b> The office component is a structural analysis software program that can be used to generate thresholds which are used for identifying isolated events.

The field monitoring software has been developed such that, once started, it will operate autonomously with minimal user interaction. In general, the SHM system features two key uses.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 has caused major global concern over a potential pandemic and since its emergence in 1996 has become the longest persisting HPAI virus in history. HPAI viruses are generally restricted to domestic poultry populations, however, their origins are found in wild bird reservoirs (Anatidae waterfowl) in a low-pathogenic or non-lethal form. Understanding the spatial and temporal interface between wild and domestic populations is fundamental to taking action against the virus, yet this information is lacking. My dissertation takes two approaches to increase our understanding of wild bird and H 5 N 1 transmission. The first includes <b>a</b> <b>field</b> <b>component</b> to track the migratory patterns of bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) and ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) from the large H 5 N 1 outbreak at Qinghai Lake, China. The satellite telemetry study revealed a new migratory connection between Qinghai Lake and outbreak regions in Mongolia, and provided ecological data that supplements phylogenetic analyses of virus movement. The second component of my dissertation research took a modeling approach to identify areas of high transmission risk between domestic poultry and wild waterfowl in China, the epicenter of H 5 N 1. This effort required the development of spatial models for both the poultry and wild waterfowl species of China. Using multivariate regression and AIC to determine statistical relationships between poultry census data and remotely-sensed environmental predictors, I generated spatially explicit distribution models for China's three main poultry species: chickens, ducks, and geese. I then developed spatially explicit breeding and wintering season models of presence-absence, abundance, and H 5 N 1 prevalence for each of China's 42 Anatidae waterfowl species. The poultry and waterfowl datasets were used as the main inputs for the transmission risk models. Distinct patterns in both the spatial and temporal distributions of H 5 N 1 risk was observed in the model predictions. All models included estimates of uncertainty, and sensitivity analyses were performed for the risk models...|$|E
