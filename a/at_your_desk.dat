2500|$|Storyboard artists Simon Duric said [...] "The {{security}} on the film was a challenge. That script was locked in a safe. Most of the time on a film you can sit <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>desk</b> {{with a copy of}} the script next to you. On this, you couldn’t. That’s fine but it was tricky in places. We had people flying drones over Pinewood studios trying to take photographs. It was nuts. If a prop was being moved we had to have them covered in a big black sheet. We were told in an email to be [...] of drones." ...|$|E

40|$|Do {{you receive}} music {{questions}} <b>at</b> <b>your</b> reference <b>desk?</b> Are you {{in charge of}} purchasing music books, scores, and media materials? Do you catalog music materials? If you said yes {{to any of the}} above, this session is for you! In this lightning round style presentation, you’ll hear from a panel of music librarians who work in public, academic and archival settings. Learn about resources to use for collection development, resources to ease cataloging music materials, resources to answer those tricky reference questions, and how the Pacific NW Chapter of the Music Library Association acts as a networking resource for music‐related questions. Attached here are the Powerpoint slides for the portion of the panel presented by Mary Wise, Catalog Librarian at Central Washington University...|$|R
5000|$|To {{promote their}} 2009 album, Get Color, the band held a {{sweepstakes}} contest, {{in which a}} winner of a golden ticket was awarded a free trip to Los Angeles to go to Six Flags Magic Mountain with the band. Other prizes included locks of the band members' hair and posters autographed in blood. The album earned a score of eight from Pitchfork in which the review claimed “Never merely meager, this project delivers, both when you're waving your orgy-snorkel all blotto on-the-town, and for a soundtrack to serious rumination <b>at</b> <b>your</b> midday <b>desk</b> of harsh reality.” Duzsik agreed with an interviewer that Get Color was indeed more accessible than their self-titled debut, but “It’s still crazy, though.” The track [...] "Die Slow" [...] was released as the album’s single with its music video garnering nearly 500,000 views. The album received a positive score of 7.4 on Pitchfork.|$|R
40|$|A single glance <b>at</b> <b>your</b> crowded <b>desk</b> {{is enough}} to locate your {{favorite}} cup. But finding an unfamiliar object requires more effort. This superiority in recognition performance for learned objects has at least two possible sources. For familiar objects observers might: 1) select more informative image locations upon which to fixate their eyes, or 2) extract more information from a given eye fixation. To test these possibilities, we had observers localize fragmented objects embedded in dense displays of random contour fragments. Eight participants searched for objects in 600 images while their eye movements were recorded in three daily sessions. Performance improved as subjects trained with the objects: The number of fixations required to find an object decreased by 64 % across the 3 sessions. An ideal observer model that included measures of fragment confusability was {{used to calculate the}} information available from a single fixation. Comparing human performance to the model suggested that across sessions information extraction at each eye fixation increased markedly, by an amount roughly equal to the extra information that would be extracted following a 100 % increase in functional field of view. Selection of fixation locations, on the other hand, did not improve with practice...|$|R

6000|$|It was Xmas Eve on the Old Homestead. Reader, do you know, by sight, the Old Homestead? In the pauses of <b>your</b> work <b>at</b> <b>your</b> city <b>desk,</b> {{where you}} have grown rich and avaricious, does it never rise before your mind's eye, the quiet old {{homestead}} that knew you as a boy before your greed of gold tore you away from it? The Old Homestead that stands beside the road just on {{the rise of the}} hill, with its dark spruce trees wrapped in snow, the snug barns and the straw stacks behind it; while from its windows there streams a shaft of light from a coal-oil lamp, about as thick as a slate pencil that you can see four miles away, {{from the other side of}} the cedar swamp in the hollow. Don't talk to me of your modern searchlights and your incandescent arcs, beside that gleam of light from the coal-oil lamp in the farmhouse window. It will shine clear to the heart across thirty years of distance. Do you not turn, I say, sometimes, reader, from the roar and hustle of the city with its ill-gotten wealth and its godless creed of mammon, to think of the quiet homestead under the brow of the hill? You don't! Well, you skunk! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{this same}} habit that {{confirms}} some of us, who {{are capable of}} better things, in Lucifer's own pride and stubbornness--that confirms and deepens others of us in villainy--more of us in indifference--that hardens us from day to day, according to the temper of our clay, like images, and leaves us as susceptible as images to new impressions and convictions. You shall judge of its influence on me, John. For more years than I need name, I had my small, and exactly defined share, in the management of Dombey's House, and saw your brother (who has proved himself a scoundrel! Your sister will forgive my being obliged to mention it) extending and extending his influence, until the business and its owner were his football; and saw you toiling <b>at</b> <b>your</b> obscure <b>desk</b> every day; and was quite content to be as little troubled as I might be, out of my own strip of duty, and to let everything about me go on, day by day, unquestioned, like a great machine--that was its habit and mine--and to take it all for granted, and consider it all right. My Wednesday nights came regularly round, our quartette parties came regularly off, my violoncello was in good tune, and there was nothing wrong in my world--or if anything not much--or little or much, it was no affair of mine.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{is for me}} not {{to allow}} you to study," [...] replied Forester, [...] "all this forenoon, but to require you to sit still <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>desk,</b> with nothing to do.

I fail to see anything in my conduct which has given you just reason to complain." ...|$|E

[...] "Look <b>at</b> <b>your</b> desk," [...] he said piteously; [...] "there's another proof how hard you are on me. I used to keep the key of <b>your</b> <b>desk</b> in London.

If {{you get tired of}} sitting <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>desk,</b> you may take your board and your chalk out to the door and sit upon the step. You must spend all the time in making the letters on the board, and you may say a and b while you are making the letters, but besides that you must not speak a word. For every time that you speak, except to say a and b, after I tell you to begin, you will have to pick up a basket of chips." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better than that!" [...] she shouted, and {{she brought}} {{an open letter}} from behind her, and flourished it before him, while she went on breathlessly: [...] "It's from Godolphin, and of course I opened it at once, for I thought if there was {{anything}} worrying in it, I had better find it out while you were gone, and prepare you for it. He's sent you a check for $300--twelve performances of the play--and he's written you the sweetest letter in the world, and I take back everything I ever said against him! Here, shall I read it? Or, no, you'll want to read it yourself. Now, sit down <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>desk,</b> and I'll put it before you, with the check on top!" ...|$|E

You are not good for much, but you can spin out yards of what you and your friends, I suppose, call literature; and some people seem to enjoy reading it. Very well: you sit there and write this literature, or {{whatever}} it is, and keep your mind fixed on that. I will see to everything else for you. I will provide you with writing materials, and books of wit and humour, and paste and scissors, and everything else that {{may be necessary to}} you in your trade; and I will feed you and clothe you and lodge you, and I will take you about to places that you wish to go to; and I will see that you have plenty of tobacco and all other things practicable that you may desire--provided that you work well. The more work you do, and the better work you do, the better I shall look after you. You write--that is all I want you to do." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{were seven}} {{rooms in the}} house, but only two were of public note, the school-room, which was downstairs, and the blue-and-white room above. The school-room was so long that it looked very low in the ceiling, {{and it had a}} carpet, and on the walls were texts as well as maps. Miss Ailie's desk {{was in the middle of}} the room, and there was another desk in the corner; a cloth had been hung over it, as one covers a cage to send the bird to sleep. Perhaps Miss Ailie thought that a bird had once sung there, for this had been the desk of her sister, Miss Kitty, who died years before Tommy came to Thrums. Dainty Miss Kitty, Miss Kitty with the roguish curls, it is strange to think that you are dead, and that only Miss Ailie hears you singing now <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>desk</b> in the corner! Miss Kitty never sang there, but the playful ringlets were once the bright thing in the room, and Miss Ailie sees them still, and they are a song to her.|$|E

5000|$|When Internet hunting was {{introduced}} in 2005, allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns, the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase.

Sitting <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>desk</b> in front of your computer, clicking at a mouse, {{has nothing to do with}} hunting." ...|$|E

50|$|Momentary forgetting, such as forgetting {{what you}} wanted to get from the kitchen after getting up from your desk, is {{frequently}} experienced in day-to-day life.

For example, imagine sitting <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>desk</b> and deciding {{you want to get a}} drink from the kitchen. Once you get to the kitchen, you completely forget {{what you wanted}} there. If you return to your desk, you will most likely remember what you wanted from the kitchen.|$|E
