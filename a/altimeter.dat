40|$|Flight {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} to determine the repeatability of the over-all altimetry errors in the landing-approach condition of two sensitive <b>altimeters</b> (Air Force type C- 12) installed in the cockpit of a transport airplane and of four precision <b>altimeters</b> (Air Force type MA- 1) installed in a photo-observer. Data were obtained through a speed range of 62 to 100 knots during 42 landing-approach operations conducted on four different days. The results of the tests show that the repeatability errors of the two sensitive <b>altimeters</b> are +/- 35 feet and +/- 39 feet. These errors are of the same order as the maximum repeatability error measured in previous tests of eleven airplanes of the same type. For {{each of the four}} flights of the present tests the mean values of the data obtained with the two sensitive <b>altimeters</b> shifted by relatively large amounts, apparently because of the interaction of the stability and aftereffect- recovery characteristics of the instruments. For concurrent measurements of the over-all errors of the four precision <b>altimeters,</b> it is concluded that for comparable installations, the repeatability errors measured with these <b>altimeters</b> would be smaller than those measured with the sensitive <b>altimeters...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{study by}} the Naval Research Laboratory {{published}} in January 1965 found that, of four different designs of pilot <b>altimeters,</b> the 3p design was the one most prone to misreading by pilots. The study revealed that the 3p design was misread almost eight times more often than the best-designed of the four <b>altimeters</b> tested. It was also noted that it took the pilots considerably longer to decipher the correct reading of the 3p than with the other <b>altimeters.</b>|$|R

5|$|Tests were {{conducted}} with a frequency modulated type radar <b>altimeter</b> known as AYD and a pulse type known as 718. The AYD modifications {{were made by the}} Norden Laboratories Corporation under an OSRD contract. When the manufacturer of 718, RCA, was contacted, it was learned that a new tail warning radar, AN/APS-13, later nicknamed Archie, was just entering production, which could be adapted for use as a radar <b>altimeter.</b> The third unit to be made was delivered to Los Alamos in April 1944. In May it was tested by diving an AT-11. This was followed by full-scale drop testing in June and July. These were very successful, whereas the AYD continued to suffer from problems. Archie was therefore adopted, although the scarcity of units in August 1944 precluded wholescale destructive testing. Testing of Silverplate Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft with Thin Man bomb shapes was carried out at Muroc Army Air Field in March and June 1944.|$|E
5|$|During a flyby on 26 September 2012, Cassinis radar {{detected}} in Titan's northern polar region {{what is likely}} a river with a length of more than 400 kilometers. It has been compared with the much larger Nile river on Earth. This feature is connected to Ligeia Mare. Later, a paper ("Liquid-filled Canyons on Titan") published on Geophysical Research Letters on 9 August 2016 reported about the May 2013 Cassini RADAR <b>altimeter</b> observation of Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received <b>altimeter</b> echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are {{at the same level}} as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea {{but there are a few}} isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.|$|E

5|$|On 10 August 1959, a B-52 {{crashed in}} the Spruce Swamp at Fremont, New Hampshire. The bomber {{was on a}} routine {{training}} mission from Chicopee, Massachusetts, when its air speed indicator and <b>altimeter</b> failed, which led to more serious malfunctions. The B-52 was attempting to make an emergency landing at Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, the only landing option not affected by foggy weather conditions. However, it crashed before making the landing. The U.S. Air Force reported {{that it was the}} first B-52 crash where the entire crew survived; the crew parachuted to safety.

5|$|The Meteorological Flight {{first came}} into being on 1 November 1924. Its main {{priority}} was identifying temperature, pressure, humidity and general weather conditions being logged at sea level to 18,000 feet. These flights were named THUM (Temperature/Humidity). Changes in air conditions usually came in the Atlantic in the west. The Meteorological Office (MET) relied on reports from ships in this regard. The need for aircraft for operations was ignored in 1939 owing to lack of aircraft. However, in June 1940, Bomber Command started to become anxious about base landing conditions and the accuracy of general forecasts. In response from strong support, No. 403 Squadron RAF, No. 404 Squadron RAF and No. 405 Squadron RAF were formed for this purpose. The routes requested by the MET usually involved distances of up to 1,000nm. Hudsons were ideal for this operation, but since none were available Bristol Blenheims filled the role. On 1 March 1941 Coastal Command assumed operational control of all the units. They were redesignated No. 1401 to 1406 flights. All were handed over to No. 18 Group RAF. In October 1940, two more flights, 1407 and 1408 were sent to Iceland to begin operations from there. Several types of single engine aircraft were used; Gloster Gladiators, Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires. Operations were conducted mostly up to 15,000 feet in wartime as the aneroid capsule <b>altimeter</b> {{was not able to}} give accurate readings. A Mk. 14B ICAN <b>altimeter</b> was used. The aircraft had to be flown at the height measured for two minutes to allow the readings to settle or stabilise.|$|E

The waveform retracker used to estimate the key geophysical variables for the <b>altimeters</b> on the Jason- 1 and Jason- 2 satellites shows increased small-scale variability since the problem is ill-conditioned. A simple empirical adjustment to ? 0 improves the separability between various parameters and also improves the along-track profiles of ? 0. This leads to i) more realistic wind fields, ii) better discrimination of rain events, and iii) improved comparison between the Jason- 1 and Jason- 2 <b>altimeters</b> during their tandem mission...|$|R

5|$|On September26, the Hurricane Hunter P2V-3W Neptune {{aircraft}} Snowcloud Five, led by U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Grover B. Windham, {{was sent}} from Guantánamo Bay to investigate Janet, {{which was at}} the time a Category4 hurricane south of Jamaica. Upon penetration of the hurricane's eyewall at an altitude of 700ft (200m), a final transmission was received from the reconnaissance flight before it presumably crashed in the Caribbean Sea. All 11people on board, including nine crew members and two journalists, were killed. Following the loss of the plane, an extensive search and rescue operation took place over a large area of the Caribbean Sea, with 3,000personnel involved with the search, returning no results. The exact cause of the crash remains unknown, though it is speculated that the plane's <b>altimeter</b> gave an incorrect reading due to the low surrounding barometric pressure. Although four hurricane reconnaissance flights have been lost since operations began in 1943, Snowcloud Five remains the only known loss of a reconnaissance aircraft {{as a result of a}} hurricane in the Atlantic basin, with the other three occurring as a result of Pacific typhoons.|$|E
5|$|The Little Boy pre-assemblies were {{designated}} L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, L-6, L-7, and L-11. L-1, L-2, L-5, and L-6 were expended in test drops. The first drop test {{was conducted with}} L-1 on 23 July 1945. It was dropped over the sea near Tinian {{in order to test}} the radar <b>altimeter</b> by the B-29 later known as Big Stink, piloted by Colonel Paul W.

Tibbets was the pilot for both missions, but this time the bomber used was the one subsequently known as Jabit. L-6 was used as a dress rehearsal on 29 July. The B-29 Next Objective, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney, flew to Iwo Jima, where emergency procedures for loading the bomb onto a standby aircraft were practiced. This rehearsal was repeated on 31 July, but this time L-6 was reloaded onto a different B-29, Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, and the bomb was test dropped near Tinian. L-11 was the assembly used for the Hiroshima bomb.|$|E
5|$|The first Ju 88s {{took off}} at 23:00 and began {{heading toward the}} Dutch coast where they dived to sea level and stayed at {{approximately}} 50 metres while they flew out to sea. Crews were forbidden to engage enemy aircraft over the North Sea {{in order to preserve}} surprise until the last possible moment. The rain and squall assisted crews in judging the location and distance of the water. However, with crews prone to human error, it was decided to use the very accurate FuG 101 radar <b>altimeter</b> and the Ju 88s blind-flying instruments. The strain on the crews was enormous, as a careful vigil was kept on them until the British coast was reached and the pilot began his ascent to the height of the returning bomber stream. As they did so, the Ju 88s released Düppel to obscure the radar of Mosquito fighters. The pilots were then free to begin their attacks.|$|E

Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an <b>altimeter,</b> airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward.

5|$|The third mass {{production}} {{model of the}} He 111H was the H-16, entering production in late 1942. Armament was as on the H-11, with some differences. The 20mm MG FF cannon was deleted, as the H-16s were seldom employed on low-level missions, was replaced with a single MG 131 in a flexible installation in the nose (A-Stand). On some aircraft, designated He 111H-16/R1, the dorsal position {{was replaced by a}} Drehlafette DL 131 electrically powered turret, armed with a single MG 131. The two beam and the aft ventral positions were provided with MG 81Zs, as on the H-11. The two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Jumo 211 F-2 provided a maximum speed of 434km/h (270mph) at 6,000m (19,690ft); cruising speed was 390km/h (242mph), service ceiling was 8,500m (27,900ft).Funkgerät (FuG) radio equipment. FuG 10P, FuG 16, FuBl Z and APZ 6 were fitted for communication and navigation at night, while some aircraft received the FuG 101a radio <b>altimeter.</b> The H-16 retained its eight ESAC internal bomb cells; four bomb cells, as on previous versions could be replaced by a fuel tank to increase range.

Empty weight was 6,900kg (15,210lb) and the aircraft weighed 14,000kg (30,860lb) fully loaded for take off. German factories built 1,155 H-16s between the end of 1942 and the end of 1943; in addition, 280 H-6s and 35 H-11s were updated to H-16 standard. An undetermined number of H variants were fitted with the FuG 200 Hohentwiel. The radar was adapted as an anti-shipping detector for day or night operations.|$|E
