40|$|Abstract The world’s first ship-to-ship {{automatic}} dock-ing {{system has}} been developed to provide a safe and reli-able solution for docking between two ships exchanging containers in ocean. The system consists of vacuum pads, robot <b>arms,</b> <b>cables,</b> automatic winches and fenders. Basi-cally, the docking status is maintained by contact force of fenders and cable tension controlled by automatic winches. All the developmental procedures from the conceptual design to the final prototype-system demonstration are presented focusing {{on the details of}} the two most important features: the passive- and emergency-mode controls. The passive-mode control makes the docking system freely follow the relative motion between the two ships without resistance. In case of emergency, the emergency-mode control is activated and the docking connection can be instantly released. A prototype was built to demonstrate the technical and operational feasibility in the actual ocean environment...|$|R

The Unimation controller has a classical hierarchical structure as shown in Figure 1. 1. The host, in the factory configuration an LSI- 11 / 2 running the VAL robot language, communicates with the Arm Interface Board (AIB) over a bidirectional parallel bus. The AIB in turn communicates with six digital servo boards over a custom wired DEC double-height backplane, see Figure 1. 2. These boards execute commands (such as position setpoint setting, reading current encoder values, and miscellaneous parameter setting) as well as implementing the position control loop. They connect through the backplane to the analog servo boards which implement nested velocity and current control loops.

In Cable #24, Hope and Cable return to the present time but Bishop follows them. He attacks them, running Cable through with a sword.

40|$|Agrawal, Sunil K. Accurately aiming {{and firing}} a pistol {{requires}} a steady hand. While many devices can steady a shooter's arm or hand by restricting movement or {{degrees of freedom}}, few devices actively reduce involuntary tremors while allowing larger voluntary aiming movements. This paper details the design, fabrication, and experimental evaluation of an arm exoskeleton that can actively damp arm tremors while allowing voluntary aiming movements. The MAXFAS (Mobile Arm eXoskeleton for Firearm Aim Stabilization) device allows five degrees of freedom, controlling four degrees of freedom using thin steel cables. The cable-driven architecture allows the control motors to be mounted away from the arm, resulting in device that adds very little weight and inertia to the <b>arm.</b> The <b>cables</b> attach to braces that are mounted on the forearm and upper arm. Weight of MAXFAS is further reduced compared to conventional arm exoskeletons through the careful design and manufacture of the braces using stiff, lightweight carbon fiber composites. The initial design called for tremorous movement to be filtered out from voluntary motion, and an adaptive algorithm to provide a tremor-cancelling signal to the cable control motors. Experiments described in this paper involved a control method which used the motors to only actively allow voluntary motion, thus attempting to passively damp tremorous motion. The device was evaluated on subjects performing a pistol aiming task, using an airsoft pistol with a laser sight. Results indicate that this simpler control mode was effective at reducing the amplitude of motion in all five degrees of freedom. During a simulated shooting task, this control mode improved shooting performance both while subjects were wearing the device, as well as 5 minutes after removing the device. These results will be discussed, and future experiments will be suggested. University of Delaware, Department of Mechanical EngineeringM. S. M. E...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{describes}} a shooting method for computing three-dimensional equilibria of pre-curved nonlinear beams with axial and shear flexibility using the intrinsic beam formulation. For distributed and concentrated follower loads {{acting on a}} cantilevered beam, the method amounts to a direct solution approach requiring only a single shot (zero iterations) to compute the equilibria. This is possible since the system equations are defined in a local coordinate system that rotates and translates with the beam, akin to the follower loads themselves. A general procedure employing nonconservative follower loads, which invokes the Picard–Lindelöf theorem on uniqueness and existence of solutions, is also introduced for finding all solutions for three-dimensional pre-curved beam problems with conservative loading. This is particularly useful in beam buckling problems where multiple stable and unstable solutions exist. Three-dimensional equilibrium solutions are generated for many loading cases and boundary conditions, including three-dimensional helical beams, and are compared to similar solutions where available in the literature. Excellent agreement is documented in all comparison cases. For buckling examples, {{the stability of the}} computed solutions is assessed using a dynamic finite element code based on the same intrinsic beam equations. Due to the ability to avoid iteration, the presented approach may find application in model-based control for practical three-dimensional problems such as the control of manipulators utilized in endoscopic surgeries and the control of spacecraft with robotic <b>arms</b> and long <b>cables...</b>|$|R

Although other engineering seismic guns which fire blank or projectile sources are available, {{they are for}} near-surface shots and {{are not meant to}} be used for downhold seismic surveys in water-filled boreholes. The EDG was designed primarily for checkshot surveys (well travel-time surveys) and high-quality reflection/refraction tests, but potential applications include shallow vertical seismic profiling and borehole to borehole or borehole to surface tomography, as well as optimum offset and common midpoint seismic reflection surveys. The EDG consists off four steel subassemblies: (1) chamber; (2) breech; (3) pipe; and (4) hanger. A blank 8 -gauge electrical shell is held by the chamber and is detonated by an electrode located inside the breech. O-ring seals prevent water from entering the breech and causing short circuits.

50|$|The Falcon {{in essence}} is a {{consumer}} robot. It consists of its grip connected via three arms to a roughly conical body, which {{sits on a}} U-shaped base. Each of the three arms moves {{in and out of}} the Falcon's body. The default grip is a small spherical grip with 4 buttons on the top. The buttons are the Novint Logo for the primary button (which is similar to an 'N'), an upside down triangle (similar to a 'V'), a lightning bolt (similar to an 'N'), and a plus (similar to a 'T'), which collectively make the letters 'NVNT', the consonants in Novint's name and its ticker symbol as a public company. At the front flattened point of the Falcon's conical housing is a Novint Falcon logo that lights up in different colors to indicate the state of the device. The body contains 3 motors, each attached to one of the Falcon's <b>arms</b> by a <b>cable</b> that is wrapped around a capstan on the motor. As each of the 3 arms moves, an optical sensor attached to each motor keeps track of the movements of the arm. A mathematical function called a Jacobian is then used to determine the position of a three-dimensional cursor in Cartesian coordinates based on the positions of the arms. The position of that haptic cursor is therefore controlled by the Falcon's movements, and is used by the Falcon's software to determine the forces to be applied to the user. Currents are sent to the motors at the 1 kHz servo rate to present the user with an accurate sense of touch. In this way, a force can be applied to the grip in any direction, up to the maximum force (over 2 pounds of force), every 1/1000 of a second.|$|R
