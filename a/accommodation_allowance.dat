40|$|This chapter {{reflects}} critically on {{the relevance}} of current quality grading and assurance schemes to small accommodation enterprises in which a home dimension is a common feature. The discussion focuses specifically on the cases of New Zealand and Scotland, looking comparatively at the nature of small tourist accommodation businesses and at the quality grading and assurance schemes in place in those contexts. It is suggested that the benchmark for such quality assurance and grading schemes should be a much greater emphasis upon {{the importance of the}} host-guest relationship. Rather than simply being concerned with the objective facets of <b>accommodation,</b> <b>allowance</b> needs to be taken of subjective elements of the accommodation experience; what it feels like for the guest who is staying, and what guest has to say about a place. In this way, it is suggested that a tendency towards standardization, perceived to be harmful to the reality of the accommodation product, might be avoided...|$|E
40|$|About 6, 000 refugees, {{asylum seekers}} and torture claimants (collectively “protection claimants”) are {{struggling}} to survive in Hong Kong. It is undoubted that they are an underprivileged and marginalized group in Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong is not the signatory of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, protection claimants do not enjoy legal status or formal rights to welfare services in Hong Kong. Without the right to work, protection claimants must survive on $ 1, 500 a month for accommodation and bags of food equivalent to $ 1, 200, or they may risk to work illegally in Hong Kong. This thesis examines how Hong Kong refugee policy affects the life of protection claimants in terms of right to work, food assistance and <b>accommodation</b> <b>allowance.</b> These factors are of paramount importance {{to the life of}} protection claimants. Drawing on qualitative participant-observations and in-depth interviews with protection claimants, it demonstrates the primary and secondary consequences that caused by the current refugee policy.

In particular it examined how the compromises and sacrifices low-income households must make to procure housing jeopardises {{their ability to}} promote and maintain health. Health within this study was defined holisticly including physical, mental, spiritual and family aspects {{as well as the}} dimension of ontological security. The participants were comprised of three groups: housing workers, community health workers, and most importantly the households in housing need. All participants were or had been connected with Monte Cecilia Emergency House. The role of the state, past and present, in assisting low-income households to obtain accommodation was examined. Particular consideration was given to changes which have occurred in the lost-cost rental sector through the move to market-level rents for state housing, and the introduction of a targeted, abatable <b>accommodation</b> <b>allowance.</b> The participants' stories demonstrated an increasing and serious level of unaffordability of rental housing. This had brought about both immediate and long-term detriments to health due to living in over-crowded accommodation and / or a residual post-rent income insufficient to maintain an adequate standard of living. Tangata Whenua and Tagata Pasifika were disproportionately affected by unaffordable housing. The need for a return to income-related state housing was high-lighted.

40|$|Summary In the {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis Selected Economic Aspects of Social Care Services, I present a definition and {{an overview of the}} statutory regulation of social care services in the historical perspective and from the viewpoint of the valid law. The subsequent section, which is the core segment of {{the theoretical}} part of my thesis, sets forth a specification and a general outline of all social care services available in our jurisdiction. The chapter about the funding of social services identifies the available financial resources, and the range of options associated with the payment of social care services. The services and particularly the financing methods constitute a frequent topic for discussion among all main initiators (promoters, movers) of social services. In the practical part of the thesis, I present an identification of financial resources of one selected social service provider, and an analysis of its income from transfers, users payments for meals, from the <b>accommodation</b> and care <b>allowances,</b> and other revenue generated from 2005 to 2015. This part of the thesis also shows a comparison of the amount of individual transfers and payments from users, including per-user care allowance per year and month in the period from 2005 to 2015. The analysis is then used to identify the system for subsidy allocation, to draw conclusions on specific findings, and to present some recommendations.

That is, job in high motivation (intrinsic) and hygiene (extrinsic) factors leads to high performance and few complaints among employees. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the Effect of Motivation factors on Teachers’ Performance in Tanzania Education institutions; A Case of Public Secondary Schools in Nyamagana district Mwanza [...] A descriptive research design which incorporated quantitative and qualitative approaches was adopted to investigate motivation factors that influence teacher’s performance. A survey was carried out with 148 respondents including ordinary teachers, department teachers and head teachers in public secondary schools in Nyamagana district, Mwanza. In addition, in depth interviews were carried out with head teachers. Data was analyzed by using descriptive statistics of SPSS package. The study revealed that the motivation for persons to join the teaching profession was job security and absence of job alternatives but salary was a low consideration. The study further revealed that the majority of teachers were motivated by intrinsic factors, while a small percentage by extrinsic factors despite the fact that salary was inadequate. Furthermore, although not all extrinsic motivation factors (such as free meals, regular salary payment, leave of absence, free <b>accommodation</b> and weekly <b>allowances)</b> were available to teachers, the majority of teachers were concerned more about the inadequacy of current salary levels to meet their basic needs. The study recommends immediate increase the salary of secondary school teachers to match increases in the cost of living, provision of accommodation to teachers and strengthening of supervision. The study also suggests areas for research and these included but not limiting to investigation of innovative teachers’ motivation strategies, students’ satisfaction with relation to teachers’ performance and extension of the same study of other regions in Tanzania before generalization of results...|$|R

According to him, the beneficiaries includes Yerima Abdullahi, Chief Bode George, Peter Odili, Jim Nwobodo, Attahiru Bafarawa and Ahmadu Ali.He transferred N300 million to BAM Properties, whose account details were sent to him by Bello Haliru, a former National Chairman of the People's Democratic Party. He also {{claimed to have}} sent N200 million to Bello Sarkin Yaki, the Governorship aspirant in Kebbi State. According to him, Mahmud Shinkafi, the former Governor of Zamfara State, received ₦100 million.Bashir's confessional statement reads For the cash disbursement of ₦600million, it was meant for the six zonal chairmen for Contact and Mobilisation Committees for Election of 2015. The chairmen are Bode George, Amb. Yerima Abdullahi; Peter Odili; Attahiru Bafarawa; Jim Nwobodo; Ahmadu Ali. The sum of ₦100million was given to each chairman. I gave the money in company of Prof. Alkali, who was Political Adviser to former president. The zonal chairmen are for the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP). I also instructed Jabbama Limited to transfer the sum of N100m to Dalhatu Limited on the request of Attahiru Bafarawa. I also remember that Bello Sarkin Yaki was among the people that the then NSA instructed that I send the sum of N200million to. He was the PDP gubernatorial candidate in Kebbi State. I knew the chairman of Stallion Limited whose second name I cannot remember. Between December 2014 to June 2015, on the instruction of the then NSA, I introduced Jabbama Limited to a staff of the company on the instruction of the chairman. When the account was in credit, disbursement was made {{from time to time}} on the instruction of the then NSA. Part in foreign exchange or transfers. I wish to add that sometime in February 2015, I instructed Jabbama to transfer the sum of N300m to BAM Properties. The account was given to me by Bello Haliru as one of the people the former NSA requested me to give money. I also remember that Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi was sent the sum of N100million on the instruction of the then NSA. Further to my statement of 30th November, 2015, I have brought the sum of $829,800(equivalent to N200m) and N600m was given to me to distribute to the six PDP Zonal Committee chairmen. I don’t know who are the directors of Dalhatu Investment Limited but funds were transferred to the company’s account on the instruction of Dalhatu Bafarawa for the total amount of N1.5billion received from the then NSA by Jabbama Limited. I shall endeavour to recover the sum of N600million given to the six zonal PDP committee chairmen, while I appeal to the commission to use their machineries to trace the remaining balance of the money transferred to various accountsIn a counter-claim, Chief Bode George denied the allegations of receiving a total sum of ₦100 million from Yuguda for the 2015 general election. He described the claim by Yuguda as “mischievous and deliberately fraudulent.”Bode's statement reads “My attention has been drawn to another mischievous and deliberately fraudulent claim that I collected N100 million from Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance. This is another blatant falsehood, stripped of any iota of truth. This is yet again a depraved continuation of lynch mob journalism orchestrated by an online newspaper. The salient fact is that very early this year, long before the election period, the party set up Contact and Mobilization Committee for each zone to reconcile various factions and ensure a firm unity of purpose within the zones before the election. I was elected as the Chairman for the South-West zone. The committee which was made up of 18 senior members of the party with distinguished history of honour and exemplary leadership, met at least 10 times in my office in Lagos. These people travelled all the way from every corner of the South-West, with three members representing each state. All of them are very much alive to testify to my assertions. Sometime in the middle of these deliberations, Yuguda {{came to me and said}} the party was reimbursing the 18 elders of the committee for their transportation, <b>accommodation</b> and feeding <b>allowance</b> for the work that was done. The committee later submitted the report of its deliberations to the party and then wound up. For all these efforts Yuguda gave the committee only $30,000. That was less than N6 million at that time. Yuguda can never claim that he gave the Committee N100 million. That is the figment of the imagination of rascally scribblers purporting to be journalists. Again, facts are sacred.” ...|$|R

Dr Hopper’s contribution, “Coming Off the Rails”, focuses on O’Brien’s most inventive and intriguing short story, “John Duffy’s Brother” (1940), which was made into an award-winning short film in 2006. The essay discusses both the story and the film, and explores some of its more secretive subtexts. It also locates the story as one of the earliest, and most exuberant, examples of post-modern fiction.
