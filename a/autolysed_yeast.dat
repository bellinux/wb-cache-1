40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{monitored}} {{the evolution of the}} fermentative capacity of the 8 selected yeast strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{under the influence of the}} following compounds: perhydrol, lactic acid 90 %, acetic acid, chlorhydric acid, sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, magnesium chloride and sodium bisulphite. the greater number of <b>autolysed</b> <b>yeast</b> cells was obtained in case of addition of 90 % lactic acid at pH 3, 0. 2 % sodium bisulphite and acetic acid at pH 3. The lowest number of <b>autolysed</b> <b>yeast</b> cells was obtained with 0. 1 % ammonium chloride, perhydrol and 0. 1 % magnesium chloride...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: A {{number of}} media have been {{developed}} for the production of micro-coccin. A satisfactory medium consists of corn steep liquor to 1800 mg. N/ 1. with an aqueous extract of dried <b>autolysed</b> <b>yeast</b> to 1800 mg. N/l., which gives titres of the order of 40 - 6 Opg. micrococcin/ml. in 3 days. A soluble yeast extract such as Marmite may be used in place of the dried <b>autolysed</b> <b>yeast.</b> Moderate aeration is required for good titres but initial pH is relatively unimportant, any value in the range 6. 0 - 7. 0 being suitable. The main energy source in sugar-free media is probably the aerobic oxidative deamination of amino-acids. An inoculum that has been pre-incubated gives better results than an inoculum used immediately after it has been prepared. The addition of various inorganic ions to the medium was tried without any detectable influence on titre. The production of micrococcin (Su, 1948) in quantity was undertaken to provide material with which other workers could examine extraction of the active substance and its behaviour both in vitro and in vivo. The principal object of the present experiments was to reduce the cost of the medium and t...|$|E
40|$|The {{beginning}} of {{our knowledge of the}} vitamin folic acid dates back to the discovery of Wills (1) in 1931 that the macrocytic anemia of pregnancy frequently observed in the tropics responded to oral administration of concentrated extracts of <b>autolysed</b> <b>yeast.</b> This tropical anemia resembled classical Addisonian pernicious anemia in that the bone marrow exhibited megaloblastic changes, but differed from true pernicious anemia in that achlorhydria and neurological changes were absent. A considerable advance was made in the characterization of the unknown hematopoietic factor when it was found by Wills and Stewart (2) that a similar syndrome could be induced in monkeys by feeding a diet similar to that common in those areas of India where the disease was frequent...|$|E
40|$|The ciliate Paramecium caudatum was {{cultivated}} {{in a medium}} consisting princi-pally of known chemical compounds, including 17 amino acids, guanylic, adenylic, cytidylic and uridylic acids, sodium acetate and sodium pyruvate, linoleic and oleic acids, a mixture of B vitamins and several inorganic salts. In addition {{it was necessary to}} add microgram quantities of a protein concentrate, first obtained from <b>autolysed</b> <b>yeast,</b> but recently by an improved method from dried green peas. Lipids were first extracted from the crude material and the protein was then dis-solved and precipitated with 10 ? $ trichloroacetic acid. This protein was further purified by paper chromatography to yield a concentrate active in dilutions as low as 10 pg. /ml. When the protein was hydrolysed enzymically or by acid or alkali, the hydrolysates were inactive. Sixteen amino acids were qualitatively identified in the hydrolysate. The nutritional role of a protein effective in such small concen-trations has not yet been satisfactorily explained...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Biotin and {{methionine}} {{are essential}} growth factors for the aerobic thermophilic actinomycete Micromnospora vulgaris. Biotin can be partially replaced by Tween 80 (sorbitan mono-oleate). No aerial growth is {{obtained in the}} absence of methionine. A chemically defined medium containing mineral salts, phosphate buffer (pH 64), soluble starch, a mixture of 18 synthetic amino acids (including methionine) and biotin will support growth of the organism. Throughout the studies of Erikson (1952, 1958), Erikson & Webley (1953) and Webley (1954) on the aerobic thermophilic actinomycete Mimmorcospora vulgaris it was found necessary to use in the main a complex medium (C. P. S.) for growth. Erikson (1952) did, however, show that the organism would grow in the presence of Czapek's mineral salt solution containing 1 yo (wlv) soluble starch, 1 yo (wlv) vitamin-free acid hydrolysate of casein and 0. 01 yo (w/v) <b>autolysed</b> <b>yeast</b> extract. The present work deals with the essential growth factor requirements of the organism and the establishment of a chemically defined medium for growth...|$|E
40|$|Ceratitis capitata {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of fruits for exportation, and Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has been the most efficient and environmental friendly technique used to control fruit fly populations around the world. A key goal in achieving a successful SIT program is a mass rearing system producing high quality insects at low cost. Providing adults with an artificial diet containing hydrolysed protein has been the major obstacle for bio-production facilities in Brazil, because it is expensive and has to be imported. Two other commercial products, <b>autolysed</b> <b>yeast</b> (AY) and yeast extract (YE), of domestic origin and low cost, were tested as substitutes of the imported hydrolyzed protein. To compare their efficiency we observed the female fecundity, adult survival and egg viability of flies raised on diets containing one of each of the different protein products. Flies reared on the domestic yeast products had equivalent or superior performance to the flies reared on imported protein. Both AY and YE can be a possible substitute for imported hydrolyzed protein for C. capitata mass-rearing, as they are cheaper and are readily available in the national market...|$|E
30|$|In many viticultural regions {{the natural}} {{nutrient}} composition of grape juice is considered suboptimal and {{may lead to}} a variety of fermentation problems including slow or stuck fermentations and formation of undesirable off-flavours (Blateyron and Sablayrolles 2001; Henschke and Jiranek 1993; Mendes-Ferreira et al. 2009; Sablayrolles et al. 1996; Schmidt et al. 2011; Torrea et al. 2011; Ugliano et al. 2010). To alleviate these deficiencies, various yeast nutrient preparations are often added to the juice prior to or during alcoholic fermentation, to contribute to the production of a quality wine. Among the nutrient supplements allowed by wine regulatory authorities in many countries are vitamins, inorganic nitrogen, usually in the form of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and organic nutrient preparations. The latter are typically prepared from inactive or <b>autolysed</b> <b>yeast</b> and are therefore usually composed of lipids, micro- and macro-elements, amino nitrogen, mannoproteins and insoluble material (for example see Pozo-Bayón (2009). Effects of these nutrients on the formation of key aroma groups in wine have been studied widely. The concentration of esters and higher alcohols, which impart fruity and fusel aromas respectively, were found to be influenced mostly by nitrogen availability (reviewed by Bell and Henschke (2005). Nitrogen is also considered a key modulator in the formation of volatile sulfur compounds, including H 2 S, a highly potent compound which possesses an odour reminiscent of rotten egg (Rauhut 1993).|$|E
