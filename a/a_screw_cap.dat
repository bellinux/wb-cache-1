2500|$|The 30A plug is {{the largest}} of the family. [...] This was used for high power {{industrial}} equipment up to 7.2kW, such as industrial kitchen appliances, [...] or dimmer racks for stage lighting. Plugs and sockets were usually of an industrial waterproof design with a screw locking ring on the plug to hold it in the socket against waterproof seals, and sockets often had <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> chained to them to be used when no plug was inserted to keep them waterproof. Use of the BS546 30A plugs and sockets diminished through the 1970s as they were replaced with BS 4343 (which later became IEC 60309) industrial combo plugs and sockets.|$|E
2500|$|Hand grenades {{were mostly}} of Communist Chinese manufacture. These were stick grenades, with a wood handle {{at the bottom}} of which was <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> whereupon {{unscrewing}} out fell (if holding right) a porcelain-bead with a thread attached. [...] Pull this and in an unknown time (for these were badly stored and old weapons) it might explode. [...] Despite this there were numerous troops wounded by this weapon. RPG-2's and RPG-7's were prevalent, sometimes one or two to a section of ten men, though hardly ever used against Fireforce (there was usually only one present and the difficulties of targeting the helicopters was extreme).|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} of purification {{of drinking water}} by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the Indian Medical Service, Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903. According to his own account, [...] "It {{occurred to me that}} chlorine gas might be found satisfactory ... if suitable means could be found for using it.... The next important question was how to render the gas portable. This might be accomplished in two ways: By liquefying it, and storing it in lead-lined iron vessels, having a jet with a very fine capillary canal, and fitted with a tap or <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> <b>cap.</b> The tap is turned on, and the cylinder placed in the amount of water required. The chlorine bubbles out, and in ten to fifteen minutes the water is absolutely safe. This method would be of use on a large scale, as for service water carts." ...|$|E

50|$|Once a {{large and}} celebrated estate, owned by the Gasqueton-Hanappier families, it was {{acquired}} by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) in 1968, and André Lurton who had worked at the estate as a fermier since 1967, bought from INRA a smaller portion of Château Couhins. The 2003 vintage of Château Couhins-Lurton was the first classified Bordeaux wine to be sealed with an alternative wine closure when it was released with <b>a</b> stelvin <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> closure.|$|R
5000|$|Oronamin C was {{introduced}} in February 1965 and was initially sold in a 120 ml glass bottle sealed with a bottle cap. It contains isoleucine and many other essential amino acids {{as well as many}} vitamins such as vitamin B2, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. It is not only available in supermarkets and convenience stores in Japan, but also in Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. vending machines as well. The bottle cap was briefly replaced with <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> bottle <b>cap,</b> but following a nationwide scare during the 1980s regarding a large number of poisoned sealed bottled beverages, this <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> was replaced with a one-time [...] "pull-cap," [...] which cannot be re-sealed after opening. Child welfare activist Osamu Mizutani (水谷 修 Mizutani Osamu, born May 8, 1956) wrote that the previous <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> allowed individuals to put in paint thinner and then re-seal the bottles.|$|R
50|$|All Sigg bottles use {{the same}} {{diameter}} head and thread system, which results in interchangeability of bottles and caps.

50|$|Zork is an {{alternative}} wine closure for still wines, that seals like <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> and pops like a cork, created by an Australian company of the same name. The closure has three parts: an outer cap providing a tamper-evident clamp that locks onto the band of a standard cork mouth bottle; an inner metal foil which provides an oxygen barrier similar to <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> <b>cap,</b> and an inner plunger which creates the ‘pop’ on extraction and reseals after use. Introduced in 2010, {{it is the first}} on-bottle, resealable closure for sparkling wines.|$|E
50|$|A closure {{applied to}} the mouth of a jar can be <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> <b>cap,</b> lug cap, cork stopper, roll-on cap, crimp-on cap, press-on cap, plastic shrink, or other {{suitable}} means.|$|E
50|$|Carbon {{footprint}} studies {{committed by}} Corticeira Amorim, Oeneo Bouchage of France and the Cork Supply Group of Portugal concluded that cork {{is the most}} environmentally friendly wine stopper in comparison to other alternatives. The Corticeira Amorim’s study, in particular ("Analysis {{of the life cycle}} of Cork, Aluminum and Plastic Wine Closures"), was developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, according to ISO 14040. Results concluded that, concerning the emission of greenhouse gases, each plastic stopper released 10 times more CO2, whilst <b>an</b> aluminium <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> releases 26 times more CO2 than does a cork stopper.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{disadvantage}} of <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> according to wine expert Jancis Robinson {{is the opposite}} of oxidation, reduction, which may suppress a wine's aroma and possibly cause unpleasant ones, a problem that particularly affects Sauvignon blanc which is a grape variety with natural tendencies toward reduction. Furthermore, there is the screwcap's public image, as [...] "consumers still perceive screwcaps as being for 'cheap' wines (regardless of the price tag)".|$|R
30|$|Fatty acid {{derivatization}} {{was performed}} {{according to a}} method proposed by Horak et al. (2009). The dried lipid residue was redissolved in 500  μl 10 % BF 3 -methanol and incubated in <b>a</b> sealed <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> tube in <b>a</b> heatblock at 95  °C for 20  min. Then the tubes were cooled down to near room temperature. 300  μl of saturated NaCl in water and 300  μl of n-hexane were added. Samples were centrifuged (14, 000  rpm, 10  min) at room temperature. The upper hexane layer containing the extracted Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were transferred to glass vials for GCMS analysis.

40|$|In this paper, fatigue {{strength}} of the engine damper <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> bolt is determined. Engine damper <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> is critical fastener. Critical fastener is a term used to describe <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> that, upon failure, causes immediate engine shutdown or possible harm to person. So, determination of {{fatigue strength}} is important. S-N method is used for <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> fatigue strength determination by testing number of samples at different alternating load keeping mean load constant. Alternating load is increased until <b>cap</b> <b>screws</b> begin to fail. But for measurement of axial load in fasteners, ultrasonic bolt gauging method is used. It has been observed that fatigue failure takes place on the thread of <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> bolt due to high stress concentration on the thread...|$|R

There are small saline bags that have <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> off <b>cap</b> {{on the top of}} them to allow the powder to be added, commonly called piggy back bags by medical staff. Powdered Amoxicillin can be mixed with saline solution or sterile water to be used in a syringe, but because of the slow delivery time that is needed to inject the solution (3–4 minutes for solution containing 1g of amoxicillin powder) this method is seldom used.|$|R

40|$|In {{the wine}} closure {{industry}} cork remains the dominant bottle sealing technology with a {{market share of}} around 90 per cent. Our research analyses the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine seal's development and original introduction within Australia in the 1970 s. It identifies the fundamental reasons for its initial commercial failure. The Australian wine industry {{played a leading role}} in recognizing the commercial potential of <b>a</b> French prototype <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal. Local piloting and testing occurred followed by a market launch. Unfortunately for <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> change agents, the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal was largely a failure. Rogers' (1995) innovation diffusion model identifies several underlying factors responsible for the customer's rejection of the new <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal. In particular, these were the failure to effectively demonstrate the relative advantage of the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal to consumers and to address the complexity and incompatibility of the seal with established user traditions. The industry was therefore unable to achieve a 'critical mass' of adoption. The additional application of Moore's (2001) adaptation of the technology adoption life cycle model reveals that the failure of the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> was also attributable to a lack of an effective industry marketing strategy that would overcome this identifiable consumer resistance. In particular, it lacked a strategy to manage the transition dynamics between the early and mainstream markets. We conclude that a theoretically informed {{understanding of the nature of}} the innovation and thus the adoption hurdles would have significantly aided the diffusion of this innovation...|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{broaching}} {{is another}} common operation. The broach holder is mounted stationary while its internal live spindle and end cutting broach tool {{are driven by}} the workpiece. As the broach is fed into or around the workpiece, the broach's contact points are constantly changing, easily creating the desired form. The most common form made this way is a hexagonal socket {{in the end of}} <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|R
