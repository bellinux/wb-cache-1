5|$|If the Sun–Neptune {{distance}} is scaled to 100 metres, then the Sun {{would be about}} 3cm in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3mm, and Earth's diameter along {{with that of the}} other terrestrial planets would be smaller than <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> (0.3mm) at this scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is host {{to a range}} of parasites and pathogens. It is a vector for Avipoxvirus, Newcastle disease virus, Falconid herpesvirus 1 (and possibly other Herpesviridae), and some mycoses and bacterial infections. Endoparasites include Plasmodium relictum (usually not causing malaria in the {{peregrine falcon}}), Strigeidae trematodes, Serratospiculum amaculata (nematode), and tapeworms. Known peregrine falcon ectoparasites are chewing lice, Ceratophyllus garei (<b>a</b> <b>flea),</b> and Hippoboscidae flies (Icosta nigra, Ornithoctona erythrocephala).|$|E

5|$|Firearm tracing {{starts at}} the {{manufacturer}} or importer and typically ends at the first private sale regardless if the private seller later sell to an FFL or uses an FFL for background checks. Analyzing data from a report released in 1997 by the National Institute of Justice, fewer than 2% of convicted criminals bought their firearm at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> market or gun show. About 12% purchased their firearm from a retail store or pawnshop, and 80% bought from family, friends, or an illegal source.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{five years}} later, the Soviet Union militarily {{intervenes}} in Afghanistan. Amir and Baba escape to Peshawar, Pakistan, {{and then to}} Fremont, California, where they settle in a run-down apartment. Baba begins work at a gas station. After graduating from high school, Amir takes classes at San Jose State University to develop his writing skills. Every Sunday, Baba and Amir make extra money selling used goods at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> market in San Jose. There, Amir meets fellow refugee Soraya Taheri and her family. Baba is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is still capable of granting Amir one last favor: he asks Soraya's father's permission for Amir to marry her. He agrees and the two marry. Shortly thereafter Baba dies. Amir and Soraya settle down in a happy marriage, but to their sorrow they learn that they cannot have children.|$|E
5|$|Norman Dolph's {{original}} acetate {{recording of}} the Scepter Studios material contains several recordings {{that would make it}} onto the final album, though many are different mixes of those recordings and three are different takes entirely. The acetate was cut on April 25, 1966, shortly after the recording sessions. It would resurface decades later when it was bought by collector Warren Hill of Montreal, Quebec, Canada in September 2002 at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> market in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City for $0.75. Hill put the album up for auction on eBay in November. On December 8, 2006, a winning bid for $155,401 was placed, but not honored. The album was again placed for auction on eBay and was successfully sold on December 16, 2006 for $25,200.|$|E

5|$|On the Seminoles' first {{offensive}} {{play of the}} drive, {{they attempted}} <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> flicker pass, which was caught by Warrick at the Virginia Tech 33-yard line for a 33-yard gain. Following the play, Weinke was sacked {{for the first time}} by the Tech defense. This was followed immediately by Tech's second sack, which pushed Weinke back into the Seminoles' side of the field. On the third play of the Seminole drive, Weinke attempted to scramble for yardage, but was stopped short of the needed mark. Florida State's punt was downed at the Virginia Tech one-yard line, which was where the Tech offense began work. Florida State's defense prevented the Hokies from gaining a first down, and Tech again had to punt from its end zone.|$|E
5|$|The Mountain Eagle is {{the only}} feature film {{directed}} by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints of the film are known to exist. Six surviving stills are reproduced in François Truffaut's book. More stills have recently been found to exist, {{many of which are}} reproduced in Dan Auiler's book. A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> market in Rowley, Massachusetts. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. Although these images gave clues to the film and its story, they were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself. They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $6,000 (£3,700). Hitchcock's notebooks were also found, documenting his journey to Obergurgl, by train, horse and cart, and by foot.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, rats did not {{directly}} start {{the spread of the}} bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new person, and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.|$|E

50|$|Since {{more than}} three-quarters of <b>a</b> <b>flea's</b> life is spent somewhere other than on the host animal, it is not {{adequate}} to treat only the host; it is important also to treat the host's environment. Thorough vacuuming, washing linens in hot water, and treating all hosts in the immediate environment (the entire household, for example) are essential and if possible must be performed on a regular basis.|$|R
25|$|Although Blake was {{singular}} in {{his ability}} to directly transcribe visions onto canvas or paper, a number of visual and literary sources can be detected in this work. The art historian Hope Werness suggested that The Flea may be inspired by a 1665 work by early microscopist Robert Hooke (1635–1703), whose Micrographia includes a drawing of <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> microscopically observed.|$|E
25|$|When <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> bites a {{human and}} {{contaminates}} the wound with regurgitated blood, the plague carrying bacteria are {{passed into the}} tissue. Y. pestis can reproduce inside cells, so even if phagocytosed, they can still survive. Once in the body, the bacteria can enter the lymphatic system, which drains interstitial fluid. Plague bacteria secrete several toxins, {{one of which is}} known to cause beta-adrenergic blockade.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s and 1890s, Parisian {{shows such}} as the Moulin Rouge and Folies Bergère were {{featuring}} attractive scantily clad women dancing and tableaux vivants. In this environment, an act in the 1890s featured a woman who slowly removed her clothes in a vain search for <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> crawling on her body. The People's Almanac credits the act as the origin of modern striptease.|$|E

25|$|At 21.4cm × 16.2cm {{the work}} is a greatly reduced {{miniature}} portrait. Blake generally worked on a small scale; most of his illuminated pages, engravings {{and many of his}} paintings are only inches high. Although Ghost of <b>a</b> <b>Flea</b> is one of Blake's smallest works, it is monumental in its imagination. Its tiny scale achieves drama in contrasting the muscular bulk and apparent power of the creature against its incarnation in the panel as an insect.|$|E
25|$|Having {{made his}} way into Freyja's chambers, Loki looked around {{to be sure that}} no one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep. He landed on her bed and noticed that she was wearing the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> and jumped onto Freyja's cheek and there bit her. Freyja stirred, turning about, and then fell asleep again. Loki removed his flea's shape and undid her collar, opened the bower, and {{returned}} to Odin.|$|E

50|$|Though nitenpyram {{is used to}} kill adult <b>fleas</b> {{quickly on}} <b>an</b> infested animal, it does not kill insect eggs and has no {{long-term}} activity. Thus, it is not effective as <b>a</b> long-term <b>flea</b> preventative; however, it can be repeatedly applied {{over the course of}} several days to eradicate a single instance of infestation. Nitenpyram can be combined with <b>a</b> longer-term <b>flea</b> preventative like fipronil or lufenuron to prevent reinfestation.|$|R
5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its {{primary goal is}} to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, <b>an</b> adult <b>flea</b> only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, <b>a</b> <b>flea's</b> life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|R
