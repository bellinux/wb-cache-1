5|$|Given an {{adequate}} supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons after three larval stages. Within the cocoon, the larva moults {{for a final}} time and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. This can take just four days, but may take much longer under adverse conditions, and there follows a variable-length stage during which the pre-emergent adult awaits <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> opportunity to emerge. Trigger factors for emergence include vibrations (including sound), heat (in warm-blooded hosts), and increased levels of carbon dioxide, all of which stimuli may indicate the presence of <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> host. Large numbers of pre-emergent fleas may be present in otherwise flea-free environments, {{and the introduction of}} <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> host may trigger a mass emergence.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLet G=⊕α<τGα be {{the direct}} sum of (discrete) groups endowed with the linear group {{topology}} whose base at the identity {{consists of the}} subgroups Uα=⊕α⩽β<τGβ, α<τ. We show that every subgroup H of G has <b>a</b> generating <b>suitable</b> set. In addition, if H is not closed in G, then H has <b>a</b> closed generating <b>suitable</b> set. The case of topologically orderable topological groups is considered. It is proved that if a topologically orderable group G has <b>a</b> (closed) <b>suitable</b> set, then every dense subgroup of G also has <b>a</b> (closed) <b>suitable</b> set...|$|R

5|$|Bristol Aero Engines and Hooker {{had already}} {{been working on a}} project to produce <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> VTOL engine; this engine {{combined}} major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of the}} compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. With <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> engine already being developed, Camm and his team at HSA proceeded to develop the company's first VTOL aircraft, designated as the Hawker Siddeley P.1127. The P.1127 was envisioned as a subsonic VTOL-capable strike aircraft, while also serving to demonstrate and prove the capabilities of the aircraft's basic configuration and to validate the performance of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine that powered it.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, finding <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> {{adhesive}} was {{a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working on the problem of <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> stem cell donor is available.|$|E
