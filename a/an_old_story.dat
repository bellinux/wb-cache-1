500|$|The {{film was}} {{received}} conflicting reviews by both The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The reviewer for the World said, [...] "This well known story is rendered into a motion picture {{in a way}} that will please the most exacting. ... The picture proves that a good rendering of even <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>story</b> is attractive. The audience apparently delights in the character of John Halifax. He is quite as good on the curtain as he is in the book, and there he has always been a favorite. The different parts are played to perfection. The character of the daughter and the ill son are both faithfully reproduced and seem to live before the audience." [...] The Mirror reviewer The film is not as well acted as Thanhouser pictures usually are. The strict character of the old Quaker is insufficiently expressed and is apt to leave the audience to guess why John is ordered out, and the strike scene is far from impressive. The mob to a man wave their sticks incessantly, instead of portraying intense rage as should have been done." [...] Bowers noted that the Mirror was not a neutral party in respect to the works of the Independent producers.|$|E
500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody who can give you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency".

2500|$|The {{consensus}} of modern scholars {{is that the}} Bible does not give an accurate account {{of the origins of}} Israel. There is no indication that the Israelites ever lived in Ancient Egypt, the Sinai Peninsula shows almost no sign of any occupation for the entire 2nd millennium BCE, and even Kadesh-Barnea, where the Israelites are said to have spent 38 years, was uninhabited prior to the establishment of the Israelite monarchy. Such elements as could be fitted into the 2nd millennium could equally belong to the 1st, and are consistent with a 1st millennium BCE writer trying to set <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>story</b> in Egypt. So while a few scholars, notably Kenneth Kitchen and James K. Hoffmeier, continue to discuss the historicity, or at least plausibility, of the story, arguing that the Egyptian records have been lost or suppressed or that the fleeing Israelites left no archaeological trace or that the large numbers are mistranslated, the majority have abandoned the investigation as [...] "a fruitless pursuit".|$|E
