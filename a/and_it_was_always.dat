Mauboy began writing songs with Adam Reily, Israel Cruz, Brooke McClymont, and Audius Mtawarira. In June 2008, Mauboy told The Jakarta Post that her debut solo single would be released in August, with the album planned for a September release. Two months later, it was announced that Mauboy had left the Young Divas to resume her solo career.|$|E

[...] Kayitah and Martine made the initial contact, being invited into the camp by the Bavispe River. [...] Kayitah remained in the camp as a hostage while Martine left and returned with Gatewood and 15 pounds of tobacco. [...] After Gatewood made gifts of tobacco, [...] Geronimo teased Gatewood about his thinness and sickly look, Gatewood was then told by Geronimo, [...] "you are always welcome in my camp, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> safe for you to come".
