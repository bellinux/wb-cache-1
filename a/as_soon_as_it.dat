5|$|A driver {{becomes the}} World Champion each season <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{is no longer}} mathematically {{possible}} for another to beat him whatever {{the outcome of the}} remaining races. The Drivers' Championship has been won in the final race of the season 29 times in the 67 seasons it has been awarded. The earliest in a season that the Drivers' Championship has been clinched was in , when Michael Schumacher secured the title with six races remaining.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. The platoon moved forward {{on either side}} of the girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Atchison {{submitted}} his {{script to}} the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences along with about 4,500 others, {{in hopes of}} winning the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting. Atchison's script ended up being one of five scripts selected, and he won the grant. Editor Glenn Farr, then {{a member of the}} committee, offered to edit Atchison's film <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was finished. Producer Sid Ganis was also attracted to the story during the award presentation ceremony. Nancy Hult Ganis, Sid's wife who was interested in public education, encouraged him to follow through with the film.|$|E
5|$|Sprint was {{the primary}} weapon of Nike-X as {{originally}} conceived; {{it would have been}} placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered piston. The missile was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> became visible. A transponder in the missile could respond to signals from either the MAR or MSR for accurate tracking.|$|E

5|$|The Sirens and Ulysses {{was painted}} using an {{experimental}} technique, which {{caused it to}} begin to deteriorate <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was complete. It was shown in a major London exhibition of Etty's work in 1849 and at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, but was then considered in too poor a condition for continued public display and {{was placed in the}} gallery's archives. Restoration began on the work in 2003, and in 2010 the painting went on display in the Manchester Art Gallery, over 150 years after being consigned to storage.|$|E
5|$|The {{rainfall}} lightened almost <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> began, but the top {{riders in}} the general classification still faced a course made more difficult by the rain. Most of them rode conservatively, to keep their positions intact rather than aim for the stage win, but Danilo Di Luca did not. Di Luca attacked the course, riding with a high cadence from the outset. He had the best time at the first intermediate time check, but he lost energy and faded away as the course went on, finishing 45 seconds slower than the stage winner.|$|E
5|$|Ziegfeld {{returns to}} his father and young Mary Lou at the Chicago Musical College, and departs to San Francisco, where he and Sandow are deemed frauds for putting on a show in which Sandow faces a lion who falls asleep <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is let out of the cage. Flo travels to England on an ocean liner, where he runs into Billings again who is {{laughing}} at a newspaper article denouncing him as a fraud.|$|E

5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Beno√Æt, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E
5|$|Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in {{the case}} favoring the law firm's position. The case dealt {{with the concept of}} an advance payment retainer, a fee given to an {{attorney}} for later services to a client. An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney's assets <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer) and the security retainer. A classic retainer was described by the court as one used in an attorney-client relationship for a set length of time or a particular purpose. A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{began to}} advance near Losheim before the artillery barrage lifted, preparing {{to cross the}} front line <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> ended. They marched under the glow of massive searchlights, bouncing light off the clouds. The armor was located farther back, near Blankenheim, Germany. At 8:00, as the sun rose, the American platoon heard explosions and guns around Buchholz Station and Losheimergraben {{to the east and}} north where the 3rd and 1st Battalions of the 394th Infantry Division was located. The 55 soldiers of U.S. 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 14th Cavalry Group was initially ordered south to help protect Manderfeld, but shortly afterwards were redirected to join the active battle near Buchholz Station. They withdrew from the village and left without contacting the I&R platoon. This left the platoon as the only unit in the sector and without armor support.|$|E

5|$|Girls {{wanted to}} become part of the {{movement}} almost <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> began. Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910, a parallel movement for girls, sometimes named Girl Scouts. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910, at the request of the girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally. In 1914, she started Rosebuds‚Äîlater renamed Brownies‚Äîfor younger girls. She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert's wife Olave Baden-Powell, who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards, though co-educational youth groups did exist. By the 1990s, two thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.|$|E
5|$|In May 1798, {{the arrest}} {{of a number of}} the leaders of the United Irishmen {{provoked}} the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a widespread uprising across Ireland. The Rebellion took the British authorities by surprise, but the introduction of regular British Army troops rapidly defeated the Irish armies and the last resistance was brought to an end in September with the surrender of a small French force at the Battle of Ballinamuck. The French authorities had also been taken by surprise by the uprising, and were consequently unprepared: the forces they deployed were inadequate to face the much larger British armies operating in Ireland at the time. News of this defeat had still not reach the continent by October, when a second French invasion force set out. Closely watched by the Royal Navy <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> left Brest, the squadron was defeated on 12 October 1798 at the Battle of Tory Island: fewer than a third of the French ships returned to France.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1945, U-2336 left Larvik {{and headed}} out into the North Sea. On 7 May 1945, U-2336 sank the last Allied {{merchant}} ships to be lost to a German submarine in the war, when she torpedoed and sank the freighters Avondale Park and Sneland I (in order) off the Isle of May inside the Firth of Forth. The first of the two ships to be sunk was the Sneland I, which exploded <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was hit killing seven of her crew members, including the captain. Avondale Park was hit next, alarming the 28 man crew who believed that they had struck a mine. Avondale Park sank two minutes after being hit. Two crew members had been killed while the rest managed to enter a lifeboat or jump into the sea. U-2336 later returned to Kiel on 14 May 1945 and then transferred to Wilhelmshaven, Germany, where she was surrendered to the Western Allies.|$|E

5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could get out of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E
5|$|That night Jones and {{the eight}} men with him {{stayed in the}} ravine just under the crest. Without his radio he could not {{communicate}} {{with the rest of}} the company which he thought had been destroyed or driven off the hill. The next day when American fighter planes strafed the hilltop it confirmed his belief that no D Company men were there. Some of the men in the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but North Koreans captured Jones and the eight men with him near the bottom of Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the North Korean lines. This account of the 3rd Platoon explains why, except for the 3d Squad which rejoined D Company that evening, it was out of the action and off the crest almost <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> arrived on top, unknown to Kennedy and the rest of the company at the time.|$|E
5|$|The five UH-1 gunships {{immediately}} strafed Viet Cong {{positions with}} 2.75-inch rockets, {{but failed to}} suppress the enemy fire. After South Vietnamese soldiers had disembarked from the helicopters, one CH-21 was too severely damaged {{to get off the}} ground. A second CH-21 was sent to rescue the crew, but it too was immobilized <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> touched the ground. One of the Hueys returned to pick up the crews of the two downed CH-21s. As it prepared to land, the main rotor was struck by enemy gunfire. The aircraft flipped over to the right and crashed. Almost simultaneously, a third CH-21 sustained heavy damage and was forced to land on the rice fields a short distance from the first two helicopters. By 10:30, all the South Vietnamese soldiers who had landed on the field were under heavy fire from inside Ap Bac and refused to move. Sergeant Arnold Bowers, who had ridden in the first crashed helicopter, raced back and forth to rescue injured American airmen.|$|E
