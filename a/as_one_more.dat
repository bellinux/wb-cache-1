25|$|The work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the other great historical novel of the Napoleonic Wars, Tolstoy's War and Peace. While Tolstoy's work has a greater emphasis on the historical detail and the effect the war has upon his protagonists, Thackeray instead uses the conflict as a backdrop to the lives of his characters. The momentous events on the continent do not always have an equally important influence on the behaviours of Thackeray's characters. Rather their faults tend to compound over time. This is in contrast to the redemptive power conflict has on the characters in War and Peace. For Thackeray, the Napoleonic wars as a whole can be thought of <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> of the vanities expressed in the title.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{the flow}} cytometry {{community}} {{has started to}} release a set of publicly available datasets. A subset of these datasets representing the existing data analysis challenges is described below. For comparison against manual gating, the FlowCAP-I project has released five datasets, manually gated by human analysts, {{and two of them}} gated by eight independent analysts. The FlowCAP-II project included three datasets for binary classification and also reported several algorithms that were able to classify these samples perfectly. FlowCAP-III included two larger datasets for comparison against manual gates as well <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> challenging sample classification dataset. As of March 2013, public release of FlowCAP-III was still in progress. The datasets used in FlowCAP-I, II, and III either have a low number of subjects or parameters. However, recently several more complex clinical datasets have been released including a dataset of 466 HIV-infected subjects, which provides both 14 parameter assays and sufficient clinical information for survival analysis.|$|E

Her second husband, Abraham Goldman, invested Taube's inheritance in a business that quickly failed. The ensuing hardship combined with the emotional distance of husband and wife to make the household a tense place for the children. When Taube became pregnant, Abraham hoped desperately for a son; a daughter, he believed, would serve <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> sign of failure. They eventually had three sons, but their first child was Emma.|$|E

500|$|The school {{operates}} under a [...] "noncoercive" [...] philosophy {{where students}} are encouraged to develop their own interests and where all learning is self-directed. As such, Brooklyn Free School has no grades, no tests, and no compulsory classes or homework. Students are free to pursue the activities of their interest, such as reading alone or taking a class. Students are free to leave classes as they please. Classes have included philosophy seminars, cheese-tasting, book discussions, business, astrology, psychology, videography, and Tibet. Some classes are taught by volunteers. By law, students are required to attend for 5.5 hours a day. Principal Alan Berger contends that the school provides an education better adapted for the Internet era, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> original, enterprising, and adaptive {{in the face of a}} changing economy.|$|E
500|$|The first movement, [...] "" [...] (You shall love God, your Lord), carries Bach's {{statement}} {{on the most important}} law, on which, according to the parallel , [...] "hang all the law and the prophets". The words translate to [...] "You shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself". Bach had enlarged on the [...] "dualism of love of God and brotherly love" [...] already in his monumental cantata in 14 movements, , {{at the beginning of his}} first cycle. In order to show the law's universality, Bach introduces Martin Luther's chorale [...] "" [...] (These are the holy ten commandments), referring to the commandments of the Old Testament, as a foundation of the movement's structure. The tune is played in a strict canon, the most rigid musical law <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> symbol. The canon is performed [...] by the trumpet in the highest range, and the continuo, representing the lowest range. The tempo of the trumpet is twice as fast as the tempo of the continuo, therefore the trumpet has time to repeat first single lines and finally the complete melody of the chorale. The trumpet enters ten times, to symbolize once more the completeness of the law. The voices, representing the law of the New Testament, engage in imitation of a theme which is derived from the chorale tune and first played by the instruments. John Eliot Gardiner, who provides an extended analysis of the movement, concludes: ...|$|E

2500|$|Rajneesh {{viewed the}} mind first and {{foremost}} as a mechanism for survival, replicating behavioural strategies that have proven successful in the past. But the mind's appeal to the past, he said, deprives human beings {{of the ability to}} live authentically in the present, causing them to repress genuine emotions and to shut themselves off from joyful experiences that arise naturally when embracing the present moment: [...] "The mind has no inherent capacity for joy. … It only thinks about joy." [...] The result is that people poison themselves with all manner of neuroses, jealousies, and insecurities. He argued that psychological repression, often advocated by religious leaders, makes suppressed feelings re-emerge in another guise, and that sexual repression resulted in societies obsessed with sex. Instead of suppressing, people should trust and accept themselves unconditionally. This should not merely be understood intellectually, as the mind could only assimilate it <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> piece of information: instead meditation was needed.|$|E
