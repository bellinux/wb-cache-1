5|$|More generally, Neferhotep's time on {{the throne}} was likely prosperous <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many private monuments datable to his reign {{and that of his}} brother, and {{especially}} in sculpture some remarkably high quality art works were produced.|$|E
5|$|WWE 2K18 has {{discontinued}} the 2k Showcase mode entirely <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{no plans}} of making one for this title according to executives of 2K.|$|E
60|$|Just as a Class {{is said to}} be Real, or Unreal, {{according}} <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> or is not, {{an existing}} Thing in it, so also a Name {{is said to be}} Real, or Unreal, according <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> or is not, an existing Thing represented by it.|$|R
50|$|Approach {{from the}} east <b>is</b> rare, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a wide expanse of heather-covered moorland with no roads in that direction. Approach from the north is not {{possible}} for walkers, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no path between the crags.|$|R
50|$|Rumours of late have {{suggested}} that Ciderman might be hanging up his cape. Gig-goers are however assured by the band that, <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> The InCiders, <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> cider, they can expect to encounter Ciderman.|$|R
5|$|When {{only the}} outside is affected, the inner ivory is still commercially viable. <b>As</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> not yet {{verified}} techniques for identifying ivory that was previously burned, some have expressed concerns regarding the possible use {{of some of}} the burned stockpiles.|$|E
5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle further {{noted that}} there are many bird forms within the bird kind – cranes, eagles, crows, bustards, sparrows, and so on, just <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many forms of fishes within the fish kind. He {{sometimes}} called these atomon eidos, indivisible forms. Human is one of these indivisible forms: Socrates {{and the rest of us}} are all different individually, but we all have human form.|$|E
50|$|The {{award was}} not {{presented}} in 2007 and 2013 <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no recipients. It also {{will not be}} presented in 2018 <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> currently no artiste with ten Top 10 wins {{that will allow the}} award to be presented in that year.|$|R

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{a limited}} number of stalls in the Chapel, only the most senior Knights and Dames Grand Cross are installed. A stall made vacant by the death of a {{military}} Knight Grand Cross is offered to the next most senior uninstalled military GCB, and similarly for vacancies among civil GCBs. Waits between admission to the Order and installation may be very long; for instance, Marshal of the Air Force Lord Craig of Radley was created a Knight Grand Cross in 1984, but was not installed until 2006.|$|E
5|$|Central Pacific hurricanes {{are rare}} and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move {{in this area}} annually. <b>As</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no large {{contiguous}} landmasses in the basin, direct hits and landfalls are rare; however, they occur occasionally, as with Hurricane Iniki in 1992, which made landfall on Hawaii, and Hurricane Ioke in 2006, which made a direct hit on Johnston Atoll.|$|E
5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, {{they moved to}} more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their skin pigmentation. It appears certain {{that there was some}} lightening of skin colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E

5|$|Current definition: The mole is {{the amount}} of {{substance}} of a system that contains as many elementary entities <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon-12. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or specified groups of such particles.|$|E
5|$|Driving to the Emirates Stadium is {{strongly}} discouraged <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium. An hour before kick-off to one {{hour after the}} final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement {{on a number of}} the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and businesses with a road closure access permit. The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation. Industrial action forced Arsenal to reschedule the match for the following month.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Bowling {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} in the horse genome project. This work was also {{important}} to human medicine, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> at least 90 genetic conditions that can affect both humans and horses. The horse genome was first sequenced in 2006, and was fully mapped by 2009.|$|E

5|$|In these {{countries}} {{there is little}} need, and no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> insufficient structures to handle the large flocks of ewes there. New Zealand ewes produce 36 million lambs each spring time, which is an average of 2,250 lambs per farm. Australian graziers, too, do not receive the financial support that governments in other countries provide to sheep breeders. Low-cost sheep breeding is based on large numbers of sheep per labour unit and having ewes {{that are capable of}} unsupervised lambing to produce hardy, active lambs.|$|E
5|$|K–Pg {{boundary}} mammalian {{species were}} generally small, comparable {{in size to}} rats; this small size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments. In addition, it is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{constitute}} {{more than}} 90% of the biomass in the sea. It {{is estimated that}} viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day {{and that there are}} 10 to 15 times as many viruses in the oceans <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> bacteria and archaea. Viruses are also major agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 {{legislation}} did {{not include}} a specific sunset clause to change the allocation of units to firms that undertake emissions-intensive and trade-exposed activities. The legislation stipulates that allocations must be reviewed no less than once every 5 years by a review panel. In late 2009, Climate Change Minister Nick Smith stated that estimates of fiscal impacts beyond 2020 at the present time are meaningless <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> simply too many unknowns.|$|E
5|$|The Independent newspaper's {{review of}} the audio books stated that the {{chapters}} are short enough to keep children of seven-plus interested but, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> ghosts, rats, soldiers and dragon boats to help Septimus and the young Princess fight the evil necromancer DomDaniel, there is {{enough to keep the}} whole family amused.|$|E
5|$|The {{carousel}} {{was commissioned}} by William Hubbs, who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917. Built on a Mangel-Illions mechanism, it used animals carved by the Dentzel carousel company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sometime before 1900. The carousel was assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company in 1917. It was probably not the first carousel in the park, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> indications of a previous ride that came from Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
