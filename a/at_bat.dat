5|$|At {{the close}} of the Interstate League season, Levan was called up to the Phillies. He made his major league debut against the New York Giants, {{collecting}} his first hit in his second official <b>at</b> <b>bat.</b> Batting second in the lineup, he finished his first game 2-for-5, notching his first major league run batted in (RBI). The following day, he helped pitcher Curt Simmons, a former teammate in American Legion Baseball, earn his first victory over Andy Hansen of the Giants by hitting safely twice in four times <b>at</b> <b>bat</b> and scoring one run.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{was named}} to the 2005 team as a {{replacement}} for Pedro Martínez but did not play. Both Oswalt and Podsednik played, but Podsednik did not record an official <b>at</b> <b>bat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of {{an injury}} to Giants {{starting}} catcher Bengie Molina, Posey was called up to the Majors {{for the first time}} on September 2, 2009. On September 11, 2009, Posey made his Major League debut, striking out in his first <b>at</b> <b>bat</b> against Hiroki Kuroda of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Posey got his first major league hit on September 19 against Jeff Weaver of the Dodgers. In 17 at-bats with the Giants in 2009, Posey had two hits.|$|E
50|$|His {{best season}} was in 1919 {{when he played}} in all 140 games and would lead the NL in <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> (590), plate {{appearances}} (635), hits (164), singles (140) and <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per strikeout (49.2). In 1921 he would also lead the NL in <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> (652). He currently ranks 84th on the MLB all-time sacrifice hits list (198) and ranks 73rd on the all-time <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per strikeout list (23). He also holds the Los Angeles Dodgers single season record for <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per strikeout (55.1 in 1922) and is the Dodgers all-time <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per strikeout leader (26.8).|$|R
50|$|In {{baseball}} statistics, <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per {{home run}} (AB/HR) {{is a way}} to measure how frequently a batter hits a home run. It is determined by dividing the number of <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> by the number of home runs hit. Mark McGwire possesses the MLB record for this statistic with a career ratio of 10.61 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per home run and Babe Ruth is second, with 11.76 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per home run. Giancarlo Stanton, with 14.33 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per home run, currently holds the record among active players.|$|R
500|$|Rules in 1954 {{required}} 2.6 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per team game, 400 for a 154-game schedule (the {{rule was}} changed in 1957 {{to the current}} requirement of 3.1 plate appearances per team game), {{to qualify for the}} title and hitless <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> could be added to reach this total. Ted Williams posted a [...]345 average in 1954 over only 386 <b>at</b> <b>bats,</b> and the required hitless <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> drop him below Avila's league-leading [...]341 average.|$|R
5|$|On July 28, Davis {{hit home}} runs in his first three at bats (all solo home runs) against the Arizona Diamondbacks' Ian Kennedy, {{eventually}} going 4-for-4 (adding a single in his final <b>at</b> <b>bat).</b> Davis became only the 9th Met in history to hit 3 {{home runs in}} one game. The 3 homers in one game were also a career high for Davis; with them he also reached 20 home runs for the season, breaking his prior year high of 19 home runs.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, Braun hit his 200th career {{home run}} in his 867th game, against the New York Mets, faster than all but four active players in the Majors (Ryan Howard, Albert Pujols, Adam Dunn, and Alex Rodriguez). In his {{following}} <b>at</b> <b>bat,</b> Braun hit another home run, his 40th of the year, {{the first time he}} had reached the 40-home-run mark.|$|E
5|$|A game {{is played}} between two teams, each {{composed}} of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one <b>at</b> <b>bat</b> {{and one in the}} field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings {{at the high school level}} and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The players on the team <b>at</b> <b>bat</b> attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base, second base, third base, and back home in order to score a run. The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's batting order comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.|$|E
5000|$|Hall played 151 {{games for}} the A's in 1943, with a [...]256 batting average for the season on 139 hits in 544 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b> In 1944, Hall had 150 hits in 559 <b>at</b> <b>bats,</b> ending {{the season with a}} [...]268 average, his best in the majors. Hall batted [...]261 in the 1945 season, with 161 hits in 616 <b>at</b> <b>bats,</b> his 148 singles and his 484 outs both leading the American League that season. In 1946, his last season in the majors, Hall had 46 hits in 185 <b>at</b> <b>bats,</b> hitting for a [...]259 average.|$|R
5000|$|Bassler {{was also}} among the American League leaders in <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per strikeout four {{straight}} years from 1922 to 1925. His 1925 total of 57.3 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per strikeout was a career high.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Tomlinson {{began his}} {{professional}} baseball career {{playing for the}} Augusta GreenJackets of the Class A South Atlantic League, hitting [...]356 in 149 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b> In 2012, Tomlinson finished the year with a [...]224 average in 450 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b> In 2013, Tomlinson started the year with the AZL Giants of the Arizona Fall League. He was then promoted to the San Jose Giants of the California League at the A-Advanced level, where he had a [...]276 average in 134 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b> He was then called up {{to play for the}} Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Class AA Eastern League. He struggled, managing only a [...]198 average in 96 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b> In 2014, Tomlinson was now the starting second baseman for the Richmond Flying Squirrels. He eventually finished the year with a [...]268 average in 433 <b>at</b> <b>bats,</b> playing in 126 games.|$|R
5|$|Both teams played {{each other}} in the last series of the season in what would be Derek Jeter's final games as a player before retirement. In Jeter's final game at Yankee Stadium against the Red Sox of his career, the Yankees won with a 9th-inning game-tying homerun by Mark Teixeira, {{followed}} by a walkoff blast by Chase Headley. Jeter said he would not play shortstop for the last series of the season in Boston, but would still bat as a designated hitter out of respect for the rivalry. Boston honored Jeter with a pregame ceremony including Red Sox retired stars Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Fred Lynn, Luis Tiant and Rico Petrocelli, the Boston Bruins' Bobby Orr, New England Patriots receiver Troy Brown and the Boston Celtics' Paul Pierce. In his last <b>at</b> <b>bat</b> as a professional player, Jeter grounded out, but drove in a run. Writer Peter Gammons who was in attendance at the game was also at Fenway during Ted Williams' final <b>at</b> <b>bat</b> where he hit a homerun 54 years prior to the day. Despite the rivalry, many Boston fans at Fenway Park loudly cheered for Jeter and gave him a standing ovation. The Yankees, though unable to reach the playoffs, finished in second place, while the Red Sox finished in last place, 25 games behind the first place Orioles.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, McBride {{had made}} {{his way through the}} minor leagues to the Cardinals' Class AA {{affiliate}} in Little Rock. Though he was successful there and he received a promotion to the Class AAA team in Tulsa, he was initially hesitant to report there, wondering whether he was ready for Class AAA baseball. In his first <b>at</b> <b>bat</b> at the Class AAA level, McBride hit a ball off of the outfield wall and seemed to collect a triple, but he was called out for failing to touch second base.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} major league debut against the Boston Red Sox on Opening Day on April 3, 2006, {{and got his}} first major league hit in his first major league <b>at</b> <b>bat,</b> off Curt Schilling. Kinsler said: The crowd was full; I had the {{butterflies}} going, so to get that hit was huge. The family was in town.... To {{go out there and}} face one of the best pitchers of all time, you've got to be locked in. It's your first game, your first big league experience—it was unbelievable to face that guy.|$|E
5000|$|Treadway {{is one of}} many ballplayers {{who only}} {{appeared}} in the major leagues during World War II. He made his major league debut on July 25, 1944 in an against the Pittsburgh Pirates at the Polo Grounds. He hit for a high average (.300) during his first season with New York, but did not hit well with men in scoring position. In 170 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> he had only 5 runs batted in, a dismal average of one for every 34 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b> Then, in 1945, Treadway hit only [...]241 in 224 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> but had 23 RBI, an average of one for every 9.7 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{never had}} more than 242 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> in a season. He ended his career with a [...]212 batting average, and [...]237 on-base {{percentage}}, in 605 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b> He had a [...]982 fielding percentage (the league average was [...]987).|$|R
50|$|On July 10 Del Unser hit {{his third}} {{consecutive}} pinch hit home run. Unser tied a Major League Baseball record with homers in three straight pinch <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b> The <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> were on June 30, July 5, and July 10.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} to record two outs {{in the course of}} the same play. This is called a double play. Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn <b>at</b> <b>bat</b> as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 2012, Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine {{publicly}} questioned Youkilis' {{motivation and}} physical ability to succeed. Viewing rookie Will Middlebrooks as the superior third baseman, Valentine {{began to play}} Middlebrooks over Youkilis. The Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24 for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility man Brent Lillibridge. The Red Sox agreed to pay $5.5 million of Youkilis' salary to help close the deal. In the seventh inning of that day's game, Ben Cherington, the Red Sox General Manager, informed Valentine that a transaction was pending. Youkilis hit a triple in his last <b>at</b> <b>bat,</b> and received a long standing ovation while tipping his helmet to the crowd after being taken out for pinch runner Nick Punto.|$|E
5|$|Tim Wakefield {{made his}} first start of the 2004 postseason for the Red Sox, {{becoming}} the first knuckleball pitcher to make a World Series start since 1948, while Woody Williams, who had won both his previous two starts in the post-season, was the Cardinals' starting pitcher. In {{the bottom of the}} first inning, Williams gave up a lead-off double to Johnny Damon, and then hit Orlando Cabrera in the shoulder with one of his pitches. After Manny Ramírez flied out, Ortiz hit a three-run home run in his first-ever World Series <b>at</b> <b>bat.</b> Kevin Millar then scored by virtue of a single by Bill Mueller to put the Red Sox up 4–0.|$|E
5000|$|During his August-September callup, Ryan Zimmerman {{recorded}} 23 hits in 58 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b> He thus {{became the}} first member of the Washington Nationals to complete the season with a <b>batting</b> average of <b>at</b> least [...]300 in at least 50 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b>|$|R
500|$|In 2013, Valencia batted [...]286 with 14 {{home runs}} and 51 RBIs in 262 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> with Triple-A Norfolk, and a [...]531 {{slugging}} percentage that would have ranked second in the International League if he had reached the minimum number of <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{also led}} the league in <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> three times, partly because he batted early in the order and partly because he rarely missed a game, coming to be known as a workhorse. His career high was 692 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> in 161 games in 1962.|$|R
5|$|In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 3,000 hit club is {{the group}} of batters who have {{collected}} 3,000 or more regular-season hits in their careers. Cap Anson {{was the first to}} join the club on July 18, 1897, although his precise career hit total is unclear. Two players—Nap Lajoie and Honus Wagner—reached 3,000 hits during the 1914 season. Ty Cobb became the club's fourth member in 1921 and became the first player in MLB history to reach 4,000 hits in 1927; he ultimately finished his career with more than 4,100. Pete Rose became the second member of the 4,000 hit club on April 13, 1984 while playing for the Montreal Expos. Cobb, also the major leagues' all-time career batting average leader, remained the MLB hit leader until September 11, 1985, when Rose collected his 4,192nd hit. Rose, the current record holder, finished his career with 4,256 hits. Roberto Clemente's career ended with precisely 3,000 hits, reaching the mark in the last <b>at</b> <b>bat</b> of his career on September 30, 1972.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} {{the eighth}} inning, with one out and two men on base, Red Sox closer Foulke came in to pitch. Édgar Rentería singled towards Ramírez in left field, who unintentionally kicked the ball away, {{allowing}} Jason Marquis to score. Walker also hit the ball towards Ramírez in the next <b>at</b> <b>bat.</b> Ramírez slid in an attempt to try to catch the ball, but tripped and deflected the ball for his second error in two plays, and the fourth Red Sox error in the game. Roger Cedeño scored on the play to tie the game at nine. In the bottom of the eighth inning, however, Jason Varitek reached on an error, and Bellhorn then hit a home run off the right field foul pole, also known as Pesky's Pole, for his third home run in as many games to give the Red Sox a two-run lead. In the ninth inning, Foulke struck out Cedeño to win the game for the Red Sox 11–9.|$|E
5|$|Pee Wee Reese singled and Jackie Robinson homered, scoring {{two runs}} for the Dodgers in the first inning; the Giants had one player reach base on an error, making the score 2–0 after one inning. In the second inning, Gil Hodges singled and reached third base on an error, {{allowing}} the Dodgers to potentially score again. After Rube Walker's hit the Giants threw Hodges out at home plate, and two further outs ended their turn <b>at</b> <b>bat.</b> The Giants had two consecutive hits in their half, a double hit by Thomson and a single hit by Mays, but they failed to score as well after two groundouts, leaving the score 2–0. After one out, Duke Snider walked and Robinson singled to start the third inning, and Jones was removed from pitching duties, replaced by George Spencer.|$|E
5000|$|In 190 career games <b>at</b> LSU, Bregman <b>batted</b> [...]338/.412/.520, with 66 strikeouts and 87 {{walks in}} 761 <b>at</b> <b>bats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Brown divided {{his major}} league {{career as an}} outfielder, first baseman, pinch hitter and {{designated}} hitter. He is best remembered for his contribution to the 1968 World Series champion Detroit Tigers. In his pinch hitting <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> in the 1968 season, Brown hit for a [...]450 batting average, the eighth highest single season batting average for a pinch hitter (minimum 30 <b>at</b> <b>bats)</b> in major league history. Brown holds the American League record for the most pinch-hit <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> in a career, with 414.|$|R
25|$|For his career, McGwire {{averaged}} {{a home run}} once every 10.61 <b>at</b> <b>bats,</b> the best <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per home run ratio in baseball history (Babe Ruth is second at 11.76). McGwire also holds {{the distinction of being}} the fastest player to hit 500 home runs, in only 5,487 at-bats.|$|R
5|$|The Mets {{promoted}} deGrom to {{the major}} leagues on May 12, 2014, after Gonzalez Germen {{was placed on the}} disabled list. The Mets planned to use deGrom in relief, but an injury to Dillon Gee required the Mets to insert him into their starting rotation. DeGrom made his major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New York Yankees in Citi Field. He faced fellow rookie Chase Whitley, also making his MLB debut. He pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out six, but the Yankees shut out the Mets and won 1–0. DeGrom also collected his first MLB hit in the game in his first career <b>at</b> <b>bat.</b> It was the first hit by a Mets pitcher in the 2014 season ending an 0-for-64 hitless streak, the worst collective mark by a pitching staff to begin a season in MLB history.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} player's turn batting or plate {{appearance is}} complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball {{that results in}} the team's third out, {{even if it is}} recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn <b>at</b> <b>bat.</b> The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.|$|E
5|$|For {{the sixth}} {{time in his}} major league career, Doby was named an All-Star during the 1954 season, one of five Indians named. The game was held at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium and {{featured}} the second-largest crowd to watch an All-Star Game (the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium). In what would prove his final career All-Star <b>at</b> <b>bat,</b> Doby hit a pinch-hit solo {{home run in the}} eighth inning to tie the game at 9–9; the AL squad went on to win, 11–9. His home run was the first hit by a black player in an All-Star Game. The game, which had a record 17 hits by the AL and was the highest-scoring All-Star Game until 1998, was called the best ever by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward. As the regular season resumed, Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant. His regular season 32 home runs and career-high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL, which led to him finishing second in AL MVP voting. The Indians were swept in the 1954 World Series by Doby's former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants.|$|E
5000|$|Forster {{was also}} an {{excellent}} hitter, something usually not associated with relief pitchers. His [...]397 lifetime batting average (31 hits in 78 <b>at</b> <b>bats)</b> is the highest for any major leaguer in history with either 50 <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> or with <b>at</b> least 15 years of major league experience.|$|R
5000|$|In 15 Major League seasons, Finney {{played in}} 1,270 games and had 4,631 <b>at</b> <b>bats,</b> 643 runs scored, 1,329 hits, 203 doubles, 85 triples, 31 home runs, 494 runs batted in, 39 stolen bases, 329 bases on balls, a [...]287 batting average, [...]336 on-base percentage, [...]388 {{slugging}} percentage, 1,795 total bases and 63 sacrifice hits. He led the American League in <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> (653) in 1936 and finished 29th in {{voting for the}} 1940 American League MVP Award for leading the AL in <b>at</b> <b>bats</b> per strikeout (41.1) ...|$|R
