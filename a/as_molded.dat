Chassis are typically cast from aluminum alloy, or stamped from thin steel sheet, though in some drivers with large magnets cast chassis are preferable as sheet metal can easily be warped in whenever the loudspeaker is subjected to rough handling. Other materials such <b>as</b> <b>molded</b> plastic and damped plastic compound baskets are becoming common, especially for inexpensive, low-mass drivers.

50|$|A {{timing belt}} is {{typically}} rubber with high-tensile fibres (e.g. fiberglass or Twaron/Kevlar) running {{the length of}} the belt as tension members.

50|$|A {{stepless}} type of {{ear clamp}} {{was invented by}} Hans Oetiker in Horgen, Switzerland, which eliminates steps or gaps on the inner circumference of the clamp. This is said to provide uniform compression and a 360° seal.Such stepless clamps are claimed to be well suited to applications involving thin-walled hoses, supposedly with higher retained loads. This suggests they should be considered for difficult to seal applications such <b>as</b> <b>molded</b> plastics or other less malleable materials, commonly used in the automotive industry.|$|E
50|$|With the {{development}} of new flexible yet springy materials, such <b>as</b> <b>molded</b> plastic, and new manufacturing processes, many new variations in these types of connectors have been invented, and are commonly called snap-fits. They can be found in on our phones, laptops, keys, and other household devices. Engineers have studied and developed these snap-fits, creating formulae concerning the amount of deflection allowed on the components, amount of torque one can take, and the amount of space one can allow in order to be detached.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the parkway}} concept of Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, {{designers}} of New York City's Central Park, the planners of the Colonial Parkway used {{a model of}} a limited access highway with broad sweeping curves, set in a landscaped right-of-way devoid of commercial development. These features, derived from 19th-century Romantic landscape theories, created a safer and more pleasant drive compared to the increasingly congested urban strips. In addition to protecting the views, culvert headwalls and parkway underpasses were clad in [...] "Virginia-style" [...] brick laid in English and Flemish bonds to promote a [...] "colonial-era" [...] effect. Design features such <b>as</b> <b>molded</b> coping rails, string courses and buttresses followed the historical prototypes found at Williamsburg.|$|E

In addition there are sculpted anthropomorphic figurines and polished jade renderings of ritual {{objects from the}} Olmec, Veracruz, and Teotihuacan cultures as well <b>as</b> <b>molded</b> and painted ceramics of the Nasca, Moche, and Wari cultures. Gold and silver objects from the Chavín, Lambayeque, Chimú, and Inca cultures offer evidence of the expertise achieved by Andean metalsmiths, and over forty textiles and works in feathers testify to the importance of fiber arts in this region.|$|E
50|$|A plastic zipper, {{also known}} as a Delrin zipper, is a zipper made with {{polyester}} tape and molded POM elements. Delrin is a high-grade plastic that is molded in a form over the individual side of the zipper tape. These zippers are light in weight and can be colored to match the product they are fabricated for. They are more commonly known <b>as</b> <b>molded</b> zippers and have a larger bulk than coil zippers. Individually coupling of the teeth in these zippers interlocks seamlessly. In fact, they are almost similar to metal zippers in design because of the individually positioned teeth along the tape. The teeth are smartly injection molded onto a pre-woven, dyed tape. The degree of self-lubrication and sturdiness of Delrin zippers is far better than an equivalent size of coil zipper.|$|E

5000|$|The neuroscientist David Linden {{discusses}} how {{intelligent design}} proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy.The transcendent {{aspects of our}} human experience, the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core, were not given to us by a Great Engineer. These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain. Rather, at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche. The things we hold highest in our human experience (love, memory, dreams, and a predisposition for religious thought) result from a particular agglomeration of ad hoc solutions that have been piled on through {{millions of years of}} evolution history. It's not that we have fundamentally human thoughts and feelings despite the kludgy design of the brain <b>as</b> <b>molded</b> by the twists and turns of evolutionary history. Rather, we have them precisely because of that history.|$|E
5000|$|Judith Shea {{has been}} a notable {{presence}} in the New York art world since the 1970s. Trained as a designer at Parsons, she soon found the fashion industry too restrictive and abandoned it in favor of making art. For her first solo show, at The Clocktower in 1976, Shea made a work based on color theory, using transparent silks in a spectrum of colors, worn by a live model. Other early work referenced clothing and its construction, first as flat, minimalist pattern and later <b>as</b> <b>molded</b> draping over implied, absent figures. In the 1981 Whitney Biennial, Shea showed three simple forms that evoked iconic clothes of the 1950s and 60s—the overcoat and the simple sheath dress—which hung from the wall as if on hangers. Five related works {{were included in the}} Hirshhorn’s Directions 83 survey. All of these works evoke human presence, felt as absence, as if the clothes were placeholders for missing persons. Thinking about her earlier clothes-based works, Shea has said that she “was looking for characters, for personae, really, to occupy them. I used clothes as stand-ins for people.” ...|$|E
