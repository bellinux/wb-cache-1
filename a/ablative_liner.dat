50|$|The {{combustion}} chamber {{consists of an}} ablative-lined titanium alloy case to the 16:1 area ratio. Fabrication of the 6Al4V alloy titanium case was accomplished by machining the chamber portion and the exit cone portion from forgings and welding them into one unit at the throat centerline. The <b>ablative</b> <b>liner</b> is fabricated in two segments and installed from either end. The shape of the nozzle extension is such that the <b>ablative</b> <b>liner</b> is retained in the exit cone during transportation, launch and boost. During engine firing, thrust loads force the exit cone liner against the case. The titanium head end assembly which contains the Pintle Injector and propellant valve subcomponents is attached with thirty-six A-286 steel ¼ inch bolts.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} keep the maximum {{operating}} temperatures of the titanium case in the vicinity of 800 degrees (F), the <b>ablative</b> <b>liner</b> was designed as a composite material providing the maximum heat sink and minimum weight. The selected configuration consisted of a high density, erosion-resistant silica cloth/phenolic material surrounded by a lightweight needle-felted silica mat/phenolic insulation.|$|E

40|$|Carbon-phenolic {{composite}} materials {{are used as}} ablative material in the solid rocket motor nozzle of the Space Shuttle. The nozzle is lined with carbon cloth-phenolic resin composites. The nominal effects of the completely consumed solid propellant on the carbon-phenolic material are given. The extreme heat and erosion of the burning propellant are controlled by the carbon-phenolic composite by ablation, the heat and mass transfer process in which {{a large amount of}} heat is absorbed by sacrificially removing material from the nozzle surface. Phenolic materials ablate with the initial formation of a char. The depth of the char {{is a function of the}} heat conduction coefficient of the composite. The char layer is a very poor heat conductor so it protects the underlying phenolic composite from the high heat of the burning propellant. The nozzle component <b>ablative</b> <b>liners</b> (carbon cloth-phenolic composites) are tape wrapped, hydroclave and/or autoclave cured, machined, and assembled. The tape consists of a prepreg broadcloth. The materials flow sheet for the nozzle <b>ablative</b> <b>liners</b> is shown. The prepreg is a three component system: phenolic resin, carbon cloth, and carbon filler. This is Volume 1 of two, Experimental Studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Solid {{rocket motor}} nozzles and liquid engine throats use {{ablative}} composite materials {{to protect the}} structures from the extremely severe operating conditions of high temperature, pressure and particle impingement. These <b>ablative</b> nozzle <b>liners</b> are processed from carbon phenolic/silica phenolic prepregs using a complex processing cycle. The process starts from impregnating the fibres with phenolic resin followed by either moulding or wrapping/winding prepreg tapes over metallic mandrels followed by polymerization under pressure. Traditionally, prepreg is cut into straight tapes and wound on mandrels to form the divergents. For throats and convergents, prepreg patterns are cut and stacked for curing. Plies of shape conforming {{to the development of}} base cone are cut from the prepreg and wound on the mandrel. After polymerization, the final required configuration is machined from this cylindrical blank after the liners are cured. The new method, described in this paper, replaces the straight-cut prepreg tapes by bias-cut prepreg tapes. These can be used for <b>ablative</b> <b>liners</b> in which the plies are at an angle to the direction of the flow. Bias tapes are cut at 45 ° to the warp and weft directions of the fabric to the required width and formed to the required frustum of cone. Since the cone is formed from straight cut bias tape, the fibre construction will be uniform around the circumference unlike the pattern cut tape. Th...|$|R
40|$|The Fastrac Engine {{developed}} by the Marshall Space Flight Center for the X- 34 vehicle began as a low cost engine development program for a small booster system. One of the key components to reducing the engine cost was {{the development of an}} inexpensive combustion chamber/nozzle. Fabrication of a regeneratively cooled thrust chamber and nozzle was considered too expensive and time consuming. In looking for an alternate design concept, the Space Shuttle's Reusable Solid Rocket Motor Project provided an extensive background with ablative composite materials in a combustion environment. An integral combustion chamber/nozzle was designed and fabricated with a silica/phenolic <b>ablative</b> <b>liner</b> and a carbon/epoxy structural overwrap. This paper describes the fabrication process and developmental hurdles overcome for the Fastrac engine one-piece composite combustion chamber/nozzle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A gas-fed {{capillary}} {{plasma source}} has been devel-oped to study plasma–surface interactions under pulsed high pressure arc conditions, {{without the use}} of an exploding fuse wire or <b>ablative</b> <b>liner.</b> A nonintrusive preionization source has been developed to break down relatively large interelectrode gaps at low charge voltages of 2 – 6 kV. The preionization source comprises a nonequilibrium surface streamer discharge that forms a conducting channel through which the main thermal arc discharge is initiated. The arc electron temperature and number density are estimated to be Te ∼ 1 – 2 eV and ne ∼ 1023 m− 3. Silicon and sapphire samples were exposed to the arc plasma and revealed deposition of electrode and wall materials. Substitution of Elkonite 50 W 3 for brass electrodes reduced plasma contamina-tion to acceptable levels. The plasma–material interactions were examined and quantified using scanning electron microscopy an...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this master thesis was to investigate an <b>ablative</b> <b>liner</b> for the T-Minus DART booster that will accelerate a dart to Mach 5. 2 within five seconds. An oxyacetylene torch {{test was used to}} sort out the obviously bad materials. Glass fiber/epoxy, with and without alumina as fire retardant, and carbon fiber/epoxy were selected for further investigation. A sub-scale motor was built to expose the materials for conditions similar to the booster conditions in regard to temperature, chemistry, flow velocity and pressure. The target pressure could not be reached in the sub-scale motor but a polynomial function was fitted to the data in order to extrapolate the data and estimate the ablation rate at 7 MPa. The final design is always based on measurements on full scale motors. This could not be done within this report. Recommendation for future work is to use an insulator of 1. 8 mm of carbon fiber/epoxy or 1. 3 mm of glass fiber/epoxy/alumina for the sub-scale firings to come...|$|E

AE {{technique}} {{was applied to}} the structural strength tests of the <b>ablative</b> composite <b>liner</b> bonded on steel nozzle to figure out the unexpected problem that happened during the flight test. Two different kinds of specimen, which were specimens with some initial crack and without initial crack each, were used for the test.
