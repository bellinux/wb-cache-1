25|$|Bogarde was {{the elder}} of two sons born to Ulric van den Bogaerde (1892–1972) and Margaret Niven (1898–1980). Ulric {{was born in}} Perry Barr, Birmingham, of Flemish ancestry. He was Art Editor of The Times. Margaret Niven was Scottish, from Glasgow and was a former actress. Dirk Bogarde {{was born in a}} nursing home at 12 Hemstal Road, West Hampstead, London. He was baptised on 30 October 1921 at St. Mary's Church, Kilburn. His brother, Gareth Ulric Van Den Bogaerde, an <b>advertising</b> <b>film</b> producer, was born in July 1933, in Hendon. He also had a younger sister, Elizabeth.|$|E
500|$|In 1976 Jacques {{appeared}} in a promotional <b>advertising</b> <b>film</b> for British Rail, which pitted her against racing driver Jackie Stewart in a race to London. From 1976 onwards Sykes and Jacques appeared together in the stage play A Hatful of Sykes, both in the UK and internationally. During {{the course of the}} different tours relations between the two stars became increasingly strained and Sykes altered the act several times to ensure he received more acclaim than Jacques. While appearing in Blackpool in 1977 Jacques's health became problematic as she suffered from arthritis and ulcerated legs, which required daily dressing. Because a dressing room was arranged that avoided her needing to use stairs, Sykes accused her of receiving special treatment. When the show moved to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Sykes [...] "began to behave rather strangely... and he even accused Hattie... {{of not being able to}} deliver a proper feed line". By the time the show {{appeared in}} Brighton in 1979 the relationship between the two [...] "was rapidly deteriorating", and, although the pair praised each other in public, Jacques felt hurt by Sykes's treatment of her. Despite the differences, the pair filmed the seventh series of Sykes in 1979, and—in April 1980—the television film Rhubarb Rhubarb; although her part was a small one, she looked [...] "a little unsteady on her feet", according to Merriman.|$|E

This marriage ended in 1996 and {{was followed by a}} seven-year relationship with Dublin-born presenter and writer Sarah Owens. The couple moved to County Wicklow, where they settled close to their friends, director John Boorman and Claddagh Records founder and Guinness heir Garech Browne. In July 2002, the couple separated. In March 2005, Hurt married his fourth wife, <b>advertising</b> <b>film</b> producer Anwen Rees-Meyers. He gave up smoking and drinking after his fourth marriage. He lived in Cromer, Norfolk.|$|E
