5|$|Madison {{was deeply}} {{read in the}} history of {{government}} and used a range of sources in composing the amendments. The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the right to petition and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent for the right to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> (although this applied only to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller {{that the}} city's 1976 handgun ban {{violated}} {{the right to}} keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> as protected under the Second Amendment. However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E
5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} {{right to keep}} <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms.</b> The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before {{the enactment of the}} Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E

50|$|In Plymouth Colony records, Doty's {{name was}} also spelled {{variously}} as Doten (Mayflower Compact), Dotey (1626 Purchasers <b>and</b> 1643 <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> lists), Dolton (1627 Division of the Cattle), and Dowty (1633/34 tax lists).|$|R
5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic {{is quite}} liberal. It is mostly caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted to regain their rights to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|These {{conspiracy}} theorists, {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a right to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms,</b> are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA {{will be used for}} the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.|$|E
25|$|Gun {{rights activists}} {{in recent decades}} have {{sometimes}} argued for a fundamental natural right to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> in the United States that both predates the U.S. Constitution and is covered by the Constitution's Ninth Amendment; according to this viewpoint, the Second Amendment only enumerates a pre-existing right to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E

25|$|State level laws vary {{significantly}} in their form, content, {{and level of}} restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects {{the right to keep}} <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms.</b> The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.|$|E
25|$|Thompson said {{citizens}} {{are entitled to}} keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> {{if they do not}} have criminal records, and the Gun Owners of America says that he voted pro-gun in 20 of 33 gun-related votes during his time in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|The Second Amendment {{was based}} {{partially}} {{on the right}} to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> in English common law and was influenced by the English Bill of Rights of 1689. Sir William Blackstone described this right as an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state.|$|E

25|$|The Second Amendment (Amendment II) to the United States Constitution {{protects the}} right of the people to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> and was adopted on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten {{amendments}} contained in the Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the right belongs to individuals, while also ruling that the right is not unlimited and does not prohibit all regulation of either firearms or similar devices. State and local governments are limited to the same extent as the federal government from infringing this right per the incorporation of the Bill of Rights.|$|E
25|$|The years 1880 and 1881 saw a new {{influx of}} {{political}} refugees from Germany, {{activists in the}} socialist movement fleeing the crackdown on radicalism launched with the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878. This influx of new German members, coming {{during a time of}} low ebb of the English-speaking membership, extended Germanic influence in the SLP. Excluded from the voting booth by their lack of citizenship status, many of the newcomers had little use for electoral politics. An SLP German militia sued on Second Amendment grounds to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> in Chicago parades. The Supreme Court ruled against them in Presser v. Illinois, however.|$|E

25|$|Hitchens philosophically {{supported}} gun {{rights and}} was generally opposed to gun control. On {{the subject of}} the second amendment, Hitchens argued that as both an outright ban on guns and relying on a citizen militia for the national defence were equally as idealistic and utopian, and that as gun control created a duopoly of force between the state and criminals, it would be more desirable to encourage training among average citizens so they might develop a better relationship with firearms. Although Hitchens repeatedly stated a broad support for the right to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms,</b> he was not an enthusiastic advocate and he rarely publicly discussed his views.|$|E
25|$|I deem it {{important}} to direct your attention to Article 2 of the Constitutional Amendments of the United States—'the {{right of the people}} to keep <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> shall not be infringed.' This you should comply with immediately. Every (local) union should have a rifle club. I strongly advise you to provide every member with the latest improved rifle, which can be obtained from the factory at a nominal price. I entreat you to take action on this important question, so that in two years we can hear the inspiring music of the martial tread of 25,000 armed men in the ranks of labor.|$|E
25|$|Servius' {{political}} reforms {{and those of}} his successor Tarquinius Superbus undermined the bases of aristocratic power and transferred them in part to commoners. Rome's ordinary citizens became a distinct force within Roman politics, entitled to participate in government <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> on its behalf, despite the opposition and resentment of Rome's patricians and senate. Tarquinius was ousted by a conspiracy of patricians, not plebeians. Once in existence, the comitia centuriata could not be unmade, or its powers reduced: as Republican Rome's highest court of appeal, it {{had the capacity to}} overturn court decisions, and the Republican senate was constitutionally obliged to seek its approval. In time, the comitia centuriata legitimized the rise to power of a plebeian nobility, and plebeian consuls.|$|E

[...] He also clarified that under prevailing practice the militia included all people, rich and poor. [...] "Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers." [...] Because all were members of the militia, all enjoyed the right to individually <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> to serve therein.|$|R
