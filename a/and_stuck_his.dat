5|$|Glastonbury {{has been}} {{described}} as a New Age community which attracts people with New Age and Neopagan beliefs, and is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence of a landscape zodiac around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.|$|E
5|$|While Tszyu {{celebrated in}} his corner, Judah was in disbelief of what just {{happened}} and became infuriated. Judah picked up his stool and hurled it towards center ring. While being restrained by his father and trainer, Yoel Judah, he broke loose and walked up to Nady <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> gloved fist into his neck {{and had to be}} pulled off by cornermen. A few minutes later, Jimmy Lennon, Jr. announced the official decision and Judah screamed out and again had to be restrained by a growing number of security guards and cornermen. Judah was fined $75,000 and suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.|$|E
25|$|The loyal dog, {{that could}} not wake up his owner but still kept trying to save his life, soaked himself in a nearby stream and {{extinguished}} the fire near Kim. The dog repeated this behavior until he saved Kim's life, but died of burns. Kim woke up after a while and {{found that there was}} a fire and that his dog was burnt to death near him, but that the grassland on and around which he slept was still wet, safe from the fire. Kim realized what his dog had done for him, cried bitterly, buried his dog in a nearby sunny place, <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> walking staff in front of the grave instead of a tombstone. The story states that the wooden staff became a very large tree after several years, resulting {{in the name of the}} story (the Tree of a Dog). There still stands a huge tree in Osu-Myun to this day, aged about a thousand years.|$|E
60|$|Almayer, {{his hair}} all wet <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> to <b>his</b> head, {{as if he}} had been diving, sat up and gasped.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' he said, 'there's no {{need for}} that;' <b>and</b> he <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> hand into the fire. This also made him take to bed for a good while.|$|R
60|$|He put on <b>his</b> coat <b>and</b> belt, <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> axe <b>and</b> {{knife into}} the latter, {{shouldered}} his gun, and went nimbly up the rocky ascent on his left.|$|R
2500|$|On October 27, 2017, Speier {{posted a}} video sharing her {{experience}} with sexual harassment on Capital Hill. She {{said that when}} she was in her 20's a chief of staff for Representative Leo Ryan, [...] "kissed me <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> tongue in my mouth." [...] Speier call the United States Congress a breeding ground for a hostile work environment and she called for more sexual harassment training.|$|E
2500|$|Scotty Moore {{described}} their first session, {{resulting in the}} recording of [...] "That's Alright Mama": We were taking a break and, all of sudden, Elvis started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool. Then Bill Black picked up his bass and began acting the fool too, and I started playing with them. Sam had {{the door to the}} control room open, <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head out and said, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'We don't know'. He said, 'Well, back up. Try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again'. So we kinda talked it over and figured out a little bit what we were doin'. We ran it again, and of course Sam is listenin'. 'Bout the third or fourth time through, we just cut it. It was basically a rhythm record. It wasn't any great thing. It wasn't Sam tellin' him what to do. Elvis was joking around, just doing what come naturally, what he felt.|$|E
60|$|He flung back {{pages of}} the files <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> finger on a point.|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jove!" [...] he thought, [...] "we must {{be nearly}} there!" [...] <b>and</b> he <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> {{head out of}} the window and got the air full in his face.|$|R
60|$|The two men dashed up {{onto the}} veranda of the ranchhouse and pounded at the door until a Chinaman opened it <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> out <b>his</b> head, inquiringly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't like it,' {{returned}} Mr Venus moodily, {{as he put}} {{his head}} between <b>his</b> knees <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> up <b>his</b> dusty hair. 'And there's no encouragement to go on.' ...|$|R
60|$|Before I could reply, one of {{the other}} Belgians opened the door <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head in.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{guess you}} won’t mind very much,” said Snipper, and then, despite her struggles, {{he bent over}} <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> repulsive face close to her fair cheek.|$|E
60|$|The {{two women}} were {{regarding}} each other with shining eyes, each {{on the verge of}} speech when Billy returned to the door <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head in.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Come {{around about}} sunset and perhaps you'll {{see a thing}} or two,' he said, <b>and</b> then <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head under his wing {{as if he were}} nearly dead for want of sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{too many}} adventures," [...] added Phil. [...] "Oh, I can tell you, girls, we are heroes!" [...] <b>and</b> he <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> thumbs in the armholes of his vest, {{and began to}} strut around.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the first}} round of Lester's match, his four front top teeth were knocked out <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> in <b>his</b> mouth guard, causing a delay {{starting}} the second round while they were removed.|$|R
6000|$|... (Pausing for a reply, {{he opened}} his right eye with his hand, <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> glass in it, in that {{inflammatory}} manner that his eye began watering dreadfully.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{folded his}} arms on his breast then <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> chin up {{in a sort of}} desperate way; but I wasn't to be {{impressed}} by the beggar's posturing.|$|E
60|$|He {{leaned back}} in his chair, <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> hands deep into his pockets, and watched his wife's face, {{luminous}} with the emotions that flashed through her mind-doubt, joy, anxiety.|$|E
60|$|He strolled round it once or twice, {{and then}} {{attacked}} the shutters with his pocket-knife, reinforced presently by a wooden stake he found conveniently near. At last {{he got a}} shutter to give, and tore it back <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> in <b>his</b> head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Porter, I don't {{want any}} such talk from you!" [...] and now Ward Porton doubled up <b>his</b> fists <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> out <b>his</b> chin. [...] "I've stood all I {{am going to}} stand from you. I want you to leave me alone." ...|$|R
60|$|Just {{then the}} roof of the house in front of them opened <b>and</b> a Tottenhot <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head out, very cautiously, and looked at the strangers.|$|R
60|$|Jim, {{who was in}} advance, saw {{the last}} stair before him <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head above the rocky sides of the stairway. Then he halted, ducked down and began to back up, so that he nearly fell with the buggy onto the others.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} Harris threw away the sculls, {{got up and}} left his seat, and sat on his back, <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> legs in the air. Montmorency howled, and turned a somersault, and the top hamper jumped up, and all the things came out.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My love, {{will you}} take any game?' says Ponto, with prodigious gravity; <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> fork into that little mouthful of {{an island in the}} silver sea. Stripes, too, at intervals, dribbled out the Marsala with a solemnity which would have done honour to a Duke's butler. The Bamnecide's dinner to Shacabac was only one degree removed from these solemn banquets.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course there}} was an immense deal of talking and chatting and commenting, also no small amount of giggling, and once or twice {{one of the women}} {{addressed}} Olaf; but Olaf shook <b>his</b> head <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> to <b>his</b> first assurance that their words were incomprehensible.|$|R
60|$|Whatever it {{was that}} he found {{on the other side of}} the path it grew under the ground, <b>and</b> he <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head down as far as he could get it, and bent up his back, as if he were about to try to turn a somersault, or to stand on his head.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{used for}} {{a story in the}} Oklahoma Times newspaper. Caption: "A {{youthful}} school administrator, who decided to become a teacher early in life <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> to <b>his</b> choice, will be at the helm when Oklahoma City's fourth highschool, the new structure at Northeast Thirtieth street and Kelley avenue, is opened in September. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This Airley's smart--wahn't quite smart enough, though. His {{bright idea}} come a little mite late. Hunted up old Christy, got {{the key to}} his law office right here in the Duncan Block, went up through the skylight, clumb down to the roof of Randall's store next door, shinned up the lightnin' rod on t'other side, <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head plump into the Opery House window." ...|$|E
6000|$|But now Friar Tuck came bustling up. [...] "Gi' ye good den, brothers," [...] said he. [...] "I {{am right}} glad to welcome {{some of my}} cloth in this naughty place. Truly, methinks these rogues of outlaws would stand but an ill chance {{were it not for}} the prayers of Holy Tuck, who laboreth so hard for their well-being." [...] Here he winked one eye slyly <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> tongue into his cheek.|$|E
60|$|The {{village was}} rustlingly quiet. Carl skipped slowly and unhappily {{to the group}} of box-elders beside the {{workshop}} <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> finger-nails into the cobwebby crevices of the black bark. He made overtures for company on any terms to a hop-robin, a woolly worm, and a large blue fly, but they all scorned his advances, and when he yelled an ingratiating invitation to a passing dog it seemed to swallow its tail and ears as it galloped off. No one else appeared.|$|E
6000|$|Yet {{he dreamed}} of it, <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> to <b>his</b> dreams, <b>and</b> {{would not have the}} reality of Cossethay and Ilkeston. There he sat stubbornly in his corner at the [...] "Red Lion", smoking and musing and {{occasionally}} lifting his beer-pot, and saying nothing, {{for all the world like}} a gorping farm-labourer, as he said himself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This is Mr Melmotte,' said Lord Alfred, who had deserted {{the ladies}} <b>and</b> still <b>stuck</b> to <b>his</b> master. 'Lord De Griffin, let me {{introduce}} you to Mr Melmotte.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray, don't wish now; for it {{may come}} to pass as the man's wish in the fairy tale did, and the black pudding flew up <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> tight to <b>his</b> wife's nose." ...|$|R
