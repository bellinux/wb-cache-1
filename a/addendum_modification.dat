The range of <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> co-efficient is taken from negative value to positive value through zero by considering both the upper limit(peaking limit) and the lower limit (undercutting limit). The root stress factor is found out for various loading positions. The variation of root stress factor with <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> co-efficient is shown when only the driving gear is modified. A study into {{the effects of}} <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> on root stress using mathematical formulation as well as finite element analysis when both the driver and follower are modified {{at the same time}} also for different gear ratios. The value of root stress factor decreases with an increasing <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> coefficient when only the driver is modified. The root stress factor also decreases when pressure angle is increased. The root stress factor is further decreased when both the driver and follower are modified at the same time.

40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{principles}} of equalized sliding coefficients and equalized teeth bending strength, the optimization mathematical model for calculating and allocating the <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> coefficients of involute cylindrical gear is firstly established. Then the measures to calculate the tooth parameters in real-time during the optimization steps are achieved. Finally, the optimization program for calculating and allocating the modification coefficients is developed using the Optimization Toolbox in MATLAB combined with VC++. Compared with the traditional methods such as enclosed chart and graph method, the proposed optimization method in this paper can update the constraints during the optimization process and obtain the accurate modification coefficients. The examples show that the proposed optimization method is more rational and accurate.

40|$|Abstract. Planetary {{gear drive}} with minor teeth {{difference}} (zd≤ 8) {{is one of}} the advanced transmitting styles and could meet the requirement of larger ratio in a smaller size of dimension. Generally the gears with <b>addenda</b> <b>modifications</b> play a principal role in planetary gear drive of minor teeth difference to avoid teeth interference during the mesh, and this transmission implies cumbersome parameters calculations and brings up higher angle of engagement to affect the load capacity because of life weakening on carrier bearings involved. In fact, provided some certain promise, zero <b>addenda</b> <b>modification</b> (viz. X-zero) drive with minor teeth difference could also qualify for gearing conditions so as to reduce the complicacy of calculations and angle of engagement mentioned above. From investigating the relationships amongst the total teeth number of internal gear, difference of tooth number between internal and external gear, addendum coefficient and teeth profile interference criterion, the unique design characteristic about X–zero gear drive with minor teeth difference are outlined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{simplified}} {{tooth profile}} and the complicated load distribution along the contact line, the traditional analytic method cannot satisfy the accuracy requirement while car-rying out <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> of the helical gears. To overcome this disadvantage, {{a new way}} based on cross-section method is presented to calculate the deformation of helical tooth tip. First, the tooth is divided into copies of cross-section along face width and the moment of inertia for each section is calculated. Also, the load is distributed according to length of the contact line, {{and the effect of}} deflected load is taken into account as well. Based on these works, a general formula of helical tooth tip deformation is deduced. Then, this formula is applied to calculate the adden-dum modification width ac. In addition, considering that tooth tip modification will shorten the meshing line, three models used to control length of the remaining meshing line are proposed and <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> height hc is defined accordingly. Finally, an instance is given to verify the good agreement between results of this study and those of a finite element model.

40|$|Griffith Energy Limited Liability Corporation (Griffith) {{proposes to}} {{construct}} and operate the Griffith Energy Project (Project), a natural gas-fuel, combined cycle power plant, on private lands south of Kingman, Ariz. The Project would be a ''merchant plant'' which means {{that it is not}} owned by a utility and there is currently no long-term commitment or obligation by any utility to purchase the capacity and energy generated by the power plant. Griffith applied to interconnect its proposed power plant with the Western Area Power Administration's (Western) Pacific Northwest-Pacific Southwest Intertie and Parker-Davis transmission systems. Western, as a major transmission system owner, needs to provide access to its transmission system when it is requested by an eligible organization per existing policies, regulations and laws. The proposed interconnection would integrate the power generated by the Project into the regional transmission grid and would allow Griffith to supply its power to the competitive electric wholesale market. Based on the application, Western's proposed action is to enter into an interconnection and construction agreement with Griffith for the requested interconnections. The proposed action includes the power plant, water wells and transmission line, natural gas pipelines, new electrical transmission lines and a substation, upgrade of an existing transmission line, and access road to the power plant. Construction of segments of the transmission lines and a proposed natural gas pipeline also require a grant of right-of-way across Federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the higher}} speed ratio and profile shifted gear drives, the maximum fillet {{stress in the}} pinion and the gear is not equal. The {{load-carrying}} {{capacity of the gear}} drives can be improved by removing this unbalanced maximum fillet stress. This paper has explained an idea to remove this unbalanced maximum fillet stress and design the spur gear drives with uniform fillet strength. This uniform fillet strength of the gear drive can be achieved by changing the tooth thickness of basic racks on the pitch lines from the standard tooth thickness (0. 5 πm) in to a non-standard one (kgcπm, kgc≠ 0. 5). The influence of gear parameters such as backup ratio, cutter tip radius and <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> factors on the maximum fillet stress has been analyzed through FEM with different values of tooth thickness coefficient and finally the optimum value of tooth thickness coefficient are suggested for the given spur gear drive that improve the fillet capacity in bending...|$|E

Because of the concentric degree demand of the internal gear and the outline step shaft is higher, length of below shaft is large and diameter is small, So plastic forming of the shaft is very difficult. Meeting the needs of markets and improving comprehensive function of automobiles, the high efficient precision forming technology method of single-step chipless-forming for internal gear tooth surface and external step shaft is put forward based on analysis, study and repeated test. In the same time, a set of high accuracy die with simple novel structure and long service life is designed and manufactured. The advantages of the method have been verified that utilization ratio of material and production efficiency is high. For this reason, the method is profitable reference for producing {{the same type of}} complex shape gear shaft...|$|E
40|$|Gears {{are used}} to {{transmit}} motion or power from one shaft to another. Spur gears {{are used to}} transmit power between two parallel shafts. This paper deals with the comparative study of tooth profile with aspect of spur gear tooth bending strength in altered tooth-sum gearing. Using profile shift {{it is possible to}} alter the tooth-sum of a gear pair operating between a specified center distance and module. The described procedure implies research of tooth profile parameters influence on spur gear tooth bending strength for a tooth-sum of 100 when it is altered by + 4 teeth for a pressure angle of 20 ° and module 2 mm and operating between a specified center distance by introducing a negative profile shift. In order to compare the bending stress of meshed gear teeth for gear pairs with different tooth profile the comparative diagrams are made. Many conclusions about the influence of tooth profile parameters of spur gear tooth bending strength for altered tooth-sum gearing can be obtained from those diagrams. With the help of these comparative diagrams it is possible to select the optimal values of <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> coefficients and radius of root curvature for a particular gear pair (104 teeth) with aspect of tooth bending strength...|$|E
40|$|Deviations {{from the}} ideal gear {{geometries}} and unfavorable deformations during the operation may cause serious defects called interference. Conjugate action should be maintained, {{which does not}} happen during interference. Due to this, tip of one tooth of the gear will tend to dig in to the portions of the flank of the tooth of the other member of the pair, weakening the teeth. While generation of the gear teeth, if there is interference of the cutter, then a recess is cut {{at the root of}} the tooth. The profile thus generated deviates from the theoretical tooth profile. The removal of the material {{at the root of the}} gear toothresults in undercutting, which weakens the spur gear tooth. So to reduce the interference and undercutting the profile modification or profile shift or <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> should be used. In this work, at the outset, a C-PROGRAM is created for the development of the standard spur gear tooth and a profile corrected tooth, The C-PROGRAM output file is converted to DXF file conversion [...] .

40|$|Industrial gears {{are often}} very expensive; they {{are large and}} {{manufactured}} in batches of small quantities, or even individually. Nevertheless, several industrial gears are prematurely discarded because of superficial damages, even if modern technologies and machine tools can completely repair these kinds of failures. For a long time, in fact, the repair of a gear {{was limited to the}} modification of the <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> coefficient (a. k. a. profile shift coefficient), while the modification of the pressure angle was usually impracticable, due to the axis limitations of the conventional gear machinery, where the pressure angle and the normal module are set by the tooling. Thus for each repair requiring that pressure angle variation, a gear tooling with the modified pressure angle should be used. In the past decade, the scenario has changed, thanks to the introduction of the - multi-axis CNC Machine Centers, - gear modules for CAD/CAM software, - evolution of CNC Gear Grinding machines, - development of new cutting tools able to machine parts with surface hardness higher than 60 HRC. The above has enabled the application of new types of modification for the refurbishment of superficially damaged gears. This paper presents a new approach to repair industrial gears by showing a case study where pressure angle modification is also considered, differently from the past repairing procedures that dealt only with the modification of the profile shift coefficient. A computer program has been developed to automatically determine the repair alternatives under two goals: minimize the stock removal or maximize gear tooth strength. It will also be shown that the refurbishment of industrial gears using these approaches can result in a 30 - 40 % savings, compared to the cost of a new part, without reducing gear strength. This paper will also show that the whole repair procedure can be carried out in no more than two weeks, depending on the gear size...|$|E
