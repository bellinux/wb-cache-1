25|$|On 21 July, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry urged its {{nationals}} {{residing in}} Libya to adopt measures of extreme caution {{as it was}} preparing to send consular staff {{in order to facilitate}} their return their country following an attack in Egypt's western desert region near the border with Libya that left 22 Egyptian border guards killed. A week later, the ministry announced that it would double its diplomatic officials on the Libyan-Tunisian border and reiterated its call on Egyptian nationals to find shelter in safer places in Libya. On 3 August, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia agreed to cooperate by establishing an <b>airbridge</b> between Cairo and Tunis that would facilitate the transfer of 2,000 to 2,500 Egyptians from Libya daily.|$|E
50|$|KKIA was {{the first}} airport in the Kingdom to install <b>airbridges,</b> to speed up {{handling}} and turnaround times. Each terminal has eight gates with <b>airbridges</b> effectively {{eliminating the need for}} bus journeys between the terminal buildings and waiting aircraft.|$|R

25|$|As {{in other}} RTS games, air {{transports}} {{can be used}} to convey units to specified destinations, in Supreme Commander though by shift queuing orders a transport containing several units can be ordered to drop specific units at subsequent waypoints. An air transport can also be ordered to create a ferry route, an <b>airbridge</b> wherein any land units ordered {{to the start of the}} ferry route will be conveyed by the air transport to the specified destination. The output from a production factory can be routed to a ferry route causing all units constructed by that factory to be automatically ferried to the route's destination. Additional air transports can be ordered to assist an existing ferry route allowing many units to be efficiently transported.|$|E
25|$|In August 1975, the MPLA {{requested}} direct {{assistance from}} the Soviet Union {{in the form of}} ground troops. The Soviets declined, offering to send advisers but no troops; however, Cuba was more forthcoming and in late September dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to Angola, along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies. By independence there were over a thousand Cuban soldiers in the country. They were kept supplied by a massive <b>airbridge</b> carried out with Soviet aircraft. The persistent buildup of Cuban and Soviet military aid allowed the MPLA to drive its opponents from Luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by Zairean and South African troops, which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the FNLA and UNITA. The FNLA was largely annihilated, although UNITA managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from Luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces. From there, Savimbi continued to mount a determined insurgent campaign against the MPLA.|$|E
500|$|Agencies {{under the}} United Nations and non-government {{organizations}} provided {{assistance to the}} storm victims, although aid agencies were cautious in helping a city under control of Al Qaeda. The Red Crescent Society of the United Arab Emirates, {{in conjunction with the}} Khalifa Foundation and the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, provided aid to the hardest hit areas of mainland Yemen via an <b>airbridge,</b> as well as over land. United Nations agencies sent 29trucks carrying 296tons of non-food items, and the World Health Organization sent a ship from Djibouti with 18tons of medical supplies. To prevent the spread of disease, officials began mass immunizing children under five years old, as well as distributing mosquito nets. A national effort to vaccinate against polio was disrupted in six governorates by the cyclone, but was completed by December. Médecins Sans Frontières established a medical clinic in Mukalla while also setting up a water tank. To help with food shortages, the World Food Programme had provided High Energy Biscuits by 30November to 24,900people, using pre-stocked supplies. The International Organization for Migration provided [...] of water per day in Shabwah and Abyan governorates, and also helped clean sewage and debris from the storm. Agencies also delivered hygiene kits and food to the hardest hit areas. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees provided emergency beds, cooking utensils, and other supplies to about 1,600families.|$|E

50|$|Málaga Airport {{has three}} terminals, {{adjacent}} to each other. There {{is also a}} General Aviation Terminal and a Cargo Terminal. The Airport consists of three piers or docks used by airlines: Pier B (with 13 gates, 7 with <b>airbridges),</b> Pier C (with 10 gates, 7 with <b>airbridges)</b> and Pier D (with 20 gates, 12 with <b>airbridges).</b> Pier B is used for non-European traffic, Pier C is used by non-Schengen Traffic and Pier D is used for Schengen Traffic. Flights to the UK and Ireland use both Pier B and Pier C. EasyJet, EasyJet Switzerland & Ryanair flights check in at Terminal 2 whilst all others use Terminal 3. The terminals have a total of 164 check-in desks, and have a total of 48 boarding gates of which 26 have <b>airbridges.</b> Although certain airlines check-in at certain terminals, all flights leave from Terminal 3.|$|R
50|$|Later in 1986, {{infrastructure}} works were undertaken to accommodate larger aircraft. Thus, a new terminal was built including <b>airbridges</b> {{to meet the}} expected increase in traffic growth, and a car park attached to the new building and customs service for international routes. The new terminal consisted of two floors and could accommodate up to four aircraft simultaneously via <b>airbridges.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{largest of}} the Modules located in the east. It has 33 gates of which 9 have <b>airbridges.</b> It is used by Niki and Condor along with EasyJet flights to Schengen destinations. The {{majority}} of <b>airbridges</b> have airberlin.com written on them. The southern area of the Module was worked on and reopened in May 2010. The refurbishment and expansion is so that the Module can handle more flights, and to improve ways {{to get into the}} pier as it is the longest walk from security control. There will also be a further 8 gates with <b>airbridges,</b> but there will still be 33 in total.|$|R

50|$|The Cuba-Angola <b>airbridge</b> (Portuguese: Ponte aérea Cuba-Angola) was an <b>airbridge</b> {{conducted}} in 1974 and 1975 {{to allow the}} arrival of Cuban troops and military equipment in Angola. Its goal was to support the MPLA political party, {{as part of a}} larger Cuban operation known as Operation Carlota. The <b>airbridge</b> allowed the entry of Cuban troops and military equipment in Angola to strengthen the weakened People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA), the military wing of the MPLA. The Cuban special troops and military equipment were initially transported from Cuba in two old four-engine Bristol Britannias by the Cuban national airline, Cubana de Aviación. The establishment of the <b>airbridge</b> revitalized the MPLA and is seen as a turning point in its consolidation of power in Angola.|$|E

40|$|Complex {{integrated}} circuits require multiple wiring layers. In complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing, these layers are robustly separated by amorphous dielectrics. These dielectrics would dominate energy loss in superconducting {{integrated circuits}}. Here we demonstrate {{a procedure that}} capitalizes on the structural benefits of inter-layer dielectrics during fabrication and mitigates the added loss. We separate and support multiple wiring layers throughout fabrication using SiO_ 2 scaffolding, then remove it post-fabrication. This technique is compatible with foundry level processing and the can be generalized to make many different forms of low-loss multi-layer wiring. We use this technique to create freestanding aluminum vacuum gap crossovers (<b>airbridges).</b> We characterize the added capacitive loss of these <b>airbridges</b> by connecting ground planes over microwave frequency λ/ 4 coplanar waveguide resonators and measuring resonator loss. We measure a low power resonator loss of ∼ 3. 9 × 10 ^- 8 per bridge, which is 100 times lower than dielectric supported bridges. We further characterize these <b>airbridges</b> as crossovers, control line jumpers, {{and as part of}} a coupling network in gmon and fuxmon qubits. We measure qubit characteristic lifetimes (T_ 1 's) in excess of 30 μs in gmon devices...|$|R
