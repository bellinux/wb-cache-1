The explanation by Federation president Dino Meneghin was that admitting the newly created organisation would go against league rules and create an unsustainable legal precendent (indebted clubs - not the case of Benetton Treviso - forming a new organisation to stay in the league), Meneghin also bemoaned the lack of reaction since Benetton announced its withdrawal eighteen months beforehand {{and the fact that the}} two entities did not merge.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the present paper is to {{investigate}} the developement of a local failure in slope and the transitional deformation to collapse, which cannot be analysed by the clasical stability analyses of slopes. In this paper，such a finite element analysis is proposed that cross anisotropic materials (i. e. transversely isotropic ones) simulate the soil materials after yield which reduced thier stiffness anisotropically to the direction of the plane of both slide and tensile rupture. And we <b>aplly</b> it to the slope containing the very soft clay layer which parallels the surface of slope partially. The following conclusions have been drawn from the numerical analyses. 1) A local failure usually initiate at the discontinuities (i. e. the edge of the weakness plane). 2) Soil materials are weakened by a number of small tensile cracks along the bed，before a slope collapse occurs along the rainforced plane. 3) The displacement has an inclination to become larger nonlineally，with the developement of a local failure. As the result of calculating the safety factor Nf，apllying the clascal stability analysis to the model analysed by the finite element method，we recognised it rather dangerous to <b>aplly</b> it easely to natural slopes，becouse it can take no account of a local failure that caused by the stress concentration depends on the discontinuities...|$|E
