5|$|Any general {{property}} of Banach spaces {{continues to hold}} for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to <b>another</b> <b>is</b> an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a continuous and bijective linear function from one Banach space to <b>another</b> <b>is</b> an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to <b>another</b> <b>is</b> continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E

5|$|Many {{legends and}} fantastic stories about Anne Boleyn have survived over the centuries. One {{is that she}} was {{secretly}} buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors. Her body was said to have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> that her heart, at her request, was buried in Erwarton (Arwarton) Church, Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker.|$|E
5|$|One {{circumstance}} {{which may}} call for issuance {{of a second}} passport of a particular type is a prolonged visa-processing delay especially for Angola and São Tomé and Príncipe visa applications. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> safety or security. The period of validity of a second passport issued under either circumstance is generally two years from the date of issue.|$|E
50|$|Godzilla Game was a {{board game}} {{released}} by Mattel in 1978. Between two and four people could play. Each player controlled six spaceships. One player's spaceships <b>were</b> all green, <b>another's</b> <b>were</b> all yellow, <b>another's</b> <b>were</b> all orange, and <b>another's</b> <b>were</b> all magenta. Occasionally Godzilla would appear and eat {{one of the}} spaceships. The last player to have a spaceship left would be the winner.|$|R
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Sir Tristram {{enters the}} tournament] Then {{straightway}} there came against Sir Tristram four {{knights of the}} other party, and one of these was Sir Gaheris, and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> Sir Griflet and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> Sir Bagdemagus and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> Sir Kay. But Sir Tristram was possessed with a great joy of battle, so that {{in a very short}} time he had struck down or overthrown all those knights, beginning with Sir Gaheris, and ending with Sir Kay the seneschal.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{solutions}} to the agent design problem. We have extended the theory of intelligent agent systems. One of the extensions <b>was</b> "society agents", <b>another</b> <b>was</b> "evolution", <b>another</b> <b>was</b> "wrapper agents", yet <b>another</b> <b>was</b> multimedia and VR generated at various sites. We {{have shown that the}} extended theory is realistic by designing a GIS + Swarm solution to a complex but important modelling problem, which must be run on a network of intercommunicating processors...|$|R
5|$|One {{possible}} lingering {{effect of}} the Winfield Scotts wreck was the introduction of black rats to the ecosystem of the Channel Islands. While the wreck is one possible source {{for the arrival of}} rats on Anacapa, <b>another</b> <b>is</b> the later construction of a lighthouse. The first mention of rats on the island is in 1907.|$|E
5|$|The M2A {{was sold}} {{on to be}} used by various private racers in the United Kingdom before being {{destroyed}} by fire in 1969.

5|$|The Oxford English Dictionary derives {{the word}} straightforwardly from Old English butorflēoge, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German {{show that the}} name is ancient. A {{possible}} source of the name is the bright yellow male of the brimstone (Gonepteryx rhamni); <b>another</b> <b>is</b> that butterflies were on the wing in meadows during {{the spring and summer}} butter season while the grass was growing.|$|E

5|$|The Smithsonian Institution {{displayed}} a Little Boy (complete, except for enriched uranium), until 1986. The Department of Energy took the weapon {{from the museum}} to remove its inner components, so the bombs could not be stolen and detonated with fissile material.

Three other disarmed bombs are {{on display in the}} United States; <b>another</b> <b>is</b> at the Imperial War Museum in London.|$|E

5|$|The {{manuscript}} is {{dated to}} {{the first half of}} the 4th century and is likely slightly older than Codex Sinaiticus, which was also transcribed in the 4th century. One argument to support this, is that Sinaiticus already has the, at that time, very new Eusebian Canon tables, but Vaticanus does not. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> the slightly more archaic style of Vaticanus, and the complete absence of ornamentation.|$|E

5|$|The {{matching}} rules {{can be described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|The myth {{influenced}} popular {{religion as}} well. One {{example is the}} magical healing spells based on Horus's childhood. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> {{the use of the}} Eye of Horus as a protective emblem in personal apotropaic amulets. Its mythological restoration made it appropriate for this purpose, as a general symbol of well-being.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{additional}} critiques as well. One is that NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery. But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA had little effect on capital markets one way or the other. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> that political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery. But at least one study has shown no effect whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Using fossil evidence, {{there are}} three main {{theories}} for the origin of modern amphibians. One is that they evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> that they evolved from lepospondyls, most likely the lysorophians. A third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolved from dissorophoids.|$|E

The book also relates tragic events: one of Syvia's friends disappears, and <b>another</b> <b>is</b> killed and burned in an extermination camp. The ghetto is liberated one day shy of Syvia's tenth birthday, on January 19, 1945. Syvia, her older sister Dora, and a younger cousin, Isaac, were three of only twelve children who survived.|$|E
