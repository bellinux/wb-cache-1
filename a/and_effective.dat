5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown to be safe <b>and</b> <b>effective</b> against Myrmecia venom.|$|E
