5|$|Airway {{management}} can {{be classified}} into closed or open techniques depending on the system of ventilation used. Tracheal intubation is a typical example of <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> technique as ventilation occurs using <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> circuit. Several open techniques exist, such as spontaneous ventilation, apnoeic ventilation or jet ventilation. Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which determine when it should be used.|$|E
5|$|As a {{complete}} normed space, Hilbert spaces are by definition also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance {{is the notion}} of <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> set in {{a complete}} metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E

5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means that for <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related {{directly to the}} difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E

As the remnants approached a weakness in the subtropical ridge across the western Atlantic on August5, its forward speed gradually slowed as well. A combination of microwave and satellite imagery during the morning hours of August5 revealed the reformation of <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> low, and Colin's remnants regained tropical storm status at this time while located 280mi (450km) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
