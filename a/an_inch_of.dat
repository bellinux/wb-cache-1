5|$|John M. Harlan's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} {{towards the end}} of his career. His eyesight began to fail during the late 1960s. To cover this, he would bring materials to within <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> his eyes, and have clerks and his wife read to him (once when the Court took an obscenity case, a chagrined Harlan had his wife read him Lady Chatterley's Lover). Gravely ill, he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein {{marked the end}} of Model's special {{relationship}} with Hitler, who on 21 January 1945 issued an order that all the divisions of Army Group B would thenceforth be personally responsible to him to limit Model's operational freedom of decision. Any suggestion of its withdrawal back to the river Rhine to obtain a better fighting position - given the Third Reich's weakening strength against the Allied torrent of men and material - was forbidden, and it was ordered to conduct its actions from now on upon the strategic basis of not yielding <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> ground and an abandonment of tactical manoeuvre.|$|E

5|$|In the 1903 CAHL season, Ottawa and the Montreal Victorias both {{finished}} {{in first place}} with 6–2 records. The top scorers were the Victorias' Russell Bowie, who scored seven goals in one game and six in another, and McGee, whose top performance saw him score five goals in a game. The two clubs faced off in a two-game total goals series to decide the league championship and Stanley Cup. The first game, played in Montreal on slushy ice that made it a desperate struggle to score, ended 1–1. The return match in Ottawa, witnessed by three thousand fans, was on ice coated with <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> water. The conditions did not hinder Ottawa, as they won 8–0, with McGee scoring three goals and the other five shared among the three Gilmour brothers, Dave (3), Suddy (1) and Bill (1), to win their first Cup. This started {{a period in which}} the team held the Stanley Cup and defeated all challengers until March 1906.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Karen {{produced}} {{light to}} moderate winds across Atlantic Canada, peaking at 47mph (76km/h) with {{a gust of}} 64mph (103km/h) in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, along with a 26mph (42km/h) report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Rainbands in the storm dropped light rainfall of up to 1.8inches (46mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and 1.4inches (35mm) in Saint John, New Brunswick, most of which fell in {{a short amount of}} time. Skewed to {{the left side of the}} transitioning storm, the rainfall was beneficial for the drought-stricken areas of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Due to the fast-moving nature of the storm, though, most areas reported only around half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> rain. A buoy in Halifax Harbour reported wave heights of up to 16.7feet (5.1m), causing breaking waves at docks white caps along the ocean. Damage in Canada was minor due to the storm, limited to an uprooted tree in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia and several other trees with damaged branches. There were no injuries or fatalities in Canada.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{affected}} areas were already hit by a significant winter storm during the weekend of December 1 and December 2. Many areas had received close to three-quarters of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> ice from Nebraska to Illinois, causing {{tens of thousands of}} power outages and at least 16 deaths across nine states and the Canadian province of Quebec, the latter receiving a major snow storm.|$|E
25|$|To {{maintain}} top quality, berries {{are harvested}} {{at least every}} other day. The berries are picked with the caps still attached and with at least half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> stem left. Strawberries need {{to remain on the}} plant to fully ripen because they do not continue to ripen after being picked. Rotted and overripe berries are removed to minimize insect and disease problems. The berries do not get washed until just before consumption.|$|E

25|$|On 1968, {{during the}} height of the {{so-called}} 'Operation Merdeka', against the combined might of the Royal Navy and Royal Malaysian Navy ships, BRP Cebu stood her 'ground' to protect the maritime border of the Philippines and confronted the British-Malaysian warships raring to do a battle with her after learning that the Philippines is preparing to invade Sabah. The stand-off between the Philippine Navy and British-Malaysian Navy lasted for 10 tense hours giving the Philippine Navy patrol craft escort/corvette a victory for not yielding even <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> the Philippine territory.|$|E
25|$|Some wine experts {{debate the}} {{importance}} of humidity for proper wine storage. In the Wine Spectator, writer Matt Kramer cites a French study which claimed that the relative humidity within a bottle is maintained at 100% regardless of the closure used or {{the orientation of the}} bottle. However, Alexis Lichine contends that low humidity can still be detrimental to premium wine quality due to the risk of the cork drying out. As a way of maintaining optimal humidity, Lichine recommends spreading half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> gravel {{on the floor of a}} wine cellar and periodically sprinkling it with some water.|$|E
25|$|One storm {{affected}} the Midlands, producing hailstones {{reported to be}} larger than golfballs, with conglomerate stones up to 10cm across. Burbage in Leicestershire {{saw some of the}} most severe hail. Another supercell produced a tornado near Sleaford, in Lincolnshire. Homes and businesses were damaged as <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> rain fell in two hours in some areas of the West Midlands. Hailstones as large as golf balls fell in parts of the East Midlands, while the 2012 Olympic torch relay was briefly halted by lightning. A motorist was swept to his death after his vehicle was overwhelmed by flood waters in Shropshire.|$|E

25|$|As {{the storm}} {{moved into the}} Northeastern United States and {{portions}} of Ontario and Quebec on December 2, six inches (152mm) of snow fell in portions of central New York, while three inches (76mm) of snow fell across New Jersey with a dusting in several other areas. A second band of precipitation during the late hours produced areas of rain and freezing rain (of up to four-tenths of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> ice) across several valley areas from New York to Pennsylvania, with rain further {{to the east and}} south, while locally over a foot of snow fell across parts of Upstate New York, Vermont and New Hampshire, causing several accidents which forced the shutdown of northbound Interstate 89.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the dish but a common one is made by soaking cooked rice in water overnight. Rice is boiled the usual way. Then phaen or starch is strained away. Rice is cooled in air temperature for 3–4 hours. Then cool water is added {{in a way that}} about <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> water rises above the rice. Rice is generally covered with a light piece of fabric. 12–24 hours later panta bhat is ready. Care must be taken to cover the dish during the long soaking to avoid contamination. The soaked rice is usually eaten in the morning with salt, lime, chili (either raw or roasted) and onions (sliced or whole) mostly for flavor. Water is discarded before consumption. Sometimes edible oils may be added.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1940, Ribbentrop made a {{sustained}} but unsuccessful effort to have Spain enter the war on the Axis side. During his talks with the Spanish foreign minister, Ramón Serrano Súñer, Ribbentrop affronted Súñer with his tactless behaviour, especially his suggestion that Spain cede the Canary Islands to Germany. An angry Súñer replied that he would rather see the Canaries sink into the Atlantic then cede <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> Spanish territory. An area in which Ribbentrop enjoyed more success arose in September 1940, {{when he had the}} Far Eastern agent of the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, Dr. Heinrich Georg Stahmer, start negotiations with the Japanese foreign minister, Yōsuke Matsuoka, for an anti-American alliance. The end result of these talks was the signing in Berlin on 27 September 1940 of the Tripartite Pact by Ribbentrop, Count Ciano, and Japanese Ambassador Saburo Kurusu.|$|E
