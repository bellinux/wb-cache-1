40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems facing the telecommunications industry {{is the extent to which}} competition will be introduced into what has been, for the most part, a regulated industry. In the forefront of the competitive environment has been the telephone interconnection industry. The genesis of this industry was the Carterfone decision by the Federal Communications Commission which allowed competition in the interconnection field. It is the thesis of this project that the most significant factor affecting the telephone interconnection industry today is the continued impact of competition on the industry. To insure that the project stayed within manageable limits the authors chose to examine the issues dealing with that part of the interconnect industry providing for the connection of <b>answering</b> <b>devices,</b> acoustic couplers, personal custom telephones, intercom systems, key business systems, or private branch exchanges (PBX) to the telephone system. Issues surrounding the competitive interconnect services of microwave and satellite links provided by the specialized common carriers are beyond the scope of this project. The specialized common carrier area is a critical issue on its own right and should be the subject of investigation by future participants in the Telecommunications Program. An analysis of present, past and potential interconnect manufacturers is provided to show how the lure and promise of competition has affected the industry. Because there are hundreds of companies involved in the manufacture and marketing of interconnect devices, only a limited cross section has been chosen for this project...|$|R

50|$|A small device, {{about the}} size of a home {{wireless}} router, contains the necessary electronics which allow plain old telephone service to be provided to one or two telephone jacks on the back of the unit, as well as having a small radio antenna and a transceiver for the wireless side of the connection. LED indicator lights on the front typically show signal strength and voicemail messages waiting. The devices usually cannot provide enough ringing current for more than one phone and one externally powered device, such as a telephone <b>answering</b> <b>device</b> or the base station for a cordless phone. For this reason, it is not recommended to connect these devices to a home's wiring (which also requires the disconnection of the wiring at the network interface device, just as when a cable telephone or other whole-home VoIP service is installed). A rechargeable battery backup is normally provided to run the device during a power outage lasting no more than a few hours, significantly less standby time than a true mobile device.|$|E
5000|$|Most 20th century {{answering}} machines used {{magnetic recording}} which Valdemar Poulsen invented in 1898. [...] The {{creation of the}} first practical automatic <b>answering</b> <b>device</b> for telephones, however, is in dispute. Clarence Hickman worked for Bell Laboratories from 1930 where he developed methods for the magnetic recording and working on the recognition of speech patterns and electromechanical switching systems. In 1934, he developed a tape-based answering machine which phone company AT&T, {{as the owner of}} Bell Laboratories, kept under wraps for years for fear that an answering machine would result in fewer telephone calls. Many claim it was William Muller in 1935, {{but it could have been}} created already in 1931 by William Schergens whose device used phonographic cylinders. Ludwig Blattner promoted a telephone answering machine in 1929 based on his Blattnerphone magnetic recording technology. In 1935 inventor Benjamin Thornton developed a machine to record voice messages from the caller. The device reportedly also was able to keep track of the time the recordings were made. Although many sources maintain that he invented it in 1935, Thornton had actually filed a patent in 1930 (Number 1831331) for this machine, which utilized a phonographic record as the recording medium.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Traditional {{survey methods}} are fast {{reaching}} their “use by ” dates. It {{is much harder}} for researchers to contact households through the telephone {{as a result of}} call screening and <b>answering</b> machine <b>devices.</b> In relation to face to face interviews, housing estates and buildings are increasingly becoming fenced off and protected by security systems making it virtually impossible for the researcher to enter the premises, if not expected, as well as the fact that more often than not, householders are not available at the time when the survey is being conducted. In addition, the over use of marketing surveys has led people to believe that every survey they are asked to complete is of this type. Together, these difficulties have led to rising item and unit non-response, and consequently, rising unit costs. This is not only a phenomena associated with travel surveys, but rather the entire realm of social science research. Development of the World Wide Web has had some dramati...|$|R

50|$|Besides these solutions, mostly {{requiring}} a constantly running computer, since a wake-on-ring function then (~1995) {{started to take}} too much time to boot up an operating system, a few so-called selfmodems were available from e.g. U.S.-Robotics or ELSA Technology: the Sportster MessagePlus, the 56K Message Modem External, and the MicroLink Office.

Once the number or color is chosen, the holder uses their fingers to switch between the two groups of colors and numbers inside the fortune teller. The holder switches these positions a number of times: which may be determined by the number of letters in the color selected, the number originally chosen, or the sum of both. Once the holder has finished switching the positions of the fortune teller, the player chooses one of the flaps revealed. These flaps often have colors or numbers on them. The holder then lifts the flap and reveals the fortune underneath. Steps may be repeated to suit the users.|$|R

In recent years, because of low cost, chainsaws have become popular among unprofessionals, e. g. for cutting firewood and trimming trees. Serious or lethal lesions due to the use of chainsaws or electric chainsaws are often observed by traumatologists or forensic pathologists. Such serious accidents often occur during occupational activities and are essentially due to kickback or uncorrected use of the tool, or when the operator falls down losing the control of the implement. A new device in order to stop a cutting chain was developed and adapted to an electric chainsaw. The device is based on a Wiimote controller (Nintendo™), including two accelerometers and two gyroscopes for detecting rotation and inclination.
