5|$|Although {{primarily}} rural, England had {{a number}} of old, economically important towns in 1066. A large amount of trade came through the Eastern towns, including London, York, Winchester, Lincoln, Norwich, Ipswich and Thetford. Much of this trade was with France, the Low Countries and Germany, but the North-East of England traded with partners as far away as Sweden. Cloth was <b>already</b> <b>being</b> imported to England before the invasion through the mercery trade.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{evolved from}} older bat-and-ball games <b>already</b> <b>being</b> played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by {{immigrants}} to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was {{widely recognized as}} the national sport of the United States. Baseball is currently popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{took the}} new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish {{composer}} John Field, {{to a deeper}} level of sophistication. He {{was the first to}} write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, <b>already</b> <b>being</b> developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.10 published in 1833, Op.25 in 1837).|$|E

5|$|In September 2007, the Office of Rail Regulation {{granted the}} Wrexham Shropshire & Marylebone Railway (WSMR) Company {{permission}} to operate services from Wrexham in North Wales via , Telford and the West Midlands to Marylebone; they started in early 2008, restoring direct London services to Shropshire (Wrexham <b>already</b> <b>being</b> {{served by a}} Virgin Trains service to Euston), with five return trips per day on weekdays. This was reduced to four trains a day in March 2009. These services ceased in January 2011 after passenger number reduced; the closure was blamed on the Great Recession.|$|E

5|$|Bristol Aero Engines and Hooker {{had already}} {{been working on a}} project to produce a {{suitable}} VTOL engine; this engine combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of the}} compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. With a suitable engine <b>already</b> <b>being</b> developed, Camm and his team at HSA proceeded to develop the company's first VTOL aircraft, designated as the Hawker Siddeley P.1127. The P.1127 was envisioned as a subsonic VTOL-capable strike aircraft, while also serving to demonstrate and prove the capabilities of the aircraft's basic configuration and to validate the performance of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine that powered it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hope was exhibited, Watts had already {{committed}} himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, {{and although he}} received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include Hope in this donation, {{in light of the}} fact that it was <b>already</b> <b>being</b> considered one of his most important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as <b>already</b> <b>being</b> in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

5|$|It {{also became}} clear that Apollo would outgrow the Canaveral launch {{facilities}} in Florida. The two newest launch complexes were <b>already</b> <b>being</b> built for the Saturn I and IB rockets at the northernmost end: LC-34 and LC-37. But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission, so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center (LOC) immediately north of Canaveral at Merritt Island. The design, development and construction of the center was conducted by Kurt H. Debus, a member of Dr. Wernher von Braun's original V-2 rocket engineering team. Debus was named the LOC's first Director. Construction began in November 1962. Upon Kennedy's death, President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29, 1963, to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{force was}} {{originally}} intended to join General William Hull at Detroit, but Hull surrendered Detroit on August 16 and his army was captured. Johnson reported to William Henry Harrison, Territorial Governor of Indiana, then {{in command of the}} entire Northwest frontier. He was ordered to relieve Fort Wayne in the northeast of the Territory, which was <b>already</b> <b>being</b> attacked by the Indians. On September 18, 1812, Johnson's men reached Fort Wayne in time to save it, and turned back an Indian ambush. They returned to Kentucky and disbanded, going {{out of their way to}} burn Potawatomi villages along the Elkhart River.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, one {{improvement}} to Zeus was <b>already</b> <b>being</b> studied: a new phased-array radar replacing Zeus' mechanical ones {{would greatly}} {{increase the number}} of targets and interceptors that a single site could handle. Much more powerful computers were needed to match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies at Bell Labs started in 1960 on what was then known as the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, Western Electric and Sylvania were selected to build a prototype, with Sperry Rand Univac providing the control computer.|$|E
