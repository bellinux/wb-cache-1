5|$|After a spell in {{civilian}} life following the war, Malley joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1925, serving with No.3 Squadron. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and {{worked closely with}} Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the Sino-Japanese War <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand,</b> though his reports were given little weight in Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government. After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{painting}} lie corpses {{in various states}} of undress. The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand,</b> and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Caerphilly's water defences {{were almost}} {{certainly}} inspired by those at Kenilworth, where a similar set of artificial lakes and dams was created. Gilbert de Clare had fought at {{the siege of}} Kenilworth in 1266 and would have seen these <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand.</b> Caerphilly's water defences provided particular protection against mining, which could otherwise undermine castle walls during the period, and are considered the most advanced of their kind in Britain.|$|E

There were earlier engagements to be met; there was an {{exciting}} editorial episode to be got behind you; and there was material for a veridical representation of the ardent young life of the New York Synthesis of Art Studies to be gathered as nearly <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hands</b> and as furtively as possible.|$|R

Some doubt exists though about Tintin and Alph-Art, left unfinished by Hergé and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>handed</b> over to the Studios to be finished by Bob De Moor. Fanny Remi then changed her mind and decided to publish just the sketches by Hergé, to the disappointment of Bob De Moor.|$|R

In October 1944, Cannan travelled with General Blamey to visit General Douglas MacArthur in Hollandia {{in order to}} prepare for Philippines campaign. In the event, plans to employ Australian troops in the Philippines fell through and they were employed in the Borneo Campaign instead. Cannan visited New Britain, Lae, Hollandia, Bougainville and Aitape in February 1945 to help plan the final campaigns and Hollandia, Morotai, Labuan and Darwin in August 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Prince of Wales – {{the future}} Edward VIII – was keen to {{participate}} in the war but the government refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne were captured. Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand</b> and attempted to visit the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, led to his great popularity among veterans of the conflict.|$|E
5|$|For his {{services}} in Siberia, Eichelberger {{was awarded the}} Army Distinguished Service Medal, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 28 March 1919. Graves prevented him from receiving the British Distinguished Service Order and the French Legion of Honor, as had {{other members of the}} Inter-Allied Military Council. Eichelberger did, however, receive the Japanese Imperial Order of Meiji, Order of the Sacred Treasure and Order of the Rising Sun. Siberia gave Eichelberger a chance to observe the Japanese Army <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand,</b> and he was impressed by what he saw of their training and discipline. He concluded that, if properly led, they would be more than a match for American troops. The American Expeditionary Force Siberia was withdrawn in April 1920.|$|E

5|$|Beecham {{appointed}} Victor Olof as his orchestral manager, {{and they}} started recruiting. At {{the top of their}} list were leading musicians with whom Beecham had worked before the war. Four had been founder members of the LPO fifteen years previously: Reginald Kell (clarinet), Gerald Jackson (flute), James Bradshaw (timpani) and Jack Silvester (double-bass). From the current LPO they engaged the oboist Peter Newbury. Beecham persuaded the veteran bassoonist Archie Camden, who had been pursuing a solo career, to return to orchestral work. The cellos were led by Raymond Clark, enlisted from the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The principal horn player was Dennis Brain, who already held the same post in Legge's Philharmonia, but managed to play for both orchestras. Jenkins speculates that as Beecham knew all Britain's orchestral leaders <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand</b> he decided not to try to lure any of them away. His choice was John Pennington, who had been first violin of the London String Quartet from 1927 to 1934, and had then had a career in the US as concertmaster, successively, of the San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Paramount Pictures orchestras.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} the English Benedictine reform were Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury (959–988), Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester (963–984), and Oswald, Archbishop of York (971–992). Dunstan and Æthelwold reached {{maturity}} in Æthelstan's cosmopolitan, intellectual court in the 930s, where they met monks from the European reformed houses which provided {{the inspiration for the}} English movement. In the early 940s Dunstan was appointed Abbot of Glastonbury, where he was joined by Æthelwold, and they spent much of the next decade studying Benedictine texts at Glastonbury, which became the first centre for disseminating monastic reform. The Rule of Saint Benedict was translated into Old English at this time, probably by Æthelwold, and it is the only surviving prose translation of the Rule into a European vernacular in the early Middle Ages. In about 954 Æthelwold wished to go to the Continent to study reforms there <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand,</b> but King Eadred (946–955) refused him permission and appointed him Abbot of Abingdon, which became the second centre. Dunstan was exiled by King Eadwig (955–959) between 956 and 958, and he spent this time observing Benedictine practices at St Peter's Abbey in Ghent. Æthelwold on the other hand appears to have been on good terms with Eadwig, an early indication that the reformers were not united politically. Oswald was a nephew of Oda, Archbishop of Canterbury from 941 to 958. Oda, a supporter of reform, introduced Oswald to Fleury, where he was ordained and spent {{a large part of the}} 950s.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own {{experiences}} {{played a significant}} role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in Hijo de hombre. Later he saw the devastation of WWII <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand</b> in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El trueno ebtre las hojas, set the stage for Hijo de hombre and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.|$|E
40|$|This article {{attempts}} a historical, archaeological {{and social}} {{analysis of the}} practice of mutilating hieroglyphs apparent {{from the end of the}} Middle Kingdom and then continues throughout the Second Intermediate Period. The analysis leads to some new observations about the use and eventual abandonment of this custom, pinpointing its origin around the end of Amenemhat III's reign. The practice seems to have moved with the royal entourage from the north to the south of the country, where it is attested in a slightly later period. At Thebes, the incomplete hieroglyphs system is <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>handed</b> down unchanged, but soon becomes inconsistent and then gradually forgotten before finally disappearing entirely...|$|R

Jane's family (the Barretts) had helped {{give the money}} to build the school's science hall named Barrett Hall. After Alison's {{marriage}} and her move to Boston, a new housemother named Meredith Pembroke comes along, and <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>handed</b> out demerits with reckless abandon because she was overreacting to her own wild adolescence. Andrea, Jane and Toby talked her through the rough time, and then Meredith (nicknamed, Merrie) became as nice and friendly as Alison had been.|$|R

In 1940, he was diagnosed with spinal tuberculosis and was immobilised for two years. By the later stages of the war he had recovered enough to resume his political career, but lost his seat in the general election of 1945. He regained it in 1950, but the following year he left the Commons when, on the death of his father, he inherited the earldom of Home and thereby {{became a member of the}} House of Lords as the 14th Earl of Home. Under the premierships of Winston Churchill, Sir Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan he was appointed to a series of increasingly senior posts, including Leader of the House of Lords and Foreign Secretary. In the latter post, which he held from 1960 to 1963, he supported United States resolve in the Cuban Missile Crisis and was the United Kingdom's signatory of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in August 1963.|$|E

He then asked Jacobs, his London-based, Hove-living celebrity lawyer (Jacobs's other clients included Marlene Dietrich, Diana Dors, Judy Garland, Liberace and Laurence Harvey) to appoint someone specifically to take over the assignment and gave Jacobs power of attorney in the matter. Jacobs <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>handed</b> the daily management of this to his chief clerk, Edward Marke, but it transpired that Marke knew almost nothing about the merchandising business, and so Jacobs was forced to look [...] elsewhere.|$|R

60|$|There {{was much}} {{talk on the}} boat about the Calhoun Land Company, an {{enterprise}} {{which is expected to}} work wholesome results. Colonel Calhoun, a grandson of the statesman, went to Boston and formed a syndicate which purchased a large tract of land on the river, in Chicot County, Arkansas--some ten thousand acres--for cotton-growing. The purpose is to work on a cash basis: buy <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hands,</b> and handle their own product; supply their negro laborers with provisions and necessaries at a trifling profit, say 8 or 10 per cent.; furnish them comfortable quarters, etc., and encourage them to save money and remain on the place.

25|$|Catherine de' Medici's {{patronage}} {{of the arts}} made a significant contribution to the French Renaissance.

As a young woman, she witnessed <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand</b> the artistic flowering stimulated by his patronage.
