50|$|Motor oil, engine oil, or engine {{lubricant}} is any {{of various}} substances comprising base oils enhanced with additives, particularly <b>antiwear</b> additive plus detergents, dispersants and, for multi-grade oils viscosity index improvers. In addition to that, almost all lubricating oils contain corrosion (GB: rust) and oxidation inhibitors. Motor oil {{is used for}} lubrication of internal combustion engines. The main function of motor oil is to reduce friction and wear on moving parts and to clean the engine from sludge (one of the functions of dispersants) and varnish (detergents). It also neutralizes acids that originate from fuel and from oxidation of the lubricant (detergents), improves sealing of piston rings, and cools the engine by carrying heat away from moving parts.|$|E

40|$|Almost {{all modern}} engine {{lubricants}} use the additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) to provide <b>antiwear</b> and extreme pressure protection. However existing and proposed emissions regulations include constraints in {{the concentration of}} ZDDP or other sulphated ash-, phosphorus- and sulphur- (SAPS) containing additives in engine oils, as well as limits to the permissible phosphorus loss from the oil in running engines. The deleterious effects of SAPS on exhaust aftertreatment systems from ZDDP decomposition has lead to {{a great interest in}} identifying alternative low and zero SAPS <b>antiwear</b> additives that can partially of fully replace ZDDP in the next generation of engine oils to extend the life of exhaust after-treatment systems. The aim of the work described in this thesis is to explore under the same test conditions, the film-forming, friction and wear-reducing properties of a very wide range of low and zero SAPS <b>antiwear</b> additives as possible replacements for ZDDP in engine oils, and, where additive types are effective, to investigate their mechanism of action. Some of the alternative low and zero SAPS <b>antiwear</b> additives investigated show wear-reducing performance comparable to the ZDDP used as a benchmark in this research. The most promising alternatives to be used as supplements/replacements for ZDDP are suggested and discussed. One characteristic of ZDDP is that it can form quite thick films on surfaces during rubbing. It is found that many different types of additive can also form thick films, though not generally as thick as ZDDP. However it has been found that there is no significant correlation between the ability of an additive to form a thick boundary film and its ability to control wear. Thick boundary film formation does, however, correlate positively with an increase in friction in contacts operating at intermediate entrainment speeds, so thick film formation should not be taken as a necessary or desirable feature of <b>antiwear</b> additives. It is also found that <b>antiwear</b> additives can give a very wide range of boundary friction coefficient values, depending on the molecular structure of the additive. There thus appears to be scope for optimising the structure of <b>antiwear</b> additives to provide reduced boundary friction. Imperial Users Onl...|$|E

40|$|The <b>antiwear</b> and {{antioxidant}} additives, zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDPs), are {{an essential}} ingredient in engine oil formulations, {{and have been}} in use for many years. These additives function by forming <b>antiwear</b> films on surfaces in sliding contact, and thus reduce friction and wear. Among the surface techniques employed, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (including EXAFS and XANES) has been mainly used because of its high resolution, low detection limit and non-destructive characteristics.;This {{is the first time}} that P and S L-edge XANES spectroscopy has been used to analyze <b>antiwear</b> films and thermal films. About two hundred <b>antiwear</b> films and thermally prepared films have been measured by XANES spectroscopy. It has been found that longer rubbing time, higher concentration of ZDDP, moderate temperature and higher load help to form long chain phosphates. Sulphur species in most of the cases is sulphide. The presence of sulphate in very short rubbing time or high temperature films is likely from sulphur in base oil.;The chemical composition of additives also affects their behaviour. Secondary ZDDP tends to form long chain polyphosphate while primary ZDDP and aryl ZDDP, in most of the cases, form short chain polyphosphate. The chemical state of sulphur in the same film resembles ZnS or alkyl sulphide. It seems that Zn acts as an antioxidant for sulphur and also catalyses the polymerization of phosphates. These properties are more significant for secondary ZDDP than for primary ZDDP. The presence of detergents and dispersant reduce the amount of unreacted ZDDP on the rubbing surface. The addition of the detergent and dispersant may change the polymerization of phosphate in the <b>antiwear</b> films. The S signals are much weaker than P signals and sulphur is in the reduced sulphide form.;Depth profiling results from XPS showed that the <b>antiwear</b> film formed in 30 minutes is shorter than that formed in 12 hours.

40|$|Global {{concerns}} for {{the environmental impact of}} pollutants from automotive sources require considerable reduction of phosphorus and sulphur-based <b>antiwear</b> additives in lubricating oils. One of such additives used as antiwear/extreme pressure (EP) additives in lubricating oils is Zinc Dialkyl DithioPhosphate (ZDDP). Potential replacements for ZDDP are antiwear/EP boron-based additives. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of the tribological properties of model oils of different types of borate <b>antiwear</b> additives are considered for comparison to ZDDP on steel surfaces in tribo-contact. In this thesis, tribological experiments in pure sliding under boundary lubrication conditions were performed using pin-on-reciprocating plate test rig with variations of: additive concentrations in the oil, bulk-oil temperature, sliding process, dissolved, and free water contamination tests. The coefficient of friction response and <b>antiwear</b> performance of tribofilms were evaluated. Bulk oil analysis of the model oils were performed to evaluate their response to different thermal and oxidative conditions in comparison to ZDDP. In addition, chemical characterization of key crystalline boron compounds was done. The physical and chemical aspects of tribofilms generated during tribological tests were evaluated using surface analysis techniques such as: Optical white-light interferometry, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM), Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Nanoindentation. One of the key findings {{of this study is that}} tribofilms from hydrolytically unstable borates additives gave poor <b>antiwear</b> performance compared to ZDDP and other synthetic borate additives with better resistance to hydrolysis. This study has revealed that boric acid is not directly responsible for the poor <b>antiwear</b> performance as previously understood. Tribochemistry results by this thesis has shown that high atomic concentration of boron and particles such as; boron nitride and carbides acts as third body abrasives, are responsible for the poor <b>antiwear</b> performance. The established <b>antiwear</b> mechanism of borate tribofilms relies on the digestion of abrasive iron oxides by trigonal structural groups in boron oxide. Results at different test conditions from this research have indicated that boric acid, iron oxyhydroxide, and tetragonal structural units in boron oxide plays a major role in this process. The established friction reducing mechanism of boron-containing tribofilms relies on the weak van der Waal’s of boric acid and passivation of its high energy edge-sites by moisture. Another major finding of this PhD thesis is that decomposition and volatility of boric acid at certain temperatures affects the easy shear of the lamellar. An important finding from this study indicated that the abnormal behaviour of boron oxide effect in borosilicate glass manufacture could also affect the <b>antiwear</b> performance and durability of tribofilms containing nanoparticle alkali borate ester. In addition, the hardness of built-up tribofilms from oils containing hydrated potassium borate was found to be comparable to ZDDP, unlike organic borates which gave significantly higher hardness. Another major finding of this research is that in moisture-rich atmosphere, borate tribofilms formed on ferrous surfaces was more wear-resistant than ZDDP due to their different tribochemistry. ...|$|E
