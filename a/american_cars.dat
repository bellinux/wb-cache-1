25|$|The use of {{a fashion}} {{designer}} to specially create appearance packages for <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> was {{taken up by the}} Lincoln Continental Mark IV in 1976. In 1979, Cadillac briefly used this approach on the Cadillac Seville partnering with fashion designer Gucci but ended this practice in 1980.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{vehicles}} are manufactured in the United States, from compact cars to full-size luxury vehicles. The American automobile industry itself is probably {{best known for the}} manufacture of large cars, leading to the common public perception of <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> being larger than those from other countries and making the US well known for the production of so-called land yachts.|$|E
50|$|This {{car with}} its 2½-litre 6-cylinder engine and three speed gearbox, the {{correspondent}} said, should {{meet the requirements}} of many who might otherwise buy an <b>American</b> <b>car.</b> Gear changing was as simple as on any <b>American</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{windows were}} {{intended}} to offset the significant blind spots created by the very wide C-pillars that were characteristic of <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> produced at this time. Even narrow opera windows helped rear visibility. In an age of decreasing dimensions and increasingly common use of non-opening rear side windows on 2-door models, the small opera windows helped rear passengers to be somewhat less claustrophobic.|$|E
25|$|In April 1975, the North American Series II got a {{slightly}} revised set of front bumpers which had rubber over-riders covering {{the full length}} of the bumper with embedded turn signals at each end. In 1975 V12 XJS / XJ12L cars and in 1978 the 4.2 6 cyl. XJ6L North <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> got the addition of Bosch-Lucas electronic fuel injection in the place of Zenith-Stromberg carburettors.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, the BBC {{reported}} on a Sun story that Top Gear had been in talks about creating an American version. The current presenters would remain as hosts, but the series would focus on <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> and include American celebrities. Plans for an American version were eventually shelved, partly over Clarkson's misgivings about spending several months in the U.S., away from his family.|$|E

25|$|Aluminum Model Toys, {{known by}} the acronym AMT, was a Troy, Michigan-based company that {{manufactured}} various pre-assembled plastic promotional models starting in 1948, when attorney West Gallogly, Sr. started it as a side business. Later, a variety of kits became very popular. Most of the company's vehicle products were <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> and trucks in 1:25 scale. In the 1970s, hot rods, customs, trucks and movie and TV vehicles were also produced.|$|E
25|$|The Riviera's {{suspension}} used Buick's standard design, {{with double}} wishbones {{up front and}} a live axle located by trailing arms and a lateral track bar in the rear, but the roll centers were raised to reduce body lean. Although its coil springs were actually slightly softer than other Buicks, the Riviera's lighter weight made its ride somewhat firmer. While still biased towards understeer, contemporary testers considered {{it one of the}} most driveable <b>American</b> <b>cars,</b> with an excellent balance of comfort and agility.|$|E
25|$|<b>American</b> <b>cars</b> {{have a low}} market share. Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep {{vehicles}} are sold in Singapore, such as the Chrysler 300C, Chrysler PT Cruiser, Dodge Caliber, and Jeep Wrangler. Chevrolet markets only Korean-made Daewoo cars, but not its American-made models. Ford markets some cars from its European line, not its American product line. Even Subaru, a Japanese car maker, did not do well with cars made by a US-based subsidiary, Subaru of Indiana Automotive, which exported the US-made Tribeca to Singapore.|$|E

50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Car</b> Company was {{a builder}} of {{electric}} powered streetcars. ACC was bought {{out by the}} J. G. Brill Company of Philadelphia in 1902. However, Brill continued to operate the <b>American</b> <b>Car</b> Co. under its own name until 1931, when it was reorganized as J. G. Brill of Missouri.|$|R
25|$|Styling {{tended to}} mimic larger <b>American</b> <b>cars.</b> A {{very small number}} did {{make it to the}} United States. This {{generation}} of Bluebird {{became one of the first}} Japanese cars to be sold in significant numbers in Europe, after Finland fully opened its doors to automobile imports in mid-1962. 700 were brought in, and by the time the 410-series had arrived, Datsun had passed SAAB and Triumph in registrations. Although not very fast, the sturdy Datsun was well-suited to the rugged Finnish roads of the time.|$|E
25|$|Unique in the {{domestic}} automotive industry, AMC offered adjustable front seat backrests from their Nash-origin, and in 1964, the Classic and Ambassador were equipped with standard dual reclining front seats nearly a decade before the Big Three offered them as options. Bendix disc brakes were made standard on the Marlin and optional on other models in 1965. This made the Marlin one the first modern <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> with standard disc brakes, while the Big Three did not offer them until the early 1970s on most of their models to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of foreign churches in Palestine {{in the late}} 19th century increased awareness of prosperity in the West. In Ramallah and Bethlehem, a few miles south, local residents began to seek economic opportunity overseas. In 1901, merchants from Ramallah emigrated to the United States and established import-export businesses, selling handmade rugs and other exotic wares across the Atlantic. Increased trade dramatically improved living standards for Ramallah's inhabitants. <b>American</b> <b>cars,</b> mechanized farming equipment, radios, and later televisions became attainable luxuries for upper-class families. As residents of Jaffa and Lydda moved to Ramallah, the balance of Muslims and Christians began to change.|$|E

25|$|The 1972 Hornet was {{notable for}} {{being one of}} the first <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> to offer a special luxury trim package created by a fashion {{designer}}. Named for Italian fashion designer Dr. Aldo Gucci, the Gucci package was offered only on the Sportabout, the four-door wagon with a single sloping hatch replacing the then traditional window/tailgate door. The option included special beige-colored upholstery fabrics on thickly padded seats and inside door panels (with red and green striping) along with Gucci logo emblems and a choice of four exterior colors: Snow White; Hunter Green; Grasshopper Green, and Yuca Tan. The Gucci model proved to be a success, with 2,583 produced in 1972 (and 2,252 more for 1973) Sportabouts so equipped.|$|E
25|$|The North <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> {{also had}} {{different}} equipment levels (depending on the version: Milano Silver, Milano Gold or Milano Platinum). L/h and r/h electrically adjustable outside mirrors, electrically reclining seats and cruise control were usually optional in Europe. The car was also available with a 3-speed ZF automatic gearbox {{option for the}} 2.5 V6. Other, more common options such as electrically operated rear windows and an A/C system were standard in the USA. The USA-cars also had different upholstery styles and of course different dashboard panels also indicating speed in mph, oil pressure in psi and coolant temperature in degrees F, and as a final touch the AR control was different, including a seat belt warning light.|$|E
25|$|These are {{required}} to produce white light by U.S. and international UN Regulations. However, some countries have at various times permitted amber reversing lights. In Australia and New Zealand, for example, vehicle manufacturers were faced {{with the task of}} localising <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> originally equipped with combination red brake/turn signal lamps and white reversing lights. Those countries' regulations permitted the amber rear turn signals to burn steadily as reversing lights, so automakers and importers were able to combine the (mandatorily amber) rear turn signal and (optionally amber) reversing light function, and so comply with the regulations without the need for additional lighting devices. Both countries presently require white reversing lights, so the combination amber turn/reverse light is no longer permitted on new vehicles. The U.S. state of Washington presently permits reversing lamps to emit white or amber light.|$|E

25|$|The Dinky Toys ranges {{became more}} {{sophisticated}} throughout the 1950s. Some {{cars in the}} sporty pre-war line were carried on after the war like the Alvis sports tourer, the Sunbeam Talbot, or the Frazer-Nash BMW. These offerings then led to a magnificent line-up in the post war Dinky range, which included a Lagonda, an Armstrong-Siddeley, MG, Sunbeam Alpine, Austin Atlantic, Austin Healey 100, Aston Martin DB3S racer, Morris Oxford sedan and Triumph TR2 (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, pp.50–51). Additionally, several models introduced were <b>American</b> <b>cars,</b> and even now still seem unique choices, such as a 1954 Packard convertible, a 1955 Plymouth Belvedere, a Cunningham, the 1953 and 1957 Studebakers (and a 1957 Packard), a Chrysler New Yorker Convertible, a 1957 Rambler, and a late model Hudson Hornet. In many cases, even domestic British / European vehicle choices for models were not everyday selections, e. g. the Connaught racing car, Maserati Sports 2000, AC Aceca, Humber Hawk, 1954 Bristol LeMans car with large fins - and a Daimler instead of the more routine Jaguar.|$|E
25|$|Hence, Ford {{decided to}} {{commence}} local {{production of a}} Holden challenger. Initially, they intended to produce the Zephyr, Consul, and Zodiac, using expensive dies {{they would need to}} purchase from Ford of Britain. However, during a visit to Ford headquarters in Detroit in 1958, they were shown the new Falcon, which was being prepared for its US launch. Immediately, the executives were attracted to the new car- it was about the same size as Holden, but it was low, long, wide and modern. The width allowed it to accommodate six people, and a two-speed automatic transmission was available. Besides all this, Ford Australia felt they had more experience building North <b>American</b> <b>cars.</b> Hence, they decided to make Falcon their new Australian car. In 1959, Ford built a factory at Campbellfield, a suburb of Melbourne, for local production of the North American Ford Falcon. The factory was designed in Canada, and had a roof which would facilitate dispersal of snow – notwithstanding the fact that snow does not usually fall in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 Race of Champions (still {{sponsored}} by Daily Mail) {{saw the first}} of two major victories by <b>American</b> <b>cars</b> at Brands when Dan Gurney brought the Eagle-Weslake T1G over the line first by 0.8 seconds from Lorenzo Bandin's Ferrari 312/67. So good was the public's response to the race (run in two 10-lap heats and a 40-lap final) that John Webb decided to make the race an annual event. The other great American victory was to come when the be-winged 7-litre Chaparral 2F-Chevrolet driven by Phil Hill and Mike Spence won the BOAC 500 run over 211 laps of the Grand Prix Circuit at an average speed of 93.08mph, from the Ferrari 330-P4 of Chris Amon and Jackie Stewart. These two had lapped {{the rest of the field}} twice, third place going to the Jo Siffert/Bruce McLaren Porsche 910. The year saw many firsts; in July, Tetsu Ikuzawa became the first Japanese ever to win a race in Britain, the first Mini Festival was run at Whitsun and the Mini-Seven Club ran the first ever all-saloon car meeting in February. But the biggest ‘first ‘was the arrival of Formula Ford which was to become the providing ground and starting place for so many drivers. The first Formula Ford race was run on 7 July and was won by Roy Allan in a Lotus 51.|$|E
