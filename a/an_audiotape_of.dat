25|$|The Santa Barbara County sheriff {{released}} a videotape showing Jackson's arrest. They also released <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> his {{ride to the}} police station. In it, Jackson complains about the handcuffs and is politely told by an officer how he can relieve the discomfort. He is heard to be whistling, and he asks for the air conditioning to be turned on (it was). Police allege these tapes prove that Jackson's claims are false; Jackson, along with his family, claim that what is being shown is merely a biased portion of what actually occurred. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer ordered an independent investigation into Jackson's complaints. After interviewing 163 witnesses, the complaints were rejected in August 2004.|$|E

40|$|This follows {{an earlier}} study of the same data set, which, through its findings, {{presented}} new questions that are investigated in this study. Both studies used a prospective controlled design, wherein women receiving genetic counseling for breast cancer risk were randomized into two groups. Subjects receiving <b>an</b> <b>audiotaped</b> recording <b>of</b> their genetic consultation (tape group) were compared to subjects who also had a genetic consultation but did not receive <b>an</b> <b>audiotaped</b> recording <b>of</b> it (no-tape group). Participants were drawn from attendees at the genetic clinics of two London hospitals and included 115 women with {{a family history of}} breast cancer. Cancer worry and psychological distress were assessed before genetic consultation (baseline), and at one- and six-month follow-ups by post. Objective risk was estimated by the geneticist during the consultation, and subjective risk was assessed at one month follow-up. The goals of the current study were to investigate relationships between cancer worry, psychological distress, and recall of genetic risk for breast cancer in a sample of women receiving genetic counseling for breast cancer risk, and to investigate the role sociodemographic variables on cancer worry, psychological distress, or risk recall for these women. Results for this sample of women with a family history of breast cancer found that there were consistent relationships between cancer worry, psychological distress, objective risk, and subjective risk before and after genetic consultation. This suggests that women=s psychological responses are appropriate to their level of cancer risk. There were no differences found between the tape and no-tape groups for objective or subjective risk, or for nearness of recall accuracy or degree of under-/over-estimation. Provision <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>audiotaped</b> recording <b>of</b> the genetic consultation did not appear to enhance recall of risk information. The role of sociodemographic variables on the psychological and risk variables assessed in this study was very minor. Age was mildly correlated with cancer worry, and employment was predictive of cancer worry only at baseline...|$|R
