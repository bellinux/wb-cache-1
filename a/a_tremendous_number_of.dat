25|$|Inconsistencies and {{irregularities}} in English pronunciation and spelling have gradually increased in number {{throughout the history}} of the English language. There are a number of contributing factors. First, gradual changes in pronunciation, such as the Great Vowel Shift, account for <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> irregularities. Second, relatively recent loan words from other languages generally carry their original spellings, which are often not phonetic in English. The Romanization of languages (e.g., Chinese) using alphabets derived from the Latin alphabet has further complicated this problem, for example when pronouncing Chinese proper names (of people or places).|$|E

Researchers using antibodies in their work need to record them correctly in order to allow their research to be reproducible (and therefore tested, and qualified by other researchers). Less than half of research antibodies referenced in academic papers can be easily identified. Papers published in F1000 in 2014 and 2015 provide researchers with a guide for reporting research antibody use.

In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a population model for academia, derived from publication records in the Computer Science domain. We use a generalized branching process as an overarching framework, which enables us to describe the evolution and composition of the research community in a systematic manner. Further, the observed patterns allow us {{to shed light on}} researchers' lifecycle encompassing arrival, academic life expectancy, activity, productivity and offspring distribution in the ecosystem. We believe such a study will help develop better bibliometric indices which account for the inflation, and also provide insights into sustainable and efficient resource management for academia...|$|R

The evaluation is based on the perceptions of the customers of five cellphone network providers that operate in South Africa. The paper concludes that though there are many customer retention strategies that are employed in the South African cellphone industry, the most effective are those related to quality of service, affordability of service and provision of customer support services...|$|R

In this thesis, we take an availability-centric view on end-to-end service Quality of Service (QoS) and investigate service availability for large-scale content distribution and replication systems in wide-area internetworks such as the Internet. The main focus is on issues of provid-ing availability guarantees, i. e., delivering target level of service availability with guarantees for all individual users of services running on top of the above systems. Specifically, the thesis aims at the development of concept and framework for technically realizing the availability-centred QoS approach, on the one hand, and of decision strategies for content replication in order to provide availability guarantee for the large-scale Internet-based services, on the other hand. In particular, we tackle the replica selection and placement problem and study the effec-tiveness of realistic replication strategies on the achieved service availability in the Internet...|$|R
40|$|Hydrostatic pressure, {{when applied}} to {{segments}} of the small intestine of the salamander, causes <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> reduction in <b>number</b> <b>of</b> microvilli {{and a loss of}} the terminal web. The intestinal epithelium strips off from its deeper layers {{at the level of the}} basement membrane. When the pressure is released and this epithelial sheet is allowed to recover, the microvilli and its terminal web reappear. Stages in the reformation of microvilli are described. In the earliest stages, foci of dense material seem to associate with the cytoplasmic surface of the apical plasma membrane. From this material, filaments appear and their regrowth is correlated with the extension of the microvilli. We suggest that the dense material nucleates the assembly of the filaments which, in turn, appear instrumental in the redevelopment of microvilli. This concept is supported by the existing literature. Further, since neither the microvilli nor the terminal web reappear on any surface but the apical surface, even though the apical and basal surfaces are bathed with the same medium, we suggest that information in the membrane itself or directly associated with the membrane dictates the distribution of the dense material which leads to the formation of the microvilli and ultimately to the polarity of the cell...|$|R

40|$|Context: Recent trends {{show that}} there is <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> shift from IT {{companies}} following traditional methods by hosting their applications/systems in self-managed on premise data centers to using the so-called cloud data centers. Cloud computing has received immense popularity due to its architecture and the ease of usage. Due to this increase in demand and shift in practices, there has been <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> increase in <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data centers over a period, resulting in increase of energy consumption. In this thesis work, a research is carried out on optimizing the energy consumption of a typical cloud data center. OpenStack cloud computing software is chosen as the platform in this research. We have used live migration as a key aspect in this research. Objectives: In this research, our objectives are as follows: Design an OpenStack testbed to implement the migration of virtual machines. To estimate the energy consumption of the data center. To design a heuristic algorithm to evaluate the performance metrics and to optimize the overall energy consumption. Methods: We have used PowerAPI, a software tool to estimate the energy consumption of hosts as well as virtual machines. A heuristic algorithm is designed and implemented in an instrumental OpenStack testbed to optimize the energy consumption. Server consolidation and load balancing of virtual machines methodologies are used in the heuristic algorithm design. Our research is carried out against the functionality of Nova scheduler of OpenStack. Results: Results section describes the values of performance metrics yielded by carrying out the experiment. The obtained results showed that energy can be optimized significantly by modifying the way OpenStack nova scheduler can work. The experiment is carried out on vanilla OpenStack and OpenStack with the heuristic algorithm in place, In the second case, the nova scheduler algorithms are not used but the heuristic algorithm is used instead. The CPU utilization and CPU load were noticed to be higher than the metrics observed in case of OpenStack with nova scheduler. Energy consumption is observed to be lesser than the consumption in OpenStack design with nova scheduler. Conclusions: The research tells that energy consumption can be optimized significantly using desired algorithms without compromising the service quality it offers. However, the design impacts on CPU slightly as the metrics are observed to be higher when compared to that in case of OpenStack with nova scheduler. Although it won’t have noticeable impact on the system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Since 2001, {{there has}} been <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> {{increase}} in <b>number</b> <b>of</b> households protected by ITN and IRS in Ghana. However, {{there has not been}} evidence of a reduction in malaria cases as expected and reported deaths have rather increased since 2007. As a result, this study was undertaken to get a better understanding of perceptions of malaria, knowledge on mosquitoes and the value attached to ITNs among secondary and tertiary students in Cape Coast. Methods Structured questionnaires were administered randomly to gather data on demographic characteristics of students, knowledge of mosquitoes and ITNs and attitude towards the use of ITN in seven public high schools and four tertiary institutions in Cape Coast metropolis. In addition, curriculums of science courses common to all students from junior high school to the university were carefully examined. Results A total of 492 students took part in this study and more than 90 % of them had high knowledge of malaria transmission and ITN, but little knowledge of mosquito life history. Only 1 % in secondary and 2. 1 % in tertiary institutions had seen or knew about all the development stages of mosquitoes. In high school and tertiary institutions, 24. 2 % and 10. 8 % of respondents, respectively, were able to mention other genera of mosquitoes, apart from Anopheles. Though 93. 9 % in senior high school and 86. 7 % in the tertiary institutions knew that ITNs are either used to protect oneself from mosquito bites or to prevent malaria, 32. 7 % of the respondents in secondary and 21. 9 % in tertiary institutions who owned ITN did not use them. Conclusions The study reveals that respondents did not have adequate knowledge on the biology and behaviour of mosquitoes. This appears to weaken their knowledge of the link between the use of ITN and malaria control; the effect of this is that a significant number owned ITNs but did not use them. The implication is that if people will really accept and use ITN or other mosquito control interventions, then just creating awareness of those interventions is not enough but people should also be educated on the life history of mosquitoes and on the mechanism of the control strategies. This can be effectively done through the formal education system. </p...|$|R
