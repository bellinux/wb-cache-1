40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of two {{commonly}} used <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> strategies on house sales prices. In particular, we compare a dynamic <b>asking</b> <b>price,</b> where the seller adjusts her <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> over time as she fails to sell her property, with a static <b>asking</b> <b>price,</b> where the seller sets an <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> and sticks to it until the property is sold. While we show this comparison to be ambiguous from a theoretical perspective, our empirical study, using a comprehensive dataset of the properties sold in the greater Sydney region in 2011, indicates that properties with a dynamic <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> sold, on average, for approximately 1. 9 per cent less than properties with a static <b>asking</b> <b>price.</b> In addition, we show that, controlling for the <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> strategy, the duration of sale has {{a significant impact on}} sales prices...|$|R

With risk-neutrality, the optimal <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> exceeds the optimal fixed price when the expected gain is a strictly concave function.

5000|$|Most {{firms are}} {{multi-product}} companies {{faced with the}} decision whether to sell products or services separately at individual prices or whether combinations of products should be marketed {{in the form of}} [...] "bundles" [...] for which a [...] "bundle price" [...] is <b>asked.</b> <b>Price</b> bundling plays an increasingly important role in many industries (e.g. banking, insurance, software, automotive) and some companies even build their business strategies on bundling. In a bundle pricing, companies sell a package or set of goods or services for a lower price than they would charge if the customer bought all of them separately. Pursuing a bundle pricing strategy allows you to increase your profit by giving customers a discount.|$|E
50|$|The hire {{purchase}} agreement {{was developed in}} the United Kingdom in the 19th century to allow customers with a cash shortage to make an expensive purchase they otherwise would have to delay or forgo. For example, in cases where a buyer cannot afford to pay the <b>asked</b> <b>price</b> for an item of property as a lump sum but can afford to pay a percentage as a deposit, a hire-purchase contract allows the buyer to hire the goods for a monthly rent. When a sum equal to the original full price plus interest has been paid in equal installments, the buyer may then exercise an option to buy the goods at a predetermined price (usually a nominal sum) or return the goods to the owner.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Price {{was asked}} by Ted Saskin of the NHLPA to {{determine}} {{what should be done}} with the NHLPA's Be A Player hockey product. The product was started in 1994 and was supposed to give to each of the NHLPA licensees for two years. Pinnacle had the license for 1996 and 1997 but they went bankrupt and Be A Player needed a home. Price was hired by the NHLPA as a consultant to determine the fate of Be A Player. He advised Saskin that Upper Deck should be given back the Be A Player brand because of collector loyalty. However, Saskin <b>asked</b> <b>Price</b> if he would come back into the hockey card market and manufacture Be A Player in partnership with the NHLPA.

30|$|Since {{constants}} {{come out}} of the infima of expectations, Madan (2016) shows that one may write the bid price as the expected value under a base probability less the <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> for the negative of the centered or demeaned cash flow. One may then also view the bid price as measuring reward by the expectation under the base probability less a risk measure given by the <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> for the negative of the centered cash flow. Since the centered negative cash flow has a zero mean by construction, and as the base probability is one of the test probabilities, the <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> is always positive and can be minimized subject to attaining a particular expectation. This naturally leads us to a mean <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> frontier and examples of such constructions may be found in Madan (2016). Here we consider the mean <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> frontier for the two-period portfolio problem.|$|R

A contemporary historian noted the [...] "merciless exercise of his authority". Rev.

Bishop Robert Willson, following his third visit to the island in 1852, described the harsh punishment of the convicts. He observed [...] "the state of the yard, from the blood running down men's backs, mingled with the water used in washing them when taken down from the triangle - the degrading scene {{of a large number}} of men … waiting their turn to be tortured, and the more humiliating spectacle presented by those who had undergone the scourging … were painful to listen to".

40|$|We {{conducted}} an {{experimental study of}} price competition in a duopolistic market. The market was operationalized as a repeated game between two “teams” with one, two, or three players in each team.

In case of a tie, the teams split the asking price. For teams with multiple players we manipulated {{the way in which}} the team’s profit was divided between the team members. In one treatment each team member was paid his or her asking price if the team won, and half that if the game was tied, while in the other treatment the team’s profit for winning or tying the game was divided equally among its members. We found that asking (and winning) prices were significantly higher in competition between individuals than in competition between two- or three-person teams.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Electricity swing {{options are}} supply {{contracts}} for power, which give the owner {{the right to}} change the required delivery on short time notice. It gives more flexibility than fixed base load or peak load contracts. The name ”option ” is a bit misleading, since it gives the owner multiple exercise rights at many different time horizons with exercise amounts on a continuous scale. We look at the problem to determine a rational ask price for such a contract {{from the viewpoint of}} the contract seller. The pricing of these contracts differs drastically from the pricing of financial options. First, pecu-liar properties arise from the non-storability of the underlying (the energy) and therefore the impossibility to hedge with the underlying, hedging is only possible with some future contracts. Second, the behavior of the owner plays an important role. Based on some behavioral model for the option holder, we develop a game-theoretic model, which allows to identify the equilibrium price. Besides some theoretical results, we present some numerical results which clarify the dependence of the <b>asked</b> <b>price</b> on the amount of flexibility offered in the swing option...|$|E

This Research examined 22 companies that issued right issue in the Jakarta Stock Exchange during 2000 - 2002. Perception were conducted 5 days before until 5 days after right issue. A multiple regression analysis was used to examine the effect of stock price, trading volume and variant of return on the bid-ask spread.

5000|$|Layering is a {{strategy}} in high-frequency trading where a trader makes and then cancels orders that they never intend to have executed in hopes of influencing the stock price. For instance, to buy stock at a lower price, the trader initially places orders to sell {{at or above the}} market <b>ask</b> <b>price.</b> This may cause the market's best <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> to fall as other market participants lower their <b>asking</b> <b>prices</b> because they perceive selling pressure as they see the sell orders being entered on the order book. The trader may place subsequent sell orders for the security at successively lower prices as the best <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> falls (to increase the appearance of selling interest). After the price has fallen sufficiently, the trader makes a real trade, buying the stock at the now lower best <b>ask</b> <b>price,</b> and cancels all the sell orders.
