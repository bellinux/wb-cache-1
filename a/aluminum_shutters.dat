5000|$|Between 1993 and 2003, over 13% of the machiya in Kyoto were {{demolished}}. Roughly {{forty percent}} of those demolished were replaced with new modern houses, and another 40% were replaced with high-rise apartment buildings, parking lots, or modern-style commercial shops Of those machiya remaining, over 80% have suffered significant losses to the traditional appearance of their facades. Roughly 20% of Kyoto's machiya have been altered in a process called kanban kenchiku (看板建築, lit. [...] "signboard architecture"); they retain the basic shape of a machiya, but their facades have been completely covered over in cement, which replaces the wooden lattices of the first story and mushikomado windows and earthwork walls of the second story. Many of these kanban kenchiku machiya have also lost their tile roofs, becoming more boxed-out in shape; many have also had <b>aluminum</b> or steel <b>shutters</b> installed, as are commonly seen in small urban shops around the world.|$|R
