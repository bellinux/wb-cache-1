A {{recently}} hired editor, Archibald Ogden, liked the book, but two internal reviewers gave conflicting opinions. One said it was a great book that would never sell; the other said it was trash but would sell well. Ogden's boss, Bobbs-Merrill president D.L. Chambers, decided to reject the book. Ogden responded by wiring to the head office, [...] "If this is not the book for you, then I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> editor for you."

500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits. In a 2003 interview with the Independent on Sunday he provided a summary of his playing style: [...] "The ability to battle {{is one of the}} main parts of my game. I know my limits. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> sort who gets the ball and is then going to beat five or six players and stick it in the top corner from God knows where.

500|$|In his {{appearances}} on The Howard Stern Show, he was frequently challenged {{to defend his}} ratings.

Ebert later added The Godfather Part II to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list in October 2008 stating that his original review has often been cited as proof of his [...] "worthlessness" [...] but he still had not changed his mind and would not change a word of his original review. When reviewing the 2009 remake of The Last House on the Left, Ebert noted how he had given the controversial 1972 original three and a half stars and declined to make a comparison between the two versions: [...] "I wrote that original [...] "Last House" [...] review 37 years ago.
