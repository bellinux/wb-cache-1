5|$|Most modern breweries use a {{continuous}} sparge, collecting the original wort and the sparge water together. However, {{it is possible}} to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.|$|E
5|$|White was the {{grandson}} of Virginia pioneer settler and physician Dr.Robert White (1688–1752) <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> member of the prominent White political family of Virginia and West Virginia.

5|$|Canada is a {{multilingual}} {{and multicultural}} society home {{to people of}} many different ethnic, religious and national origins, {{with the majority of}} the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> Canadian identity. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige perhaps {{came from}} Rutland, as {{he owned the}} manor of Tinwell there later in life. The Liber Eliensis claimed {{that he had been}} born by Caesarian section, but this is most likely a later {{accretion}} to his lifestory, added after his death because of efforts to have him declared a saint. The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section was a miracle, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E
5|$|Dom Pedro Afonso (19 July 1848– 10 January 1850) was the Prince Imperial and heir {{apparent}} {{to the throne}} of the Empire of Brazil. Born at the Palace of São Cristóvão in Rio de Janeiro, he was the second son and youngest child of Emperor Dom PedroII and Dona Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza. Pedro Afonso was seen as vital to the future viability of the monarchy, which had been put in jeopardy {{by the death of}} his older brother Dom Afonso almost three years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Domnall mac Murchada (died 1075), {{also known}} as Domnall mac Murchada meic Diarmata, was a leading late eleventh-century {{claimant}} to the Kingdom of Leinster, and a King of Dublin. As a son of Murchad mac Diarmata, King of Dublin and the Isles, Domnall was a grandson of Diarmait mac Máel na mBó, King of Leinster, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> member of the Uí Chennselaig. Domnall {{was also the first}} of the Meic Murchada, a branch of the Uí Chennselaig named after his father.|$|E
5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, {{are known as}} homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or {{are the result of}} divergence of the genes after a speciation event, where they are known as orthologous genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.|$|E
5|$|His {{descendants}} became {{de facto}} {{heads of state}} of the Dutch Republic during the 16th to 18th centuries, which was an effectively hereditary role. For {{the last half century}} of its existence, it became an officially hereditary role <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> monarchy (though maintaining republican pretense) under Prince William IV. His son, Prince William V, was the last stadtholder of the republic, whose own son, King William I, became the first king of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was established on 16 March 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. With the independence of Belgium on 21 July 1831, the Netherlands formally became the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The current monarch is Willem-Alexander.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{if such a}} {{strategy}} of financing development from outside the home country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems. For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse {{the resources of the}} underdeveloped country. This would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure. Apart from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People would try to imitate Western consumption habits <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> balance of payments crisis may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.|$|E
5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. They view the Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, {{but they do not}} consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New Testament) (Hebrews 8: 7-13). They believe that the New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (<b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector. This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption of electricity <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> decrease in the need for the oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a decrease in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E

Due to the town's prevalence as an industrial centre <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> hub for employment, Oldham attracted migrant workers throughout its history, including those from wider-England, Scotland, Ireland and Poland.|$|E

5|$|The BTO {{analysis}} {{was able to}} determine {{the distance between the}} satellite and aircraft with a relatively high degree of accuracy, while the BFO {{analysis was}} able to estimate the heading and speed of the aircraft, but is sensitive to small changes in input data. To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E

5|$|The dodos on this islet may not {{necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand.|$|E
