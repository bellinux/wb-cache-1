5|$|During the 1790s, {{politicians}} and land speculators in Georgia perpetrated fraudulent and corrupt land sales {{in an area}} that is now a large portion of Alabama and Mississippi. When the fraud was exposed in 1795, there was significant public outcry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> legislation authorizing the sales was repealed. This led to a host of claims and litigation, since in a number of cases, land was afterward resold to unsuspecting third parties. President Jefferson eventually established a three-person commission to resolve conflicting claims arising from the fraud. Lincoln was appointed to this commission, which developed legislation to resolve the issue. Eventually approved by Congress, Georgia's claims to the area were extinguished and some land was reserved to resolve other outstanding claims. The commission was also responsible for documenting and reporting on {{the nature and extent of}} the fraud, activities in which Lincoln was heavily involved.|$|E
