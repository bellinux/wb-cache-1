40|$|Abstract. The Denclue {{algorithm}} {{employs a}} cluster model based on kernel density estimation. A cluster {{is defined by}} a local maximum of the estimated density function. Data points are assigned to clusters by hill climbing, i. e. points going to the same local maximum are put into the same cluster. A disadvantage of Denclue 1. 0 is, that the used hill climbing may make unnecessary small steps in the beginning and never converges exactly to the maximum, it just comes close. We introduce a new hill climbing procedure for Gaussian kernels, which adjusts the step size automatically <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>extra</b> <b>costs.</b> We prove that the procedure converges exactly towards a local maximum by reducing it to a special case of the expectation maximization algorithm. We show experimentally that the new procedure needs much less iterations and can be accelerated by sampling based methods with sacrificing {{only a small amount}} of accuracy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Secure multi-party {{computation}} (MPC) {{allows a}} set of n players to securely compute an agreed function, even when up to t players are {{under the control of}} an adversary. Known perfectly secure MPC proto-cols require communication of at least Ω(n 3) field elements per multipli-cation, whereas cryptographic or unconditional security is possible with communication linear in the number of players. We present a perfectly secure MPC protocol communicating O(n) field elements per multiplica-tion. Our protocol provides perfect security against an active, adaptive adversary corrupting t < n/ 3 players, which is optimal. Thus our proto-col improves the security of the most efficient information-theoretically secure protocol <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>extra</b> <b>costs,</b> respectively improves the efficiency of perfectly secure MPC protocols by a factor of Ω(n 2). To achieve this, we introduce a novel technique – constructing detectable protocols with the help of so-called hyper-invertible matrices, which we believe to be of independent interest. Hyper-invertible matrices allow (among other things) to perform efficient correctness checks of many instances in par-allel, which was until now possible only if error-probability was allowed.
