40|$|In {{this paper}} we motivate and {{describe}} a logic-based specification framework for objects and interfaces based on Abstract Data Views, a formal model for specifying interfaces. Abstract Data Views (ADVs) are Abstract Data Objects (<b>ADOs)</b> or objects {{that have been}} specifically augmented to support the specification of interfaces: interfaces between application components (<b>ADOs)</b> or between application components and an "external" environment such as a user or a network. The central mathematical tools {{used for this purpose}} are temporal logic (or deontic action logic) and some tools from category theory (institutions). Essentially, temporal logic is used to represent the individual ADVs or <b>ADOs</b> and the tools from category theory are used to represent the amalgamation of these components into a structure. Both ADVs and <b>ADOs</b> will basically be represented by tuples !

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by David S. Cohen, and {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. Joe Mantegna guest stars in the episode as Fat Tony. The title of the episode is a parody of William Shakespeare's play Much <b>Ado</b> About Nothing. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 8.2, and was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|Tracy and Hepburn reunited {{on screen}} {{for the first}} time in five years for the office-based comedy Desk Set (1957).

That summer, Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice in Much <b>Ado</b> About Nothing.

Her first film role was in the 1989 romantic comedy The Tall Guy, and in the early 1990s, she frequently collaborated with her then husband, actor and director Kenneth Branagh.

5|$|Feyenoord opened September with a 4–0 home win on {{the first}} day of the month against Roda JC. Four {{different}} Feyenoord players scored in the game; Vormer and Pellè in the first half and Nelom and Goossens after half time. The club announced halfway through the month they had signed Otman Bakkal without transfer fee. Bakkal had played for Feyenoord in the 2011–12 season as well before joining Russian club Dynamo Moscow for the 2012–13 season. On 15 September Feyenoord played the second game of the month in Nijmegen against N.E.C., the game ended in a 3-all draw after a last-minute equalizer by Bruno Martins Indi. The club got their third win in four league matches on 22 September at home due to the lone goal in the 35th minute from Tonny Vilhena against FC Utrecht. After a bye in the first round, Feyenoord started the 2013–14 KNVB Cup on the 26th at home against FC Dordrecht in the second round. They won the game 3–0; Pellè put the first goal on the board after 36 minutes, Schaken and Armenteros added a goal each to the scoreline in the second half. Feyenoord won the last match of September 4–2 at home against <b>ADO</b> Den Haag. They got up by four goals 18 minutes into the second half after a hattrick by Pellè and first half goal by Martins Indi; <b>ADO</b> got two goals on the board in the last ten minutes. From the five games in September, four league games and one cup game, Feyenoord drew one and won the other four.|$|E

5|$|Gielgud {{continued}} to try, without much success, {{to find new}} plays that suited him as an actor, but his direction of Peter Shaffer's first play, Five Finger Exercise (1958), received acclaim. While in the US for the Shaffer play, Gielgud revived Much <b>Ado</b> About Nothing, this time with Margaret Leighton as his Beatrice. Most of the New York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan's The Browning Version for CBS and N C Hunter's A Day by the Sea for ITV. He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television {{over the next four}} decades.|$|E

He later attended Ilesa Grammar School, where he obtained a Grade I certificate with distinction in 1970 and Higher School Certificate (HSC) in 1972.

5000|$|Perhaps, {{the most}} elegant proof of the first result above uses <b>Ado's</b> theorem, which says any finite-dimensional Lie algebra (over a field of any characteristic) is a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra [...] of square matrices. The proof goes as follows: by <b>Ado's</b> theorem, we assume [...] is a Lie subalgebra. Let G be the {{subgroup}} of [...] generated by [...] and let [...] be a simply connected covering of G; {{it is not hard}} to show that [...] is a Lie group and that the covering map is a Lie group homomorphism.

5|$|Subsequent names, {{rather than}} {{continuing}} the airy spirits theme (only Puck and Mab continued the trend), {{have focused on}} Herschel's source material. In 1949, the fifth moon, Miranda, was named by its discoverer Gerard Kuiper after a thoroughly mortal character in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The current IAU practice is to name moons after characters from Shakespeare's plays and The Rape of the Lock (although at present only Ariel, Umbriel, and Belinda have names drawn from the latter; all the rest are from Shakespeare). At first, the outermost moons were all named after characters from one play, The Tempest; but with Margaret being named from Much <b>Ado</b> About Nothing that trend has ended.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ADO</b> {{is seeking}} to expand the number of Indigenous Australians it {{recruits}} and improve their retention rate. Restrictions on Indigenous Australians' ability to enlist in the military existed until the 1970s, though hundreds of Indigenous men and women had joined the military when restrictions were reduced during the world wars. By 1992 the representation of Indigenous Australians in the ADF was equivalent to their proportion of the Australian population, though {{they continue to be}} under-represented among the officer corps. Two of the Army's three Regional Force Surveillance Units (NORFORCE and the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment) are manned mostly by Indigenous Australian reservists. In 2015 Indigenous Australians made up around 1.5% of ADF personnel, which is smaller than the Indigenous share of the total Australian population.|$|E
