40|$|Technical Specifications (TS) {{requirements}} for {{nuclear power plants}} define the Limiting Conditions for Operations (LCOs) and Surveillance Requirements (SRs) to assure safety during operation. In general, these requirements are based on deterministic analyses and engineering judgments. Improvements in these requirements are facilitated by the availability of plant-specific Probabilistic Risk Assessments (PRAs). The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) Office of Research sponsored research to develop systematic, risk-based methods to improve various aspects of TS requirements. A handbook of methods summarizing such risk-based approaches has been completed in 1994. It is expected that this handbook will provide valuable input to NRC`s present work in developing guidance for using PRA in risk-informed regulation.

40|$|Testing and {{maintenance}} activities of safety equipment have drawn much attention in Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) to risk and cost control. The testing {{and maintenance}} activities are often implemented {{in compliance with}} the technical specification and maintenance requirements. Technical specification and maintenance-related parameters, that is, <b>allowed</b> <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> (AOT), maintenance period and duration, and so forth, in NPP are associated with controlling risk level and operating cost which need to be minimized. The above problems can be formulated by a constrained multiobjective optimization model, which is widely used in many other engineering problems. Particle swarm optimizations (PSOs) have proved their capability to solve these kinds of problems. In this paper, we adopt PSO as an optimizer to optimize the multiobjective optimization problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Numerical results have demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Changes to Technical Specifications (TSs) at {{nuclear power}} plants (NPPs) require review and {{approval}} by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC). Currently, many requests for changes to TSs use analyses {{that are based on}} a plant`s probabilistic safety assessment (PSA). This report presents an approach to reviewing such PSA-based submittals for changes to TSs. We discuss the basic objectives of reviewing a PSA-based submittal to modify NPP TSs; the methodology of reviewing a TS submittal, and the differing roles of a PSA review, a PSA Computer Code review, and a review of a TS submittal. To illustrate this approach, we discuss our review of changes to <b>allowed</b> <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> (AOT) and surveillance test interval (STI) in the TS for the South Texas Project Nuclear Generating Station. Based on this experience gained, a check-list of items is given for future reviewers; {{it can be used to}} verify that the submittal contains sufficient information, and also that the review has addressed the relevant issues. Finally, recommended steps in the review process and the expected findings of each step are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In this work, Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) {{is used to}} {{evaluate}} <b>Allowed</b> <b>Outage</b> <b>Times</b> (AOT) and Surveillance Test Intervals (STI) extensions for three Angra 1 nuclear power plant safety systems. The interest in such an analysis lies {{on the fact that}} PSA comprises a risk-based tool for safety evaluation and has been increasingly applied to support both the regulatory and the operational decision-making processes. Regarding Angra 1, among other applications, PSA is meant to be an additional method that can be used by the utility to justify Technical Specification relaxation to the Brazilian regulatory body. The risk measure used in this work is the Core Damage Frequency, obtained from the Angra 1 Level 1 PSA study. AOT and STI extensions are evaluated for the Safety Injection, Service Water and Auxiliary Feedwater Systems using the SAPHIRE code. In order to compensate for the risk increase caused by the extensions, compensatory measures as (1) test of redundant train prior to entering maintenance and (2) staggered test strategy are proposed. Results have shown that the proposed AOT extensions are acceptable for two of the systems with the implementation of compensatory measures whereas STI extensions are acceptable for all three systems...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the design}} {{certification}} process, probabilistic safety assessments (PSAS) are performed {{at the design stage}} for each advanced nuclear power plant. Among other usages, these PSAs are important inputs in defining the Technical Specifications (TSs) for these plants. Knowledge gained from their use in improving the TSs for operating nuclear power plants is providing methods and insights for using PSAs at this early stage. Evaluating the safety or the risk significance of the TSs to be defined for an advanced plant encompasses diverse aspects: (a) determining the basic limiting condition for operation (LCO); (b) structuring conditions associated with the LCO; (c) defining completion <b>times</b> (equivalent to <b>allowed</b> <b>outage</b> <b>times</b> in the TS for conventional plants); and, (d) prescribing required actions to be taken within the specified completion times. In this paper, we consider the use of PSA in defining the TSs for an advanced nuclear plant, namely General Electric`s Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR). Similar approaches are being taken for ABB-CE`s System 80 + and Westinghouse`s AP- 600. We discuss the general features of an advanced reactor`s TS, how PSA is being used in reviewing the TSs, and we give an example where the TS submittal was reviewed using a PSA-based analysis to arrive at the requirements for the plant...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{noticeable}} and long distribution outages around Finland {{have been caused by}} severe weather conditions. The outages have changed the public opinion and a more reliable electricity distribution is demanded. Lastly the Ministry of Employment and the Economy (TEM) has composed a new, more demanding law concerning of the electricity market, which came into the effect at 1. 9. 2013. The new law reduced <b>allowed</b> <b>outage</b> <b>times</b> caused by weather conditions to six hours in an urban area and to 36 hours in rural area. The new requirements have to be fulfilled at the latest in 2028 and during that time it is estimated that 3, 5 billion euros have to be used for the network investments. This thesis work is done for Elenia Oyj, which {{has been in the past}} years one of the foregoing in the branch of business. It is said that Elenia has taken the contractor partnership network management to the new level in the branch of business. Elenia has also introduced a brand that is focused for underground cabling, called as “weather proof”, a framework that has begun as early as 2009. These heavily increased investment levels are a driver for the more sophisticated management methods for material purchasing. The objective of this thesis is to research and implement the key aspects of the modern material purchasing methods and practices based on the literature review and group studies. During the research process it came clear that special attention is needed for four different purchasing management areas: material portfolio analysis, supplier selection, supplier performance evaluation and demand forecasting. These aspects were selected because of the detected potential of efficiency improvement. In the thesis all these four different aspects are presented in own chapters. The main results of the thesis are the introduction of Kraljic portfolio matrix, AHP supplier selection method, supplier scorecard and an improved tool for the demand forecasting...|$|R

The proposed {{changes to the}} Technical Specifications (TS) contained herein would revise TS 3. 8. 1, "Electrical Power Systems AC Sources- Operating, " such that, with one emergency diesel generator (EDG) set inoperable, the allowed completion time in Action B is extended from 10 days to 13 days, provided that the other conditions of the statement are met. These TS changes will be in effect for Units I & 2 during December of 2003, for the IC EDG only. SNC is performing the 24 month preventative maintenance (PM) on EDG IC which includes the 20 year PM task of replacing the cylinder liners. This EDG outage was started on November 30, 2003. Emergent problems have been encountered that could force the maintenance schedule to exceed 10 days. The proposed license amendments are needed to avoid a potential shutdown in accordance with TS 3. 8. 1, which would require FNP Units I and 2 {{to be placed in}} Mode 3 within 6 hours after the 10 day <b>allowed</b> <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> has expired and Mode 5 within the following 36 hours.

40|$|The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) steady {{progress}} towards risk-informed performance-based regulation (RIPBR) prompted the practical {{application of this}} regulatory tool in order to demonstrate its potential benefits. This practical demonstration makes up one part of an Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) sponsored project entitled Integrated Models, Data Bases and Practices Needed for Performance-Based Safety Regulation. Project members selected the emergency diesel generator system {{as a candidate for}} assessment because of its high risk importance for core damage frequency (CDF) as well as for its failure to exhibit fulfillment of its current maintenance objectives. An analysis of current NRC maintenance and inspection requirements of the emergency diesel generators at the Millstone 3 nuclear power plant was performed by the project members. Maintenance and inspection items identified as unnecessary or harmful to the EDG qualified as candidates for removal from the current surveillance schedule. Expert testimony and comparisons with similar non-nuclear utility industries aided in the identification of candidate items. Calculations of the subsequent risk, reliability, safety, and economic implications revealed several benefits of the inspection alterations. The modified inspection provided improved backup power availability and defense in depth during the refueling outage. A sensitivity analysis performed on the EDG basic events affected by inspection alteration showed that a 50 % reduction in these basic event failure rates would decrease the EDG system failure probability by 13. 9 %. The altered inspection also shortens the plant's refueling outage critical path therefore decreasing the risk of fuel damage and improving the risk profile of the plant outage. Transfer of the revised inspection to performance while the plant is operating at power resulted in identical refueling outage benefits. Performance of the inspection at power requires an increase in the <b>allowed</b> <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> (AOT) of the plant. The subsequent rise in core damage frequency due to the increased AOT is considered negligible. INEEL University Research ConsortiumUnited States.
