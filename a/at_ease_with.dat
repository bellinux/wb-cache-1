5|$|Even {{in terms}} of fan base, the two fan bases are close in a way. Although the general public has held a {{stereotype}} of heavy metal fans being suicidal, depressed and a danger to themselves and society in general. However, Adrian North, a Heriot-Watt University professor who studies genre listeners found that metal listeners were above all else creative, <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> themselves and introverted — qualities he also found in classical listeners.|$|E

Mark, who has set aside his rock band youth (now {{confined}} to memorabilia displayed in the one room {{of the house that}} Vanessa has designated for Mark's personal belongings), works at home composing commercial jingles. Juno and Leah happen to see Vanessa in a shopping mall being completely <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> a child, and Juno encourages Vanessa to talk to her baby in the womb, where it kicks for her.|$|E
5|$|Mandela's 90th {{birthday}} was marked {{across the country}} on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at Qunu, and a concert in his honour in Hyde Park, London. In a speech marking the event, Mandela called for the rich {{to help the poor}} across the world. Throughout Mbeki's presidency, Mandela continued to support the ANC, usually overshadowing Mbeki at any public events that the two attended. Mandela was more <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> Mbeki's successor, Zuma, although the Nelson Mandela Foundation was upset when his grandson, Mandla Mandela, flew him out to the Eastern Cape to attend a pro-Zuma rally {{in the midst of a}} storm in 2009.|$|E

5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived at}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, devoted {{exclusively}} {{to the music of}} Russian composers. One included the first complete performance of his revised First Symphony; another featured the final version of Third Symphony of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, with whose circle Tchaikovsky was already in touch. Rimsky-Korsakov, with Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically minded composers and musicians, had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle, named after a merchant and amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher. Tchaikovsky spent much time in this circle, becoming far more <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> them than he had been with the 'Five' and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs. This relationship lasted until Tchaikovsky's death.|$|E
5|$|The True Directions {{kids are}} {{encouraged}} to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann), who take the campers to a local gay bar where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all picket Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting homophobic abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 Burnet was {{involved}} in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that {{he would be able to}} make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.|$|E

5|$|On October 28, Persis Khambatta {{was hired}} to portray Ilia. She had been {{required}} to wear a bald cap for her screen test, although {{at this point the}} character also wore elaborate headgear in some footage. Roddenberry was insistent on this as a character attribute, but others such as Eisner hated the idea of a bald female character. His notes said that while a bald female character would be an interesting addition, it may prevent the audience from feeling <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> Ilia and so the style may need to be given to a different character entirely. The auditions by this time were not held under the pretence that they were to play a part in a television series, but were openly talking about Star Trek becoming a feature film. The casting for Willard Decker had been delayed, both because of a slight delay in the production but also because the writers were no longer sure that the character was needed at all. This was despite auditions being conducted {{at the same time that}} Gautreaux was cast as Xon, during which, in his second audition with Barrett, he also read lines against ten actors competing for the role of Decker.|$|E

25|$|Douglass Houghton {{was born}} in Troy, New York, the son of Jacob Houghton, a lawyer and later a county judge, and Mary Lydia (Douglass). Raised in a close-knit, cultured home in Fredonia, New York, Douglass was a small person with a nervous, active {{temperament}} inclined toward the practical and scientific. He exhibited early his lifelong interest in the natural world. In spite of a slight speech impediment and facial scarring from a youthful experiment with gunpowder, he was <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> all levels of society.|$|E

Confronting issues and using Woodall and Constantine as confidantes, is aimed to help the couple release insecurities and burdens, and ultimately become more <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> each other.|$|E
25|$|In 2007–08, England toured Sri Lanka and New Zealand, {{losing the}} first series 1–0 {{and winning the}} second 2–1. They {{followed}} up at home in May 2008 with a 2–0 home series win against New Zealand, these results easing the pressure on Moores, who was not <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> his team, particularly star batsman Kevin Pietersen, who succeeded Vaughan as captain in June 2008, after England had been well beaten by South Africa at home. The poor relationship between Moores and Pietersen {{came to a head}} in India on the 2008–09 tour. England lost the series 1–0 and both men resigned their positions, although Pietersen remained a member of the England team. Moores was replaced as coach by Zimbabwean Andy Flower. Against this background, England toured the West Indies under the captaincy of Andrew Strauss and, in a disappointing performance, lost the Test series 1–0.|$|E
25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation. Most of the veterans report that they do not feel <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, {{and some of them are}} having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E
