5|$|Staff at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., {{reported}} {{that some of}} the animals in the park appeared to show behavior suggesting that they anticipated the earthquake from seconds to minutes before it was felt in the area. The earthquake was felt at the great ape exhibits during afternoon feeding time. About three to ten seconds before the quake, many of the apes abandoned their food and {{climbed to the top of}} a tree-like structure in the exhibit. The red ruffed lemurs sounded an alarm call about 15 minutes before the quake, and the flock of 64 flamingos rushed about and grouped themselves together just before the quake. During the quake, some animals vocalized, some ran or dove for cover, and some stood up <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the walls of their enclosures. Some of the animals remained agitated for the rest of the day, while others calmed quickly. The Zoo's giant pandas did not appear to respond to the quake.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, {{after the}} two {{unfamiliar}} armies had exchanged messages <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{each other for a}} few days, da Gama formed his troops into an infantry square and marched against the Imam's lines, repelling successive waves of Muslim attacks with musket and cannon. This battle ended when Imam Ahmad was wounded in the leg by a chance shot; seeing his banners signal retreat, the Portuguese and their Abyssinian allies fell upon the disorganized Muslims, who suffered losses but managed to reform next to the river on the distant side.|$|E
25|$|Bill Hamilton was {{a solitary}} man who saw {{everything}} {{through the lens}} of Darwin's theory of evolution. When he wanted to know why some ants and humans give up their life for others, he went to Waterloo station <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> humans for hours, looking for patterns. In 1963, he realised that most of the behaviours of humans were due to genes, and he began looking at humans from the genes' point of view. Humans were machines that were only important for carrying genes, and it made sense for a gene to sacrifice a human if it meant that another copy of the gene elsewhere could prosper.|$|E

500|$|My Bloody Valentine are {{regarded}} as the pioneers of the alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing, a term coined by Sounds journalists in the late 1980s to describe certain bands' [...] "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the floor". The band's releases on Creation Records influenced other shoegazing acts, including Slowdive, Ride and Lush, and {{are regarded}} as providing a platform to allow the bands to become recognised. Following the release of Loveless (1991), My Bloody Valentine were [...] "poised for a popular breakthrough", although never achieved mainstream success. However, the band are noted to have been [...] "profoundly influential {{in the direction of}} '90s alternative rock", according to AllMusic. [...] In 2017, a study of AllMusic's database indicated My Bloody Valentine as its 26th most frequently cited influence on other artists.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the music}} on Ecstasy has been criticised as being [...] "directionless and floundered about within the {{framework}} of songs which appeared to be only half formed ideas," [...] which was due to the band's in-studio experimentation with different aspects of their guitar sound. In hindsight, Shields said that [...] "even when we'd finished it we didn't like half the songs we'd done. The record never came out right and it made us realise that we were still too twee". In response to the band's [...] "unwanted reputation for jangly feyness", My Bloody Valentine later incorporated elements of American indie rock music and Shields customised his guitars' tremolo systems, resulting in the band pioneering an alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing. The term [...] "shoegazing", which was considered derogatory, was coined by Sounds journalists in the early 1990s to describe certain bands' [...] "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the floor".|$|E
2500|$|A popular legend {{dating back}} to the 1960s, it has been claimed that several people took LSD <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the sun, going blind as a result. [...] This myth {{appeared}} in 1967 on the cop show Dragnet, and twice in the mainstream news media. [...] The legend is considered to be unfounded, since in 1968 the source of the hoax, Norman M. Yoder, commissioner of the Office of the Blind in the Pennsylvania State Welfare Department, admitted that he had completely made up the story because of his [...] "concern over illegal LSD use by children." [...] After the sun-gazing on LSD story was widely publicized, a small number of case reports were published in the medical literature which describe this phenomenon temporarily occurring. In one case, the patient was a teenage girl described as having a [...] "hysterical personality" [...] who heard warnings about staring at the sun under LSD in a school anti-drug lecture and thought this [...] "would be a neat thing," [...] and in another case the patient had paranoid schizophrenia.|$|E

2500|$|In a documentary, Jay-Z {{revealed}} being {{inspired by}} a segment of Jackson's tour in which she stood in silence <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the crowd for several minutes to massive applause; imitating the technique during his own concerts. Beyoncé has also been reported to emulate a similar tactic during several live shows. JoJo praised the tour, tweeting [...] "Janet Jackson Velvet Rope Tour DVD. Freaking out. Mesmerized. Living. Can't stop yelling at the tv screen. Omg." [...] JoJo later recorded the album Agápē while The Velvet Rope Tour played on a studio television for inspiration. Canadian singer Anjulie became [...] "obsessed with music" [...] and [...] "developed [...] through watching" [...] the tour, recalling [...] "I remember seeing The Velvet Rope Tour and then getting the VHS of that, putting it on slow motion so that I could learn every single dance move." [...] British artist Rowdy Superstar commended Jackson's performance of [...] "If" [...] and [...] "stayed up the whole night learning all the choreography from the Velvet Rope Tour." [...] BBC Asian Network presenter DJ Kayper called Jackson [...] "hands down, the best female performer of all time", praising the tour's rendition of [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] in which Jackson dances with nunchucks.|$|E
2500|$|Late in the {{day they}} heard , the Big Giant, approaching. [...] His {{footsteps}} shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water was gone from the lake. Then he saw {{the reflection of the}} twins in the water, and stood <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> them. [...] he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, [...] Then [...] paced back and forth and said, [...] "What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?" [...] The twins shouted back, [...] "What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? [...] And how shall we kill it?" [...] , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called [...] "Akóóh! Beware! Jump!" [...] and suddenly the twins found themselves standing {{on the end of a}} rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. [...] , the Wind, whispered [...] "Keep low now!" [...] and [...] hurled his great blue knife. [...] It passed over them. [...] The Wind said, [...] "Jump to the right!" [...] and the great yellow knife of [...] passed just to their left. [...] "This is his last weapon," [...] whispered the Wind. [...] "Jump to the left. Now!" [...] The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them." [...] The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck [...] the Giant on the side of the head. [...] The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. [...] Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at [...] [...] The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. [...] The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest. [...] He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands. [...] Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. [...] fell face down on the ground. [...] Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, [...] "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!" [...] The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.|$|E
2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will ask all of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E
