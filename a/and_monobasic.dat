40|$|AbstractThe {{classical}} conversion site in precursors {{of regulatory}} peptides is {{a sequence of}} two basic amino acids. During recent years, however, a group of monobasic cleavage sites has emerged. In certain cell systems {{it has been shown}} that the monobasic cleavage mechanism is both a specific mechanism which only attacks a particular basic residue, and a distinct mechanism which can be separated from the dibasic cleaving mechanism within the same cell. The vast majority of monobasic cleavages occur at single arginines although cleavage after a lysine residue has also been demonstrated. There is no ‘consensus sequence’ of amino acids surrounding the single basic residue which is the apparent signal for proteolytic processing. However, in approximately one third of the cases, a proline residue is found either just before or just after the basic residue. On the basis of this ‘proline-directed arginyl cleavage’ it is discussed how the conformation of the peptide backbone might be important for this type of cleavage. Finally, it is suggested that tissue-specific expression of different processing enzymes, e. g. dibasic <b>and</b> <b>monobasic</b> specific forms, might explain the tissue-specific processing of precursors like the pro-opiomelanocortin and the CKK. and somatostatin precursor...|$|E

In this study, cleavage specificity of PTP for paired basic <b>and</b> <b>monobasic</b> residues was examined {{with a series}} of model peptide-MCA (-methylcoumarinamide) substrates. Monobasic peptides were cleaved at the COOH- and NH 2 -terminal sides of the single basic residue. Dibasic peptides, however, were preferentially cleaved at the NH 2 -terminal side of the pair, or between the two basic residues, with low cleavage at the COOH-terminal side of the pair. Inhibition by the peptide inhibitor (d-Tyr) -Glu-Phe-Lys-Arg-CH 2 Cl provided further evidence for ptp's specificity for the dibasic Lys-Arg site. Inhibition by Z-Leu-Val-Gly-CHN 2; and Z-Arg-Leu-Val-Gly-CHN 2; suggests involvement of Val-Gly in substrate binding to PTP; these two cystatin C-related inhibitors also indicate PTP as a cysteine protease. These results demonstrate PTP's unique cleavage specificity that differs from other processing endopeptidases, including the subtilisin-related proprotein convertases, PC 1 /PC 3, and PC 2, as well as the pituitary proopiomelanocortin-converting enzyme, PCE.

In {{addition to the}} most common form, somatostatin- 14, {{there is also a}} fourteen amino acid N-terminally extended form of the tetradecapeptide, somatostatin- 28. Both peptides are synthesized as larger precursors containing paired basic <b>and</b> <b>monobasic</b> amino acids at their processing sites, which upon cleavage generate either somatostatin- 14 or - 28, respectively. In some species of fish two distinct, but homologous, precursors (prosomatostatin-I and -II) give rise to somatostatin- 14 and - 28, respectively. Whereas anglerfish prosomatostatin-II was previously shown to release exclusively somatostatin- 28, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteolytically matures the homologous prosomatostatin-I precursor to somatostatin- 28 and - 14 as well as to a lysine-extended form of somatostatin- 14. The Kex 2 endoprotease appears to be essential for the formation of lysine somatostatin- 14 and is involved either directly or indirectly in the release of mature somatostatin- 14. The isolation of yeast mutants defective in somatostatin- 28 expression (sex mutant) allowed the cloning of a non-essential gene, which encodes an aspartyl protease, whose disruption severely affects the cleavage of mature somatostatin- 28 from both somatostatin precursors.

40|$|Multistep {{proteolytic}} {{mechanisms are}} essential for converting proprotein precursors into active peptide neurotransmitters and hormones. Cysteine proteases have been implicated in the processing of proenkephalin and other neuropeptide precursors. Although the papain family of cysteine proteases has been considered the primary proteases of the lysosomal degradation pathway, more recent studies indicate that functions of these enzymes are linked to specific biological processes. However, few protein substrates have been described for members of this family. We show here that secretory vesicle cathepsin L is the responsible cysteine protease of chromaffin granules for converting proenkephalin to the active enkephalin peptide neurotransmitter. The cysteine protease activity was identified as cathepsin L by affinity labeling with an activity-based probe for cysteine proteases followed by mass spectrometry for peptide sequencing. Production of [Met]enkephalin by cathepsin L occurred by proteolytic processing at dibasic <b>and</b> <b>monobasic</b> prohormone-processing sites. Cellular studies showed the colocalization of cathepsin L with [Met]enkephalin in secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine chromaffin cells by immunofluorescent confocal and immunoelectron microscopy.

Finally, in cathepsin L gene knockout mice, [Met]enkephalin levels in brain were reduced significantly; this occurred {{with an increase in}} the relative amounts of enkephalin precursor.

The Dyn A processing enzyme exhibits a pi of about 5. 8 and a molecular mass of about 65 kDa under reducing conditions. The Dyn A processing enzyme is a metalloprotease and has a neutral pH optimum.

It is interesting that this substitution results in efficient cleavage by furin. the site of cleavage, as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, is N-terminal to the Arg at the P 1 position for the dynorphin converting enzyme and C-terminal to the Arg at the P 1 position for furin and prohormone convertase 1. Peptides with additional basic residues at the P 2 and at P 4 positions also serve as substrates for the dynorphin converting enzyme, This enzyme cleaves shorter peptide substrates with significantly lower efficiency as compared with the longer peptide substrates, suggesting that the dynorphin converting enzyme prefers longer peptides that contain monobasic processing sites as substrates, Taken together, these results suggest that the cleavage specificity of the dynorphin converting enzyme is distinct but related to the cleavage specificity of the prohormone convertases and that multiple enzymes could be involved in the processing of peptide hormones and neuropeptides at monobasic and dibasic sites.

40|$|Abstract: Seeding is a {{versatile}} method for optimizing crystal growth. Coupling this technique with capillary counter diffusion crystallization enhances {{the size and}} diffraction quality of the crystals. In this article, crystals for organic solvent-tolerant recombinant elastase strain K were successfully produced through microseeding with capillary counter-diffusion crystallization. This technique improved the nucleation success rate with a low protein concentration (3. 00 mg/mL). The crystal was grown in 1 M ammonium phosphate <b>monobasic</b> <b>and</b> 0. 1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate pH 5. 6. The optimized crystal size was 1 × 0. 1 × 0. 05 mm 3. Elastase strain K successfully diffracted up to 1. 39 Å a...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of Pharohylaeus from Papua New Guinea {{and that of}} the female of the genus are reported. Phurohylaeus papuunus, a new species, is described. The bee genus Pharohylaeus Michener is <b>monobasic</b> <b>and</b> its type species, M roglossa kzctifera Cockerell, 1910, an Australian species, has been known by the male only. Thus, it has been known that Pharohylaez~ ~ is a rare and poorly known genus of bees since Michener erected this genus in 1965. This paper reports the {{discovery of}} Pharohylaeus from Papua New Guinea, discovery of the female of the genus and describes a new species, Phurohylaeus papzuznus, based on two female specimens in the National Forest Insect Collection...|$|R
40|$|A HPLC method using reversed-phase {{chromatography}} {{coupled with}} a coulometric electrochemical detector (ECD) was developed for the determination of morphine in human plasma. Hydromorphone was selected as an internal standard. The compounds were extracted using solid-phase extraction with C 18 cartridges and separated on a reversed-phase C 18 column with the mobile phase consisting of 69 % v/v phosphate buffer pH 2. 2 (5 mM sodium phosphate <b>monobasic</b> <b>and</b> 0. 7 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate) and 31 % v/v acetonitrile. The working electrode of the ECD was set at + 450 mV for analytical purposes. Under this condition, the limit of detection for morphine was 0. 33 ng/mL, whereas the limit of quantitation was 1. 88 ng/mL. The percen...|$|R
