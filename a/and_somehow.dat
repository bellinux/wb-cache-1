5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus and {{the three}} prisoners in his group posing as Lithuanians– Tim Walenn, Henri Picard and Gordon Brettell– managed to reach a train heading towards Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland). Most likely, they {{intended}} to travel to East Prussia, cross the Lithuanian border, <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> cross the Baltic Sea to neutral Sweden. However, officials at the Stalag had discovered the escape and began manhunts. Marcinkus and his group travelled further {{than most of the}} escapees, but were captured by the Gestapo near Schneidemühl on 26 March. Marcinkus and his associates were brought to Stalag XXB and spent the night there. On the following day they were handed over to the Danzig Gestapo.|$|E
60|$|Her {{concern was}} so genuine <b>and</b> yet <b>somehow</b> so {{innocent}} that Evelyn's heart softened.|$|R
2500|$|Cruz has joked, [...] "I'm Cuban, Irish, and Italian, <b>and</b> yet <b>somehow</b> I {{ended up}} Southern Baptist." ...|$|R
60|$|Wrayson bowed <b>and</b> waited. <b>Somehow</b> he {{felt that}} he was {{on the eve of a}} great discovery.|$|R
5|$|The Chester Canal was an English canal {{linking the}} south Cheshire town of Nantwich with the River Dee at Chester. It was {{intended}} to link Chester to Middlewich, with a branch to Nantwich, but the Trent and Mersey Canal were unco-operative about a junction at Middlewich, and so the route to Nantwich was opened in 1779. There were also difficulties negotiating with the River Dee Company, and with no possibility of through traffic, the canal was uneconomic. Part of it was closed in 1787, when Beeston staircase locks collapsed, {{and there was no}} money to fund repairs. When the Ellesmere Canal was proposed in 1790, the company saw it as a ray of hope, <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> managed to keep the struggling canal open. The Ellesmere Canal provided a link to the River Mersey at Ellesmere Port from 1797, and the fortunes of the Chester Canal began to improve.|$|E
25|$|Word of the altercation spread <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> {{escalated}} into rumours {{the employee}} {{had killed the}} customer. As a result, a large crowd gathered at the hotel and ransacked the restaurant. Shortly after, they moved to nearby Chinatown to wreak havoc there.|$|E
25|$|The first {{monolith}} {{appears at}} the beginning of the story, set in prehistoric times. It is discovered by a group of hominids <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> triggers a considerable shift in evolution, starting with the ability to use tools and weaponry.|$|E
60|$|My {{life has}} {{had its share of}} adventures, <b>and</b> yet, <b>somehow,</b> this ride stands out above the others.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 A {{person who}} has been mortally wounded or is terminally ill <b>and</b> has <b>somehow</b> communicated their wish to die.|$|R
60|$|A sort of laugh {{more like}} a groan than a laugh; <b>and</b> yet, <b>somehow,</b> it seemed {{intended}} for a laugh.|$|R
25|$|Creativity is a {{phenomenon}} whereby something new <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an idea, a scientific theory, a musical composition, or a joke) or a physical object (such as an invention, a literary work, or a painting).|$|E
25|$|Robots {{that are}} {{intended}} to play with children usually look like animals and depending on what animal they are, they make different sounds, move, walk and play. Robot-dogs for example may bark, move their tails <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> run or play with a child.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 2004 Hazes died {{of cardiac}} arrest. Eventually his {{lifestyle}} had {{caught up with}} him, <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> he became bigger in death {{than he had ever}} been during his lifetime. Everybody identified with him, and in the months after his death André Hazes became public domain.|$|E
60|$|He {{remembered her}} and she saw that he did, <b>and</b> this <b>somehow</b> {{promoted}} an illogical sense of acquaintance with him.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the true}} {{state of the}} case flashed upon me. Langour fled. I leaped up, <b>and</b> {{scrambled}} <b>somehow</b> into the saddle.|$|R
60|$|Jean le Roi {{struck the}} table with his fist, not violently, <b>and</b> yet <b>somehow</b> with a force which made itself felt.|$|R
25|$|Ninoy {{was getting}} {{impatient}} in Boston, he felt isolated by {{the flow of}} events in the Philippines. In early 1983, Marcos was seriously ailing, the Philippine economy was just as rapidly declining, and insurgency was becoming a serious problem. Ninoy thought that by coming home {{he might be able to}} persuade Marcos to restore democracy <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> revitalize the Liberal Party.|$|E
25|$|To make it, I prayed by the hour. It was automatic, almost subconscious. I {{did not ask}} God to take me out of it. I prayed {{he would}} give me {{strength}} to endure it. When it would get so bad that I did not think I could stand it, I would ask God to ease it <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> I would make it. He kept me.|$|E
25|$|Ninoy {{was getting}} {{impatient}} in Boston, he felt isolated by {{the flow of}} events in the Philippines. In early 1983, Marcos was seriously ailing, the Philippine economy was just as rapidly declining, and insurgency was becoming a serious problem. Ninoy thought that by coming home {{he might be able to}} persuade Marcos to restore democracy <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> revitalize the Liberal Party. and called him: The greatest president we never had.|$|E
60|$|She looked indignant, {{compressing}} {{her delicate}} little nostrils, <b>and</b> yet, <b>somehow,</b> Clarence {{had the same}} singular impression that she was only acting.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> yet <b>somehow</b> Harry Pallant couldn't make up {{his mind}} at once to break open the tiny {{envelope}} of that mysterious, incomprehensible letter.|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. Nor I. It {{seems so}} strange; <b>and</b> yet, <b>somehow,</b> it doesn't. (Confidently.) You see, {{it could have}} been no one else.|$|R
25|$|The two {{surviving}} crewmen, Thomsen and Fitzsimmons, gave {{evidence that}} the capsize was so swift that nothing more {{could have been done}} to avert the tragedy. Both were of the firm opinion that the shifting of the blue metal load was responsible for the listing of the vessel, <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> for its final demise. They were unanimous in their praise for the efforts of Captain Bell to save the vessel, and for his example and leadership during and after its foundering.|$|E
25|$|Cankar was a {{relatively}} fragile personality, both emotionally and physically, but showed an unusually strong and persistent intellectual vigour. He was a sharp thinker, who was able of poignant criticism of both his environment and himself. He was also full of paradoxes and loved irony and sarcasm. He was an unusually sentimental <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> ecstatic nature, intensely sensitive to ethical issues. He was very introspective: his works, which are {{to a large extent}} autobiographic, became famous for the ruthless analysis of his own deeds and misdeeds.|$|E
25|$|The twelfth-century work Acallam na Senórach {{tells of}} Patrick being met by two ancient warriors, Caílte mac Rónáin and Oisín, during his evangelical travels. The two were once members of Fionn mac Cumhaill's warrior band the Fianna, <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> survived to Patrick's time. In the work St. Patrick seeks {{to convert the}} warriors to Christianity, while they defend their pagan past. The heroic pagan {{lifestyle}} of the warriors, of fighting and feasting and living close to nature, is contrasted with the more peaceful, but unheroic and non-sensual life offered by Christianity.|$|E
6000|$|... "One always thinks that, Godfrey, <b>and</b> yet, <b>somehow,</b> {{one never}} can. Free will is a fraud {{in that sense}} as in every other." ...|$|R
60|$|They plunged {{forward in}} the mud, <b>and</b> managed <b>somehow</b> to run their yoke on the pole of an {{ammunition}} wagon, where it jammed.|$|R
5000|$|Can Sam <b>and</b> Mac <b>somehow</b> {{join forces}} {{or is it}} nearly {{impossible}} for either of them to look past their differences, especially their race? ...|$|R
25|$|The Omega Stone, {{the sequel}} to Riddle of the Sphinx, climaxes at an Atlantean pyramid at Santorini, {{and goes on to}} state that there were two Atlantis cities, one at Santorini, and the other at Bimini. The cataclysm caused by a comet {{fragment}} (the titular 'Omega Stone') impacting Atlanti-Santorini caused a malfunction in the laser beam constructed to destroy the comet fragment, <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> led to the sinking of both cities (precisely how is not made clear). Furthermore, it states that the ancient Egyptians, the Maya, the Easter Islanders, the Cretans and the builders of Stonehenge were all different Atlantean tribes.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, stimulated Raman {{scattering}} {{can take place}} when some Stokes photons have previously been generated by spontaneous Raman scattering (<b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> forced {{to remain in the}} material), or when deliberately injecting Stokes photons ("signal light") together with the original light ("pump light"). In that case, the total Raman-scattering rate is increased beyond that of spontaneous Raman scattering: pump photons are converted more rapidly into additional Stokes photons. The more Stokes photons are already present, the faster more of them are added. Effectively, this amplifies the Stokes light {{in the presence of the}} pump light, which is exploited in Raman amplifiers and Raman lasers.|$|E
25|$|All {{physical}} boxing {{proposals are}} naturally dependent on {{our understanding of}} the laws of physics; if a superintelligence could infer <b>and</b> <b>somehow</b> exploit additional physical laws that we are currently unaware of, {{there is no way to}} conceive of a foolproof plan to contain it. More broadly, unlike with conventional computer security, attempting to box a superintelligent AI would be intrinsically risky as there could be no sure knowledge that the boxing plan will work. Scientific progress on boxing would be fundamentally difficult because there would be no way to test boxing hypotheses against a dangerous superintelligence until such an entity exists, by which point the consequences of a test failure would be catastrophic.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you give}} me a lump of sugar?" [...] he asked in a sharp, hard little voice--a voice {{immature}} <b>and</b> yet, <b>somehow,</b> not young.|$|R
60|$|DEARTH (almost sharply). Don't {{talk like}} that, dear. It is wicked and stupid, <b>and</b> naughty. <b>Somehow</b> that poor woman--I won't paint any more to-night.|$|R
60|$|Ralph resented {{hearing the}} Governor called bald <b>and</b> fat. <b>Somehow</b> {{it seemed as}} if his hero were being reduced to the level of common clay.|$|R
