5|$|<b>An</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> British staff {{officers}} of the initial period of the Normandy campaign found that 7% of all German tanks destroyed by British forces were knocked out by PIATs, compared to 6% by rockets fired by aircraft. However, {{they also found that}} once German tanks had been fitted with armoured skirts that detonated hollow-charge ammunition before it could penetrate the tank's armour, the weapon became much less effective.|$|E

5|$|In November 2012, {{after a week}} of {{conflict}} between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on November 21. UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. According to <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> the New York Times, men ages 20–29, {{who are most likely to}} be militants, are most overrepresented in the death toll.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} Nigersaurus were {{initially}} described in 1976 {{as belonging to}} a dicraeosaurid, but in 1999 Sereno's team reclassified it as a rebbachisaurid diplodocoid. Rebbachisauridae is the basalmost family within the superfamily Diplodocoidea, which also contains the long-necked diplodocids and the short-necked dicraeosaurids. The subfamily Nigersaurinae, which includes Nigersaurus and closely related genera, was named by John A. Whitlock in 2011. Below is a cladogram following <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> Federico Fanti and colleagues (2013), which confirmed the placement of Nigersaurus as a basal nigersaurine rebbachisaurid.|$|E

5|$|According to <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> Tim Flannery, the {{ecosystem}} of Lord Howe Island {{is threatened by}} climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk {{to the effects of}} global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|According to the U.S. Department of Energy, {{combined}} sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric {{cars in the}} American market climbed more rapidly and outsold by more than double sales of hybrid-electric vehicles over their respective 24 month introductory periods. A 2016 analysis by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) found that 5 years after its introduction, sales of plug-in electric cars in the U.S. continued to outsell conventional hybrids. <b>An</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> Scientific American found a similar trend {{at the international level}} when considering the global top selling PEVs over a 36-month introductory period. Monthly sales of the Volt, Prius PHV and Leaf performed better than the conventional Prius during their respective introductory periods, {{with the exception of the}} Mitsubishi i-MiEV, which has been outsold most of the time by the Prius HEV over their 36-month introductory periods.|$|E
5|$|Liu {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a separate phylogenetic analysis in 2017. They criticized {{the analysis of}} Rieppel and colleagues as having unnecessarily repeated several characters in their data, thus imbuing the repeated characters with undue weight in the analysis. In their own analysis, Liu and colleagues used the same source datasets, but deleted repeated characters, added two new characters from <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> Sean Modesto and Hans-Dieter Sues (2004), and removed poorly preserved or potentially chimeric taxa such as Cosesaurus, Kadimakara, Trachelosaurus, and Malerisaurus. Analyses based on parsimony-based and Bayesian methods found that Dinocephalosaurus {{was a member of}} the Tanystropheidae, being the sister group to a clade containing Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos. The analyses also recovered a monophyletic Protorosauria, albeit to the exclusion of Prolacerta. The tree from the parsimony-based analysis is reproduced above, at right.|$|E

5|$|Phantasmagoria {{finished}} 1995 as {{the ninth}} best-selling {{game of the}} year according to <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> PC Data of sales by 42 retail chains. In January 1996, Phantasmagoria was the fourth-best seller among MS-DOS and Windows games, behind Microsoft Flight Simulator, Myst and Command & Conquer, and it was number six among all computer software. By February 10 it was number five among MS-DOS and Windows games, and by February 24 it was number 10. It received a boost in June 1996, possibly due to the pending release of its sequel , and jumped back up to seventh among best-selling computer software programs according to Computer Life magazine. One year after Phantasmagoria was released, it still remained in the best-seller charts, and more than 1 million copies were ultimately sold, making it Sierra's first game to reach that milestone.|$|E
5|$|Reger's Hebbel Requiem {{is in one}} movement. It {{follows the}} overall form of the narrated poem, but with variations, {{resulting}} in a structure of different moods. The beginning is recalled {{in the middle and}} at the end. The following table is based on the score and on <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> Katherine FitzGibbon. The translation of the incipits is given as in the liner notes of the 2009 recording in the translation by Richard Stokes. The four-part SATB chorus is often divided. The work is in D minor and common time. The tempo marking is Molto sostenuto, and is sustained with only slight modifications (stringendo and ritardando) until the most dramatic section, marked Più mosso (faster) and later Allegro, returning to the initial tempo for the conclusion.|$|E
