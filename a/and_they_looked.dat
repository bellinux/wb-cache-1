5|$|After Mission San Fernando Rey de España was {{established}} in 1797, the administrators there realized they would need more land for agriculture and livestock, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> north to the Santa Clarita Valley to establish their estancia, or mission rancho. Subsequently, the Tataviam who had been living there were relocated to the Mission, where they were baptized and put to work. The Estancia de San Francisco Xavier was built in 1804 at the confluence of Castaic Creek and the Santa Clara River.|$|E
5|$|The three leading clans of Quraysh at {{that time}} were Banu Hashim, Banu Abd ad-Dar and Banu Makhzum, the latter clan being {{responsible}} for the matters of warfare. As {{a member of the}} Makhzum clan, who were amongst the best horsemen in Arabia, Khalid learned to ride and use such weapons as the spear, the lance, the bow and the sword. The lance was said to be his favorite among the weapons. In youth he was admired as a renowned warrior and wrestler among the Quraysh. Khalid was a cousin of Umar, the future second Caliph, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> very similar.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} 1827–40, Mary Shelley was busy {{as an editor}} and writer. She wrote the novels The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck (1830), Lodore (1835), and Falkner (1837). She contributed five volumes of Lives of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French authors to Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia. She also wrote stories for ladies' magazines. She was still helping to support her father, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> out for {{publishers}} for each other. In 1830, she sold the copyright for a new edition of Frankenstein for £60 to Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley for their new Standard Novels series. After her father's death in 1836 {{at the age of}} eighty, she began assembling his letters and a memoir for publication, as he had requested in his will; but after two years of work, she abandoned the project. Throughout this period, she also championed Percy Shelley's poetry, promoting its publication and quoting it in her writing. By 1837, Percy's works were well-known and increasingly admired. In the summer of 1838 Edward Moxon, the publisher of Tennyson and the son-in-law of Charles Lamb, proposed publishing a collected works of Percy Shelley. Mary was paid £500 to edit the Poetical Works (1838), which Sir Timothy insisted should not include a biography. Mary found a way {{to tell the story of}} Percy's life, nonetheless: she included extensive biographical notes about the poems.|$|E

25|$|Gloucestershire {{stayed in}} Northampton for the Twenty20 game, and lost again. Two home wins followed, though, over Glamorgan and Worcestershire, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> very solid after their initial setback - after two no-results {{and yet another}} win over Worcestershire had ensured that they had grabbed eight points from six games. However, their bowling let them down {{in the last two}} games, first {{allowing}} whipping boys Glamorgan to take a thumping ten-wicket victory at Cardiff, and then handing Somerset the highest team score in Twenty20 Cup history, with 228 for 5 - which sent Somerset through and Gloucestershire out.|$|E
25|$|The {{border between}} the two states became a major irritant, and in November 1997 a border {{committee}} {{was set up to}} try to resolve that specific dispute. After federation and before independence the line of the border had been of minor importance because it was only a demarcation line between federated provinces and initially the two governments tacitly agreed that the border should remain as it had been immediately before independence. However, on independence the border became an international frontier, and the two governments could not agree on the line that the border should take along its entire length, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> back to the colonial period treaties between Italy and Ethiopia for a basis in international law for the precise line of the frontier between the states. Problems then arose because they could not agree on the interpretation of those agreements and treaties, and it was not clear under international law how binding colonial treaties were on the two states.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, the Browns {{selected}} University of Miami quarterback Bernie Kosar in the supplemental draft. As a rookie, Kosar {{learned through}} trial by fire {{as he took}} over for Gary Danielson midway through the 1985 season. Progressing a bit more each Sunday, the young quarterback helped turn the struggling season around, as the Browns won four of the ten games Kosar started. Two young rushers, Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack, played a large part in the team's success, as well; each ran for 1,000+ yards. The Browns' 8–8 record gave the team the top spot in a weak AFC Central, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> poised to shock the heavily favored Miami Dolphins in the divisional playoff game with a 21–3 lead at halftime. It took Dan Marino's spirited second-half comeback {{to win the game}} for Miami 24–21. While the Browns' faithful may have felt the initial sting of disappointment, there was tremendous upside in the loss: Schottenheimer's team, with Kosar at quarterback, reached the playoffs each of the next five seasons, advancing to the AFC championship game in three of those years.|$|E

Nevertheless, the Spice Girls managed to impress them. They played a few of their tracks, but neither Watkins nor Wilson particularly like them, except for a song the group wrote with Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe, called [...] "Feed Your Love", which the duo thought was [...] "dark and cool". A songwriting session was booked within the next days.|$|E

In Lennon's last published interview, he said: [...] "This image of me being an orphan is garbage, because I was well protected by my auntie and uncle [...] <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> after me very well, thanks".|$|E

2500|$|Initially the Beaulieus {{stayed at}} the Helene Hotel when they arrived in Germany, but after three months, living there became too {{expensive}} <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> {{for a place to}} rent.

Soon after moving in, the Beaulieus realized that it was a brothel, but due to scarce housing, they were forced to remain there.|$|E
2500|$|With {{only half}} a point {{separating}} the two teams, {{it was not surprising}} that Kenya declared on 300 for 6, as soon as they had secured maximum first innings batting points, and with 8 potential balls left before their 90 overs were up. Namibia instead chose to bat on to take a first innings lead at 335 for 9 declared, with Burger making 87 and Snyman 75. By {{the end of the second}} day, Kenya were 112 for 2 in reply - scoring useful points as the game looked to be heading for a draw. By the time they declared on 282 for 9, with Suji top-scoring on 72, they had set a theoretical target of 248, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> as though they would sneak it on points. By the time they had reduced Namibia to 68 for 5, they had secured their semi-final qualification.|$|E

2500|$|The Monthly {{was never}} resurrected, and the Harvard Advocate became Harvard's only {{literary}} publication, possibly subsuming {{the sort of}} material which had differentiated it from its sister-journal, {{which may have been}} due to a tradition of being different. Monthly alumnus Malcolm Cowley offered the following insight in his biography of E.E. Cummings: [...] "There were two such magazines at Harvard in those days , The Monthly and The Advocate, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> down on each other—-or, to be accurate, they nodded to each other coldly from the facing doors of their respective sanctums on the dusty third floor of the Harvard Union. The Monthlies thought that the board of The Advocate, which then appeared fortnightly, was composed of journalists, clubmen, athletes, and disciples of Teddy Roosevelt, a former editor, with not a man of letters among them. The Advocates suspected that the Monthlies were aesthetes (as indeed most of them came to be called), scruffy poets, socialists, pacifists, or worse. It was for The Monthly that Cummings chose to write." ...|$|E
2500|$|Milly dies {{following}} the premature {{birth of her}} baby (who also dies) and Barton is plunged into sadness at the loss. Barton's parishioners, who were so unsympathetic to him as their minister, support {{him and his family}} in their grief: [...] "There were men and women standing in that churchyard who had bandied vulgar jests about their pastor, and who had lightly charged him with sin, but now, when they saw him {{following the}} coffin, pale and haggard, he was consecrated anew by his great sorrow, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at him with respectful pity". Just as Barton is beginning {{to come to terms with}} Milly's death, he gets more bad news: the vicar, Mr. Carpe, will be taking over at Shepperton church. Barton is given six-months notice to leave. He has no choice but to comply, but is disheartened, having at last won the sympathies of the parishioners. Barton believes that the request was unfair, knowing that the vicar's brother-in-law is in search of a new parish in which to work. However, he resigns himself to the move and at length obtains a living in a distant manufacturing town.|$|E
2500|$|That {{dispersion}} of power, though seen by many, then and later, {{as a major}} weakness of the Republic, was actually the foundation stone of De Witt's political system, that he called de Ware Vrijheid (the [...] "True Freedom"). We have already seen that De Witt primarily defended Oldenbarnevelt's and Grotius' claim to supremacy of (Holland's) provincial sovereignty over {{the sovereignty of the}} Generality under this moniker. But the doctrine went further. [...] "True Freedom" [...] implied the rejection of an [...] "eminent head", not only of the federal state (where it would have conflicted with provincial sovereignty), but also of the provincial political system. De Witt considered Princes and Potentates as such, as detrimental to the public good, because of their inherent tendency to waste tax payer's money on military adventures in search of glory and useless territorial aggrandizement. As the province of Holland only abutted friendly territory, the Holland regents had no territorial designs themselves, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> askance at such designs by the other provinces, because they knew they were likely to have to foot the bill anyway. The Republic therefore from time to time threw its weight around in the German principalities to the East, but always to protect strategic interests, not for territorial gain. Likewise, after the dispute over the Overmaas territory (which still had been left over from the Munster treaty) was settled with the partition treaty of 1661 with Spain, there were no further territorial claims in the Southern Netherlands, till after the War of Spanish Succession fundamentally changed the strategic situation.|$|E
