5|$|After seeing {{success with}} the mouse using lizard DNA, Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing {{procedure}} and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test Connors' serum at a Veterans Administration hospital {{under the guise of}} <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> shot. In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha {{is on his way to}} the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him. By the time he gets to the Williamsburg Bridge, Connors has become a violent hybrid of lizard and man, tossing cars, including Ratha's, over the side. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, snatches each falling car with his web-lines.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Thomas {{developed}} {{an interest in}} archaeology, entomology, and ornithology, as well as drawing. In 1913 his family made plans for him to join the Royal Navy, although he failed the entrance exam due to alleged poor eyesight. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, Lethbridge was sent to Wellington College in Berkshire, while his mother and siblings moved to Buckhurst in Wokingham, Berkshire. In February 1919 Violet and her children moved to Manor House in Finchampstead, where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill as a result of <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> pandemic; the former survived but Bill died in March.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, formal {{schooling}} had again become {{a feature of}} the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.|$|E

One in five were lethal to mice at low doses. The virus that most closely matched H5N1 for virulence was one with the hemagglutinin (HA), the neuraminidase (NA) and the PB1 avian flu virus RNA molecules with their genes combined with the remaining five RNA molecules (PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS) with their genes from the human flu virus. Both the viruses from the 1957 pandemic and 1968 pandemic carried <b>an</b> avian <b>flu</b> virus PB1 gene. The authors suggest that picking up <b>an</b> avian <b>flu</b> virus PB1 gene may be a critical step in <b>a</b> potential <b>flu</b> pandemic virus arising through reassortment." ...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] This {{fact sheet}} tells {{how to set}} up an {{infection}} control program that will make workplaces safer during <b>a</b> pandemic <b>flu.</b> <b>A</b> pandemic <b>flu</b> will have <b>a</b> huge impact on workers in the United States. During the worst part of <b>a</b> pandemic <b>flu,</b> 40 % to 60 % of workers may have to stay home. Some workers are more likely to get sick, like health care workers and those who respond to an emergency. Workers who have a lot of close contact with the public are also in danger. Whenever workers are at risk of getting the virus, employers must take steps to prevent it from spreading. This is called infection control...|$|R
5|$|Within {{the party}} was {{established}} a Political Bureau ("Politburo") and Organisation Bureau ("Orgburo") to accompany the existing Central Committee; the decisions of these party bodies had to be adopted by Sovnarkom and the Council of Labour and Defence. Lenin was the most significant figure in this governance structure; {{as well as being}} the Chairman of Sovnarkom and sitting on the Council of Labour and Defence, he was on the Central Committee and Politburo of the Communist Party. The only individual to have anywhere near this influence was Lenin's right-hand man, Yakov Sverdlov, who died in March 1919 during <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> pandemic. In November 1917, Lenin and his wife took a two-room flat within the Smolny Institute; the following month they left for a brief holiday in Halia, Finland. In January 1918, he survived an assassination attempt in Petrograd; Fritz Platten, who was with Lenin at the time, shielded him and was injured by a bullet.|$|E
25|$|The main ways {{available}} to tackle <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> pandemic initially are behavioural. Doing so requires a good public health communication strategy {{and the ability}} to track public concerns, attitudes and behaviour. For example, the Flu TElephone Survey Template (FluTEST) was developed for the UK Department of Health as a set of questions for use in national surveys during <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> pandemic.|$|E

25|$|The annual Ring Ball, {{organized}} by the Clemson Undergraduate Student Government and Student Alumni Council, is a nighttime celebration on the Carillon Gardens for graduating seniors as they receive their Clemson rings. The tradition began in the 1930s but was canceled in 1936 due to <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> epidemic. The tradition was reestablished on April 26, 2013.|$|E
25|$|Some {{variants}} {{are identified}} and named {{according to the}} isolate they resemble, thus are presumed to share lineage (example Fujian flu virus-like); according to their typical host (example human flu virus); according to their subtype (example H3N2); and according to their deadliness (example LP, low pathogenic). So <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> from a virus similar to the isolate A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) is called Fujian flu, human flu, and H3N2 flu.|$|E

25|$|Another key {{recommendation}} of the report was to encourage clinicians to promote the flu vaccine to all pregnant women, with flu {{one of the leading}} causes of preventable death in pregnancy (1 in 11 of the women who died). It was reported that less than half of pregnant women eligible for a free flu vaccine had taken it up. The MBRRACE-UK report notes that of the maternal deaths caused by Flu, more than half could have been prevented had the woman received <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> jab.|$|E
25|$|In {{the school}} year of 1913-14, SVA was not in {{operation}} due to extreme financial difficulties. In 1918 the school was hit by <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> epidemic that disabled the school and even took one life. From 1916 to 1921 the school was struggling to survive, but was able to continue {{under the leadership of}} H. M. Forshee, Principal, and the help of Elder R. D. Hottel who was the pastor of the New Market Seventh-day Adventist Church at the time. Hottel besought funds and foodstuffs for the, at that time needy, school.|$|E
25|$|There is no highly {{effective}} treatment for H5N1 flu, but oseltamivir (commercially marketed by Roche as Tamiflu), can sometimes inhibit the influenza virus from spreading inside the user's body. This drug {{has become a}} focus for some governments and organizations trying {{to prepare for a}} possible H5N1 pandemic. On April 20, 2006, Roche AG announced that a stockpile of three million treatment courses of Tamiflu are waiting at the disposal of the World Health Organization to be used in case of <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> pandemic; separately Roche donated two million courses to the WHO for use in developing nations that may be affected by such a pandemic but lack the ability to purchase large quantities of the drug.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1980s, The Victoria General Hospital, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, {{introduced}} paramedic triage in its Emergency Department.

In 1997, following the amalgamation {{of two of the}} city's largest hospitals, the Emergency Department at the Victoria General closed. The paramedic triage system was moved to the city's only remaining adult emergency department, located at the New Halifax Infirmary. In 2006, a triage protocol on whom to exclude from treatment during <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> pandemic was written by a team of critical-care doctors {{at the behest of the}} Ontario government.|$|E
25|$|On July 5, 2009, Kidd {{verbally}} {{committed to}} re-signing with the Mavericks after being pursued heavily by the New York Knicks. The three-year deal reportedly was {{worth more than}} $25 million, all of it fully guaranteed. In {{the first year of}} Kidd's new contract in the 2009–10 season the Mavericks finished second in the Western Conference with a 55-27 record during the regular season. However, the season ended with another disappointment as the Mavericks lost in six games to the San Antonio Spurs {{in the first round of}} the 2010 NBA Playoffs. It was rumored that Kidd had gone through <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> just before the series began which might have affected his physical conditions. He did not speak to reporters after Games 5 and 6 and skipped the team's final meeting.|$|E
25|$|Since November 2009, 14 deaths as {{a result}} of swine flu in Northern Ireland have been reported. The {{majority}} of the victims were reported to have pre-existing health conditions which had lowered their immunity. This closely corresponds to the 19 patients who had died in the year prior due to swine flu, where 18 of the 19 were determined to have lowered immune systems. Because of this, many mothers who have just given birth are strongly encouraged to get <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> shot because their immune systems are vulnerable. Also, studies have shown that people between the ages of 15 and 44 have the highest rate of infection. Although most people now recover, having any conditions that lower one's immune system increases the risk of having the flu become potentially lethal. In Northern Ireland now, approximately 56% of all people under 65 who are entitled to the vaccine have gotten the shot, and the outbreak is said to be under control.|$|E

40|$|We {{performed}} virus isolation {{tests for}} respiratory viruses on combined nasal wash-throat swab specimens collected from {{infants and children}} with acute respiratory illnesses presenting to a hospital clinic during a 3 -month period of concurrent epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza <b>A</b> virus (<b>Flu</b> <b>A)</b> infections. Virus isolation results {{were used to assess}} the utility of commercially available rapid diagnostic kits for these two viruses. The kits employed direct immunofluorescence (IF) of cells (Imagen for RSV and <b>Flu</b> <b>A),</b> indirect IF of cells (Baxter Bartels Microscan), and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Becton Dickinson Directigen for RSV and <b>Flu</b> <b>A</b> and Abbott TestPack for RSV). All testing was completed on 81 specimens from 80 subjects. Of the 81 specimens, 53 (65 %) yielded a virus: RSV, 28 %; <b>Flu</b> <b>A,</b> 25 %; rhinovirus, 6 %; and enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and adenovirus, 2 to 4 % each. Among the tests, Bartels Microscan and Directigen Flu-A exhibited the highest sensitivities (87 and 75 %) and efficiencies (94 and 94 %) for RSV and <b>Flu</b> <b>A,</b> respectively. All the tests exhibited high specificity. Thus, optimal detection of RSV and <b>Flu</b> <b>A</b> among infants and children who presented to a hospital clinic required two different detection methods (IF and enzyme immunoassay) and kits from two different companies (Baxter [Bartels Microscan] and Becton Dickinson [Directigen]) ...|$|R
25|$|Madigan {{stated the}} {{impeachment}} committee would consider the pending criminal charges {{as well as}} review other possible wrongdoing during Blagojevich's term such as abuse of power, taking action without legal authority, ignoring state laws, and defying lawful requests for information from the General Assembly. Currie further stated that among the controversial actions under review by the committee would be the Blagojevich administration's purchase of <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> vaccine that was never distributed and his unilateral decision to send a $1 million grant {{to a private school}} that was damaged when the historic Pilgrim Baptist Church was destroyed by fire. She also warned that the panel's interest in investigating alleged criminal activities surrounding Blagojevich might be affected by how much cooperation was forthcoming from federal investigators, which was supported by a formal written request to Prosecutor Fitzgerald. On December 30, Fitzgerald filed a motion to allow the impeachment committee to hear the conversations recorded by wiretap during his federal investigation.|$|E
25|$|Manchester United's team {{selection}} {{was dominated by}} the need to save several players for the Champions League final against Bayern Munich four days later. Midfielders Roy Keane and Paul Scholes were suspended for the Champions League final, so they were paired in central midfield for the FA Cup final as the swansong for their season; their deputy for the Champions League final, Nicky Butt, was left out of the matchday squad entirely to guard him against injury. Top scorer Dwight Yorke was dropped to the bench for a similar reason, while first-choice centre-back Jaap Stam was named among the substitutes to {{give him a chance to}} prove his fitness after an Achilles tendon injury. Denis Irwin missed the match due to suspension after being sent off against Liverpool in the Premier League on 5 May and was replaced in the starting line-up by Phil Neville. Several players, including Scholes, David Beckham and Gary Neville, were suffering from <b>a</b> <b>flu</b> virus in the lead-up to the game, and were still suffering the effects on matchday, but were all deemed fit enough to play. Henning Berg was injured.|$|E
