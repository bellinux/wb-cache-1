5|$|<b>Aurora</b> {{debuted in}} Sleeping Beauty (1959) as the newborn only {{daughter}} of King Stefan and Queen Leah. Angered by not receiving {{an invitation to}} her christening, the princess is cursed by an evil fairy named Maleficent, who dooms her to die when she pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. However, one of three good fairies named Merryweather alters the curse so that <b>Aurora</b> will instead sleep until she is awoken by a kiss from her true love. Merryweather and the two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, take extra precautions by raising the princess in a secluded cottage under the alias Briar Rose {{to protect her from}} Maleficent until her birthday arrives. Several years later, a 16-year-old <b>Aurora</b> meets a handsome man in the forest. Unaware that he is actually a prince named Phillip, to whom she has been betrothed since infancy, the two fall in love and agree to meet again. However, the fairies finally reveal Aurora's true identity to her and thus forbid her from seeing him because they plan on returning the heartbroken princess to her parents. While alone at their castle, <b>Aurora</b> is hypnotized by Maleficent, who causes her to prick her finger and fulfill Merryweather's prophecy. She was then placed in the highest tower to sleep peacefully until the spell was broken. Meanwhile, Maleficent has captured Phillip, who the fairies release upon realizing that he is in fact the same man <b>Aurora</b> met in the forest earlier that day. Helping him defeat Maleficent, <b>Aurora</b> is successfully awoken by Phillip's kiss, and finally reunited with her parents.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aurora</b> went {{straight}} into reserve at Devonport after completion, but was commissioned for service with the Channel Squadron in 1890–92. She {{was transferred to}} Bantry, Ireland, in 1893 {{to serve as the}} local coastguard ship until 1895. That year the ship was reassigned to the Devonport Reserve and remained there until 1899. <b>Aurora</b> participated in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Fleet review on 26 June 1897 at Spithead.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{decide to}} go to the North Pole to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get {{disappointed}} if Santa is not what everybody thinks he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to the North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see the <b>Aurora</b> borealis and the <b>Aurora</b> Boreanaz (an <b>aurora</b> with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E
40|$|General {{characteristics}} of dayside <b>auroras</b> for quiet and disturbed conditions are examined {{on the basis}} of Greenland and Spitzbergen TV data. It is our new finding that {{characteristics of}} dayside <b>auroras</b> are quite different between the pre- and post-noon sectors. Namely, corona <b>auroras</b> are seen in the pre-noon sector and band <b>auroras</b> are seen in the post-noon sector. During the quiet period, corona <b>auroras</b> are observed at magnetic latitudes higher than 75 ° in the pre-noon sector. In the post-noon sector, no remarkable <b>auroras</b> are seen around 75 ° MLAT. On the other hand, during the disturbed period, corona <b>auroras</b> are observed at latitudes lower than 80 ° MLAT in the pre-noon sector. Periodic bright band <b>auroras</b> appear in the post-noon sector. The comparison between these <b>auroras</b> and particle precipitation is also examined and the source region of dayside <b>auroras</b> is discussed...|$|R

30|$|In principle, {{instruments}} such as THEMIS whitelight ASIs have no {{discrimination on}} electron and proton <b>auroras.</b> However, {{due to the}} dominance of electron <b>auroras</b> in optical intensity, the above studies on TSSO based upon whitelight auroral images allude almost exclusively to electron <b>auroras.</b> Mende et al. (2001, 2003) compared the electron and proton <b>auroras</b> during substorms using IMAGE satellite observations, and noticed that the proton <b>auroras</b> show less variation {{as compared to the}} electron <b>auroras,</b> but their results were somehow limited by the low spatial and temporal (2  min) resolution of the auroral instruments onboard IMAGE. So far to the authors’ knowledge, a dedicated study on the proton auroral variation during the TSSO is absent in the existing literature; it will be the main research target in this study.|$|R

5|$|In Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of the {{animated}} film in which Sleeping Beauty is retold {{from the perspective}} of the villain, <b>Aurora</b> is portrayed by actress Elle Fanning, while actress Janet McTeer voices an elderly version of the character in the role of film's narrator. The princess is raised by Maleficent after first being cursed by the fairy in an act of revenge against her father King Stefan, only for a strong mother-daughter bond to develop between the characters; <b>Aurora</b> affectionately refers to Maleficent as her fairy godmother. When her curse is finally fulfilled, <b>Aurora</b> is awoken by Maleficent's remorseful kiss to her forehead as opposed to a prince's. <b>Aurora</b> defends Maleficent from her father, and eventually returns her wings to her when she is crowned queen of both the human kingdom and the fairy kingdom known as the Moors.|$|E

5|$|When Sleeping Beauty was {{released}} in 1959, the film was both a critical and commercial failure, discouraging the studio from adapting fairy tales into animated films for decades. <b>Aurora</b> herself received negative reviews for her passivity and overall similarity to Snow White. <b>Aurora</b> would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaids Ariel debuted 30 years later in 1989. However, Costa's vocal performance was praised, which inspired her to pursue a full-time career as an opera singer to great success. Chronologically, <b>Aurora</b> is the third Disney Princess. Despite having since established herself as a popular character for her beauty and fashion, Aurora's personality continues to receive negative press, particularly from feminist critics, thus earning her {{a reputation as one}} of Disney's most passive princess characters. Actress Elle Fanning portrays a live-action version of <b>Aurora</b> in the film Maleficent (2014), a retelling of Sleeping Beauty from the perspective of its villain.|$|E

5|$|A giant {{meteoroid}} {{approaches the}} earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle, while a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predicts {{the end of}} the world. The meteoroid misses the earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their ship, the <b>Aurora,</b> is helmed by Tintin's friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another team has set out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary, backed by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel; wherefore, the expedition becomes a race to land on the meteorite. On the day of departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick of dynamite on the <b>Aurora,</b> but it is found and thrown overboard. In the North Sea, the <b>Aurora</b> is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock steers out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of Akureyri, when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three then secretly run a hose from Chester's ship, Sirius, to the <b>Aurora,</b> and thus trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need.|$|E

5|$|As he {{had done}} for other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the <b>Aurora</b> was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if <b>Aurora</b> had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Auroras</b> are {{associated}} with the solar wind. The Earth's magnetic field traps its particles, many of which travel toward the poles where they are accelerated toward Earth.

40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{data set}} {{obtained}} over two campaigns in 2007 {{is used to}} determine the long-term variability of the different components of Jupiter's <b>auroras.</b> Three regions on the planet's disc are defined: the main oval, the low-latitude <b>auroras,</b> and the high-latitude <b>auroras.</b> The UV auroral power emitted from these regions is extracted and compared to estimated solar wind conditions projected to Jupiter's orbit from Earth. In the first campaign the emitted power originated mainly from the main oval and the high-latitude regions, and in the second campaign the high-latitude and main oval <b>auroras</b> were dimmer and less variable, while the low-latitude region exhibited bright, patchy emission. We show that, apart from during specific enhancement events, the power emitted from the poleward <b>auroras</b> is generally uncorrelated with that of the main oval. The exception events are dawn storms and compression region enhancements. It is shown that the former events, typically associated with intense dawnside main oval <b>auroras,</b> also result in the brightening of the high-latitude <b>auroras.</b> The latter events associated with compression regions exhibit a particular auroral morphology; that is, where it is narrow and well defined, the main oval is bright and located ~ 1 ° poleward of its previous location, and elsewhere it is faint. Instead there is bright emission in the poleward region in the postnoon sector where distinct, bright, sometimes multiple arcs form. Peer reviewe...|$|R
