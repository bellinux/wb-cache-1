5|$|Several notable Tyrannosaurus remains {{have been}} found in the Hell Creek Formation. During the Maastrichtian this area was subtropical, with <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> humid climate. The flora {{consisted}} mostly of angiosperms, but also included trees like dawn redwood (Metasequoia) and Araucaria. Tyrannosaurus shared this ecosystem with Triceratops, related ceratopsians Nedoceratops, Tatankaceratops and Torosaurus, the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus annectens and possibly a species of Parasaurolophus, the armored dinosaurs Denversaurus, Edmontonia and Ankylosaurus, the dome headed dinosaurs Pachycephalosaurus, Stygimoloch, Sphaerotholus, and Dracorex, the hypsilophodont Thescelosaurus, and the theropods Ornithomimus, Struthiomimus, Orcomimus, Acheroraptor, Dakotaraptor, Richardoestesia, Paronychodon, Pectinodon, and Troodon.|$|E
5|$|The Gulf Stream, {{together}} with its northern extension the North Atlantic Drift, is <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> swift Atlantic ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and stretches {{to the tip}} of Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of western intensification causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America. At about , it splits in two, with the northern stream, the North Atlantic Drift, crossing to Northern Europe and the southern stream, the Canary Current, recirculating off West Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> mellow appearance {{because of the}} pinkish colour of the sandstone. The proportions appear spacious because {{the view from the}} west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery. The proportions are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E

5|$|Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and {{insecure}} man {{in private}} but adopted <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations {{of those with}} whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed {{in the years after}} his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.|$|E
5|$|In April 1953, at the {{invitation}} of the French government, she traveled to the Cannes Film Festival, where she met Pierre Galante, an executive editor for the French journal Paris Match. Following a long-distance courtship and the requisite nine-month residency requirement, deHavilland and Galante married on April 12, 1955, in the village of Yvoy-le-Marron, and settled together in a three-story house near the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris' 16th arrondissement. That same year, she returned to the screen in Terence Young's period drama That Lady (1955), about a Spanish princess and her unrequited love for King Philip II of Spain, whose respect she earned in her youth after losing an eye in a sword fight defending his honor. According to Tony Thomas, the film uses authentic Spanish locations effectively, but suffers from a convoluted plot and excessive dialogue, and while deHavilland delivered <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> elegant performance as Ana de Mendoza, the film was disappointing. Following her appearances in the romantic melodrama Not as a Stranger (1955) and The Ambassador's Daughter (1956)neither of which were successful at the box officedeHavilland gave birth to her second child, Gisèle Galante, on July 18, 1956.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a northern origin for the chestnut-shouldered fairywren group {{due to the}} variety of forms {{in the north and}} their absence in the southeast of the continent. Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> wetter period around 2 million years ago {{at the end of the}} Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene. Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations. Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the red-winged fairywren, while those in the northwest of the continent became the variegated fairywren. Further warmer, humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards; this group, occupying central southern Australia east to the Eyre Peninsula, became the blue-breasted fairywren. Cooler climate after this resulted in this being isolated as well and evolving into a separate species. Finally, after the end of the last glacial period 12,00013,000years ago, the northern variegated forms have again spread southwards. This has resulted in the ranges of all three species overlapping. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Iskandar is {{reputed to}} have been a staunch disciplinarian, with {{willingness}} to occasionally voice personal opinions on governmental issues. On the personal side, subjects who have personally approached the Sultan in his later years described him as a person with <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> generous personality. However, past critics had also argued that Sultan Iskandar was a person with a turbulent temper. These claims were made by citing records of past notorious incidents, which include an experience of being disinherited from being the Tunku Mahkota of Johor (or Crown Prince in English) by his father, in 1961, as well as a series of alleged criminal acts occurring between the 1970s and the 1990s which were published in the press and provoked widespread moral outrage within the Malaysian public.|$|E

25|$|Poodles {{are known}} as a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. They require both {{physical}} and intellectual activities.

25|$|Chimega, {{possessed of}} <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> patient personality, soon became the university's beloved mascot. She resided {{in a large}} cage just {{to the south of}} the University Center that was topped with a {{geodesic}} dome designed by visiting professor R. Buckminster Fuller. She was cared for by a student organization aptly named the Cougar Guard, who accompanied her on her twice-daily walks around the core campus and to a myriad of university activities, especially including athletic events. (In keeping with the times, the Cougar Guard was originally all-male, but eventually became co-ed.) Chimega mated in 1974 and bore two cubs, one stillborn, the second dying within hours. In the summer of 1982, having become less patient with people than she had always been, Chimega was retired from active mascot service. She died in March 1985 and was buried near the pond located east of the classroom building now known as Founder's Hall.|$|E
