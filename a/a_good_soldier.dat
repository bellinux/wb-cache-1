5|$|Berlin's {{civilian}} {{work schedule}} {{had been that}} of a hardworking night owl, generally writing material until two or three in the morning. His efforts to adjust to military life and become <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>soldier</b> included springing out of bed obediently each morning, which earned him the resentment of fellow soldiers because he concealed his hatred of reveille too well and appeared eager {{to wake up in}} the mornings.|$|E

25|$|On July 5, 1901, Birger {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Army and was {{assigned}} to Company G of the newly formed 13th Cavalry Regiment, then stationed in South Dakota. Birger was described as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>soldier</b> and was honorably discharged on July 4, 1904, at Fort Meade, South Dakota. When he left the army, he became a cowboy. However, he eventually returned to Illinois, where he met his wife, Beatrice, and became a miner in the quickly expanding coal mining community of Harrisburg, later to become a keeper {{at one of the}} local saloons.|$|E

25|$|By October 1625, {{approximately}} 100 {{ships and}} a total of 15,000 seamen and soldiers had been readied for the Cádiz Expedition. An alliance with the Dutch had also been forged, and the new allies agreed to send an additional 15 warships commanded by William of Nassau, to help guard the English Channel {{in the absence of the}} main fleet. Sir Edward Cecil, a battle-hardened soldier fighting for the Dutch, was appointed commander of the expedition by the Duke of Buckingham. This choice of commander was ill-judged, because, while Cecil was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>soldier,</b> he had little knowledge of the sea.|$|E
500|$|On 3 March 1910 Troy Middleton enlisted {{into the}} 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Porter in Buffalo, New York. [...] He {{was put to}} work as a company clerk, and as a private earned $15 a month, which was paid in gold until it became scarce, and was then paid in silver. [...] Private Middleton tired of this desk work quickly and asked to become a soldier. While this did not happen at Fort Porter, his talents as a {{football}} player became known, and he was pressed into duty as the quarterback of the local team, which played civilian teams in the Buffalo area as well as other army teams such as the one at Fort Niagara near Niagara Falls. [...] For the next several years Middleton would play a lot of football, a sport that was strongly endorsed by the army. After getting a commission, an officer is never returned to the same unit from which he served as an enlisted member, but Middleton became the exception because of his talents as a quarterback. Middleton felt that football provided him with the finest training he received while in the army, and he said he never met a good football player who wasn't also <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>soldier.</b>|$|E
500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Hunt as [...] "confident", [...] "innovative", [...] "intelligent", {{while he}} {{also can be}} [...] "aggressive", [...] "brazen", [...] "presumptuous", [...] "hasty and rash". McKidd said of his character: [...] " [...] He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him that I think is really interesting and exciting to play. [...] " [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: [...] "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>soldier</b> and good surgeon [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|On 4 November 1794, Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer {{replaced}} the ill Dumerbion as army commander. Schérer wrote that Sérurier was [...] "a very good officer, {{devoted to his}} duties; his patriotism has been attacked {{in the time of}} Hébert and his consorts; he has emerged victorious from all these charges. In my opinion he is worthy of the post he holds on the right of the active army." [...] Sérurier's promotion was not confirmed until 13 June 1795. The Austro-Sardinian commander Joseph Nikolaus De Vins attacked the French lines on 24 June. Most of the assaults failed but since a few positions were captured and could not be retaken, the French withdrew from Vado to Borghetto Santo Spirito by 5 July. In the new line, Masséna with 14,000 troops held the coast while Sérurier and 6,000 men defended Ormea. On 5 July Sérurier reported that a key position had been partly lost, causing consternation at army headquarters. Later that day he reported that one of his brigadiers, Louis Pelletier, retook the position. Curiously, this incident did not count against him; instead Sérurier was given command of the left wing in place of Garnier. On the evening of 31 August, his headquarters at Saint-Martin-Vésubie was surrounded by the enemy. Though only 318 soldiers were at hand, Sérurier resisted successfully until early the following morning when he attacked and scattered his attackers, capturing 86 of them. The enemy commander, the émigré Chevalier Bonnaud committed suicide. Not only was he <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>soldier,</b> but Sérurier's troops liked him, he treated the local civilians with decency and his diplomacy allowed him to serve as a link between his army and the neighboring Army of the Alps. François Christophe Kellermann then in command of both armies, wrote, [...] "It is to the coolness and courage of this excellent officer that was due the success of this glorious day." ...|$|E

[...] Eventually on behalf of allied Latin landowners he influenced the termination of the land commission. As a result he, too, was assassinated—probably by a land reformer.|$|E

[...] "He understands the nature of democratic groups," [...] Mahn Sha said. The Karen leader thought that [...] " [...] was highly regarded among other Burmese pro-democracy groups because of his integrity and professionalism in the army.

2500|$|By contrast, Britannicus was {{progressively}} isolated. At {{the games}} of the circus Nero appeared in triumphal robes while Britannicus was still dressed as a boy. Tacitus says their clothing at the games affected {{the expectations of the}} people: with Nero in a general's clothing, and Britannicus in the dress of boyhood. He wouldn't be due for the toga until 12 February AD 55. He and his supporters were seen as a potential problem for Nero. Agrippa replaced his tutors with her own nominees, having convinced Claudius to order their executions, including the execution of Sosibius. Not just his tutors, but the two prefects of the Praetorian Guard, Lusius Geta and Rufius Crispinus, were replaced as well. They were thought to be sympathetic to the cause of Britannicus and his mother, as Tacitus reports: it would have been risky to surround Nero with any but those loyal to Claudius and Agrippina. His step-mother had them replaced with Sextus Afranius Burrus who was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>soldier,</b> but knew to whom he owed his allegiance.|$|E

2500|$|Menelik was cunning and {{strategic}} in building his power base. He organized extravagant three-day feasts for locals {{to win their}} favor, liberally built friendships with Muslims (such as Muhammad Ali of Wollo), and struck alliances with the French and Italians who could provide firearms and political leverage against the Emperor. In 1876, an Italian expedition set out to Ethiopia led by Marchese Orazio Antinori who described King Menelik as [...] "very friendly, and a fanatic for weapons, about whose mechanism {{he appears to be}} most intelligent". Another Italian writes of Menelik, [...] " [...] had the curiosity of a boy; the least thing made an impression upon him ... He showed ... great intelligence and great mechanical ability". Menelik spoke with great economy and rapidity. He never became upset, Chiarini adds, [...] "listening calmly, judiciously [...] with good sense ... He is fatalistic and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>soldier,</b> he loves weapons above all else". The visitors also confirmed that he was popular with his subjects, and made himself available to them. Menelik had great political and military acumen, and made key engagements that would later prove essential as he expanded his Empire.|$|E
