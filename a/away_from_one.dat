5|$|Apart {{from the}} lion, the cheetah {{is the only}} cat that is gregarious; however, female cheetahs tend to remain solitary. Tim Caro, of the University of California, Davis, {{identified}} the various social classes and their longevity. Pregnant and nursing females, a few adolescents, and males who have not joined any groups are typically solitary. Non-lactating females, their cubs, adolescent siblings, and several males will form their own groups. A loose association between individuals {{of the opposite sex}} can be observed during the breeding season. These social groups typically keep <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another.|$|E

25|$|Whereas the {{original}} {{mouth of the}} Singapore River emptied into Singapore Straits and its southern islands before major land reclamation took place, the Singapore River now empties into Marina Bay - an area of water partially enclosed by the reclamation work.

25|$|Heart Peaks {{is part of}} the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, a long {{volcanic}} chain {{extending from}} just north of the city of Prince Rupert in British Columbia through Yukon to the Alaska border. Along this line, the North American Plate has been rupturing. Earth's lithosphere consists of several large tectonic plates, which slowly move towards and <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another, either converging and subducting or diverging and rifting; volcanoes and earthquakes are generated by these activities. The west coast of North America is the site of plate margins between the large Pacific and North American plates, and also between the smaller Juan de Fuca and Cocos plates.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} the Sagnac effect. Two signals were sent in {{opposite}} directions around a rotating platform. After their arrival a displacement of the interference fringes occurs. Sagnac himself believed that he had proved {{the existence of the}} aether. However, special relativity can easily explain this effect. When viewed from an inertial frame of reference, it is a simple consequence of the independence of the speed of light from the speed of the source, since the receiver runs <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> beam, while it approaches the other beam. When viewed from a rotating frame, the assessment of simultaneity changes during the rotation, and consequently the speed of light is not constant in accelerated frames.|$|E

Miami's archbishop wrote a letter against the gay rights ordinance, and ordered it to be read aloud in all Catholic churches.|$|E
500|$|With skate skiing, {{the skier}} {{provides}} propulsion on a smooth, firm snow surface by pushing alternating skis <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another at an angle, {{in a manner}} similar to ice skating. Skate-skiing usually involves a coordinated use of poles and the upper body to add impetus, sometimes with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on a temporarily [...] "dominant" [...] side ("V1") or with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on either side ("V2"). Skiers climb hills with these techniques by widening the angle of the [...] "V" [...] and by making more frequent, shorter strides and more forceful use of poles. A variant of the technique is the [...] "marathon skate", where the skier leaves one ski in the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski.|$|E

500|$|While skate skiing, {{the skier}} {{provides}} propulsion on a firm snow surface by pushing alternating skis <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another at an angle, {{in a manner}} similar to ice skating. Skis are waxed with a glide wax over their entire length, making them faster than classic skis. Freestyle events take place on smooth, wide specially groomed courses. With the skating technique double-poling is usually employed with alternating skating strides or with every skate stride. The following table puts these poling sequences into order according to the speed achieved as a progression of [...] "gears". In the lowest gear (rarely used in racing), one is poling on the side of the sliding ski, similar to diagonal stride. In the highest gear, the athlete skates without poles. There are equivalent terms in other languages; for example in Norwegian, skating is likened to paddling or dancing, depending on the tempo.|$|E
500|$|On 15 November 1988, the PLO {{proclaimed the}} {{independent}} State of Palestine. Though he had frequently {{been accused of}} and associated with terrorism, in speeches on 13 and 14 December Arafat repudiated 'terrorism in all its forms, including state terrorism'. He accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242 and Israel's right [...] "to exist in peace and security" [...] and Arafat's statements were greeted with approval by the US administration, which had long insisted on these statements as a necessary starting point for official discussions between the US and the PLO. These remarks from Arafat indicated a shift <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> of the PLO's primary aims—the destruction of Israel (as entailed in the Palestinian National Covenant)–and toward the establishment of two separate entities: an Israeli state within the 1949 armistice lines, and an Arab state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

500|$|Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel {{grew up in}} the 1940s and 1950s in the {{predominantly}} Jewish neighborhood of Forest Hills in Queens, New York, just three blocks <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another, and attended the same schools, Public School 164 in Flushing, Parsons Junior High School, and Forest Hills High School. Individually, when still young, they developed a fascination with music; both listened to the radio and were taken with rock and roll as it emerged, particularly the Everly Brothers. When Simon first noticed Garfunkel, he was singing in a fourth grade talent show, and Simon thought that was a good way to attract girls; he hoped for a friendship which eventually started in 1953 when they were in the sixth grade and appeared on stage together in a school play adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. That first stage appearance was followed by the duo forming a street-corner doo-wop group, the Peptones, with three other friends, and learning to harmonize together. [...] They began performing {{for the first time as}} a duo at school dances.|$|E
