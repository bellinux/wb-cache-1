We use variables identified in previous studies that have helped explain the underpricing of <b>industrial</b> <b>company</b> IPOs to help explain the underpricing of property trust IPOs. We find that the prospectus forecast dividend yield is a critical variable in the valuation and hence underpricing of REIT IPOs compared to <b>industrial</b> <b>company</b> IPOs. The sentiment towards the market and whether or not the issue is underwritten also impact the underpricing of REITs but the impact is much less than on <b>industrial</b> <b>company</b> IPOs. <br /...|$|R
