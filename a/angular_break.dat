50|$|Christianshavns Kanal (English: Christianshavn Canal) is a canal in the Christianshavn {{neighbourhood}} of Copenhagen, Denmark. Running northeast-southwest, it bisects the neighbourhood {{along its}} length. To the north it connects to Trangraven, the canal which separates Christianshavn from Holmen; {{to the south}} it makes an <b>angular</b> <b>break</b> and empties in the main harbour a little north of the Langebro bridge. At the middle, Christianshavns Kanal is crossed by Børnehusbroen. This bridge is part of Torvegade, the main thoroughfare of Christianshavn, connecting the city centre across Knippelsbro to the northwest to Amager the southeast. The only other bridge traversing the canal is Snorrebroen, located further north.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The Bear Creek area is {{situated}} at the boundry between the Basin and Range Province, Deschutes Basin and Blue Mountains Province. It contains rock units representing most of the Cenozoic geologic column. The major rock units exposed are the Clarno Formation, John Day Formation, Columbia River Basalt Group, Deschutes Formation and the Rim Basalts. The Bear Creek area exposes the southwestern most outcrops of the John Day Formation, which are typically fresher than the John Day rocks exposed elsewhere. In the Bear Creek area fluviatile sediments of John Day affinity have been reported for the first time. The most important unconformity in the thesis area is an <b>angular</b> <b>break,</b> between the John Day Formation and the Columbia River Basalt Group rocks. Rocks under the unconformity are folded with dips up to 40 °, and the thesis area is on the limb {{of one of these}} folds. The Columbia River Basalt is very gently folded in the same pattern. The most prominent structures of the area are a number of north-south trending faults. Field evidence is presented which indicates that all of these faults are younger than the Columbia River Basalt / John Day angular unconformity. Five different sets of faults have been identified in the thesis area on the basis of orientation and sequence. The Bear Creek Faults are the oldest set of faults. These faults are high angle normal and/or reverse (possibly scissor) faults. Minor strike slip faults cut the Taylor Butte. These faults are at least younger than the John Day Formation. The Dam Fault is a high angle normal fault, and has the maximum amount of displacement associated with it. The Reservoir Fault trends in the northwest-southeast direction and is a high angle normal fault. The Alkali Flat Fault is the youngest fault exposed in the area, and is a north-south trending normal fault. It is my contention that these faults were developed in response to the extention and development of the Deschutes Basin...|$|E
50|$|The span of {{the bridge}} crosses {{perpendicular}} to the river, but the roadway is {{at an angle to}} the river, so there are <b>angular</b> <b>breaks</b> in the east and west approaches. The approaches rise from ground level to meet the central span, which is a pointed arch high over the deepest part of the river. Constructed from colored solid masonry, the approaches have small arches built into them to let flood-waters through. Two of the piers of the bridge sit in the river; the western support is decorated with two carved figures, one standing and one sitting. The bridge is 150 m long and 7 m wide, 19 m in height and a main span of 38.6 m. The roadway has two toll-booths, one either side of the main span. The spandrels of the main arch incorporate small rooms for weary travelers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{fixturing}} {{of large}} segmented-ring assemblies is {{of importance to}} a number of key high value industries such as the aerospace and power generation sectors. This study examines methods of optimising the circularity of segmented-ring assemblies, and how the manufacturing variation within each element (i. e. segment wedge) contributes to overall assembly variability. This has lead to the definition of two original assembly methodologies that aim to optimise an assembly, so that circularity errors are minimised for a given set of components. The assembly methods considered during this study include a radial Translation Build (TB) and a Circumscribed Geometric (CG) approach, both of which are compared to a traditional Fixed Datum (FD) build method. The effects of angular, radial, parallelism/flatness and chord length variability within the component geometry, and their effect on the circularity of the final annular assembly are examined mathematically and experimentally. Furthermore, the inherent loss of assembly circularity due to differences between component and assembly sagitta is also considered, along with the stepping caused by dissimilar adjacent component radii as a result of manufacturing variation. Experimental results show that the CG build method offers a significant improvement in circularity in most situations over the benchmark FD build method. This contrasts the TB results that proved to be the least consistent in terms of circularity, but better in the control of <b>angular</b> <b>breaking</b> errors within the assembly...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} indoor mobile robot {{localization}} using 2 D laser rangefinder data. An indoor environment is mainly made of connected or nonconnected planes (e. g., walls, doors, desks [...] .). Therefore the laser rangefinder data are {{a set of}} points belonging to straight lines. The more suitable preprocessing of those data {{seems to be a}} polygonal approximation. However, classical approximation methods are not robust enough to provide a reliable local description. We propose a new method to provide a robust polygonal approximation. It means accurate, reliable and repeatable detection of dominant points, such as <b>angular</b> points or <b>break</b> points. We thus obtain a set of <b>angular</b> points and <b>break</b> points (e. g., segments) whose detection depends neither on relative sensor location nor on measure noise. We present experimental results that demonstrate successful map building. 1...|$|R
40|$|The authors present {{numerical}} simulations illustrating two {{mechanisms of}} binary formation. In the first mechanism, protostellar discs form independently and then capture {{one another to}} form binary and multiple systems. In the second mechanism, a single protostellar disc becomes rotationally unstable due to the accretion of matter with high specific <b>angular</b> momentum, and <b>breaks</b> up into two or more pieces. Both mechanisms occur {{for a wide range}} of initial conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{ground-state}} properties of bosons {{loaded into the}} $p$-band of a one dimensional optical lattice. We show that the phase diagram {{of the system is}} substantially affected by the anharmonicity of the lattice potential. In particular, for a certain range of tunneling strength, the full many-body ground state of the system becomes degenerate. In this region, an additional symmetry of the system, namely the parity of the occupation number of the chosen orbital, is spontaneously broken. The state with nonvanishing staggered <b>angular</b> momentum, which <b>breaks</b> the time-reversal symmetry, becomes the true ground state of the system. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
50|$|The anti-rolling {{controller}} {{is actually}} a steering controller to stabilize the rolling motion of the torpedo by roll rudders on both sides. The roll rudders work within angler range +/-22.5 degrees, twisting in ailerons manner.When a torpedo is rolling or rolls to some degree, the anti-rolling controller twists those rudders in the counter-rolling direction. When a torpedo is rolling back to its neutral position of 0 degree, the controller sense it and switches roll rudders {{in the opposite direction}} to <b>break</b> <b>angular</b> velocity of torpedo rolling back, or countersteering. They naval engineers called this operation as countersteer as they modeled it to steer a ship.|$|R
60|$|The minor contours, out {{of which}} the larger {{outlines}} are composed, are indeed beautifully curvilinear; but they are never monotonous in their curves. First comes a concave line, then a convex one, then an <b>angular</b> jag, <b>breaking</b> off into spray, then a downright straight line, then a curve again, then a deep gap, and a place where all is lost and melted away, and so on; displaying in {{every inch of the}} form renewed and ceaseless invention, setting off grace with rigidity, and relieving flexibility with force, in a manner scarcely less admirable, and far more changeful than even in the muscular forms of the human frame. Nay, such is the exquisite composition of all this, that you may take any single fragment of any cloud in the sky, and you will find it put together as {{if there had been a}} year's thought over the plan of it, arranged with the most studied inequality--with the most delicate symmetry--with the most elaborate contrast, a picture in itself. You may try every other piece of cloud in the heaven, and you will find them every one as perfect, and yet not one in the least like another.|$|R
40|$|We use {{our current}} {{understanding}} of the all-order singularity structure of gauge theory amplitudes to probe their high-energy limit. Our starting point is the dipole formula, a compact ansatz for the soft anomalous dimension matrix of massless multi-particle amplitudes. In the high-energy limit, we find a simple and general expression for the infrared factor generating all soft and collinear singularities of the amplitude, which is valid to leading power in $|t|/s$ and to all logarithmic orders. This leads to a direct and general proof of leading-logarithmic Reggeization for infrared divergent contributions to the amplitude. Furthermore, we can prove explicitly that the simplest form of Reggeization, based on the absence of Regge cuts in the complex <b>angular</b> momentum plane, <b>breaks</b> down at the NNLL level. Finally, we note that the known features of the high-energy limit {{can be used to}} constrain possible corrections to the dipole formula, starting at the three-loop order.

40|$|The {{turbulent}} flow structure, suspended sediment dynamics and deposits of experimental sustained turbidity currents exiting a channel across {{a break in}} slope into a wide tank are documented. The data {{shed light on the}} flow evolution and deposit geometry of analogous natural channel-fed submarine fans. Flows generated in a 0 · 3 m wide, sloping (0 °, 6 °, 9 ° or 20 °) channel crossed an <b>angular</b> slope <b>break</b> and spread onto a horizontal tank floor. Flow development comprised: (i) channelized phase (unsteady channel flow developing into steady channel flow); (ii) initial lateral expansion phase (unsteady-spreading wall jet phase); (iii) constant lateral expansion phase (steady-spreading wall jet phase); and (iv) rapid waning phase. Phases (i) and (iv) are similar to laterally constrained turbidity currents, but phases (ii) and (iii) are considerably different from such two-dimensional currents. Steeper channel slopes produced greater flow velocities and turbulence intensities, but these effects diminished markedly with distance from the channel mouth. Flow velocity vectors in the tank had similar patterns for all channel slopes, with a central core of faster velocity and narrow vector dispersion and slower flow with larger dispersion at the jet margins. Suspended sediment concentrations were higher within flow heads and dense basal layers in flow bodies. Time-averaged acoustic backscatter data showed vertical concentration gradients, confirmed by siphon samples. The deposits comprised a thick central ridge, of similar order width to the channel mouth, with abrupt margins and a surrounding, very thin, fan-like sheet. The ridge was coarser grained and better sorted than the original sediment, with grain-size fining downstream, particularly over the fan-like sheet. The formation of a central ridge suggests that, in the tank, vertical turbulent momentum exchange is more significant for sediment dynamics than spanwise momentum exchange due to lateral expansion. The streamwise elongate geometry of the ridge contrasts with conventional fan-like geometry found with surge-type turbidity flows, a result that has widespread stratigraphic and economic implications...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} stellar rotation-activity {{relation}} in the crucial {{age at which}} stars reach the fastest rotation. To this aim we have analyzed data of the young cluster h Per, very rich and compact, located at 2300 pc, that at an age of 13 Myr should be mainly composed of stars that have ended their contraction phase and that have not lost significant <b>angular</b> momentum viamagnetic <b>breaking.</b> To constrain the activity level of h Per members we have analyzed a deep Chandra/ACIS-I observation. Rotational periods of h Per members have been derived by Moraux et al. (2013) {{in the framework of}} the MONITOR project (Aigrain et al. 2007; Irwin et al. 2007). In the Chandra observation we have detected 1010 X-ray sources located in the central field of h Persei. Assuming a distance of 2300 pc their X-ray luminosity ranges between 2 x 10 ^ 29 and 6 x 10 ^ 31 erg/s. Among the 1010 x-ray sources ~ 600 have as optical counterpart candidate members of the cluster with masses ranging down to 0. 3 solar mass, and ˜ 150 have also measured rotational period. For this sample of ˜ 150 h Per members we have compared X-ray luminosity and rotational periods for different mass ranges. We have found that solar type stars (~ 1. 3 solar mass) show evidence of supersaturation for short periods. This phenomenon is unobserved for lower mass stars...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the chapter house of the Dominican Friars in Cracow is not known in greater detail. Only two medieval {{documents}} with a mention of it are known. In in capitulo fratrum ordinis Praedicatorum Cracoviae of 1244 an endowment for the Cistercian monastery in Mogiła was confirmed. In Cracovie in capitulo fratrum predicatorum of 1306 the purchase of land in Dąbie, near Cracow, was certified. Marcin Szyma estimated that these notes cannot be ascribed to one building, which means {{that there were two}} gathering places for monks, one built after the other. Szyma locates the oldest chapter-house in the site of today’s sacristy and links it with a brick wall with a biforium window and portal remains, found in the western wall of the building. The older record marks terminus ante quern, and comparative chronology and analysis of style point to 1240 s as the date of extension of the house. A new chapter house was built in Szyma’s assessment {{at the end of that}} century, and certainly before 1306. The building has fairly rich decorative carving, infrequently mentioned in historical records. The portal in the western wall of the chapter house has had three preserved, if tumbledown, consoles carved in yellowish, fine-grained sandstone. The closest analogies to these decorations are to be found in edifices built for the last members of the Premyslids dynasty, especially for king Premyslav Otokar II in the third quarter of the 13 th century. In works connected with the “Premyslids building school” compact, block-like shapes of caps, ‘coated’ with tiny leaves and decorative ‘crowns’ at rib base were fairly common. Consoles in a portal of the oldest fragment of Śpilberk in Brno or chapels in the castles in Bezdez, Horsovsky Tyn, Zvikov and Buchlov are of special importance for these considerations. Czech examples most often employ a variety of flora, yet, even here, in the portal caps of the monastery in Hradiśte on Jizerou (ca 1260) we come across a laciniated acanthus with characteristic folds. The connections described testify to the origins of the Cracow’s portal at the end of the third at the earliest or, most probably, the beginning of the fourth quarter of the 13 th century. Until 1301 Czech Dominicans belonged to one province with Polish friars. Political expansion of Premyslav Otokar II in Polish territory, and especially in Cracow, led to a number of alliances with princes of the Piast dynasty, including Boleslaus the Chaste. The sandstone capital preserved in the Franciscan monastery can also cast light upon artistic connections between Cracovian and Czech sculptors. The capital, which has gone practically unnoticed in professional literature, is believed to be a fragment of an unfinished portal from the first tierce of the 14 th century. The Cracow fragment is closest to the caps found in a Benedictine monastery at Ostrov, near Davie from ca 1260 - 1280 (Prague, National Museum), and the capital from St. Ludmila’s chapel, which until 1894 adjoined the sacristy of the Virgin Maiy’s church at Tyn in Prague (Prague, National Museum). Vault brick ribs are provided with stone leads at the base and are supported on stone consolas with three curved offsets. In each of the three bays there is a round keystone with an engraved decoration with a spatial, almost perfectly plastic character. Naturalistic character of the keystone with a floral pattern leads back to the French cathedral decorations. These decorations were introduced in the East by big workshops in the Reich, with the workshop of Naumburg Master in the first place. The spatial, openwork form, which consists of leaves rendered in a perfectly plastic way, approximates the Cracow carving to, for example, keystones in the body of the naves in the cathedral in Meissen. Figural reliefs seem to refer to works of the ‘expressive’ trend in sculpture of the second half of the 13 th and the beginning of the 14 th century, which have unquestionable connections with the alternative Gothic painting or with the formula of the zigzag style (German Zackenstill). <b>Angular</b> <b>breaking</b> of folds was considerably softened here due to exceptionally fleshy treatment of matter. Huge piles of fabric are very plastic, which blurs the outline of the drawing and washes away its expression. The closest similarity links these sculptures with works that came from Saint Erminold Master workshop - one that played a key role in the development of stone sculpture in the territory of the Reich at the close of the 13 th century. The style character of sculptures (especially this ‘underlying’ tradition of the zigzag style, readable amongst piles of fleshy matter) points to the times short after the year 1300 as their origin. Hie workshop that was completing the walling up in the Cracow Dominican monastery combined the solutions known in Central Europe, while the dominant role seems to be played by patterns from Austria and the southern parts of the Reich (Regensburg). Basic role in the artist’s choice could have been played by wide contacts of friars within the order, if only through going for general studies...|$|R
