5|$|A {{piece of}} <b>a</b> <b>garment</b> signed by Ivan Alexander and {{interwoven}} with gold {{was discovered in}} a noble's grave near Pirot in the 1970s; today it is preserved in the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade. It is the first find of its kind, demonstrating a medieval tradition attested in writing according to which Orthodox rulers would present their most eminent dignitaries {{with a piece of}} <b>a</b> <b>garment</b> they had worn.|$|E

When Meany's older brother joined the US Army in 1917, George became the sole source of income for his mother and six younger children. He supplemented his income for a while by playing as a semiprofessional baseball catcher. In 1919, he married Eugenia McMahon, <b>a</b> <b>garment</b> worker and a member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. They had three daughters.|$|E
5|$|In the 2nd century, {{emperors}} and men {{of status}} are often portrayed wearing the pallium, an originally Greek mantle (himation) folded tightly around the body. Women are also {{portrayed in the}} pallium. Tertullian considered the pallium an appropriate garment both for Christians, {{in contrast to the}} toga, and for educated people, since it was associated with philosophers. By the 4th century, the toga had been more or less replaced by the pallium as <b>a</b> <b>garment</b> that embodied social unity.|$|E

5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in <b>a</b> <b>garment</b> (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, and held in place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E
5|$|Metal corsets {{for medical}} {{purposes}} {{continued to be}} used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place. In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American Orthopaedic Association recommended an aluminium corset coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of Pott disease or curvature of the spine. Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such <b>a</b> <b>garment</b> were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such corsets were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more durable in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.|$|E
5|$|She is now {{best known}} as a fashion guru and style advisor. Her fashion career started when she worked for many years as a shop girl in America for Giorgio Armani. She later came back to London with the hope of {{securing}} a job with Armani but ended up working for designers such as Richard James, Patrick Cox, Alistair Blair and John Galliano which gained her an even greater understanding of fashion, providing an in depth knowledge of how <b>a</b> <b>garment</b> progresses from a sketch. She then started working with the British Brain and Spine Foundation and consequently met the sports editor of The Daily Telegraph. Whilst doing a piece for GMTV, he asked Constantine to report the women's World Cup Final in cricket on finding out that it was her passion. She proceeded to write about cars and then fashion.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of <b>a</b> <b>garment</b> she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E

5000|$|Made {{to measure}} (MTM or M2M) {{typically}} refers to clothing that is sewn from a standard-sized base pattern. A tailored suit {{is a common}} example of <b>a</b> made-to-measure <b>garment.</b> The fit of <b>a</b> made-to-measure <b>garment</b> {{is expected to be}} superior to that of <b>a</b> ready-to-wear <b>garment,</b> because ready-to-wear garments are constructed to fit the manufacturer's definition of an average customer, while made-to-measure garments are constructed to fit each customer individually. However, made-to-measure items are seen by many to involve less workmanship than bespoke or [...] "custom made" [...] garments, as made-to-measure garments always involve some form of standardization in the patterning and manufacturing processes, whereas <b>a</b> bespoke <b>garment</b> is made entirely from scratch based on a customer's specifications. Typically, <b>a</b> made-to-measure <b>garment</b> will be more expensive than ready-to-wear garment but cheaper than a bespoke one.|$|R
