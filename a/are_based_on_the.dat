Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH3 is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fusion of two 10-atom clusters.|$|E
