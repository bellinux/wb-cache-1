5|$|During the Great Depression, Arrington {{was curious}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of {{potatoes}} {{and set about}} his first economic experiment. He put slips of paper {{in some of the}} sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the United Kingdom on vinyl in mid-December 1979, and in the United States on vinyl and 8-track tape two weeks later. A gatefold cover design of the LP was only released in Japan. Though London Calling was released as a double album it was only sold for <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of a single album. The Clash's record label, CBS, at first denied the band's request for the album to be released as a double. In return CBS gave permission for the band to include a free 12-inch single that played at 33⅓ rpm. Ultimately, the planned 12-inch record became a second nine-track LP.|$|E

25|$|A {{second major}} cost lay in play scripts. In the years around 1600, playwrights could be paid {{as little as}} £6 to £7 per play (or <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of two suits). Yet since the {{companies}} acted a constantly changing repertory, they needed an abundant supply of plays. Philip Henslowe's Diary records dozens of titles for the 15971603 period; when Worcester's Men were setting up for their first London season in 1602, they purchased a dozen new plays from Henslowe's stable of house playwrights, to supplement their existing stock.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{members of}} the House Projection Forces Subcommittee had been {{pressing}} the Navy to use nuclear power for major combatants, partly {{as a response to}} concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> and availability of oil. They prompted studies in 2005 and 2006, the second of which stated that nuclear power broke even at an oil price of $70–$225/barrel for escort ships of 21-26,000 tonnes with heavy radar use. This led to a requirement in the FY2008 Defense Authorization Act that all major combatant vessels be nuclear powered unless it was not in the national interest.|$|E

25|$|Coffee, {{regarded}} as a Muslim drink, was prohibited by Ethiopian Orthodox Christians until as late as 1889; it is now considered a national drink of Ethiopia for people of all faiths. Its early association in Europe with rebellious political activities led to Charles II outlawing coffeehouses from January 1676 (although the uproar created forced the monarch to back down {{two days before the}} ban was due to come into force). Frederick the Great banned it in Prussia in 1777 for nationalistic and economic reasons; concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of import, he sought to force the public back to consuming beer. Lacking coffee-producing colonies, Prussia had to import all its coffee at a great cost.|$|E
25|$|The first {{publicly}} transmitted live trans-Atlantic {{program was}} broadcast via the Telstar satellite on July 23, 1962, at 3:00pm EDT, and Cronkite {{was one of}} the main presenters in this multinational broadcast. The broadcast was made possible in Europe by Eurovision and in North America by NBC, CBS, ABC, and the CBC. The first public broadcast featured CBS's Cronkite and NBC's Chet Huntley in New York, and the BBC's Richard Dimbleby in Brussels. Cronkite was in the New York studio at Rockefeller Plaza as the first pictures to be transmitted and received were the Statue of Liberty in New York and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The first segment included a televised major league baseball game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. From there, the video switched first to Washington, D.C.; then to Cape Canaveral, Florida; then to Quebec City, Quebec, and finally to Stratford, Ontario. The Washington segment included a press conference with President Kennedy, talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of the American dollar, which was causing concern in Europe. This broadcast inaugurated live intercontinental news coverage, which was perfected later in the sixties with Early Bird and other Intelsat satellites.|$|E

This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a careful series of bombing tests alongside Navy and Marine bombers.

500|$|Upon her arrival, Dot Cotton {{was quickly}} {{established}} as the gossip, [...] whose purpose, as author Anthony Slide sees it, was [...] "that of a Greek chorus, {{commenting on the}} foibles of her fellow residents of Albert Square, from her vantage point as manager of the local launderette". The [...] "gossip" [...] is a soap opera role that author Christine Geraghty has described as [...] "crucial to the audience's engagement with a serial and provides both {{a source of information}} and a means of speculation for the viewer." [...] She asserts that a fundamental aspect of British soap is the idea of supporting members of community, based on the sharing of intimate knowledge, allowing [...] "practical and emotional needs to be met" [...] within the enclosed community. However, according to Geraghty, there is nevertheless [...] "an unease <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> paid for such support and an acknowledgement of the fine-line between neighbourliness and nosiness. The 'gossip' personifies this unease and though her task of passing on information and ferreting out problems is crucial to the community, she [...] is frequently the butt of mockery and criticism [...] The avidity with which Dot Cotton seeks out news is the subject of some embarrassment to her more restrained neighbours but the exchange of information she provides is essential if the community is to provide support to its members [...] the very process of exchanging information makes her an essential yet mistrusted figure." ...|$|E

2500|$|The State Bar of Arizona {{appealed to}} {{a desire to}} {{maintain}} a certain air of [...] "professionalism" [...] among lawyers as justifying its ban on lawyer advertising. [...] Advertising, the State Bar asserted, would [...] "undermine the attorney's sense of dignity and self-worth", [...] "erode the client's trust in the attorney" [...] by exposing an economic motive for representation, and [...] "tarnish the dignified public image of the profession". But the public understands that attorneys make their living at the bar, and few attorneys deceive themselves by thinking otherwise. [...] "Bankers and engineers advertise, and yet these professions are not regarded as undignified. [...] In fact, {{it has been suggested}} that the failure of lawyers to advertise creates public disillusionment with the profession." [...] A lack of information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of legal services tends to dissuade people of modest means from seeking legal representation, even when it is in their best interest to engage such representation. [...] Finally, insofar as the [...] "belief that lawyers are somehow 'above' trade has become an anachronism, the historical foundation for the advertising restraint has crumbled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} to the character's role in {{the story}} and traits has been positive. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network liked the character's philosophies about fate and realism as she manages to explain multiple aspects from the series [...] "like a brilliant university professor." [...] To Megan Lavey from Mania Entertainment, [...] "Yuko really makes this series" [...] due to the way she interacts with her clients <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> to grant their wishes {{as well as her}} sense of humor which involves multiple references. Across the series, Yūko grows close with Watanuki and their development has been praised by Matthew Alexander from Mania Entertainment as Watanuki starts caring about his boss' true desire as he realizes how much she cares for him. Michael Aronson from Manga Life saw Yuko's outfits appealing. Johanna from Comics Worth Reading agreed with him while Ed Sizemore from the same site admitted having taken a liking to her due to her personality {{and the fact that she}} has [...] "the wonderful sensuality of a Hollywood femme fatale from the 30′s and 40's." [...] Her death scene has been referred by Active Anime's Holly Ellingwood as [...] "tragic, inspiring, and beautifully, breathtakingly sad" [...] due to the way it was presented. Santos noted that while the loss of Yūko could have negatively affected the series due to the impact she brought to the series, it managed to retain the same quality thanks to Watanuki inheriting most of her distinctive traits. Colleen Clinkenbeard's performance in the English dub of the series has also been the subject of praise by writers from Anime News Network.|$|E
