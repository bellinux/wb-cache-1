500|$|There {{are various}} {{descriptions}} {{of the church as}} it stood before Kennedy's 1871 rebuilding. In 1833, the Anglesey antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the church as [...] "a small ancient structure, displaying some good architectural details". She also noted that it contained [...] "some fine monuments" [...] to members of local families. The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1851. He said that the church was [...] "little superior in size or architecture to the generality of Anglesey churches", but added that it was in [...] "a neat and creditable state". He also commented upon the [...] "neat and uniform" [...] pews. In 1862, the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones wrote that the church was [...] "of good work, and with the details of doors and windows carefully elaborated." [...] He compared the east window to that at St Mary's Church, Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy (also on Anglesey), and noted that there was an <b>ambry</b> or recess in the east wall beneath the window.|$|E
2500|$|Fifteenth century work {{includes}} a roofless chamber {{in which the}} remains of {{what appear to be}} an <b>ambry</b> and a piscina suggest it was a chapel rather than a hall. [...] There is also a vaulted basement bakehouse and brewhouse from this period.|$|E
2500|$|These holy oils {{are usually}} stored in special vessels known as chrismaria {{and kept in}} a cabinet known as an <b>ambry.</b> When the oils are {{distributed}} to a priest for him to use in his ministry they are kept in a smaller vessel with three compartments, known as an [...] "oil stock". There is also a type of oil stock that is shaped like a ring, to make the anointing easier. The [...] "jewel" [...] of the ring is a container with a removable lid.|$|E
50|$|They were {{originally}} {{named for the}} baptismal font. Piscinae seem at first to have been mere cups or small basins, supported on perforated stems, placed close to the wall, and afterwards to have been recessed therein and covered with niche heads, which often contained shelves to serve as <b>ambries.</b> They were rare in England until the 13th century, after which there is scarcely an altar without one. They frequently {{take the form of}} a double niche, with a shaft between the arched heads, which are often filled with elaborate tracery. If there is no drain, a niche for washing is a lavabo, though the usage of the two terms is confused.|$|R
50|$|The Reformed churches {{abandoned}} reservation of the elements, so that <b>ambries,</b> unless {{used for}} housing vessels, became redundant. But, in the Scottish Episcopal church since {{the eighteenth century}} and other Anglican churches since the nineteenth century (following the Tractarian revival), reservation has again become common. In the Church of England the sacrament is reserved in all forty-four cathedrals, {{as well as many}} parish churches, although it is very uncommon amongst churches of an evangelical tradition. Reservation of the sacrament is quite common in the Episcopal Church of the United States, the Anglican Church of Australia, the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, {{as well as in the}} Anglican Church of Canada (though with varying degrees of veneration, depending on the parish). Even traditionally Low Church parishes, such as St. Anne's, Toronto, reserve the sacrament.|$|R

"Those {{who have}} lived in want and privation are the best {{qualified}} to appreciate the blessings of plenty; thus, {{those who have been}} devout and sincere members of the separated portion of the English Church; who have prayed, and hoped, and loved, through all the poverty of the maimed rites which it has retained--to them does the realisation of all their longing desires appear truly ravishing. * * * Oh! then, what delight! what joy unspeakable! when one of the solemn piles is presented to them, in all its pristine life and glory!--the stoups are filled to the brim; the rood is raised on high; the screen glows with sacred imagery and rich device; the niches are filled; the altar is replaced, sustained by sculptured shafts, the relics of the saints repose beneath, the body of Our Lord is enshrined on its consecrated stone; the lamps of the sanctuary burn bright; the saintly portraitures in the glass windows shine all gloriously; and the albs hang in the oaken <b>ambries,</b> and the cope chests are filled with orphreyed baudekins; and pix and pax, and chrismatory are there, and thurible, and cross." ...|$|R
60|$|Edward {{had lived}} at Glennaquoich {{long enough to}} be aware of a {{distinction}} which he had repeatedly heard noticed, and now satisfied that he had no interest with his attendants, he glanced a disconsolate eye around the interior of the cabin. The only furniture, excepting a washing-tub and a wooden press, called in Scotland an <b>ambry,</b> sorely decayed, was a large wooden bed, planked, as is usual, all around, and opening by a sliding panel. In this recess the Highlanders deposited Waverley, after he had by signs declined any refreshment. His slumbers were broken and unrefreshing; strange visions passed before his eyes, and it required constant and reiterated efforts of mind to dispel them. Shivering, violent headache, and shooting pains in his limbs succeeded these symptoms; and in the morning it was evident to his Highland attendants or guard, for he knew not in which light to consider them, that Waverley was quite unfit to travel.|$|E

50|$|The church {{dates to}} the early 14th century. It is triple-aisled and made of granite and fieldstone, the west tower is wooden. The oldest parts of the carved altar date to the 15th century. The <b>ambry</b> is {{in the shape of}} a {{pinnacle}} turret.|$|E
5000|$|In Roman Catholic usage, when {{commonly}} called an <b>ambry,</b> it is traditionally {{in the sanctuary}} (as in, the altar area) of a church or in the Baptistery, and is used to store the oils used in sacraments: Oil of catechumens (indicated by the Latin letters O.C.), Oil of the Sick (O.I.), and Sacred Chrism (S.C.). Former regulations required it to be secured and locked, and lined and veiled with either purple cloth (in reference to the Oil of the Sick) or white (for the Sacred Chrism). The door was usually marked [...] "O.S." [...] or Olea Sancta, to indicate the contents. Such regulations are now relaxed so that while many churches continue to use such an <b>ambry,</b> the oils are also stored {{and in some cases}} displayed in other ways.|$|E
5000|$|The Blessed Sacrament Chapel, {{built to}} the north, {{at right angles}} to the main axis of the building, can {{accommodate}} about 60 worshippers. The chapel houses five examples of fine English Victorian stained glass from the studios of the Atkinson Brothers. The central window is decorated with abstract designs. The other windows are of saints, two on each side. The saints are (on the left) Patrick and John and (on the right) James and Peter. The windows [...] " ... are a unique collection as no other building in the world contains more than two from these same workshops." [...] The modern glass above the chapel doors was designed and fabricated by Graham Stewart of Christchurch. There is also a fine icon of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and St Mary his mother by contemporary iconographer, Michael Galovic (installed in 2007). In the west wall of the chapel is a small space or <b>ambry</b> where the holy oils (called Chrism) are kept. The <b>ambry</b> is backed by a panel with a gold sculptured image of Christ on it. This panel was a door, once part of the tabernacle of the High Altar of old St Mary's Cathedral. The front of the <b>ambry</b> has a wide red and yellow, glass, mosaic border around the glassed-in space where can be seen the three glass, amphora-like, Chrismaria containing the holy oils. These vessels and their contents are bathed in a somber green light.|$|E
50|$|After the Reformation and the Tridentine reforms, in the Roman Catholic Church {{the sacrament}} {{was no longer}} {{reserved}} in ambries; some ambries were used to house the oil for the Anointing of the Sick. Today in the Roman Catholic Church, the consecrated elements may only be reserved in a tabernacle or hanging pyx; reservation in an <b>ambry</b> is now forbidden.|$|E
5000|$|Centered {{within those}} 4 carvings listed above, is the <b>Ambry</b> that {{contains}} the Holy Oils. This <b>Ambry,</b> or case, was created and built by Parishioner William O'Donnell and takes {{the shape of the}} Church itself to house the 3 oils; the Oil of Catechumens, the Chrism and the Oil of the Sick. Unfortunately, Mr. O'Donnell passed away before he could complete the case and for years, the case hung {{on the wall of the}} church [...] "as is" [...] until the upper portions were completed last year by another parishioner in honor of Mr. O'Donnell. A Parishioner also created the altar on which the tabernacle of the Upper Church now sits, on the Main Altar. Again, a parishioner, in addition to creating the Creche Cabinet itself, created the crucifix that hangs under the baldachin of the Upper Church to hold the life sized Corpus Christi that was given to the parish by another long time Parishioner.|$|E
5000|$|Items kept in an <b>ambry</b> include chalices {{and other}} vessels, {{as well as}} items for the {{reserved}} sacrament, the consecrated elements from the Eucharist. This latter use was infrequent in pre-Reformation churches, although it was known in Scotland, Sweden, Germany and Italy. More usually the sacrament was reserved in a pyx, usually hanging in front of and above the altar or later in a [...] "sacrament house".|$|E

5000|$|An <b>ambry</b> (or almery, aumbry; {{from the}} medieval form almarium, cf. Lat. armārium, [...] "a place for keeping tools"; cf. O. Fr. aumoire and mod. armoire) is a {{recessed}} cabinet {{in the wall}} of a Christian church for storing sacred vessels and vestments. They are sometimes near the piscina, but more often on the opposite side. The word also seems in medieval times to be used commonly for any closed cupboard and even bookcase.|$|E

50|$|The baptistry is also {{located at}} the entrance. The baptistry was remodeled in 2006. Two {{skylights}} in the ceiling bathe the font in natural light. The font is the original Italian marble baptistry made for the Cathedral. The floor is made of similar marble to that {{which is in the}} sanctuary. An <b>ambry,</b> built in 2004, resides in the baptistry and is made of wood and glass. It contains the oil of the sick, Sacred Chrism, and the oil of the Catechumens, blessed at the Chrism Mass, which is celebrated each Lent in the Cathedral. A statue of the Risen Christ is also present.|$|E
50|$|The church {{consists}} of a nave and chancel with high gables, {{and the remains of}} a bell-gable in the west. The arch leading into the chancel is of particular interest: Carved stones {{on each side of the}} arch show three dogs attacking an otter or fox, and another carving of three men, possibly depicting the Arrest of Jesus. There is a single lancet window and an <b>ambry</b> (recess for storing sacred vessels and vestments) at ground level on the north wall and a surviving lancet and piscina at the east end of the south wall. There is a small bullaun stone in the nave.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} {{addition to the}} building was the south wing, a chapel dedicated to St. Michael, which was probably erected by Abbot Finlay McFead (d. 1485). It is 32 feet long by 23 feet wide and {{is connected to the}} main building by an archway 14 feet wide. On the west side is a doorway; on the east side, an <b>ambry,</b> or recess; on the south side, a canopied monument to Abbot Finlay, which displays the abbot’s shield and the inscription “Hic jacet Finlaius McFaed abbas de Fern qui obit anno MCCCCLXXXV” (Here lies Finlay McFaed, abbot of Fearn, who died in the year 1485.) ...|$|E
50|$|The baptismal font is in {{the center}} of the nave. Made of Brazilian granite, it was {{dedicated}} on June 3, 2001 by Most Rev. Michael J. Sheehan. The eight-sided form represents the 8th day, or Easter, marking God's New Creation through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basin is a cruciform, with three steps representative of the 3 days between Jesus' crucifixion and his resurrection. The rill symbolizes the four Evangelists, who cast their nets to catch men. Its location directly between the doors and the altar is representative of the faith journey. To the south is the <b>Ambry</b> Cabinet, containing the oils used in the sacraments. To the north is the Easter Candle stand.|$|E
50|$|In many Christian churches {{there is}} an altar lamp, {{also known as a}} chancel lamp, which is found in the chancel (sanctuary), either hanging or fixed. In Anglican, Old Catholic and Roman Catholic churches, the chancel lamp burns before a {{tabernacle}} or <b>ambry</b> to demonstrate the belief that Christ is present there through His Real Presence, as the Blessed Sacrament is reserved in these denominations. It is also found in the chancel of Lutheran and Methodist churches to indicate the presence of Christ in the sanctuary, as well as a belief in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. The sanctuary lamp may also be seen in Eastern Orthodox Churches. Other Christian denominations burn the lamp to show that the light of Christ always burns in a sin-darkened world.|$|E
50|$|Major {{renovation}}s {{were made}} to the church in the 1960s and again in the 1990s. During the renovation in the 1960s many of the original furnishings were removed and the interior was plastered with Kalloite. An altar was constructed so the priest could face the congregation, as well as other changes influenced by the liturgical changes brought about by the Second Vatican Council. The roof was recovered with black slate in the 1980s. In the 1990s many of the original furnishings were brought back into the church and repurposed. The gates to the former communion rail were made into table tops. The old sedalia was remade into a presider’s chair. A new ambo, baptismal font and <b>ambry</b> {{were made to}} complement the church’s Gothic design. The seating capacity of the church was reduced to 300.|$|E
50|$|The castle {{stands on}} a {{promontory}} on the Scottish River Tyne, blocking its strategic route, and preying on the route to Edinburgh.Within the 13th century curtain wall is the 14th century keep, to which ranges were added {{in the next two}} centuries. The major remaining works is the West Tower, a square donjon, which dwarfs the remains of the central tower that the Gourlays built, probably a rebuilding on the 16th century. Fifteenth century work includes a roofless chamber in which the remains of what appear to be an <b>ambry</b> and a piscina suggest it was a chapel rather than a hall. There is also a vaulted basement bakehouse and brewhouse from this period. The original tower was used as a dovecot after it ceased to be occupied. Of the East Tower, only a finger of stonework remains.|$|E
50|$|The {{largest and}} most {{imposing}} of the buildings at Glendalough, the cathedral had several phases of construction, the earliest, consisting of the present nave with its antae. The large mica-schist stones which can be seen up to {{the height of the}} square-headed west doorway were re-used from an earlier smaller church. The chancel and sacristy date from the late 12th and early 13th centuries. The chancel arch and east window were finely decorated, though many of the stones are now missing. The north doorway to the nave also dates from this period. Under the southern window of the chancel is an <b>ambry</b> or wall cupboard and a piscina, a basin used for washing the sacred vessels. A few metres south of the cathedral an early cross of local granite, with an unpierced ring, is commonly known as St. Kevin's Cross.|$|E
50|$|In 1335 {{the west}} wing {{extension}} was added along the quayside on Duck Lane, by Hamo de Hethe, by then Bishop of Rochester. He continued to use the house as a summer residence. The west wing is built of roughly squared sandstone rubble with simple Gothic arched windows and a central door which leads, still today, through a stone floored passage that exits in the back garden. The exterior wooden steps were removed and an interior staircase built, from the cellar up {{to the ground and}} first floors. Upon entering the cellar there is an ancient <b>Ambry</b> built into the stone wall, which would have been used for storage objects of a religious nature, holy waters, and the like. The final addition to the house was in 1811, extending the rooms to number sixteen in all. The house remained owned by the church until 1949.|$|E
50|$|To {{celebrate}} the church’s centennial, Rob Thorton {{took on the}} job of remodeling the downstairs chapel. Not wanting to tread on the shoes of Hummel’s original artistry, Thorton worked {{with him on the}} project. He took the plaster off the walls to expose the stone beneath, but kept a section of the wood paneling that Hummel added in 1979. Thorton also added a dome-shaped hole in the ceiling of the chapel. Thorton not only worked on the chapel in the lower level, but on the reception hall as well. He took out the brown carpeting, exposed the stone on the walls, and created more space. The baptismal font was redesigned as a pool and the former font was repurposed as an <b>ambry</b> to hold the holy oils. A reservation altar for the tabernacle was created in the south transept. The canopy was from the former high altar. St John’s received an Orchid Award in 1981 from the Idaho Historic Preservation Council for outstanding work in restoration.|$|E
5000|$|With {{influence}} from Judaism in the Old Testament, God told Moses that a lamp {{filled with the}} pure oil should perpetually burn in the Tabernacle (Ex 27:20-21). This is the precedent for the custom in the Anglican Church and Catholic Church of burning a candle (at all times) before the tabernacle - {{the house where the}} Eucharistic Body of Christ is reserved under lock and key. In Jewish practice, this Altar lamp is known for its Hebrew name, ner tamid (נֵר תָּמִיד). Many Christian churches have at least one lamp continually burning, often before an <b>ambry</b> or tabernacle, not only as an ornament of the altar, but for the purpose of worship. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal in the Catholic Church, for instance, states (in 316): [...] "In accordance with traditional custom, near the tabernacle a special lamp, fueled by oil or wax, should be kept alight to indicate and honor the presence of Christ." ...|$|E
