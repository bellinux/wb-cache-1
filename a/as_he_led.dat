5|$|In 1938, Hutson {{had nine}} {{touchdown}} receptions, again setting the league record, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> the Packers to another NFL Championship Game, this time against the New York Giants. However, {{a knee injury}} he suffered four weeks earlier {{kept him out of}} the game's starting lineup. He entered as a substitute three separate times late in the game but was unable to be a factor, catching no passes as Green Bay was defeated 23–17.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, 1978, Delaney {{carried the}} ball 28 times and gained 299 yards for Northwestern State against Nicholls State University with 263 of the yards {{coming in the}} game's second half. Delaney's rushing stats {{in the second half}} of the game are an NCAA record. In the same game, he scored four touchdowns, one of which was on a 90-yard run, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> his team to a 28–18 victory.|$|E
5|$|With 23 {{goals and}} 44 points in 29 games, Cammalleri led the Wolverines to the CCHA conference {{championship}} in 2001–02. He {{was named a}} CCHA second team all-star and an NCAA first team All-American. At the West Regional tournament, Cammalleri was named both an all-star at forward and {{the most valuable player}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> Michigan back to the Frozen Four.

5|$|Al-Kharrat {{commenced}} guerrilla {{operations in}} September, targeting French forces posted {{in the eastern}} and southern Ghouta. His prominence rose <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> nighttime raids against the French in Damascus, during which he disarmed army patrols and took soldiers hostage. In al-Shaghour, Souk Saruja and Jazmatiyya, al-Kharrat and his band burnt down all French-held buildings. In {{the first week of}} October, sixty French gendarmes were dispatched to the Ghouta to apprehend al-Kharrat and his fighters. The gendarmes were quartered in the home of al-Malihah's mukhtar (village headman). In the evening, the rebels attacked the residence, killing one gendarme and capturing the rest; the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{players have}} captained the team, {{beginning}} with Ed Westfall. Denis Potvin holds {{the record for}} the longest captaincy period, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> the team from 1979 to 1987. The shortest captaincy period was held by Bryan McCabe, who only served for 56 regular season games. There have been two seasons where the Islanders did not have a captain: 1996–97 and 2000–01. The team's current captain is John Tavares, who was appointed on September 9, 2013, succeeding Mark Streit, who was traded during the previous off-season. Streit was the NHL's first team captain from Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|In August Fantastic Light {{recorded}} his first win at Group Two level <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> three furlongs out and ran {{on to win}} a strongly contested Great Voltigeur Stakes from Bienamado (Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes, San Juan Capistrano Handicap, Charles Whittingham Memorial Handicap) and the future St Leger winner Mutafaweq. A month later, he won a third important race by holding off the 1998 Epsom Derby winner High-Rise by {{three quarters of a}} length in the Listed Arc Trial at Newbury.|$|E

5|$|In February 1980, Roberts made a {{remarkable}} {{return to the}} American Grand National Championship for two races at the season opening Houston TT and short-track events held in the Houston Astrodome over two evenings. After {{more than a year}} away from dirt track competitions, Roberts won the Houston TT race to tie Bart Markel's career record of 28 Grand National victories. He followed that the next evening with a third place in the Houston short-track national. Returning to England once again for the 1980 Transatlantic Match races, Roberts was once again the top individual points scorer <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> the American team to victory over the British.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Collingwood led the England Twenty20 {{team to the}} 2010 World Twenty20 championship. Collingwood {{appeared}} in all seven games, struggling with the bat as he scored only 61 runs at 10.16, with the ball he only bowled one over for ten runs, however his prowess in the field continued – his four catches the joint highest with the wicket keeper, Craig Kieswetter, for the England team. It was Collingwood's captaincy that was most praised, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> England to their first ever ICC trophy, hitting the winning runs in their seven-wicket victory over Australia in the final.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{departure}} from Barnet, Hessenthaler was appointed manager of Dover Athletic of the Isthmian League First Division South. In {{his first season}} in charge, he played regularly, making over 30 appearances <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> the team to the championship of the division and promotion to the Isthmian League Premier Division. The following season, he led the team to a second consecutive championship as Dover won the Isthmian League Premier Division title to gain promotion to Conference South. In the 2009–10 season, Dover reached the play-offs for promotion to the Conference National, but lost at the semi-final stage to Woking. Hessenthaler, {{at the age of}} 44, announced his retirement as a player after the match.|$|E

5|$|Success {{finally arrived}} during the 2001–02 season. Arsenal {{finished}} seven points above Liverpool {{to win the}} Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2–0 in the FA Cup Final. Henry became the league's top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> Arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club. There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.|$|E
5|$|Youngblood {{was drafted}} by the Los Angeles Rams {{in the first round}} of the 1971 NFL Draft. He was the 20th overall pick in that draft and signed a 3-year $105,000 {{contract}} including a $30,000 signing bonus. That season, he backed up Deacon Jones at left defensive end and started four games when Jones was sidelined with a severely sprained arch. He was named All-Rookie by Football Digest and after the season Jones was traded to the San Diego Chargers. In 1972, the left defensive end position was Youngblood's <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> the Rams defensive linemen in tackles with 70, and started 11 of the 14 games he played, recording six sacks.|$|E
5|$|Caporusso played from 2007 to 2011 {{with the}} University of Michigan Wolverines team. During the 2008–09 Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey season, {{he was named}} to the All-Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) first team. He was also named first-team AHCA/Reebok Division I Ice Hockey All-American. He led the nation in goals scored for most of the 2008–09 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. During the 2009–10 Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey season, he {{was named to the}} CCHA All-tournament team <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> the team to the championship. Prior to his time at the University of Michigan, he excelled in junior hockey in Ontario, Canada, which earned him a {{position}} as a draftee by the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League before entering college. After finishing his senior season, Caporusso signed with the Senators on May 30, 2011.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{fulfilled}} {{his promise}} to Canadiens' fans <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> Montreal to a Stanley Cup championship in 1955–56. The season began {{with the arrival of}} his young brother Henri to the Canadiens roster. It also marked the return of his former Punch line teammate, Toe Blake, as head coach. Along with general manager Frank Selke, Blake worked with Richard on moderating his temper and responding to the provocation of his opponents by scoring goals rather than engaging in fisticuffs. Richard finished the season with 38 goals and 71 points, second on the team in both respects to Jean Béliveau's 47 goals and 88 points. Richard added 14 points in 10 playoff games as Montreal defeated Detroit to claim the Stanley Cup. He scored the second and ultimately Cup-clinching goal in the fifth and final game, a 3–1 victory.|$|E
5|$|This dip in {{success was}} {{compounded}} when Arsenal failed again to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to Chelsea in the 2004–05 season, although Arsenal did win the FA Cup (the Final of which Henry missed through injury). Henry maintained {{his reputation as}} one of Europe's most feared strikers <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> the league in scoring, and with 31 goals in all competitions, he was the co-recipient (with Diego Forlán) of the European Golden Boot, and is currently the only player to have officially won the award twice in a row (Ally McCoist also had two Golden Boots in a row, but both were deemed unofficial). The unexpected departure of Arsenal's captain Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season led to Henry being awarded club captaincy, a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him; the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders, who are better-placed on the pitch to read the game. Along with being chief goalscorer, he was responsible for leading a very young team which had yet to gel fully.|$|E
5|$|Despite his team's {{exit from}} the finals series, Selwood was {{recognised}} and rewarded for his individual season through several end of season awards. He was named to his fourth overall All-Australian team as the starting ruck rover, and was honoured with the captaincy for the second successive season. He also won his third consecutive, and fourth overall AFLPA Robert Rose Award as the adjudicated most courageous player. In addition, he also placed second for the AFLPA Best Captain Award, eighth overall for the AFLPA Most Valuable Player Award, seventh in voting for the AFL Coaches Association Champion Player of the Year Award, and fourth overall in the Brownlow Medal. Selwood's 21 votes in the 2014 Brownlow Medal count saw him set a new club record for most career polled Brownlow Medal votes by a Geelong player. His total of 137 votes across 8 seasons moved him ahead of Garry Hocking, who had previously held the club record with 133 votes in 15 seasons. His importance to the team throughout the season was demonstrated <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> the team in total disposals (614), tackles (144), clearances (153), and inside 50s (100) while kicking the third most goals (24) and providing the second most goal assists (20). His influence was highlighted as he won the club Coach's Award {{as well as his}} second successive—and third overall—Carji Greeves Medal as the adjudicated club best and fairest player of the year. In doing so he became the seventh player in the club's history to win at least three Carji Greeves Medal's.|$|E
50|$|He {{continued}} {{his career in}} Northern Ireland with then Belfast based Distillery <b>as</b> player/manager <b>he</b> <b>led</b> Distillery to {{the final of the}} Ulster Cup scoring eight goals in the competition before they were beat 3-0 in the final by Glentoran.|$|R
50|$|The Redskins {{purchased}} the Hazleton, Pennsylvania minor league football team, in 1938, and appointed Kahn <b>as</b> player-coach. <b>He</b> <b>led</b> the Hazelton Redskins to the Eastern Pennsylvania League and Dixie Championships before retiring from football {{at the end}} of the season.|$|R

5|$|East India Company and British Army {{casualties}} {{amounted to}} 428 killed, 1138 wounded and 18 missing; {{a total of}} 1,584– {{over a third of}} the force engaged in combat. The 74th and the picket battalion were decimated; from a strength of about 500, the 74th lost ten officers killed and seven wounded, and 124 other ranks killed and 270 wounded. The pickets lost all their officers except their commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Orrock, and had only about 75 men remaining. Of the ten officers forming the general's staff, eight were wounded or had their horses killed. Wellesley himself lost two horses; the first was shot from underneath him and the second was speared <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> the charge to re-capture the Maratha gun line. The number of Maratha casualties is more difficult to ascertain. Despatches from British officers give a figure of 1,200 dead and many more wounded but some modern historians have estimated a total of 6,000 dead and wounded. The Marathas also surrendered seven stands of colours, large amounts of stores and ammunition and 98 cannon– most of which were later taken into service by the East India Company. Although Scindia and Berar's army was not finished as a fighting force, several of Scindia's regular infantry battalions and artillery crews had been destroyed. Their command structure had also been damaged: many of their European officers, including Colonel Pohlmann and Major Dupont, surrendered to the Company– which had offered amnesty to Europeans {{in the service of the}} Maratha armies– or deserted and sought employment with other native chieftains.|$|E
5|$|The club {{failed to}} achieve further league or cup success until the {{appointment}} of former Everton player Howard Kendall in 1981. Kendall initially proved unpopular with the Goodison Park crowd, {{but this was not}} to last <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> Everton to their most successful season ever winning the European Cup Winners' Cup and the First Division in the 198485 season. Following success in the Charity Shield twice and another League championship in 198687, Kendall resigned from Everton to manage Spanish side Athletic Bilbao. He returned for two further spells during the 1990s (1990-1993 & 1997-1998) but without such success. Former Everton player and Oldham Athletic manager Joe Royle was appointed in 1994 following the disastrous reign of Mike Walker (1994 for 10 months) winning the FA Cup in the same season. Injury crises and players such as Andrei Kanchelskis being sold led to Royle's resignation in March 1997. Former Rangers manager, Walter Smith, took the position in August 1998, but he failed to transfer the success he had achieved in Scotland. With three bottom-half finishes in his first three seasons, and facing relegation in the 200102 season, Smith was sacked. He was replaced by fellow Scot David Moyes who led the club back into European football, finishing fifth in the 200607 season. Under Moyes's 11-year managership, the club prospered, qualifying for the Champions League in 2005 and reaching the FA Cup final in 2009. However, the long-awaited trophy that his leadership deserved eluded him. Having stalled on contract renewal discussions, and following the announcement of Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement as manager of Manchester United {{at the end of the}} 2013 season, Moyes succeeded him at Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|Following the All-Star game, Wade {{recorded}} 50 {{points on}} 56.6% shooting and added 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a blow-out loss against the Orlando Magic. Wade became the fourth player in NBA history to score at least 50 points while his team lost {{by at least}} 20 in a game. The following game, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and 7 rebounds in a 103–91 win against the Detroit Pistons. Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring at least 50 points since Wilt Chamberlain did so in 1968. Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record with 24 points in the fourth quarter, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> the Heat back from a 15-point deficit in the final nine minutes of the quarter to secure a 120–115 win over the New York Knicks. For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks. Wade followed the performance with a second consecutive 40-point game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Playing against his Eastern Conference rival and good friend, LeBron James, Wade registered 41 points on 53% shooting, 9 assists, 7 steals, 7 rebounds and one block as the Heat lost 107–100. The following game, in former teammate Shaquille O'Neal's return to Miami since being traded, Wade tied a career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, a steal and a block, as the Heat defeated the Phoenix Suns 135–129. Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with at least 30 points and 15 assists. Less than a week later, Wade tied his franchise record with his 78th consecutive game of scoring in double figures in a double overtime thriller against the Chicago Bulls, in which he scored the game-winning three-point basket to secure a 130–127 win. Wade finished with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wade joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only other player in NBA history to score that many points and have that many assists in a game, while having as high of a field goal percentage. Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning and became the Heat's all-time leading scorer in a triple overtime classic against the Utah Jazz. Wade finished with 50 points, 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals, and 2 blocks in a 140–129 win.|$|E
