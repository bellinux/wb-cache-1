A key feature of our model is that we consider nodes to be heterogeneous in terms of their content, i. e. their general appeal to the public. We find that the equilibrium structure of such a graph matches the empirical structure of the WWW better than that proposed by other models. There is a gen-eral incentive to establish reference link to sites with higher content. Also, higher content sites tend to purchase more <b>advertising</b> <b>links</b> mirroring the Dorfman-Steiner rule. Overall, there is a strong positive correlation between a site’s content and the number of its in-links. Sites with higher content sell less <b>advertising</b> <b>links</b> and offer such links at higher prices, i. e. there seems to be specialization across sites in terms of revenue models. High content sites tend to earns revenue from the sales of content while low content ones from the sales of traffic (<b>advertising</b> <b>links).</b> These results have interesting practi-cal implications with respect to ‘search-engine optimization’, the pricing of Internet advertising and the trade-off between selling traffic versus content.

U. S. interactive marketing forecast, 2007 to 2012. Forrester Research (October 10) ], approaching half the level of television advertising and making sponsored search one of the major advertising trends to affect the marketing landscape. Yet little empirical research exists to explore how the interaction of various agents (searchers, advertisers, and the search engine) in keyword markets affects consumer welfare and firm profits. The dynamic structural model we propose serves as a foundation to explore these outcomes. We fit this model to a proprietary data set provided by an anonymous search engine. These data include consumer search and clicking behavior, advertiser bidding behavior, and search engine information such as keyword pricing and website design. With respect to advertisers, we find evidence of dynamic bidding behavior. Advertiser value for clicks on their links averages about 26 cents. Given the typical $ 22 retail price of the software products advertised on the considered search engine, this implies a conversion rate (sales per click) of about 1. 2 %, well within common estimates of 1 %- 2 % [Narcisse, E. 2007.

This also improves advertiser revenue by 6 % and consumer welfare by 1. 6 %. Second, we find that a switch from a first- to second-price auction results in truth telling (advertiser bids rise to advertiser valuations).

40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes that}} a construct called Sponsorship Linked Advertising (SLA) is valuable in understanding how brand and corporate <b>advertising</b> <b>link</b> to sponsorship and event marketing. SLA includes both ads that communicate {{a link to}} a sponsored event (tiedness) and those that demonstrate, through their overall design, an event’s motif or theme (themedness). In its themed form, SLA differs from creative advertising {{by virtue of the}} fact that creative advertising can exist independent of any sponsorship link, whereas sponsorship linked advertisements intentionally unite a sponsorship and an event either implicitly and/or explicitly. With sponsorship investment estimated to be $ 45. 2 billion worldwide (International Events Group 2009) and leverage advertising (i. e., advertising that is employed to heighten awareness of sponsorships or better articulate sponsor-event links) reflecting a similar amount, empirical examination, validation and implementation guidance of SLA as a leveraging strategy is critical. The unique marketing opportunities associated with popular sporting, charitable and arts events also attract non-sponsoring companies which also seek to affiliate with the event, an activity known as ambushing (McKelvey and Grady 2008). Examination of SLA is therefore important in an increasingly competitive and cluttered global sponsorship arena, in which ambushing is becoming a pervasive practice, attracting considerable attention from event organisers, sponsors and policy makers alike, while also detracting from or diluting intended sponsorship communications. Despite widespread use of SLA, no empirical validation of this strategy has been undertaken to date. The present research addresses this gap. Initially, the SLA construct is defined, categorised, and measured through content analysis, then a series of experimental studies are used to achieve empirical validation of the SLA construct. Streams of sponsorship and advertising effectiveness research, along with theories of associative learning, attribution and persuasion, are used to guide examination of SLA effectiveness in new empirical work. Specifically, a series of experiments are used to examine consumers’ cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to SLA. The first experimental study tests a main effect of ad type as well as interactive effects of tiedness and themedness with sponsorship availability (i. e., knowledge of true sponsor) on outcomes including nature and type of thoughts elicited, ad scepticism and sponsor motive attributions. Findings from this study suggest that SLA exposure induces more positive thoughts, less ad scepticism and more favourable attributions than exposure to Non SLA. These results provide initial evidence that consumers process SLA differently to other ad types and interestingly, may derive enjoyment from, or at least exhibit less ad scepticism towards viewing SLA. Finally, the influence of competitive context on sponsor recall is tested by simulating exposure to ambush and/or SLA ad types following a sponsorship announcement. Findings provide evidence to support a memory interference hypothesis and imply that accuracy of sponsor recall is diminished by presence of an ambush ad, but that this effect is moderated by presence of SLA leveraging a previously announced sponsorship. Taken together, the results of this series of studies provide an empirical measurement of SLA strategy and demonstrate construct validity. Further, interpretation of the results gives rise to specific creative strategies for practical implementation. Ecological validity is built into the design by using real events within ad stimuli and investigating SLA in the competitive context in which it occurs. Hence, the results are said to be generalisable to real-world situations, and the resultant creative strategies are arguably contextually valid. This research contributes to existing marketing and sponsorship literature by proposing and empirically validating a new construct. Theoretically, it examines consumer response to SLA by combining information processing and resistance based perspectives. It extends traditional views of ambushing by offering empirical evidence of the practice being widespread and extending to low level sponsors and event “free riders”. Practical implications of this research extend to advertisers and sponsors faced with the challenge of effectively leveraging huge sponsorship investments and assessing return on such investment. Empirical testing of ambushing effects has important implications for the debate on increased regulatory intervention of such practices, a debate centred upon tension between balancing fair marketing practice with the rights of sponsors and event organisers...|$|E
40|$|Central to the {{explosive}} growth of the Internet has been the desire of dispersed buyers and sellers to interact readily and in a manner hitherto impossible. Underpinning these interactions, auction pricing mechanisms have enabled Internet transactions in novel ways. Despite this massive growth and new medium, empirical work in marketing and economics on auction use in Internet contexts remains relatively nascent. Accordingly, this dissertation investigates the role of online auctions; it is composed of three essays. The first essay, ``Online Auction Demand,'' investigates seller and buyer interactions via online auction websites, such as eBay. Such auction sites are among the earliest prominent transaction sites on the Internet (eBay started in 1995, the same year Internet Explorer was released) and helped {{pave the way for}} e-commerce. Hence, online auction demand is the first topic considered in my dissertation. The second essay, ``A Dynamic Model of Sponsored Search Advertising,'' investigates sponsored search advertising auctions, a novel approach that allocates premium advertising space to advertisers at popular websites, such as search engines. Because sponsored search advertising targets buyers in active purchase states, such advertising venues have grown very rapidly in recent years and have become a highly topical research domain. These two essays form the foundation of the empirical research in this dissertation. The third essay, ``Sponsored Search Auctions: Research Opportunities in Marketing,'' outlines areas of future inquiry that I intend to pursue in my research. Of note, the problems underpinning the two empirical essays exhibits a common form, that of a two-sided network wherein two parties interact on a common platform (Rochet and Tirole, 2006). Although theoretical research on two-sided markets is abundant, this dissertation focuses on their use in e-commerce and adopts an empirical orientation. I assume an empirical orientation because I seek to guide firm behavior with concrete policy recommendations and offer new insights into the actual behavior of the agents who interact in these contexts. Although the two empirical essays share this common feature, they also exhibit notable differences, including the nature of the auction mechanism itself, the interactions between the agents, and the dynamic frame of the problem, thus making the problems distinct. The following abstracts for these two essays as well as the chapter that describes my future research serve to summarize these contributions, commonalities and differences. Online Auction Demand With $ 40 B in annual gross merchandise volume, electronic auctions comprise a substantial and growing sector of the retail economy. For example, eBay alone generated a gross merchandise volume of $ 14. 4 B during the fourth quarter of 2006. Concurrent with this growth has been an attendant increase in empirical research on Internet auctions. However, this literature focuses primarily on the bidder; I extend this research to consider both seller and bidder behavior in an integrated system within a two-sided network of the two parties. This extension of the existing literature enables an exploration of the implications of the auction house's marketing on its revenues as well as the nature of bidder and seller interactions on this platform. In the first essay, I use a unique data set of Celtic coins online auctions. These data were obtained from an anonymous firm and include complete bidding and listing histories. In contrast, most existing research relies only on the observed website bids. The complete bidding and listing histories provided by the data afford additional information that illuminates the insights into bidder and seller behavior such as bidder valuations and seller costs. Using these data from the ancient coins category, I estimate a structural model that integrates both bidder and seller behavior. Bidders choose coins and sellers list them to maximize their respective profits. I then develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation approach that enables me, via data augmentation, to infer unobserved bidder and seller characteristics and to account for heterogeneity in these characteristics. My findings indicate that: i) bidder valuations are affected by item characteristics (e. g., the attributes of the coin), seller (e. g. reputation), and auction characteristics (e. g., the characteristics of the listing); ii) bidder costs are affected by bidding behavior, such as the recency of the last purchase and the number of concurrent auctions; and iii) seller costs are affected by item characteristics and the number of concurrent listings from the seller (because acquisition costs evidence increasing marginal values). Of special interest, the model enables me to compute fee elasticities, even though no variation in historical fees exists in these data. I compute fee elasticities by inferring the role of seller costs in their historical listing decision and then imputing how an increase in these costs (which arises from more fees) would affect the seller's subsequent listing behavior. I find that these implied commission elasticities exceed per-item fee elasticities because commissions target high value sellers, and hence, commission reductions enhance their listing likelihood. By targeting commission reductions to high value sellers, auction house revenues can be increased by 3. 9 %. Computing customer value, I find that attrition of the largest seller would decrease fees paid to the auction house by $ 97. Given that the seller paid $ 127 in fees, competition offsets only 24 % of the fees paid by the seller. In contrast, competition largely in the form of other bidders offsets 81 % of the $ 26 loss from buyer attrition. In both events, the auction house would overvalue its customers by neglecting the effects of competition. A Dynamic Model of Sponsored Search Advertising Sponsored search advertising is ascendant. Jupiter Research reports that expenditures rose 28 % in 2007 to $ 8. 9 B and will continue to rise at a 26 % Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), approaching half the level of television advertising and making sponsored search advertising one of the major advertising trends affecting the marketing landscape. Although empirical studies of sponsored search advertising are ascending, little research exists that explores how the interactions of various agents (searchers, advertisers, and the search engine) in keyword markets affect searcher and advertiser behavior, welfare and search engine profits. As in the first essay, sponsored search constitutes a two-sided network. In this case, bidders (advertisers) and searchers interact on a common platform, the search engine. The bidder seeks to maximize profits, and the searcher seeks to maximize utility. The structural model I propose serves as a foundation to explore these outcomes and, to my knowledge, is the first structural model for keyword search. Not only does the model integrate the behavior of advertisers and searchers, it also accounts for advertisers competition in a dynamic setting. Prior theoretical research has assumed a static orientation to the problem whereas prior empirical research, although dynamic, has focused solely on estimating the dynamic sales response to a single firm's keyword advertising expenditures. To estimate the proposed model, I have developed a two-step Bayesian estimator for dynamic games. This approach does not rely on asymptotics and also facilitates a more flexible model specification. I fit this model to a proprietary data set provided by an anonymous search engine. These data include a complete history of consumer search behavior from the site's web log files and a complete history of advertiser bidding behavior across all advertisers. In addition, the data include search engine information, such as keyword pricing and website design. With respect to advertisers, I find evidence of dynamic bidding behavior. Advertiser valuation for clicks on their sponsored links averages about $ 0. 27. Given the typical $ 22 retail price of the software products advertised on the considered search engine, this figure implies a conversion rate (sales per click) of about 1. 2 %, well within common estimates of 1 - 2 % (gamedaily. com). With respect to consumers, I find that frequent clickers place a greater emphasis on the position of the sponsored <b>advertising</b> <b>link.</b> I further find that 10 % of consumers perform 90 % of the clicks. I then conduct several policy simulations to illustrate the effects of change in search engine policy. First, I find that the search engine obtains revenue gains of nearly 1. 4 % by sharing individual level information with advertisers and enabling them to vary their bids by consumer segment. This strategy also improves advertiser profits by 11 % and consumer welfare by 2. 9 %. Second, I find that a switch from a first to second price auction results in truth telling (advertiser bids rise to advertiser valuations), which is consistent with economic theory. However, the second price auction has little impact on search engine profits. Third, consumer search tools lead to a platform revenue increase of 3. 7 % and an increase of consumer welfare of 5. 6 %. However, these tools, by reducing advertising exposure, lower advertiser profits by 4. 1 %. Sponsored Search Auctions: Research Opportunities in Marketing In the final chapter, I systematically review the literature on keyword search and propose several promising research directions. The chapter is organized according to each agent in the search process, i. e., searchers, advertisers and the search engine, and reviews the key research issues for each. For each group, I outline the decision process involved in keyword search. For searchers, this process involves what to search, where to search, which results to click, and when to exit the search. For advertisers, this process involves where to bid, which word or words to bid on, how much to bid, and how searchers and auction mechanisms moderate these behaviors. The search engine faces choices on mechanism design, website design, and how much information to share with its advertisers and searchers. These choices have implications for customer lifetime value and the nature of competition among advertisers. Overall, I provide a number of potential areas of future research that arise from the decision processes of these various agents. Foremost among these potential areas of future research are i) the role of alternative consumer search strategies for information acquisition and clicking behavior, ii) the effect of advertiser placement alternatives on long-term profits, and iii) the measure of customer lifetime value for search engines. Regarding the first area, a consumer's search strategy (i. e., sequential search and non-sequential search) affects which sponsored links {{are more likely to be}} clicked. The search pattern of a consumer is likely to be affected by the nature of the product (experience product vs. search product), the design of the website, the dynamic orientation of the consumer (e. g., myopic or forward-looking), and so on. This search pattern will, in turn, affect advertisers payments, online traffic, sales, as well as the search engine's revenue. With respect to the second area, advertisers must ascertain the economic value of advertising, conditioned on the slot in which it appears, before making decisions such as which keywords to bid on and how much to bid. This area of possible research suggests opportunities to examine how advertising click-through and the number of impressions differentially affect the value of appearing in a particular sponsored slot on a webpage, and how this value is moderated by an appearance in a non-sponsored slot (i. e., a slot in the organic search results section). With respect to the third area of future research, customer value is central to the profitability and long-term growth of a search engine and affects how the firm should allocate resources for customer acquisition and retention. Organization This dissertation is organized as follows. After this brief introduction, the essay, ``Online Auction Demand,'' serves as a basis that introduces some concepts of auctions as two-sided markets. Next, the second essay, ``A Dynamic Model of Sponsored Search Advertising,'' extends the first essay by considering a richer context of bidder competition and consumer choice behavior. Finally, the concluding chapter, which outlines my future research interests, considers potential extensions that pertain especially to sponsored search advertising. Dissertatio...|$|E

As such, there seems to be specialization across sites in revenue models: high content sites tend to earn revenue from the sales of content while low content ones from the sales of traffic (advertising). In an extension, we also allow sites to establish (reference) out-links to each other and find that there is a general tendency to establish reference link to sites with higher content. Finally, we explore network formation in the presence of search engines and find that the higher the proportion of people using these, the more sites have an incentive to specialize in certain “con-tent areas”.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a general objective function, which incorporates competitive situations, such as conservative, punitive, and predatory <b>advertising.</b> <b>Linking</b> together the particular situations into a two-parameter family of max–min problems, {{and using the}} Lanchester model to describe {{the dynamics of the}} market, a bilinear-quadratic differential game is obtained. For this game, we find saddle-point feedback time-invariant advertising strategies and show when these strategies are Nash equilibrium strategies. In an empirical application involving duopolistic competition in the cola market, we find evidence of a punitive motivation for the advertising strategies...|$|R

Gramble publishes and/or hosts games instead of licensing them - meaning developers maintain full rights to their games. Developers also keep all in-game monetization and 70% of site-based <b>advertising</b> <b>linked</b> to their game. (A portion of the remaining goes to the Gramble Foundation for charitable distribution.) Gramble also offers monetization solutions to developers {{who do not have}} their own.|$|R

While the Court found that 1-800 Contacts case is distinguishable from the current case, it concluded that the conduct is protected as a nominative fair use {{even if it was}} actually a use of the trademark. The reason is simply that eBay's use of the TIFFANY Marks in sponsored links is effectively identical to that on its own website, and thus the same conclusions can be made.|$|R

5000|$|A {{click farm}} {{is a form}} of click fraud, where a large group of low-paid workers are hired to click on paid <b>advertising</b> <b>links</b> for the click {{fraudster}} (click farm master or click farmer). The workers click the links, surf the target website for a period of time, and possibly sign up for newsletters prior to clicking another link. For many of these workers, clicking on enough ads per day may increase their revenue substantially and may also be an alternative to other types of work. It is extremely difficult for an automated filter to detect this simulated traffic as fake because the visitor behavior appears exactly {{the same as that of}} an actual legitimate visitor.|$|R
