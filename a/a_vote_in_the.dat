5|$|In May 1923 the Conservative prime minister, Bonar Law, {{resigned}} {{for health}} reasons. In December his successor, Stanley Baldwin, called another election {{in which the}} Conservatives lost their majority, with Labour in a strong second place. King George V advised Baldwin, {{as leader of the}} largest party, not to resign his office until defeated by <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton {{appointed}} 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84percent of his nominees were confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{issuance}} of the Churchill White Paper in June 1922, the House of Lords rejected a Palestine Mandate that incorporated the Balfour Declaration by 60 votes to 25, following a motion issued by Lord Islington. The vote proved to be only symbolic as it was subsequently overruled by <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons following a tactical pivot and variety of promises made by Churchill.|$|E

5|$|From 2017-18 onwards, the £9,000 fee cap {{will rise}} with inflation. Maintenance grants are also {{available}} to current students in England, although these are scheduled to cease with the 2016-17 academic year. Maintenance loans are available for living costs, and these are means tested. These loans are scheduled to increase in size for 2016-17, when the maintenance grant system is phased out. There will be <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autumn to consider a further increase effective with the 2017-18 year. Several universities have already advertised fees of £9,250 for the year in anticipation of such a vote passing.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphians {{saw three}} ballot {{questions}} in the primary election, all of which involved allowing the city to borrow money. The loans, on the ballot at Clark's urging, were designed to allow the city to temporarily increase spending without raising taxes, and were opposed by many ward leaders in both parties. As a result, they went down to unexpected defeat by a 3:2 margin. Undeterred, Clark and his allies revised and relisted the loans for <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general election in November, which would see better turnout and, they believed, {{a better chance of}} success.|$|E
5|$|Rhodri Morgan, Assembly Member (AM) {{replaced}} Alun Michael AM, {{to become}} the First Secretary (now known as the First Minister) of the National Assembly on 15 February 2000. On 22 March, Morgan stopped all work on the project {{to carry out a}} complete review. The decision to stop the project was supported by <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Assembly on 6 April 2000. The review included the costs and construction risks of the new building, the timetable for the completion of the project and consideration of possible alternatives to the new building.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} a variety of campaigns in other states to select a state dog. Georgia was {{undecided}} over choosing a state dog in 1991, with {{an attempt to make}} the Golden Retriever the official dog failing after <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Georgia State Senate; an opposing campaign promoted the Bulldog, the mascot of the University of Georgia. The campaign to make the Siberian Husky the Washington state dog failed in the Washington House of Representatives in 2004.|$|E
5|$|On 20 December 1920, the Labor Party Premier, James Dooley, and {{his cabinet}} {{resigned}} after having lost <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New South Wales Legislative Assembly a week before. The Governor, Sir Walter Davidson, then commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Sir George Fuller, as Premier. As Fuller {{did not have}} a majority, he initiated attempts to form a coalition with the Progressive Party. The Progressives split over whether to join the Fuller government into an urban wing, led by Leader Walter Wearne and Deputy Leader Thomas Bavin, which agreed to enter Fuller's coalition and a rural wing ("The True Blues"), led by Bruxner and Ernest Buttenshaw who offered Fuller only conditional support. After seven hours in government, still without a workable majority, Fuller requested a double-dissolution from Davidson. Davidson refused, on the basis that Dooley still had a majority in the lower house, and Fuller resigned.|$|E
5|$|The casino {{legislation}} was not called to <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Democratic controlled Kentucky House of Representatives, where 60 votes out of 100 {{would have been}} required for passage. Beshear announced that his proposal {{for a constitutional amendment}} to allow for casinos was dead for the regular session on March 27, 2008. Among the other proposals favored by Beshear that failed to pass in the session were an ethics reform measure Beshear proposed {{in the wake of the}} investigation of the Fletcher administration, a plan to reduce the projected shortfall in the state's pension system, and a proposed 70-cent-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. Besides the state budget, major legislation passed during the session included incentives for homeowners and businesses to utilize energy efficiency measures, anti-bullying legislation, and increased penalties for animal cruelty.|$|E

5|$|The {{rift between}} Williams and Patton became {{permanent}} during negotiations {{over the state}} budget in 1999. Patton proposed to Williams a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1cent of every 7 dedicated to counties with the most unpaved roads – usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams {{told him he had}} 10votes in the Senate for the increase. But gas prices spiked before the measure came to <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate, and Williams failed to deliver his votes after the House passed the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton's budget with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.|$|E
5|$|To achieve full {{political}} control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler's government brought the Ermächtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) to <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newly elected Reichstag. The Act—officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich ("Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich")—gave Hitler's cabinet {{the power to}} enact laws {{without the consent of}} the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution. Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election) and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.|$|E

5000|$|Amending the {{constitution}} is a complex process. Initial approval of an amendment (or [...] "reform") requires only <b>a</b> majority <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Legislative Assembly.
