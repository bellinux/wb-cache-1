40|$|This report {{covers a}} {{feasibility}} study for <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> power project in Sri Lanka. Three potential sites for <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> farm are presented, {{out of which}} the Ambewela Cattle Farm is chosen as the most suitable. Limitations of <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> farm at the site, due to properties of the electrical grid and logistical issues, are examined and costs related to installing the wind farm are estimated. The maximum capacity of <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> farm is calculated to 45 MW. The payback period of the wind farm is calculated to 4. 4 years. Environmental benefits of the wind farm are estimated in terms of avoided CO 2 -emissions, which are calculated to 76 000 metric tonnes per year. The study concludes that <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> power project at the chosen site should be technically and financially feasible, if <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> turbine that matches certain logistical criteria can be found. ...|$|R

5|$|At Tupper Lake, {{the route}} serves {{a cluster of}} {{recreational}} buildings at its intersection with Warren Point Road, a private drive leading to Warren Point. Here, NY421 turns southward, running along the lake shore to nearby Paradise Point Road, which leads east to Paradise Point and the lakeside Veterans' Mountain Camp. After Paradise Point Road, the highway follows <b>a</b> <b>winding,</b> southeasterly course along Tupper Lake, passing little more than dense forests while crossing over the Bog River near its mouth. NY421 follows the lake to its southern tip, where the route ends at an intersection with NY30 {{just west of the}} St. LawrenceFranklin county line.|$|E
40|$|We study whether <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> {{augmented}} {{wind turbine}} is effective {{for improving the}} efficiency of wind turbines or not. An augmentation device creases mass flow rate through <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> turbine, {{and the power of}} <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> augmented wind turbine becomes large. On the other hand, the augmentation device makes the size of <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> turbine increase. So, improving the efficiency depends on the rate of increased power and size. Some conditions on improving the efficiency are given. In order to make an augmentation device short, we propose a two-flow model for <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> augmented wind turbine. Experimental results for the <b>wind</b> turbine with <b>a</b> short augmentation device, which is called Wind Lens Wind Turbine, show that the wind augmented wind turbine is effective for improving the efficiency...|$|R

5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E
5|$|One major {{challenge}} was {{the approach to}} the museum. The Japanese team proposed <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80percent of the building underground.|$|E

He established <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> path, known as Capability Brown path, through the park and planted deciduous trees in key places to frame the house and castle. The deer park contains notable herds of rare White Park cattle and fallow deer. A small garden behind the house, overlooking the deer park, Moorish in style with a central fountain, has been restored to its former glory. Brown's beech clumps survive in the present day.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> power station, the {{situation}} is more complex. The alternator of <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> turbine is normally specified to match the strongest wind in which the turbine is designed to operate. This is {{because most of the}} cost of <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> turbine is in the rotor and the tower and bearings that support it, rather than in the alternator. It makes no economic sense to restrict the size of the alternator to anything less than the maximum that the rotor will deliver. However, this means that, unlike a conventional power station, <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> turbine rarely achieves its maximum rated output while operating.|$|R

At the south end in Rockfish Gap it connects to the northern terminus of the Blue Ridge Parkway, a free-access road that continues southward along the Blue Ridge Mountains. On {{the west side of}} the drive, mileposts are present. They are numbered from 0 to 105 (north to south) and serve as reference points to directions in the drive. There are 75 overlooks throughout the drive, providing views of the Shenandoah Valley to the west and the Piedmont to the east.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder is a {{canalisation}} of the River Calder from Wakefield to Castleford, {{where it}} joins the branch from Leeds, which follows the River Aire. The Aire continues to flow eastwards to Bank Dole Junction, then {{continues in a}} north-easterly direction to Haddlesey, from where it follows <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> course to join the River Ouse at Airmyn. The section below Haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation, as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river. Instead, the Selby Canal flows northwards from Haddlesey to the Ouse at Selby. Below Dole Bank Junction, the Knottingley and Goole Canal flows eastards to join the Ouse at Goole. From just before Newbridge, where the modern A614 road crosses the waterway, this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the Dutch River, an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by Cornelius Vermuyden's original diversion of the River Don northwards to the River Aire in 1628.|$|E
5|$|The {{eleventh}} {{stage was}} contested in rainy conditions on <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> course. After an unsuccessful breakaway attempt by fifteen riders, Maximilian Sciandri, LeMond, and Michele Coppolillo attacked {{and formed a}} group off the front. Sciandri and LeMond crossed the line in first and second, respectively, while Coppolillo was caught by the peloton in the closing meters of the stage. The next day saw the race's first mountain-top finish, to Monviso. The group of main contenders reached the final climb together, with 's Jean-François Bernard launching the first attack which saw him gain a maximum advantage of around thirty seconds. The next to make a serious effort was Lejarreta, who was followed by Chioccioli, Massimiliano Lelli, and Sierra, who attacked with ten kilometers left in the stage. The trio caught up to Bernard and rode as a group to the finish. Lelli took the stage as Chioccioli defended his lead. Bugno lost almost two minutes during the day.|$|E
