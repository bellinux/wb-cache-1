5|$|After modern Romania {{was formed}} in 1859 through the union of Wallachia and the rump of Moldavia, the {{administrative}} division was modernized using the French administrative system as a model, with județ <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> administrative unit. Aside from the 1950–1968 period, this system has remained in place until today. Since 1864, for each județ there exists a prefect, a subordinate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and representative of the government inside the county; {{he is also the}} head of local administration for areas not delegated to local authorities. Until 1948, each județ was further divided into several plăși, each administered by a pretor.|$|E
5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers researched the history of physics. Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations and implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> status of scientific knowledge in physics.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, {{mainframe}} {{computers and}} minicomputers were present in many academic research institutions and large companies such as Bell Labs. While the commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point in the early history of video games and would not until the early 1970s, programmers at these companies created several small games to be played on their mainframe computers. Most of these spread only to other users of the same type of computer and therefore did not persist as older computer models were discontinued; several, however, inspired future games, or were later released in modified versions on more modern systems or languages. These early mainframe games were largely created between 1968 and 1971; while earlier games were created they were limited to small, academic audiences. Mainframe games also continued to be developed through the 1970s, but the rise of the commercial video game industry, focused on arcade video games and home video game consoles, followed by the rise of personal computers later in the decade, meant that beginning in the 1970s the audience and developers of video games began to shift away from mainframe computers or minicomputers, and the spread of general-purpose programming languages such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>BASIC</b> programming language meant that later mainframe games could generally be run on personal computers with minimal changes, even if initially developed on a mainframe.|$|E
5|$|Coastal troop deployments, {{comprising}} five {{companies of}} infantry, were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called Widerstandsnester ("resistance nests"), numbered WN-60 {{in the east}} to WN-74 near Vierville in the west, located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire. Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels. As well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> weaponry of rifles and machine guns, more than 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints. The heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes. A further 18 anti-tank guns completed the disposition of artillery targeting the beach. Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches, rifle pits, and 85 machine-gun emplacements. No area of the beach was left uncovered, and the disposition of weapons meant that flanking fire could {{be brought to bear}} anywhere along the beach.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, Flint Castle was {{assigned}} to Escort Group B3, which protected convoys sailing between St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and Britain. The ship was refitted in Cardiff, Wales, in January–March 1945 and rejoined her group in Liverpool in April. She {{was assigned}} to Rosyth Command in June as an anti-submarine training ship and visited ports in Norway and Germany {{over the next several}} months. Flint Castle was transferred to the Rosyth Escort Force in June 1946, which was employed as a training unit; it was redesignated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Basic</b> Anti-Submarine Training Flotilla in September. The unit was then transferred to Portland and used a variety of names before settling on the Second Training Squadron in January 1952. On 15 June 1953, she took part in the Fleet Review held at Spithead to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The ship was used to portray a German anti-submarine vessel in the 1955 film The Cockleshell Heroes.|$|E
5|$|The Corpus Juris Civilis {{remained}} {{the basis of}} Byzantine law until {{the publication of the}} Ecloga legum in 741 by Emperor Leo III and his son and co-regent Constantine V. The Ecloga was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with Christian values. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in Slavic, Armenian and Arabic. Emperor Basil I, who ruled in the 9th century, issued the Prochiron and the Epanagoge, which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the Ecloga and restoring the Justinian laws. The Prochiron served {{as the basis for the}} legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, Saint Sava. His legal compilation was intended for the Serbian church but the influential work was adopted <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches. Around 900, Emperor Leo VI commissioned the Basilica, a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} uses of diamonds today are as gemstones used for adornment, a use which dates back into antiquity, and as industrial abrasives for cutting hard materials. The dispersion of white light into spectral colors {{is the primary}} gemological characteristic of gem diamonds. In the 20th century, experts in gemology developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the four Cs, are now commonly used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> descriptors of diamonds: these are carat (its weight), cut (quality of the cut is graded according to proportions, symmetry and polish), color (how close to white or colorless; for fancy diamonds how intense is its hue), and clarity (how free is it from inclusions).
