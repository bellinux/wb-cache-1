5|$|About half <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years ago, {{the newly}} {{captured}} star began {{to expand into}} a red giant (see stellar evolution).|$|E
5|$|Even {{before it}} becomes a red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years until it is over two hundred times larger than today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{has also}} {{purchased}} several stakes valued {{at more than}} <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> dollars. It obtained an 11.5% stake in Comcast for $1 billion, a 22.98% stake in Telewest Communications for $2.263 billion, and a 3% stake in AT Inc. for $5 billion. Among Microsoft's divestments, in which parts of the company are sold to another company, only Expedia, Inc. was sold for more than <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> dollars; USA Networks purchased the company on February 5, 2002 for $1.372 billion.|$|E

5|$|A {{few minutes}} into the expansion, when the {{temperature}} was about <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> (one thousand million) kelvin and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{prominent}} families in the asteroid belt (in order of increasing semi-major axes) are the Flora, Eunoma, Koronis, Eos, and Themis families. The Flora family, one of the largest with more than 800 known members, may have formed from a collision less than <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{effective}} surface temperature of IK Pegasi B {{is estimated to}} be about , making it a strong source of ultraviolet radiation. Under normal conditions this white dwarf would continue to cool for more than <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years, while its radius would remain essentially unchanged.|$|E
5|$|The first {{form of life}} {{to develop}} on the Earth were microbes, and they {{remained}} the only form of life until about <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear. Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see. They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.|$|E

5|$|Triton's {{eccentric}} post-capture orbit {{would have}} {{also resulted in}} tidal heating of its interior, which could have kept Triton fluid for <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years; this inference is supported by evidence of differentiation in Triton's interior. This source of internal heat disappeared following tidal locking and circularization of the orbit.|$|E
5|$|After the {{decentralization}} {{of political}} power in late antiquity, Latin developed locally in the Western provinces into branches that became the Romance languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian. In the early 21st century, {{the first or second}} language of more than <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> people derived from Latin. Latin itself remained an international medium of expression for diplomacy and for intellectual developments identified with Renaissance humanism up to the 17th century, and for law and the Roman Catholic Church to the present.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{was long}} {{considered}} the element {{with the highest}} atomic mass that is stable. However, in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life more than <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> times the estimated age of the universe. Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes.|$|E

5|$|Detailed {{observations}} of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are {{in agreement with the}} current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.|$|E
5|$|Florida State University receives, in {{addition}} to state funding, financial support from the Florida State University Foundation, an organization which exists solely to manage gifts and donations to the university. The Foundation manages the university's endowment, currently amounting to well over half <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> dollars. The endowment helps provide scholarships to students of the university, support for long-term university goals and for other specific purposes as designated by the various donors.|$|E
5|$|Haumea has an {{orbital period}} of 284 Earth years, a {{perihelion}} of 35 AU, and an orbital inclination of 28°. It passed aphelion in early 1992, {{and is currently}} more than 50 AU from the Sun. Haumea's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity {{than that of the}} other members of its collisional family. This is thought to be due to Haumea's weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit over the course of <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years, through the Kozai effect, which allows the exchange of an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.|$|E
50|$|Lockheed Martin {{divested}} {{a portion}} of its IS&GS business to Leidos in <b>a</b> $5 <b>billion</b> transaction in early 2016, which included <b>a</b> $1.8 <b>billion</b> one-time special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin shareholders received 50.5% equity in Leidos.|$|R

5|$|Highly {{energetic}} {{chemistry is}} thought to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago, and half <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years later the last common ancestor of all life existed. The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions. The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{an expert}} system called XCON was {{completed}} at CMU for the Digital Equipment Corporation. It {{was an enormous}} success: it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986. Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> dollars on AI, most of it to in-house AI departments. An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion.|$|E
5|$|Plasticity: The synapses between {{parallel}} {{fibers and}} Purkinje cells, and the synapses between mossy fibers and deep nuclear cells, are both susceptible to modification of their strength. In a single cerebellar module, input from {{as many as}} <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> parallel fibers converges onto a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells, {{and the influence of}} each parallel fiber on those nuclear cells is adjustable. This arrangement gives tremendous flexibility for fine-tuning the relationship between the cerebellar inputs and outputs.|$|E
