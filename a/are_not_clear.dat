5|$|At {{the time}} of the Spanish Conquest, the main Mam {{population}} was situated in Xinabahul (also spelled Chinabjul), now the city of Huehuetenango. They retreated to Zaculeu as a refuge during the Spanish attacks because of its fortifications. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 120 soldiers, and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies. The city was defended by Kayb'il B'alam commanding some 5,000 people (the chronicles <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> if this is the number of soldiers or the total population of Zaculeu).|$|E

5|$|For {{most of her}} career, U-16 {{operated}} in the Adriatic out of Kotor patrolling off the Albanian coast. The U-boat sank one small sailing ship in November and seized another in December. U-16 carried Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an observer while performing diving tests after engine repairs in January 1916. A water leak in March flooded U-16s batteries and put the U-boat out of action for about six weeks of repairs. While operating off Vlorë in mid-October 1916, U-16 sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort. U-16 was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> on the exact cause of her sinking. In all U-16 sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 711. She was the only U-10-class submarine sunk during the war.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear.</b> Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} year Yaropolk returned and reportedly came to an agreement with Vladimir Monomakh, but nothing specific is known of the terms other than Yaropolk being reinstated. In 1087, Yaropolk was murdered. The circumstances of his murder <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear,</b> but the Primary Chronicle suggested the complicity of Riurik Rostislavich, Prince of Peremyshl, and his brother Vasilko Rostislavich, Prince of Terebovl. His murderer was a man called Neradets, who put a sword through Yaropolk before fleeing to hide with Riurik in Peremyshl; the date given is November 22, 1087. His body was taken to Kiev and buried in the church of St Peter, the church which Yaropolk himself had endowed.|$|E

5|$|On March 11, a {{day before}} Austria was annexed into Greater Germany {{following}} the Anschluss, Justas Lukoševičius, a Lithuanian border patrol, shot Stanisław Serafin, a Polish soldier, on the demarcation line {{in the village of}} Trasninkai near Merkinė. The exact circumstances <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> as the obscure event was variously portrayed as a Lithuanian provocation, a Polish provocation, or as an unfortunate accident. During the 1920s and 1930s, similar incidents had occurred: between 1927 and 1937 seven Lithuanian border guards were killed during the course of 78 events. Usually, such incidents were handled at the local level in an attempt to forestall escalation. On this occasion, however, Polish radio and newspapers picked up the story and fanned anti-Lithuanian sentiment. Protests were held in Warsaw, Vilnius, and four other cities where the crowds shouted for military action against Lithuania. There is evidence that the Camp of National Unity was involved in organizing the protests.|$|E
5|$|Records from 1985 <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> {{on which}} trios teams {{participated in the}} tournament to {{determine}} the first ever Mexican National Trios Championship, only a few matches were clearly identified {{as part of the}} tournament, the earliest of which was a January 25, 1985 match in Arena Coliseo that saw Los Infernales (MS-1, Pirata Morgan, Satánico) defeat El Enfermero Jr., Herodes and Jerry Estrada to advance in the tournament. Records also indicate that trios consisting of Popitekus, Panico and Zorro de Oro; Talisman, La Fiera, and Mocho Cota; Atlantis, Stuka and Acertijo; Chamaco Valaguez, Impacto and Águila Solitaria were in the tournament, but were all eliminated before the finals. On February 10, 1985 Los Infernales defeated Los Brazo to win the championship.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{accession}} to the throne, Sviatoslav began campaigning to expand Rus' {{control over the}} Volga valley and the Pontic steppe region. His greatest success was the conquest of Khazaria, which for centuries {{had been one of}} the strongest states of Eastern Europe. The sources <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> about the roots of the conflict between Khazaria and Rus', so several possibilities have been suggested. The Rus' had an interest in removing the Khazar hold on the Volga trade route because the Khazars collected duties from the goods transported by the Volga. Historians have suggested that the Byzantine Empire may have incited the Rus' against the Khazars, who fell out with the Byzantines after the persecutions of the Jews in the reign of Romanus I Lecapenus.|$|E

In 1989 the name Iva was removed as it was pronounced very similarly to Hurricane Iwa, which was retired from the Central Pacific lists of names in 1982 after affecting Hawaii. In the early 1990s the names Fefa and Ismael were both retired after they affected Hawaii and Northern Mexico, respectively. Hurricane Pauline became the deadliest Eastern Pacific hurricane, and its name was retired after it affected Mexico in 1997.|$|E
5|$|During the Becket controversy, {{which began}} in October 1163, de Broc {{supported}} King Henry II of England and was appointed to oversee the lands and income of the see of Canterbury while Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was in exile after fleeing England in October 1164. The estates were given into de Broc's custody at Christmas 1164, although the grant was back-dated to Michaelmas (29 September) 1164. De Broc was to pay the king 1562 pounds 5 shillings and 5.5 pence annually from the revenues of the estate. Ranulf entrusted the day-to-day administration of Canterbury to his kinsman Robert de Broc. The de Brocs continued to administer the estates until Michaelmas 1170. Soon after de Broc took up the administration of Canterbury, Becket accused de Broc of despoiling the Canterbury estates. Historians <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> on whether Becket's charges were just propaganda or if the estates were actually damaged. De Broc managed to secure the support {{of some of the}} monks of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury, as some monks were willing to inform de Broc of any proceedings of the chapter that were favourable to Becket.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1519, Zwingli {{gave his}} first sermon in Zurich. Deviating from the {{prevalent}} practice of basing a {{sermon on the}} Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of lectio continua. He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays {{until he reached the}} end and then proceeded in the same manner with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, and finally the Old Testament. His motives for doing this <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear,</b> but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.|$|E
