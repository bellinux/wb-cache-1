25|$|The Soviet Union {{developed}} {{a new series of}} long-range missiles, called the SS-9 (NATO codename Scarp). A question developed concerning the extent of their capability to carry nuclear weapons; at issue was whether the missile were a Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) or not. The CIA information was that these missiles were not 'MIRVed' but Defense intelligence considered that they were of the more potent kind. If so, the Soviet Union was possibly aiming at a first strike nuclear capacity. The Nixon administration, desiring to employ the existence of such Soviet threat to justify a new American <b>antiballistic</b> <b>missile</b> <b>system,</b> publicly endorsed the Defense point of view. Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security advisor, asked Helms to review the CIA's finding, yet Helms initially stood by his analysts at CIA. Eventually, however, Helms compromised.|$|E

Some particle-beam weapons are real and have potential practical applications, e.g. as an <b>antiballistic</b> <b>missile</b> defense <b>system</b> for the United States and its Strategic Defense Initiative. The vast majority, however, are science fiction and are among the most common weapon types of the genre. They have been known by myriad names: phasers, particle accelerator guns, ion cannons, proton beams, lightning rays, rayguns etc.|$|R

40|$|A Legacy-funded {{inventory}} {{and evaluation of}} facilities dating to the Cold War era was conducted for the USAF 21 {sup ST} Space Wing (AFSPC). The mission of the Wing includes early warning of missile launches and detection and tracking of space objects. The political and military strategic context for these facilities was developed through an overview of Cold War history, subdivided into four major periods: (1) origins of the conflict, (2) confrontation and crisis, (3) sustained superpower balance based on mutual deterrence, and (4) renewed confrontation and collapse of the Soviet Union. The enormous importance of early warning systems in maintaining {{the balance of power}} between the USA and the Soviet Union is discussed in more detail as a subset of the general context of the Cold War history to provide additional background for evaluating the 21 {sup ST} Space Wing systems. In addition, a history of each installation was prepared and placed {{in the context of the}} broader history of the Cold War. For instance, the effort to develop a credible nuclear threat in the early 1950 s is represented by the construction of Thule AB as a forward bomber base in 1951. The growing concern with a Soviet ICBM threat in the late 1950 s is reflected in the construction of BMEWS at Thule AB and Clear AS during 1958 - 1961. Development of an <b>antiballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ABM) <b>system,</b> subsequently abandoned during the 1970 s, is represented by the Safeguard System at Cavalier AS. The U. S. response to the Soviet submarine-launched missile capability during the 1970 s is embodied in the deployment of phased-array radar systems to cover the ocean flanks of North America at Cape Cod AS (and later at Eldorado AS). The establishment of AFSPC at Peterson AFB in 1982 reflects the increased strategic importance of space in the later phases of the Cold War. A set of recommendations regarding NRHP eligibility and management of Cold War historic properties was developed as part of the inventory...|$|R
