25|$|Marcus won the -80kg/176lb {{tournament at}} Wu Ling Feng: Kunlun Fight 2 in Zhengzhou, China, on 16 February 2014. His semi-final match with Israel Adesanya was scored a draw after the {{regulation}} three rounds <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> into an extension round {{to decide the}} victor, after which Marcus was given the nod by the judges. He then stopped Vehas TopKing with a knee to the body just over two minutes into the first round in the final.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 1995, he {{defeated}} Kirkwood Walker via right low kick knockout {{in round}} three at the K-1 Grand Prix '95 Opening Battle which qualified {{him for the}} K-1 Grand Prix '95 on May 4. In the quarter-finals, he dispatched Japanese karateka Toshiyuki Atokawa with ease, knocking him out with punches in the first round. He went up against Ernesto Hoost {{for the third time}} in the semis in what was another close fight. After three rounds, the judges called it a draw <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to an extra round, after which Aerts took the unanimous decision (10-9, 10-9, 10-9). In the final, Aerts came up against hard-hitting Frenchman Jérôme Le Banner who had knocked out his two opponents in the run-up to the final. The fight did not last long, as Aerts finished Le Banner with a body shot in round one to become the K-1 World Grand Prix Champion for the second year running.|$|E
500|$|The film's story {{originated}} from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind {{over a period}} of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only [...] "a feeling" [...] and the title Blue Velvet, Lynch told Cineaste in 1987. The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. [...] "I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else... The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect," [...] Lynch remarked in an interview. The third idea was Bobby Vinton's classic rendition of the song Blue Velvet and [...] "the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time." [...] Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that [...] "there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> away for a while." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schilling {{finally made}} his GLORY debut when he competed in {{and won the}} four-man 85kg/187lb tournament at [...] in Ontario, California on September 28, 2013. He was {{scheduled}} to fight Steve Wakeling in the semi-finals but the Englishman was unable to compete due to visa issues {{and was replaced by}} Kengo Shimizu. Schilling took a dominant unanimous decision over Shimizu before meeting Artem Levin in the final. Levin had a strong first round but Schilling bounced back to floor the Russian with a right overhand followed by a knee in the second. The bout was ruled a draw after the regulation three rounds <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to an extension round to decide the winner in which Schilling scored a controversial knockdown ...|$|E
2500|$|Kicking off {{the most}} {{successful}} year of his career, Andy Hug demolished an overmatched Bart Vale at the K-1 Grand Prix '96 Opening Battle on March 3, 1996 {{to qualify for the}} K-1 Grand Prix '96 which was held two months later on May 6. After making short work of Duane van der Merwe with a KO inside forty seconds at the tournament's quarter-final stage, awaiting Hug was Ernesto Hoost in the semis and the pair had an epic battle considered {{to be one of the}} greatest matches in K-1's history. A back-and-forth fight in which Hoost delivered punishing low kicks throughout and both fighters traded heavily in the clinch, the judges ruled it a split draw after the regulation three rounds <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to an extension round to decide the winner only for it again to be scored a majority draw. Finally, after five grueling rounds, Hug was ruled the victor by split decision. In the final, he went up against Mike Bernardo, the South African power puncher who had knocked him out twice previously. It was not to be three-in-a-row for Bernardo, however, as a combination of fatigue and Hug's low kicks began to wear him down in the second round. Bernardo went down from a roundhouse kick to his left thigh but got back to his feet only for Hug to deliver one of the most spectacular stoppages of the 1990s, landing the [...] "Hug Tornado" [...] on Bernardo's already-injured left leg to put him away and clinch the coveted K-1 World Grand Prix Championship.|$|E
