5|$|In a more Christianized version, St.Elijah shoots {{lightning}} at the devils {{who lead}} the hail clouds; the devils {{in this case}} <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> ale. As shown by these examples, beliefs with various degrees of Christianization, from none to almost complete, can exist side by side.|$|E
5|$|While {{there can}} be {{considerable}} variation across members of a species—and while the results <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> impacted by the effects of moult and feather regeneration—even very closely related species show clear differences in their wing formulas.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus' {{colorful}} {{account of}} the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> not verifiable, but they form {{an integral part of}} the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the laconic speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} argued that [...] "Gerard <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> {{symbolic}} of Nazi Germany. And Marie was Anne Frank. Hiding away. The sheep <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> symbolic of the U.S. arriving too late, per usual, in a von Trierish way." ...|$|R
30|$|Proof. It <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> true.|$|R
30|$|The linear {{operator}} <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> hemicontinuous.|$|R
25|$|Transformations of Hilbert {{space by}} either a unitary linear {{transformation}} or an antiunitary antilinear operator <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> then {{compatible with the}} transformations or ray space they induce as described.|$|E
25|$|Stages 2 and 3 {{represent}} {{progressively more}} severe degrees of virilization. The genitalia <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> abnormal to the eye, with a phallus intermediate {{in size and}} a small vaginal opening.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> {{many other}} {{treatment}} options, with cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy and Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing being {{some of the}} more popular options, all these involve an individual changing the way they think about their disease and experiences in life.|$|E

25|$|Examples {{include both}} duct engines and rocket engines, and more {{uncommon}} variations such as Hall effect thrusters, ion drives and mass drivers. Duct engines <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> not used for space propulsion {{due to the}} lack of air; however some proposed spacecraft have these kinds of engines to assist takeoff and landing.|$|E
25|$|The door is {{six feet}} wide and eight feet high and is of two thicknesses. There is a large, {{horizontal}} board at the top, then two small boards, and at the bottom four more horizontal boards. The outer door is {{held in place by}} large strap hinges that <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> hand made.|$|E
25|$|The {{linguistic}} {{history of}} the Torres Strait area is complex, and interaction of well over 2000 years has led to many layers of relationship between the local languages, including many words that <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> common, though whether through trade or 'genetics' is another story, {{such as the following}} 'trade' words in Torres Strait area languages.|$|E
50|$|Barabas' name <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> {{inspired}} by the biblical character Barabbas.|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} spire, {{which also}} was of masonry {{rather than of}} sheathed wood, {{was built in the}} late 14th century, by John Mason (died ca 1403), who also built the Vicars' Hall. The style and construction of the spire <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> based on that of Salisbury Cathedral but it is not as ambitiously tall, probably because of the problem of subsidence.|$|E
25|$|There are no portraits or {{descriptions}} of St Chad {{from his own}} time. The only hint that we have comes in the legend of Theodore lifting him bodily into the saddle– possibly suggesting that he was remembered as small in stature. All attempts to portray him are based entirely on imagination, and nearly all <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> anachronistic, with a heavy stress on vestments from other periods.|$|E
25|$|Though it is {{difficult}} to define what can properly be called a 'Cubist sculpture', Picasso's 1909-10 Head bares the hallmarks of early Cubism in that the various surfaces constituting the face and hair are broken down into irregular fragments that meet at sharp angles, rendering practically unreadable the basic volume of the head beneath. These facets <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> a translation from two to three dimensions of the broken planes of Picasso's 1909-10 paintings.|$|E
50|$|The better {{integration}} domain {{for this}} passage <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> the sphere.|$|R

25|$|A {{provision}} {{will usually}} be declaratory if {{it relates to}} the performance of a statutory duty rather than to the exercise of a power on individual interests. If a procedural code established in a statute is intended to be exhaustive and strictly enforced, its provisions are mandatory. The determination will depend on the context and whether, for instance, a mistake is found to be trivial or whether individual rights <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> prejudiced by the failure to observe the requirement.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{the first}} 23 {{chapters}} (4 volumes) were serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 2004 simply {{under the title}} Steel Ball Run. Although the character's names <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> related to the series, it was unclear if the story {{was a part of}} JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. However, when the series moved to Ultra Jump in 2004, it was officially announced as part 7 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, but in an alternate universe, like the following and current arc, JoJolion.|$|E
25|$|The inner {{ridge and}} trough zone {{surrounds}} the central palimpsest. The ridges that immediately surround the central zone have steep flanks facing outward. These scarps, when studied {{at a high}} resolution, {{turned out to be}} discontinuous consisting of a series of small bright knobs surrounded by the smooth dark material. They <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> very degraded structures. The troughs that are situated further from the center than ridges are sinuous and appear to be graben (about 20km wide). The inner trough zone extends up to 950km from the center of Valhalla.|$|E

25|$|Kuala Lumpur's metro or {{rapid transit}} system {{consists}} of 6 metro lines operated by 4 operators. Among the 4 operators, Rapid Rail and KTM Komuter {{are the most}} important rail operators in Kuala Lumpur where Keretapi Tanah Melayu alone carries 30,934,651 passengers in year 2005. Metro lines in Kuala Lumpur are categorized into different types: rapid transit, commuter rail and monorail. Others such as the Intercity rail and the airport express <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> not metro systems. It may even be argued that commuter rail services from Kuala Lumpur cannot be considered a metro system because it extends far beyond Kuala Lumpur and its immediate surroundings.|$|E
25|$|The {{chloroplast}}idan chloroplasts, {{or green}} chloroplasts, are another large, highly diverse primary chloroplast lineage. Their host organisms are {{commonly known as}} the green algae and land plants. They differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes, and contain chlorophyll b instead. Most green chloroplasts <b>are</b> (<b>obviously)</b> green, though some aren't, like some forms of Hæmatococcus pluvialis, due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls' green colors. Chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the peptidoglycan wall between their double membrane, leaving an intermembrane space. Some plants seem to have kept the genes for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer, though they've been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead.|$|E
25|$|Through Oroonoko {{and other}} male characters, the speaker shows men as {{dominant}} {{leaders who are}} accompanied by strong female companions. In her text, The Romance of Empire: Oroonoko and the Trade in Slaves, Laura Brown emphasises the significance of female characters. Although men <b>are</b> <b>obviously</b> important in the novel, Brown states that “female figures—either Imoinda or the narrator and her surrogates—appear as incentives or witnesses for almost all of Oroonoko’s exploits”. Throughout the novel, Imoinda supports Oroonoko {{in all of his}} decisions, even when he suggests that he kill her to escape their slavery. Furthermore, Brown claims that Oroonoko is not alone during his execution because “ mother and Sister were by him”.|$|E
