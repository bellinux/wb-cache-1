5|$|During World War II, {{a player}} {{shortage}} led to <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> {{of the league}} as several teams folded and others merged. Among the short-lived merged teams were the Steagles (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia) in 1943, the Card-Pitts (Chicago Cardinals and Pittsburgh) in 1944, and a team formed from the merger of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Boston Yanks in 1945.|$|E
5|$|NBN premiered Today Extra in 1989. The {{lifestyle}} {{program was}} broadcast three {{days per week}} as part of NBN's day-time line-up. On 3 January 2007, {{it was announced that}} NBN would axe Today Extra, claiming it was no longer economically viable, with a drop in ratings and <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> advertising base. The program's axing ended the career for former weatherman Nat Jeffery, who presented the program for 18 years, and worked at the station for 28 years.|$|E

5|$|In addition, the Air Force was {{tasked with}} {{gathering}} intelligence, air reconnaissance, and air transport. Support of ground troops, both doctrinally {{and as a}} practical matter, became marginal. These missions were strongly influenced by <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> capability, since its combat aircraft could operate by daylight only, its anti-aircraft artillery was obsolete, and the FLORIDA radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness. The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and a cut of one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to be canceled, leaving both it and the F-5s in a strictly air-to-air role.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese Indonesian {{population}} of Sumatra accounts {{for nearly half}} of the group's national population. Although they are generally more urbanized than Indonesia's indigenous population, significant rural and agricultural communities exist throughout the country. Declining fertility rates have resulted in an upward shift in the population pyramid, as the median age increases. Emigration has contributed to <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> population, and communities have emerged in more industrialized nations {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Some have participated in repatriation programs to the People's Republic of China, while others emigrated to Western countries to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. Among the overseas residents, their identities are noticeably more Indonesian than Chinese.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, due to <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> {{number of}} {{operational}} units and stepped up production, equipment shortages were {{a thing of}} the past. Indeed, the Army had more equipment that it actually needed. For example, a total of 368 25pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand. Additionally, a total of 530 2pounder and 6pounder anti-tank guns were required, but the Army had 1,941, while 68 3.7inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training, but there were 640 pieces available. Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren, of which 9,438 were required, but there were 21,139 in the system. The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required, due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare.|$|E

5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a {{steering-wheel}} change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him around the outside on the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place Button, and Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running off the track at 130R corner, had <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> one-second advantage over Hamilton). A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E

25|$|The {{birth rate}} (9.49‰, 2012) {{is much lower}} than the {{mortality}} rate (11.84‰, 2012), resulting in <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> (−0.26% per year, 2012) and aging population (median age: 39.1, 2012), with approximately 14.9% of total population aged 65 years and over. The life expectancy in 2015 was estimated at 74.92 years (71.46 years male, 78.59 years female).|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s {{there was}} a concern that Mysen and Eidsberg would see <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> population. However, instead an {{increasing}} number of people started commuting to jobs in and around Oslo. By 1970 a quarter of the workforce were commuting, almost all to the capital. This led to a major change in the traffic pattern on the Eastern Østfold Line. Mysen became the end of train services, with the extensions to Sarpsborg closed down in 1986. At the same time NSB made more intensive its commuter service.|$|E

Mr. Felker cited the 2005 derailment as the primary reasons for the company's failure. The wreck knocked out the Gregg plant of Avondale mills, which was a key pillar {{to the survival of}} the company in <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> United States textile market.

25|$|From {{the late}} 1970s, and onwards Barre faced <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> {{popularity}} and increased domestic resistance. In response, Barre's elite unit, the Red Berets (Duub Cas), and the paramilitary unit called the Victory Pioneers carried out systematic terror against the Majeerteen, Hawiye, and Isaaq clans. The Red Berets systematically smashed water reservoirs to deny {{water to the}} Majeerteen and Isaaq clans and their herds. More than 2,000 members of the Majeerteen clan died of thirst, and an estimated 5,000 Isaaq {{were killed by the}} government. Members of the Victory Pioneers also raped large numbers of Majeerteen and Isaaq women, and more than 300,000 Isaaq members fled to Ethiopia.|$|E
25|$|During stage four {{there are}} both low birth rates and low death rates. Birth rates may drop to well below {{replacement}} level as {{has happened in}} countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan, leading to <b>a</b> <b>shrinking</b> population, a threat to many industries that rely on population growth. As the large group born during stage two ages, it creates an economic burden on the shrinking working population. Death rates may remain consistently low or increase slightly due to increases in lifestyle diseases due to low exercise levels and high obesity and an aging population in developed countries. By the late 20th century, birth rates and death rates in developed countries leveled off at lower rates.|$|E
