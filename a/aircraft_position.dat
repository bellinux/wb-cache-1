5|$|The AFIS air {{controller}} has {{a different}} role in Norway than in Russia, and the crew were not aware {{that they were being}} given information and advice, rather than orders. Communication with AFIS was left with the navigator, which is a breach of norms. Communication between air control and the crew was problematic, since the crew lacked sufficient English skills. The pilot in command had insufficient crew resource management. After the crew decided to carry out the approach to Runway 28, a new approach briefing was not accomplished. The aircraft overshot the approach centerline when turning inbound, because they did not try to intercept the outbound track from Advent. The crew showed a lack of situational awareness following their uncertainty of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>position</b> in relation to LLZ 28, caused by indications on the HSIs.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of all 239 people on board, Flight 370 is the second deadliest {{incident}} involving a Boeing 777 and the second deadliest incident in Malaysia Airlines' history, behind Flight 17 in both categories. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem that was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after the disappearance of Flight 370 and the downing of Flight 17; the airline was re-nationalised {{by the end of}} 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information promptly during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370's disappearance brought to public attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders, including several issues raised four years earlier—but never mandated—following {{the loss of}} Air France Flight 447. In response to Flight 370's disappearance, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted new standards for <b>aircraft</b> <b>position</b> reporting over open ocean, extended recording time for cockpit voice recorders, and, from 2020, will require new aircraft designs to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water.|$|E
25|$|The Avro York was a {{military}} trooping flight for the British Air Ministry from Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom to Jamaica with six crew and 33 passengers, including both soldiers and families. The aircraft had stopped at Lajes Field in the Azores and departed at 23:25 on 1 February 1953 for Gander Airport in Newfoundland. The aircraft transmitted Positional Operational Meteorological Reports at approximately one-hour intervals from 00:10 to 04:25 on 2 February. At 04:10 the <b>aircraft</b> <b>position</b> was given as 44°32'N 41°38'W. At 05:31 Gander heard an Urgency signal from the aircraft giving a position a minute before the message as 46°15'N 46°31'W. The urgency signal {{was followed by a}} distress message SOS, SOS, SOS DE G-A the message stopped abruptly and no further communications from the aircraft were heard.|$|E

50|$|Cooperative systems (a.k.a {{dependent}} surveillance): Under {{this form}} of surveillance, systems on ground (such as SSR) have to communicate with equipment (such as transponder) on-board the aircraft to determine {{the position of the}} aircraft. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>position</b> is determined on-board and then transmitted to ATC.|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} {{by which}} an aircraft avoids obstacles or other aircraft is termed separation. The most important concept of IFR flying is that separation is maintained regardless of weather conditions. In controlled airspace, {{air traffic control}} (ATC) separates IFR aircraft from obstacles and other aircraft using a flight clearance based on route, time, distance, speed, and altitude. ATC monitors IFR flights on radar, or through <b>aircraft</b> <b>position</b> reports in areas where radar coverage is not available. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>position</b> reports are sent as voice radio transmissions. In the United States, a flight operating under IFR is required to provide position reports unless ATC advises a pilot that the plane is in radar contact. The pilot must resume position reports after ATC advises that radar contact has been lost, or that radar services are terminated.|$|E
50|$|During {{instrument}} approaches {{or while}} performing SIDs and STARs, a chart overlay option {{is available on}} the map page.
