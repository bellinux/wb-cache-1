5|$|After the {{previous}} year's race showed lower-than-expected tyre degradation, Pirelli opted {{to supply the}} yellow-banded soft compound as the prime selection and the red-banded supersoft tyre as the option selection. The previous season's event saw Nico Rosberg complete 52 of 53 laps on the white-banded medium compound {{on his way to}} a second-place finish. Even with the softer tyre choice, tyre degradation was not an issue at the event, with drivers able to record fast lap times <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> race on a one-stop strategy.|$|E
5|$|After the war another twelve Sdkfz 10, bought as surplus from Norway and elsewhere, were {{delivered}} to A8. The total of 24 Sdkfz 10 {{were used in}} training gun crews <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and early 1960s. 1966 all were sold to the highest bidders at Kalix airfield and they {{ended up in the}} villages surrounding Kalix and Boden. In the mid 1970s - 1980s they were traced down and sold abroad. The last known one left Sweden in 1992. Of the 24 sold in 1966, as of 2014 fourteen have known locations with collectors and in museums all over the world.|$|E

5|$|At the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, Murray {{defeated}} Djokovic in the semifinals, {{but lost}} in the final to Roger Federer. After an early defeat at the BNP Paribas Open, Murray made the finals of the Miami Masters, losing to Djokovic. Murray then had quarterfinal losses at the Monte Carlo Masters and Barcelona Open, and a third round loss at the Italian Open. Murray battled back spasms <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> French Open, and in the quarterfinals he was beaten by David Ferrer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{excitement}} surrounding Lester's and King's performances, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, {{but only two}} were won, while the team lost nine and earned a draw in four. The other win came against Warwickshire. During this match at Edgbaston, Lester scored 35 runs in the first innings and 67 in the second. Lester was the best batsmen on the Philadelphian side; beginning with 72 not out in his first match, he kept up his form <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tour, scoring 891 runs for an average 37.12. Several counties offered him contracts to play in England.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1969, the {{pipeline}} crossed the Laotian frontier through the Mu Gia Pass and, by 1970, {{it reached the}} approaches to the A Shau Valley in South Vietnam. The plastic pipeline, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, managed to transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> same pipe.

The Deshastha Brahmins of Baroda are immigrants who came from the Desh for State service during the rule of Gaekwads.|$|E
5|$|After tricking {{his wife}} Marge {{into believing that}} {{the model for the}} Burly paper towel {{corporation}} Chad Sexington would have dinner with the Simpsons, Homer takes the family to the Pimento Grove to watch live performers as compensation. One of the acts is a hypnotist called Mesmerino. Homer volunteers, and Mesmerino hypnotizes him into thinking he is twelve years old again. As Homer starts to reminisce, he starts screaming incessantly <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night. The next day, Homer's co-workers Lenny and Carl bring him home early from work, still screaming. They finally manage to calm him down with some Yaqui tea. He starts to recall the events leading up to the scream-inducing incident. In a flashback, Homer, Lenny, and Carl are hiking in the woods and are confronted by a young Fat Tony, but they are saved by a young Moe.|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia flowers have {{an unusually}} short life span for Banksia species, {{producing}} nectar {{for only about}} four to twelve days after anthesis. Most nectar is produced during the night and early in the morning, with only small amounts produced during the day. Flowers are produced <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> year, {{but there is a}} strong peak in autumn. Little else flowers within its range at this time, so it is a seasonally important source of food for nectariferous animals. Surveys have observed a range of animals feeding on the species, including a wide range of insects; many species of bird including Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (New Holland honeyeater), Anthochaera carunculata (red wattlebird), Anthochaera chrysoptera (little wattlebird), Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris (eastern spinebill) and Trichoglossus haematodus (rainbow lorikeet); and mammals such as Petaurus norfolcensis (squirrel glider), Petaurus breviceps (sugar glider), Acrobates pygmaeus (feathertail glider) and Pteropus poliocephalus (grey-headed flying fox). In some areas such as at Bungawalbin National Park in northern New South Wales, B.integrifolia is the only source of nectar and pollen in the autumn (Marchâ€“April) and late winter (July). The importance of non-flying mammals to pollination of B.integrifolia was demonstrated in 1989, with a study in Wilsons Promontory National Park showing a reduction of fruit set when measures were taken to exclude them.|$|E

5|$|In 1896 he {{was first}} {{appointed}} consul and later consul general for the Orange Free State. Muller held this position <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Second Boer War and his high-profile performance as European representative for this Boer republic won him considerable fame and notoriety, which lasted all his life. After the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed in 1902 Muller retired {{to a life of}} travelling and writing for some years, making Muller a household name with his travel books. In 1919 the Dutch government appointed him envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Romania, and later to Czechoslovakia, where he retired in 1932. As diplomat Muller strongly promoted Dutch business interests, especially in oil and electrotechnics.|$|E
5|$|Much as {{they had}} in {{previous}} stages, race leader Denis Menchov {{and the man in}} second place Danilo Di Luca stayed right with one another <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> climb, as Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov with attacks, but was unable to. Pellizotti, who had also been holding their wheels, took the opportunity with the two of them taking energy out of each other, to come clear and move into third position on the road. Basso, who was up the road, dutifully sat up and waited for his better-placed teammate and paced him to a small gap over Menchov and Di Luca before cracking. It was enough to ensure Pellizotti second on the stage, to keep him third in the overall classification. Di Luca managed to outsprint Menchov to the line and claim 8 bonus seconds to narrow his deficit to 18 seconds, but with only a flat stage and an individual time trial remaining the superior time trialist Menchov had the advantage.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July, as the {{squadron}} neared Rochefort, it was spotted by HMS Mars, a Royal Navy ship {{of the line}} stationed off the port to intercept French ships entering or leaving. Signalling {{to the rest of}} the British squadron, Captain Robert Dudley Oliver took Mars in pursuit, chasing the French squadron <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night and into the next morning, by which time the frigate Rhin had fallen far behind the others. Recognising that Rhin was in danger of being captured, Lamellerie turned back to her defence with his main squadron but then changed his mind, turning once more and retreating to Rochefort as Oliver took possession of the heavily outgunned Rhin.|$|E

5|$|Soviet rule of Estonia was re-established by force, and sovietisation followed, {{which was}} mostly {{carried out in}} 1944â€“1950. The forced {{collectivisation}} of agriculture began in 1947, and was completed after the mass deportation of Estonians in March 1949. All private farms were confiscated, and farmers were made to join the collective farms. Besides the armed resistance of the Forest Brothers, a number of underground nationalist schoolchildren groups were active. Most of their members were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The punitive actions decreased rapidly after Stalin's death in 1953; from 1956â€“58, {{a large part of}} the deportees and political prisoners were allowed to return to Estonia. Political arrests and numerous other kind of crimes against humanity were committed <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> occupation period until the late 1980s. After all, the attempt to integrate Estonian society into the Soviet system failed. Although the armed resistance was defeated, the population remained anti-Soviet. This helped the Estonians to organise a new resistance movement in the late 1980s, regain their independence in 1991, and then rapidly develop a modern society.|$|E
5|$|The {{characterization}} of Neville Sinclair {{was inspired by}} movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current <b>all</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> arduous process of writing and re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|E

All private farms were confiscated, and farmers were made to join the collective farms. An armed resistance movement of 'forest brothers' was active until the mass deportations. A total of 30,000 participated or supported the movement; 2,000 were killed. The Soviet authorities fighting the forest brothers suffered also hundreds of deaths. Among those killed on both sides were innocent civilians. Besides the armed resistance of the forest brothers, a number of underground nationalist schoolchildren groups were active. Most of their members were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.
