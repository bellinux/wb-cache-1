50|$|In a paper {{written by}} Fessenden in 1902, it was {{asserted}} that important advances had been made, {{one of which}} was overcoming largely the loss of energy experienced in other systems. In an interview with a New York Journal correspondent, Fessenden stated that in his early apparatus he did not use an <b>air</b> <b>transformer</b> at the sending end, nor a concentric cylinder for emitters and antennae, and had used capacity, but arranged in a manner entirely different from that in other systems, and that he did not employ a coherer or any form of imperfect contact. Fessenden asserted that he had paid particular attention to selective and multiplex systems, and was well satisfied with the results in that direction. On August 12, 1902, 13 patents were issued to Fessenden, covering various methods, devices, and systems for signaling without wires. These patents involved many new principles, the chef-d'oeuvre of which was a method for distributing capacity and inductance instead of localizing these coefficients of the oscillator as in previous systems.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Air</b> Motion <b>Transformer</b> (AMT) {{is a type}} of electroacoustic {{transducer}} or loudspeaker, {{also called}} <b>Air</b> Velocity <b>Transformer</b> (AVT) or JET transducer.
