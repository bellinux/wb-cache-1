He emphasized that corporate profits are not being fairly shared, stating that chief executive officers make over 400 times that of workers, on average. Therefore, it takes an average worker over one year to make {{as much money as}} his boss makes in one day. He advocated a policy that would begin to remove United States troops from Iraq, pointing out that polls show the majority of the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not support the direction of the Iraq War or the president's strategy.|$|E

The history of North American salmon canneries is exemplified by their history on the Columbia River. Within a few years each of the Hume brothers had their own cannery. By 1872, Robert Hume was operating a number of canneries, bringing in Chinese people {{willing to work for}} low wages to do the cannery work, and having local Native <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> the fishing.

50|$|The bias {{blind spot}} is the {{cognitive}} bias of recognizing {{the impact of}} biases on the judgement of others, while failing to see the impact of biases on one's own judgment. The term was created by Emily Pronin, a social psychologist from Princeton University's Department of Psychology, with colleagues Daniel Lin and Lee Ross. The bias blind spot is named after the visual blind spot. Most people appear to exhibit the bias blind spot. In a sample of more than 600 residents of the United States, more than 85% believed they were less biased than the average American. Only one participant believed {{that he or she}} was more biased than the average <b>American.</b> <b>People</b> <b>do</b> vary with regard {{to the extent to which}} they exhibit the bias blind spot.

5000|$|Another {{factor that}} {{prevented}} an {{escalation of the}} conflict was that neither Wilson or Carranza wanted war.

[...] Alleging that Wilson was interested in more than just stopping the raids. Wilson responded to Carranza by voicing his concerns, saying; [...] "for three years the Mexican Republic has been torn with Civil strife; the lives of Americans and other aliens have been sacrificed; vast properties developed by American capital and enterprise have been destroyed or rendered nonproductive; bandits raiders have been permitted to roam through the territory contiguous to the United States and to seize, without punishment or effective attempt at punishment, the property of Americans." ...|$|E

40|$|Can {{a sitting}} President ever be criminally prosecuted (outside an {{impeachment}} court) ? The {{question has been}} debated-sometimes hotly, sometimes coolly-since the beginning ofthe Republic. Although the long pedigree ofthis debate suggests that reasonable people can disagree, {{we believe that the}} best view ofconstitutional text, history, structure, and precedent supports the conclusion that Justice Story reached: Sitting Presidents cannot be prosecuted. This privilege does not place Presidents above the law; they can be held accountable for their actions after they leave office, and they can be impeached to hasten this. The privilege does not make Presidents imperial; their special status is ultimately traceable to the rights of the <b>American</b> <b>People.</b> Nor <b>does</b> the privilege clash with the structure of American constitutional government; the President is constitutionally distinct from other, prosecutable officials...|$|R

40|$|Despite an {{economic}} recession and record levels of personal bankruptcy filings due to healthcare costs, President Obama 2 ̆ 7 s healthcare reform initiative sparked {{a season of}} protests. A 2 ̆ 2 public option 2 ̆ 2 -not to mention a single-payer system-was off the table even before the discussion began. As {{the question of the}} reform package 2 ̆ 7 s constitutionality wound its way to the Supreme Court, it became clear that a substantial number of <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not want their government helping them stay alive. In this climate, {{it is difficult to imagine}} an America in which the state is an accepted partner in meeting the challenges and responsibilities of family life. We seem to be reflexively opposed to the European-style social welfare state, 2 ̆ 2 European-style 2 ̆ 2 being understood as a term of denigration. Democrats are confounded by the public 2 ̆ 7 s widespread adherence to an ideology of liberty that conflicts with self-interest. In The Supportive State: Families, Government, and America 2 ̆ 7 s Political Ideals, Maxine Eichner argues that part of this contradiction stems from flaws in our political theory. Modem political liberalism is premised on individual liberty as its highest value and nonintervention as the presumptive posture of the state. This theory fails to account for individual vulnerability or collective interdependence (pp. 21 - 22). As a result, proponents of social welfare programs lack a persuasive theory of the state on which to rest their arguments. Because liberal theory hides vulnerability and dependence inside the private 2 ̆ 2 black box 2 ̆ 2 of the family, public support for that vulnerability remains exceptional and stigmatized. The Supportive State tackles this dilemma by rethinking liberal theory from the ground up, incorporating dependence and families rather than pushing them aside. It is a careful, beautifully written renegotiation of the social contract on behalf of real people, rather than the idealized, autonomous- yet-isolated rights-bearers who are the subjects of traditional liberalism. Eichner preserves the best of liberal theory-its jealous concern for individual liberty, its premium on a diversity of human flourishingwhile adding the complexity that the theory needs to cope with real lives. The result is an important contribution both to liberalism and to feminist theory, which in the past has focused primarily on criticizing liberalism for the failings that Eichner corrects. This review discusses The Supportive State from the perspective of feminist theory and considers the extent to which Eichner has answered the concerns of both the critics and the defenders of liberalism...|$|E
40|$|In 1944, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt {{signed the}} {{original}} GI Bill, ensuring that eight million combat veterans {{coming home from}} Germany and Japan {{would be able to}} afford an education. Called the "Servicemen's Readjustment Act," the World War II GI Bill covered tuition, fees, and books, and gave veterans a living stipend while they were in school. Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush, Senators Bob Dole and Patrick Moynihan, and authors Norman Mailer and Frank McCourt all relied on the GI Bill. Experts have argued that the GI Bill "reinvented America" after a half-decade of war. Indeed, a 1988 Congressional study showed that every dollar spent on educational benefits under the original GI Bill added seven dollars to the national economy in terms of productivity, consumer spending and tax revenue. But in his signing statement, President Roosevelt spoke more simply: "[The GI Bill] gives emphatic notice to {{the men and women in}} our armed forces that the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not intend to let them down. " Today, 1. 5 million troops are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to a very different future than the one FDR made possible for the Greatest Generation. The current educational benefits offered to veterans are far lower than the original GI Bill. Today, after paying a nonrefundable contribution from their first military paychecks, troops can receive a total of up to $ 39, 600 towards their education. Unfortunately, this covers only 60 - 70 % of the average cost of four years at a public college or university, or less than two years at a typical private college. In addition, structural problems and bureaucratic delays discourage veterans from using their GI Bill benefits. National Guardsmen and Reservists, including those who have served multiple combat tours, typically receive only a fraction of their GI Bill benefits. Moreover, 30 % of troops who pay the nonrefundable $ 1, 200 contribution do not end up using the GI Bill at all. These veterans have paid the government $ 230 million, but received nothing in return. Today's veterans deserve a real reintegration program to help adjust to the civilian world. At the same time, a renewed GI Bill is a practical answer to the military's troop shortage. Despite investing $ 4 billion dollars in recruiting annually, the military has had serious problems recruiting high-caliber personnel. The Pentagon has responded by lowering age, education, and aptitude standards for new recruits, as well as upping the number of recruiters and increasing enlistment bonuses. These stop-gap measures will not address long-term problems with recruiting, especially as the overall size of the Armed Forces is expanded. Rather than continuing to spend billions in bonuses for lower-standard enlistees, increasing GI Bill benefits would encourage high-aptitude young people to join the military. The GI Bill is the military's single most effective recruitment tool; the number one reason civilians join the military is to get money for college. As our military recovers and resets in the coming years, an expanded GI Bill will play a crucial role in ensuring that our military remains the strongest and most advanced in the world...|$|E
