5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle's affinities {{beyond the}} Sanford's sea eagle {{are a little}} less clear; {{molecular}} data indicate that {{it is one of}} four species of tropical sea eagle (along with the <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> and the Madagascar fish eagle), while allozyme data indicate it might have a closer relationship with the sea eagles of the northern hemisphere. A further molecular study published in 2005 showed the white-bellied and Sanford's sea eagles to be basal to the four fish eagles (the two mentioned above plus the two hitherto untested species of the genus Ichthyophaga).|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.|$|E
40|$|<b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> (Haliaeetus vocifer) are {{important}} {{birds of prey}} and indicator of ecosystem integrity in aquatic environments. We assessed the population abundance and spatial distribution of <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> along three major rivers in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. Data were collected using walked transect surveys along Mwenezi, Runde and Save rivers in Gonarezhou between March and April 2011. A total of 54 <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> were recorded with an average density of 0. 62 individuals per km. <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> were mostly distributed in areas with large water pools along Gonarezhou’s three major rivers. The results suggest that large pools along perennial rivers {{are important}} in the distribution and density of <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> in Gonarezhou. Future studies should aim at establishing the long-term population trends of birds of prey in Gonarezho...|$|R

25|$|At one time, {{the golden}} eagle {{lived in a}} great {{majority}} of temperate Europe, North Asia, North America, North Africa, and Japan. Although widespread and quite secure in some areas, {{in many parts of}} the range golden eagles have experienced sharp population declines and have even been extirpated from some areas. The total number of individual golden eagles from around the range is estimated to range somewhere between 170,000 and 250,000 while the estimated total number of breeding pairs ranges from 60,000 to 100,000. Few other eagle species are as numerous, though some species like tawny eagle, wedge-tailed eagle and bald eagle have total estimated populations of a similar size to the golden eagle’s despite having distributions which are more restricted. The world’s most populous eagle may be the <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> (Haliaeetus vocifer), which has a stable total population estimated at 300,000 individuals and is found solely in Africa. On a global scale, the golden eagle is not considered threatened by the IUCN.|$|E

50|$|Alongside human activities, {{natural enemies}} include cheetahs, leopards and lions, which all {{sometimes}} prey on this species. Eggs may be also {{at risk of}} predation by <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles.</b> At one colony in Kisumu, Kenya, approximately 61% of eggs counted between all nests hatched and 38% were predated by <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagles.</b> The success rate of fledglings was only 0.33 young per nest.

50|$|Spotted-necked otters feed {{primarily}} on fish, typically less than 20 cm in length, but also eat frogs and small crustaceans, especially when fish {{are in short}} supply. They are diurnal, and appear to hunt entirely by sight using short dives of less than 20 seconds each in clear water with good visibility. Larger prey items are carried ashore, while smaller items are eaten while treading water. Known predators on the otters include crocodiles and <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles.</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{a species}} the slaty egret is highly {{dependent}} on seasonal marshes which are threatened by human factors such as drainage (for cultivation), flood regulation and dams as along the Kafue River, the erosion of river catchments, water abstraction for irrigation, invasive non-native vegetation, human disturbance including excessive trampling and over grazing by livestock and the harvesting of reeds and other marsh vegetation for human use. In Botswana {{a major threat to}} roosts and to colonies is the burning of the reed bed habitat. African elephants (Loxodonta africana) may be a threat to some nest sites through trampling and predation at some nest sites by <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> (Haliaetus vocifer) may negatively affect productivity.|$|R
50|$|Zebras, buffaloes, {{black and}} white colobus, blue monkeys, bushbucks, sunis, and leopards {{populate}} the park. The park contains some 350 species of birds in total, of which 52 are birds of prey. The cliffs in {{the northern end of}} Lake Paradise, in Gof Sokorte Gurda, are home to a number of birds, including Ruppell's griffon vultures, peregrine falcons, mountain buzzards, black kites and <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles.</b> Ducks such as garganeys, southern pochards and teals are found on the lake, which is also home to red-knobbed coots, hamerkops, ibises, purple herons, and yellow-billed storks.On the lower slopes of the forest of the park, marked by scrubland, there are populations of olive baboons, vervet monkeys, Peter's gazelles, beisa oryxes, striped hyenas, caracals and aardwolves.|$|R

25|$|Table Mountain is {{also home}} to porcupines, mongooses, snakes, lizards, tortoises, and a rare endemic species of {{amphibian}} that is only found on Table Mountain, the Table Mountain ghost frog. The last lion in the area was shot circa 1802. Leopards persisted on the mountains until perhaps the 1920s but are now extinct locally. Two smaller, secretive, nocturnal carnivores, the rooikat (caracal) and the vaalboskat (also called the vaalkat or Southern African wildcat) were once common in the mountains and the mountain slopes. The rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain. The mountain cliffs are home to several raptors species, apart from the Verreaux's eagle. They include the jackal buzzard, booted eagle (in summer), African harrier-hawk, peregrine falcon and the rock kestrel. In 2014 three pairs of <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> were believed to be breeding on the Peninsula, but they nest in trees generally as far away from human habitation as is possible on the Peninsula. Their number in 2017 is unknown.|$|R
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> breed {{during the}} dry season, when water levels are low. They are {{believed}} to mate for life. Pairs often maintain two or more nests, which they frequently reuse. Because nests are reused and built upon over the years, they can grow quite large, some reaching 2 m (6.0 ft) across and 1.2 m deep. The nests are placed in a large tree and are built mostly of sticks and other pieces of wood.The female lays one to three eggs, which are primarily white with a few reddish speckles. Incubation is mostly done by the female, but the male incubates when the female leaves to hunt. Incubation lasts for 42 to 45 days before the chicks hatch. Siblicide does not normally occur in this taxon, and the parents often successfully rear two or three chicks. Chicks fledge around 70 to 75 days old. Postfledgling dependence lasts up to three months, whereafter the juveniles become nomadic, and may congregate in groups away from territorial adults. Those that survive their first year have a life expectancy of some 12 to 24 years.|$|R

50|$|Raptors are {{vultures}} (Gyps) species {{found in}} both parks, which are carion-eating birds. A common sight is the <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> (Haliaeetus vocifer) species, which {{is black and}} white in colour.|$|E
50|$|As well as flamingos, {{there are}} myriad other bird species that inhabit the lake and the area {{surrounding}} it, such as <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagle,</b> Goliath heron, hamerkop, pied kingfisher and Verreaux's eagle among others.|$|E
50|$|Goliath herons are solitary foragers and {{are highly}} {{territorial}} towards other Goliaths entering their feeding territories. On occasions, two {{may be seen}} together but these {{are most likely to}} be a breeding pair or immatures. A diurnal and often rather inactive feeder, this heron often hunts by standing in the shallows, intently watching the water at its feet. This is a typical feeding method among large Ardea herons and it can forage in deeper waters than most due to its larger size. It may also perch on heavy floating vegetation, in order to prevent water from rippling around them. As prey appears, the heron rapidly spears it with open mandibles, often spearing both mandibles through the fish's body, and then swallows it whole. It is possible that the bill is used in a lure-like fashion occasionally, attracting fish to the immobile, large object submerged in the water. The handling period is long, with herons often placing their struggling prey on floating vegetation while preparing to swallow it. Due to its generally slow movements and handling time, the Goliath is frequently vulnerable to kleptoparasitism. In Africa, <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> frequently pirate food caught by Goliaths, although other large birds such as saddle-billed storks and pelicans may also steal their prey.|$|R
50|$|Whales can {{be spotted}} in the Bay from May to late October and {{dolphins}} {{can be seen}} daily {{on their way back}} and forth between the bays of Cape St Francis and Jeffrey’s Bay. The Cape clawless otter is also ever present, frolicking in the waves and rock pools around Port St Francis and at Otters Landing. Bird life is abundant with over 200 species recorded in the area including the rare <b>African</b> oystercatcher and <b>fish</b> <b>eagle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season in India is January to March. In Zambia, the {{breeding season}} begins in August. Pairs may indulge in courtship feeding {{in which the}} female feeds the male, an unusual behaviour that has also been noted in captivity. This falcon often reuses the old tree nests of corvids, or lays its 3-5 eggs in a nest that it builds on the fork of a tall tree or in the crown of a palm tree. In Africa, they {{have been known to}} reuse the nests of pied crows (Corvus albus), <b>African</b> <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> (Halieaetus vocifer) on Acacia apart from building their own nest in Borassus palms. In India, the nest is often placed in a large mango tree (Mangifera indica) and concealed inside foliage. The nest territory is well-guarded and crows and kites driven away. This falcon has been documented to nests in trees amidst dense human population. The clutch consists of two to four eggs which are incubated only by the female which begins after the last egg of the clutch is laid. The eggs hatch after about 32 to 34 days and the newly hatched young are covered in white down and are brooded by the female for a week. The male brings food which is torn by the female and fed to the chicks. The young fledge in about 35 to 37 days in Africa and up to 48 days in India.|$|R
