40|$|AURORA is a vision-based system {{designed}} to warn a vehicle driver of possible impending road-way departure accidents. It employs a downward looking color video camera with a wide angle lens, a digitizer, and a portable Sun Sparc workstation. Using a binormalized <b>adjustable</b> <b>template</b> correlation algorithm, it reliably detects lane markers on structured roads at 60 Hz. A time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) measurement is calculated for each image based on the estimation of vehicleâ€™s lat-eral position and velocity. This measurement is used to trigger an alarm when the TLC falls below a preset threshold. Promising results have been achieved {{under a variety of}} weather and lighting conditions, on many road types. 1...|$|E
40|$|We employ {{distances}} as {{a second}} dimension for transfer function (hereafter TF) specification. Distances refer to selected reference shapes. When distance-based TFs are applied to medical volume data and anatomic structures as reference shapes, they can support diagnostic procedures and therapy planning. As an example, distance-based TFs {{may be used to}} explore the neighborhood of a tumor which is essential to assess whether a surgical removal is feasible. In this paper, we discuss methods to specify 2 d distance-based TFs, the use of predefined but <b>adjustable</b> <b>templates</b> to reduce the interaction effort and an efficient implementation of these TFs. ...|$|R
