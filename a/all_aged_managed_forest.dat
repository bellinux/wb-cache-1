40|$|The Oregon Coast Range {{supports}} some of {{the most}} dense and productive forests in North America. In the pre-harvest-ing period these forests arose as a result of large fires-the largest covering 330, 000 ha (Teensma and others 1991). These fires occurred mostly at intervals of 150 to 300 years. The natural disturbance regime supported a diverse fauna and large populations of anadromous salmonids (salmon and related fish). In contrast, the present disturbance re-gime is dominated by patch clearcuts of about 10 - 30 ha superimposed on most of the forest land with agriculture on the flats near rivers. <b>Ages</b> of most <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> are less than 60 years.

40|$|Canada’s forests play an {{important}} role in the global carbon (C) cycle because of their large and dynamic C stocks. Detailed monitoring of C exchange between forests and the atmosphere and improved understanding of the processes that affect the net ecosystem exchange of C are needed to improve our understanding of the terrestrial C budget. We estimated the C budget of Canada’s 2. 3 106 km 2 <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> from 1990 to 2008 using an empirical modelling approach driven by detailed forestry datasets. We estimated that average net primary production (NPP) during this period was 809 5 Tg C yr 1 (352 g C m 2 yr 1) and net ecosystem production (NEP) was 71 9 Tg C yr 1 (31 g C m 2 yr 1). Harvesting transferred 45 4 Tg C yr 1 out of the ecosystem and 45 4 Tg C yr 1 within the ecosystem (from living biomass to dead organic matter pools). Fires released 23 16 Tg C yr 1 directly to the atmosphere, and fires, insects and other natural disturbances transferred 52 41 Tg C yr 1 from biomass to dead organic matter pools, from where C will gradually be released through decomposition. Net biome production (NBP) was only 2 20 Tg C yr 1 (1 g C m 2 yr 1); the low C sequestration ratio (NBP/NPP 5 0. 3 %) is attributed to the high average <b>age</b> of Canada’s <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> and the impact of natural disturbances.

However, large aspen {{have largely been}} removed from <b>managed</b> <b>forests,</b> whereas regeneration and the long-term persistence of mature trees in protected areas are matters of concern. We recorded the numbers of mature (≥ 20 cm diameter) aspen in old-growth and <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> in eastern Finland, based on a large-scale inventory (11400 ha, 36000 living and dead trees). In addition, saplings and small aspen trees were surveyed on thirty-six 1 ha sample plots.

40|$|Although {{protected}} areas {{are central to}} global biodiversity conservation, off-reserve forests are increasingly recognized as potentially important {{for the long term}} conservation of biota, particularly in less-developed countries where communities rely directly on resources from natural areas. We assessed the conservation value of differently <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> for birds in lowland tropical forests of Nepal. In particular, we explored whether their conservation value was additional or complementary to those of formal {{protected areas}}. Using data collected from 112 sites in protected areas (n = 31), state <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> (n = 37) and community <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> (n = 44), we assessed how bird species richness, abundance, diversity and community composition varied among tenures. Although sites in protected areas had the greatest species diversity, community <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> supported a complementary assemblage. Of 124 species recorded, only 45 % were common to all management tenures. Overall, the distinctiveness and richness of species in sites in forests outside of protected areas contributed substantially to regional avifaunal diversity.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] carbon (C) density varies tremendously across space due to the inherent heterogeneity of forest ecosystems. Variation of forest C density is especially pronounced in mountainous terrain, where environmental gradients are compressed and vary at multiple spatial scales. Additionally, the influence of environmental gradients may vary with forest age and developmental stage, an important consideration as forest landscapes often have a diversity of stand ages from past management and other disturbance agents. Quantifying forest C density and its underlying environmental determinants in mountain terrain has remained challenging because many available data sources lack the spatial grain and ecological resolution needed at both stand and landscape scales. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if environmental factors influencing aboveground live carbon (ALC) density differed between young versus old forests. We integrated aerial light detection and ranging (lidar) data with 702 field plots to map forest ALC density at a grain of 25 m across the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, a 6369 ha watershed in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA. We used linear regressions, random forest ensemble learning (RF) and sequential autoregressive modeling (SAR) to reveal how mapped forest ALC density was related to climate, topography, soils, and past disturbance history (timber harvesting and wildfires). ALC increased with stand <b>age</b> in young <b>managed</b> <b>forests,</b> with much greater variation of ALC in relation to years since wildfire in old unmanaged forests. Timber harvesting was the most important driver of ALC across the entire watershed, despite occurring on only 23 % of the landscape. More variation in forest ALC density was explained in models of young <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> than in models of old unmanaged forests. Besides stand age, ALC density in young <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> was driven by factors influencing site productivity, whereas variation in ALC density in old unmanaged forests was also affected by finer scale topographic conditions associated with sheltered sites. Past wildfires only had a small influence on current ALC density, which may be a result of long times since fire and/or prevalence of non-stand replacing fire. Our results indicate that forest ALC density depends on a suite of multi-scale environmental drivers mediated by complex mountain topography, and that these relationships are dependent on stand age. The high and context-dependent spatial variability of forest ALC density has implications for quantifying forest carbon stores, establishing upper bounds of potential carbon sequestration, and scaling field data to landscape and regional scales...|$|R
40|$|The moist {{evergreen}} Afromontane {{forest of}} SW Ethiopia has become extremely fragmented and most remnants are intensively managed for cultivation of coffee (Coffea arabica). We investigated the distributions of epiphytic orchids in shade trees and their understory in forests with contrasting management intensity to determine biodiversity losses associated to coffee cultivation {{and to determine}} the capacity of coffee shrubs to act as refugia for orchid species. We surveyed epiphytic orchid diversity and abundance of 339 trees, in different tree zones and in the understory, in <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> and in natural forests. Coffee management {{was associated with a}} downward shift of orchid species as orchid species were occurring in significantly lower tree zones in <b>managed</b> <b>forest.</b> The number of shrubs in the understory of <b>managed</b> <b>forest</b> was not higher than in natural forests, yet orchid abundance was higher in the understory of <b>managed</b> <b>forests.</b> Local extinctions of epiphytic orchids and species losses in the outer tree zones (a contraction of habitat) in <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> are most likely driven by losses of large, complex-structured climax trees and changes in microclimate, respectively. Coffee shrubs and their shade trees in <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> are shown here to be a suitable habitat for only a limited set of orchid species. As farmers continue to convert natural <b>forest</b> into <b>forest</b> <b>managed</b> for coffee cultivation, further losses of habitat quality and collateral declines in regional epiphytic orchid diversity can be expected. Therefore, the conservation of epiphytic orchid diversity, as well as other components of diversity of the coffee forests, must primarily rely on avoiding coffee management intensification in the remaining natural forest. Convincing farmers to keep forest-climax trees in their coffee forest and to tolerate orchids on their coffee shrubs may also contribute to a more favorable conservation status of orchids in Ethiopian coffee agroecosystems. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|What makes virgin forests better forests? Biodiversity {{evaluation}} {{depends on}} the value systems of the stakeholders involved.

40|$|In SW Ethiopia, {{the moist}} {{evergreen}} Afromontane forest has become extremely fragmented {{and most of}} the remnants are intensively managed for coffee cultivation (Coffea arabica), with considerable impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Because epiphytic orchids are potential indicators for forest quality and a proxy for overall forest biodiversity, we assessed the effect of forest management and forest fragmentation on epiphytic orchid diversity. We selected <b>managed</b> <b>forest</b> sites from both large and small forest remnants and compared their epiphytic orchid diversity with the diversity of natural unfragmented forest. We surveyed 339 canopy trees using rope climbing techniques. Orchid richness decreased and community composition changed, from the natural unfragmented forest, over the large <b>managed</b> <b>forest</b> fragments to the small <b>managed</b> <b>forest</b> fragments. This indicates that both forest management and fragmentation contribute to the loss of epiphytic orchids. Both the removal of large canopy trees typical for coffee management, and the occurrence of edge effects accompanying forest fragmentation are likely responsible for species loss and community composition changes. Even though some endangered orchid species persist even in the smallest fragments, large <b>managed</b> <b>forest</b> fragments are better options for the conservation of epiphytic orchids than small <b>managed</b> <b>forests.</b> Our results ultimately show that even though shade coffee cultivation is considered as a close-to-nature practice and is promoted as biodiversity conservation friendly, it cannot compete with the epiphytic orchid conservation benefit generated by unmanaged moist evergreen Afromontane forests...|$|R

The common property approach is being propounded as a responsible method of sustainable forest management. Yet, as these case studies from India, Zimbabwe and East Asia point out, access to forest resources must be regulated, to avoid over-exploitation. The book reviews common property as a system of governance, and examines traditional systems that have survived or disappeared.

30|$|In Fennoscandia, it {{has been}} shown how the loss of natural {{structural}} elements in <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> has led to the decline of biodiversity (Auvinen et al. 2007; Kuuluvainen and Siitonen 2013). For example, in Finnish <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> the decline of dead wood amounts is estimated to be the main cause of species becoming threatened for one-third of the threatened forest species (over 500 species) (Rassi et al. 2010). In Finnish <b>managed</b> <b>forests</b> there are on average 4 – 6  m 3 ∙ha−[*] 1 of dead wood, which is less than 10 % of natural levels (Siitonen 2001). Obviously such low levels of dead wood are below the threshold of species that demand more natural deadwood habitat conditions (Nordén et al. 2013). The national and European Union -level ambitions to increase forest biomass harvesting to replace fossil fuels would likely lead to further decline in dead wood and related diversity in forests, as well as the forest carbon store and sink in short term at least (Helmisaari et al. 2014; EASAC 2017). Notably the dead wood levels in the <b>managed</b> boreal <b>forests</b> of eastern Canada are much higher compared with Fennoscandia, apparently due to differences in management and natural legacies (Table 1). However, these natural legacies of dead wood will probably decay and diminish with time and intensifying management, as has happened in Fennoscandian <b>managed</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|R
