40|$|Seven {{patients}} with amebic liver abscess presenting as pleuropulmonary disease were admitted to hospital initially because of pulmonary symptoms and {{were found to}} have amebic liver disease. Three categories of pleuropulmonary involvement included reactive inflammation of the pleura or lung, rupture of a hepatic abscess into the pleural space and rupture of a hepatic abscess into the bronchial airways. The preferred medical treatment is with metronidazole, but rupture of hepatic <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess</b> into the pleural space requires drainage in addition to medical therapy. In contrast, rupture into the bronchus may provide spontaneous drainage so that only medical therapy is needed. Recovery from amebiasis in all three categories is generally complete. Morbidity and mortality increase with failure to correctly identify amebic infection of the liver as the underlying cause.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Amebiasis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by Entamoeba histolytica. It most commonly results in asymptomatic colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, but some patients develop intestinal invasive or extra-intestinal diseases. Liver abscess {{is the most}} common extra-intestinal manifestation. The large number of clinical presentations of amebic liver abscess makes the diagnosis very challenging in non-endemic countries. Late diagnosis of the <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess</b> may lead to perforation and amebic peritonitis, resulting in high mortality rates. Case presentation This report describes a 37 -year-old white man, suffering from hepatitis B, with a gigantic amebic liver abscess presenting as an acute abdomen due to its rupture. Rapid deterioration of the patient's condition and acute abdomen led to an emergency operation. A large volume of free fluid together with debris was found at the moment of entry into the peritoneal cavity because of a rupture of the hepatic abscess at the position of the segment VIII. Surgical drainage of the hepatic abscess was performed; two wide drains were placed in the remaining hepatic cavities and one on the right hemithorax. The patient was hospitalized in the ICU for 14 days and for another 14 days in our department. The diagnosis of <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess</b> was made by the pathologists who identified E. histolytica in the debris. Conclusion Acute abdomen due to a ruptured amebic liver abscess is extremely rare in western countries where the parasite is not endemic. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are fundamental to preserving the patient's life since the mortality rates remain extremely high when untreated, even nowadays. </p...|$|E

40|$|Lymphocytes from {{patients}} cured of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses</b> proliferate and produce gamma interferon upon incubation with soluble Entamoeba histolytica antigen: however, <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses</b> exhibit a relentless progression without treatment.

In the presence of immune sera, E. histolytica antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation decreased by 63 % and production of gamma interferon was reduced by 93. 2 % (P less than 0. 01). Immune sera had no effect on the mitogenic responses of patient lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin or on the proliferative responses of control lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin or tetanus toxoid. The suppressive activity of immune sera diminished as the time between therapy for <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses</b> and serum collection increased (P less than 0. 05). Suppressive activity did not correlate with the titers of serum anti-amebic antibody and was not affected when serum was absorbed with viable amebic trophozoites. In conclusion, soluble factors present in the sera of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> patients suppressed in vitro lymphocyte responses to E. histolytica antigen and {{may have contributed to the}} lack of development of effective in vivo cell-mediated immune responses following the onset of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses...</b>|$|R

In the remaining three patients, surgical procedure would have been avoided if the correct diagnosis had been made. In fact, the preoperative diagnosis in five cases was acute appendicitis. All patients survived. The incidence of Entamoeba histolytica infestation is increasing in our community.

After intraportal inoculation of 10 (5) ameba trophozoites (6 and 24 hr), the ratio of gerbils with AAL, as well as the number and size of the microabscesses was comparable in eosinophilic and control gerbils. However, at 96 hr the number and size of the microabscesses were significanly smaller (p< 0. 05) in eosinophilic gerbils. On the other hand the actuarial AAL survival curve up to 45 days post-amebic inoculation was signficantly (p< 0. 05) shifted to the right in controls.

40|$|A noninvasive {{diagnostic}} test for <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> is needed, because <b>amebic</b> and bacterial <b>abscesses</b> appear identical on ultrasound or computer tomography {{and because it}} is rarely possible to identify Entamoeba histolytica in stool specimens from patients with <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Here we report a method of detection in serum of circulating E. histolytica Gal/GalNAc lectin to diagnose <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess,</b> which was used in patients from Dhaka, Bangladesh. The TechLab E. histolytica II test (which differentiates the true pathogen E. histolytica from Entamoeba dispar) detected Gal/GalNAc lectin in the sera of 22 of 23 (96 %) <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> patients tested prior to treatment with the antiamebic drug metronidazole and 0 of 70 (0 %) controls. After 1 week of treatment with metronidazole, 9 of 11 (82 %) patients became serum lectin antigen negative. The sensitivity of the E. histolytica II antigen detection test for intestinal infection was also evaluated. Antigen detection identified E. histolytica infection in 50 samples from 1, 164 asymptomatic preschool children aged 2 to 5 years, including 16 of 16 (100 %) culture-positive specimens. PCR analysis of stool specimens was used to confirm that most antigen-positive but culture-negative specimens were true-positive: PCR identified parasite DNA in 27 of 34 (79 %) of the antigen-positive, culture-negative stool specimens. Antigen detection was a more sensitive test for infection than antilectin antibodies, which were detected in only 76 of 98 (78 %) <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> patients and in 26 of 50 (52 %) patients with intestinal infection.

40|$|Twelve {{cases of}} liver abscess in {{children}} and adolescents presenting at Children’s Hospital at Los Angeles from 1974 to 1983 were reviewed. Most occurred in children younger than 5 years of age. The time from onset of symptoms to presentation did not differ over the 10 -year period ex-amined. However, diagnosis was made more rapidly {{in the latter half of}} the decade due to the development of advanced noninvasive imaging techniques and serologic methods. A constellation of fever, abdominal pain (whether or not localized in the right upper abdomen), vomiting or an-orexia, hepatomegaly, elevated white blood cell count and sedimentation rate, and an unexplained anemia should prompt the clinician to include occult liver abscess in the differential diagnosis and proceed to early use of ultrasound or isotopic liver-spleen scan.

Given the often nonspecific nature of the complaints related to <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess,</b> a retrospective review of patients with confirmed disease to recognize the most common patterns of presentation is useful. Here, we study the clinical presentations of 62 Thai patients with amebic liver abscess. We also compare the clinical presentations of Anti HIV seronegative and Anti HIV seropositive patients. Methods A retrospective case review was carried out for 62 Thai patients who had been diagnosed with amebic liver abscess. Clinical information was collected, including symptoms and signs, location and number of abscesses. The Anti HIV serology laboratory investigation was also reviewed. Results According to our study, the common clinical symptoms and signs are abdominal pain (85. 5 %), fever and chills (74. 2 %), and abdominal tenderness (69. 4 %). The location of the abscess was predominantly in the right lobe (74. 2 %), and most of patients had a single abscess (77. 4 %). Similar trends in clinical presentations were observed in both Anti HIV seropositive and Anti HIV seronegative subjects. Conclusions In conclusion, the clinical presentations of our amebic liver abscess patients were similar to those in previous reports.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesSplenic abscess is an {{uncommon}} disease, with a reported incidence of 0. 14 – 0. 7 % in autoptic series. The best treatment option remains unclear. We report {{our experience of}} percutaneous drainage of splenic abscess under ultrasound (US) guidance. MethodsFrom 1979 to 2005, 16 consecutive patients (12 male and four female; mean age 39. 9 years, range 16 – 72 years) were diagnosed with splenic abscess by means of US, and were treated with medical therapy alone or combined with US-guided percutaneous aspiration or catheter drainage. ResultsTen of 16 patients had bacterial abscesses (including one case of tubercular abscess), two had an <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess,</b> and four had fungal abscesses. Seven of ten patients with bacterial abscesses were successfully treated with fine needle aspiration alone, one patient was successfully treated with fine needle aspiration for one abscess and catheter drainage for another, and one patient, who subsequently required a splenectomy for an abdominal trauma, successfully underwent percutaneous catheter drainage alone. Four patients with fungal lesions were treated with medical therapy alone, and two patients later required a splenectomy. One patient with a bacterial abscess due to endocarditis was treated with medical therapy alone, and his recovery was uneventful. ConclusionsUS-guided percutaneous aspiration of splenic abscesses is a safe and effective procedure. It {{can be used as}} a bridge to surgery in patients who are critically ill or have several comorbidities. Percutaneous aspiration may allow complete non-operative healing of splenic abscesses or temporize patients at risk for surgery...|$|E
40|$|The noninvasive {{diagnosis}} of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> is challenging, as most {{patients at the}} time of diagnosis do not have a concurrent intestinal infection with Entamoeba histolytica.

A real-time PCR assay was evaluated for detection of E. histolytica DNA in blood, urine, and saliva samples from <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> as well as amebic colitis patients in Bangladesh. A total of 98 <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> and 28 <b>amebic</b> colitis patients and 43 control subjects were examined. The real-time PCR assay detected E. histolytica DNA in 49 %, 77 %, and 69 % of blood, urine, and saliva specimens from the <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> patients. For <b>amebic</b> colitis the sensitivity of the real-time PCR assay for detection of E. histolytica DNA in blood, urine, and saliva was 36 %, 61 %, and 64 %, respectively. All blood, urine, and saliva samples from control subjects were negative by the real-time PCR assay for E. histolytica DNA. When the real-time PCR assay results of the urine and saliva specimens were taken together (positive either in urine or saliva), the real-time PCR assay was 97 % and 89 % sensitive for detection of E. histolytica DNA in liver abscess and intestinal infection, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Previously, we {{reported}} {{the case of}} a man in the fourth decade of life afflicted with three independent episodes of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses</b> over a period of 4 years. Previous evidence has indicated that the cellular immune response is involved in protection against recurrent invasive amebic infection, and macrophage-mediated effector mechanisms appear important for host resistance to Entamoeba histolytica infection. The aim of the present work was to investigate locomotor activity and oxidative burst function of peripheral mononuclear cells of this individual after healing of the third <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> A locomotion assay using Boyden chemotaxis chambers and the respiratory burst evaluated by chemiluminescence were performed in both mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes. Levels of salivary IgA and serum IgG anti-amebic antibodies were followed during 48 months after the second <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Results obtained showed a deficiency in MP but not in PMN leukocyte respiratory burst.

40|$|Background: The non {{invasive}} {{diagnosis of}} amebic liver abscess allows {{the use of}} empirical therapy without the requirement of invasive diagnostic procedures. Aim: To determine the discriminatory capacity of clinical, laboratory and ultrasound studies for the etiological diagnosis of liver abscess. Patients and methods: Sixty one patients were initially included in this prospective study, but 12 did not comply with the inclusion criteria. Of the rest, 29 (59 %) had an amebic liver abscess, 16 (33 %) had a pyogenic liver abscess and four (8 %) had an abscess of mixed etiology. Blood cultures were done in 42 patients. Ultrasound guided needle aspiration was done in 7 patients with amebic liver abscess and 13 patients with non amebic liver abscess. Results: The clinical picture and ultrasound fndings were similar in all types of <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess.</b> ELISA test for IgG anti-Entamoeba histolytica antibodies were positive in 100 % of patients with amebic liver abscess. Antibodies measured by gel diffusion were positive in 93 %. All patients with mixed liver abscess had positive antibodies {{and some of them}} positive culture. Blood cultures were positive for anaerobic bacteria in five patients. Cultures of aspirated material were positive in 7 patients (obligate anaerobic bacteria in 3 and facultative anaerobic bacteria in the rest). The most common complications, whatever the etiology, were right pleural effusion and systemic inflammatory response. Conclusions: A final model of binomial regression analysis revealed that age under 40 years, an hematocrit greater than 35 % and an elevation in prothrombin time of less than 1. 5 seconds had enough discriminatory capacity for the diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess (Rev Méd Chile 2003; 131 : 1411 - 20) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a {{free-living}} <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> believed to have complicated a huge liver cyst. A 64 -year-old woman with complaint of right upper quadrant abdominal distention was admitted to our hospital and a huge liver cyst measuring 18 cm in diameter was observed on CT. However, since ultrasonography revealed a solid component like a septum, aspiration cytology and needle biopsy were performed. The aspirate was serous and dark reddish-brown. Histologically, many amoebas were detected and it was diagnosed as a free-living <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> instead of Entamoeba histolytica. She was treated with oral metronidazole and percutaneous drainage. However, a secondary infection occurred, and hepatectomy was ultimately performed. Our case is of interest because the inflammation response was not expected, the CT findings suggested a liver cyst, and because of the diagnosis of a very rare free-living <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> It is therefore necessary to keep the possibility of liver abscess in mind during the diagnosis of such cystic lesions. ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{our study}} was to obtain a highly conserved Entamoeba histolytica {{recombinant}} antigen for study as a subunit amebiasis vaccine. We screened a Uni-Zap cDNA library of E. histolytica (strain HM 1 :IMSS) with human immune sera and isolated a dominant 804 -bp cDNA clone. A 33 -kDa fusion protein expressed from the cDNA clone was determined by monoclonal antibody binding, DNA hybridization, and nucleotide sequence to be the complete E. histolytica 29 -kDa antigen. Serum antibodies to the recombinant protein were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 80 % of subjects from Egypt and South Africa with <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Similar results were found with the native 29 -kDa protein. Native and recombinant 29 -kDa antigens induced proliferation of lymphocytes harvested from patients with <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> (P < 0. 01 compared with controls). Intraperitoneal immunization of gerbils with the recombinant fusion protein (10 mg) with Titermax adjuvant elicited an antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin G antibody response and was partially protective (54 %) against intrahepatic challenge with 5 3 105 virulent axenic trophozoites (strain HM 1 :IMSS). In summary, the recombinant form of the E. histolytica 29 -kDa antigen demonstrated serologic specificity for <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess,</b> exhibited conserved T-cell epitopes, and was effective as a subunit vaccine in an experimental animal model of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Entamoeba histolytica is a widespread enteric protozoan tha...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Men {{are more}} than 7 {{times more likely to}} develop <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> or <b>amebic</b> {{dysentery}} caused by Entamoeba histolytica than women. Because the complement system could {{play a key role in}} controlling amebiasis, we determined whether serum from men and women differ in the ability to kill amebic trophozoites. We found that serum from women was significantly more effective in killing E. histolytica trophozoites than serum from men, and this killing was complement dependent. Our results provide a possible explanation for the differential susceptibility of men and women to <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> and <b>amebic</b> colitis. Amebic dysentery and <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1 Interestingly, the prevalence of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> and <b>amebic</b> dysentery is between 5 - and 7 -fold higher in men than women. 2 The reason for the greater susceptibility to disease in men is un-known, particularly because there does not seem to be a dif-ference between men and women in the rates of intestinal colonization by E. histolytica. 2 To invade through the intesti-nal mucosa and survive within the portal circulation to estab-lish infection within the liver, E. histolytica trophozoites must resist killing by complement. 1 We tested the hypothesis that differences between men and women in the efficiency of complement-mediated killing of amebic trophozoites might explain the varying susceptibility of the sexes to <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> and <b>amebic</b> colitis. We obtained serum samples from 100 consecutively en-rolled healthy volunteers from an area that is not endemic for amebiasis, and examined the efficiency of their sera in killing amebic trophozoites. Among the volunteers were 66 women and 34 men, who provided 84 samples (16 were technically unsuitable for study) for analysis. Informed consent was ob-tained from all individuals, and this study was approved b...|$|R
