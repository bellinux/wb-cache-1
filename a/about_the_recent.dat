5|$|Monk is briefly {{separated}} from the group after accidentally boarding the wrong train at Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. While reuniting with his partners he notices Steven Leight (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) being interviewed on a TV screen in Times Square <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> murder of his wife. Noticing Leight eating a mint from the same bar the ambassador had last been seen, Monk insists Steven Leight is the ambassador's murderer, {{despite the lack of}} supporting evidence. To support his theory, Monk proposes that Leight stole his wife's jewelry to stage a robbery, then proceeded to the bar before calling the police. He asserts Leight and the ambassador were wearing essentially identical coats, and that they must have been switched accidentally at the bar. As rain falls, Leight locates the ambassador's hotel room, and subsequently kills both him and his bodyguards, and switches the newly wet coat with his own.|$|E

The Blood Ravens 3rd company, led by Captain Gabriel Angelos, arrive on the planet and saves Brom and his remaining men, who then proceed to exterminate the remaining Orks in the vicinity. In the aftermath of the battle, Gabriel is joined by the Librarian Isador Akios. Brom asks Isador <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> sterilization of the planet Cyrene; however, Isador makes it clear this is not a permitted subject for discussion, particularly in Angelos' presence.

25|$|On 31 March, Hardy assumed {{command of}} his own and Desfourneaux's {{divisions}} at Cap-Français. Bertrand Clausel took over from Desfourneaux who was ill and Salme succeeded to the command of Hardy's division. Hardy's chief adversary was Christophe, perhaps the best of Louverture's generals. On 20 April Hardy wrote to Christophe, pointing out that several of Louverture's lieutenants had defected to the French and urging him to do the same. Christophe responded politely but he and his troops did not give up. By May Hardy pacified the northern region and established a civil administration. He wrote affectionately to his wife on 17 May <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> birth of their third son, saying that he was in good health. On 27 May 1802 he was stricken with yellow fever and died within a few hours. Another source asserted that Hardy died on 29 May. The fever killed most of the French army, including generals Leclerc, Debelle and Dugua. The Haitian armies, apparently on the verge of giving up, continued the war with renewed resolve. On 28 November 1803 Rochambeau surrendered 3,000 disease-ridden French survivors to a British force at Cap-Français. The last 1,200 French troops handed over Santo Domingo on 15 July 1809. HARDY is on Column 6 of the Arc de Triomphe.|$|E

500|$|It {{is likely}} that the KCA {{purchased}} a motorbike for Kenyatta, which he used to travel around both Kikuyuland and neighbouring areas inhabited by the Meru and Embu, helping to establish new KCA branches. In February 1928, he was part of a KCA party that visited Government House in Nairobi to give evidence in front of the Hilton Young Commission, which was then considering a federation between Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika. In June, he was part of a KCA team who appeared before a select committee of the Kenyan Legislative Council to express concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> introduction of Land Boards. Introduced by the British Governor of Kenya, Edward Grigg, these Land Boards sought to hold all land in native reserves in trust for each tribal group and would have the ability to regulate land exchange. Both the KCA and the Kikuyu Association expressed frustration at these Land Boards, which treated Kikuyu land as a collective entity rather than recognising the ownership of land by individual Kikuyu. Also in February, his daughter, Wambui Margaret, was born.|$|E
