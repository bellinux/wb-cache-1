5|$|After the C's <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> {{acquired}} by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1871, the PRR refurbished and operated the locomotive a few times for public displays: it was fired up for the Centennial Exposition in 1876 and again for the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in 1883. In 1884 the locomotive was purchased by the Smithsonian Institution as the museum's first major industrial exhibit.|$|E
50|$|Under IFRS, AFS <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> {{defined as}} being all {{financial}} assets {{that do not}} {{fall into one of}} the other classifications. As such, the treatment closely follows that of US GAAP. Gains or losses from revaluation of the <b>asset</b> <b>are</b> put through Other Comprehensive Income in Shareholders' Equity, except to the extent that any losses are assessed as being permanent and the <b>asset</b> <b>is</b> therefore impaired (under IAS 39, paragraph 58), or if the <b>asset</b> <b>is</b> sold or otherwise disposed of. If the <b>asset</b> <b>is</b> impaired, sold or otherwise disposed of, the revaluation gain or loss implicit in the transaction is recognised as a income or expense.|$|R
50|$|Liquidation of a {{partnership}} generally {{means that the}} <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> sold, liabilities are paid, and the remaining cash or other <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> distributed to the partners.|$|R
50|$|<b>Assets</b> <b>are</b> {{known as}} the raw {{materials}} of wealth, and they consist primarily of stocks and other financial and non-financial property, particularly homeownership. While these <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> unequally distributed, financial <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> much more unequal. In 2004, the top 1% controlled 50.3% of the financial assets while the bottom 90% only held 14.4% of the total US financial assets.|$|R
5|$|At Traherne's {{death in}} 1674 {{most of his}} manuscripts were bequeathed to his brother Philipp. After Philipp's death they {{apparently}} passed into the possession of the Skipps family of Ledbury in Herefordshire, where they languished for almost 200 years. In 1888 the family's <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> dissolved, yet the manuscripts did not re-emerge until 10 years later.|$|E
5|$|Competitive {{pressure}} and financial troubles {{resulted in the}} company's liquidation in 1928. The company’s <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> purchased by investors who formed The British Oliver Typewriter Company, which manufactured and licensed the machines until its own closure in the late 1950s. The last Oliver typewriter was produced in 1959.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese {{attack of}} the Dutch East Indies, KNILM was {{utilized}} for evacuation flights and transport of troops. KNILM could not operate in East Indies because of World War II and the ensuing Indonesian war for independence, and disbanded completely on 1 August 1947. Its remaining <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> transferred to KLM, which created the KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf (Interinsular Service).|$|E

5|$|In March 2001, all WCW <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> {{purchased}} by the then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) after AOL/Time Warner discontinued their involvement in wrestling programming.

5|$|When Shadow of Mordor was introduced, Monolith {{was accused}} by former Ubisoft {{employee}} Charles Randall of using assets (such as the protagonist-animation code) from Assassin's Creed II. Monolith responded that all their project's <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> developed from scratch; they had {{confidence in their}} originality, and the game was based upon the Nemesis system.|$|E
5|$|With {{the events}} of 11 September 2001, I Corps began {{providing}} support for Army units deploying {{in support of the}} War on Terrorism. Its <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> active in providing combat support and combat service support missions, including Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and the domestic Operation Noble Eagle.|$|E
50|$|In finance, {{a hidden}} <b>asset</b> <b>is</b> an <b>asset</b> that <b>is</b> not shown on a balance sheet. An {{example of such}} an <b>asset</b> <b>is</b> the US $15 billion that United Airlines' {{frequent}} flyer program, MileagePlus, {{was estimated to be}} worth when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|In particular, for a bank or a {{financial}} institution if the non-performing <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> high, their NIM will go down as the interest earning <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> that much reduced by non-performing assets.|$|R

5|$|A new factory was {{constructed}} at 230 Duffy Avenue, Hicksville, New York, to manufacture electron tubes and semiconductors. Miniature receiving tubes, magnetrons, X-ray tubes, Geiger-Muller tubes, and large transmitting tubes were also manufactured at this location. This location became the headquarters for North American Philips (NAP). The factory {{was completed in}} 1953 and closed in 1989. All <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> then sold to Richardson Electronics of rural Lafox, near Batavia, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Between August and September 1941, the Hawaiian Division's <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> reorganized to form two {{divisions}} {{under the new}} Triangular Division TO. Its brigade headquarters were disbanded and the 27th and 35th Infantry regiments {{were assigned to the}} new 25th Infantry Division. Hawaiian Division headquarters was redesignated as Headquarters, 24th Infantry Division on 1 October 1941. The 24th Infantry Division also received the Hawaiian Division's Shoulder Sleeve Insignia, which was approved in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{left behind}} $15,000 in debts, {{and with the}} nation still {{in the throes of}} the Panic of 1819, his <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> not enough to pay off the obligations. His wife, who also fell ill and was {{pregnant}} with the couple's sixth child, was so depressed because of his death and her subsequent financial straits that she suffered a miscarriage. She and the children moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale. For several years, she was dependent upon her in-laws for survival; Breckinridge's brother, Robert, assumed Cabell's debts, which he paid in full in 1832.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} Illiquid Assets to Total <b>Assets</b> should <b>be</b> at least 25%. In terms of Shari’ah, {{illiquid}} <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> all those <b>assets</b> that <b>are</b> not cash or cash equivalents. Therefore, inventory of raw material, work in process, among all other fixed <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> considered as illiquid whereas long term investments in interest based institutions {{are considered to}} be liquid in terms of Shari’ah.|$|R

50|$|A {{financial}} <b>asset</b> <b>is</b> a non-physical <b>asset</b> whose value <b>is</b> {{derived from}} a contractual claim, such as bank deposits, bonds, and stocks. Financial <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> usually more liquid than other tangible assets, such as commodities or real estate, and may be traded on financial markets.|$|R
5|$|Enron was {{estimated}} to have about $23 billion in liabilities from both debt outstanding and guaranteed loans. Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase in particular appeared to have significant amounts to lose with Enron's bankruptcy. Additionally, many of Enron's major <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> pledged to lenders {{in order to secure}} loans, causing doubt about what, if anything, unsecured creditors and eventually stockholders might receive in bankruptcy proceedings.|$|E
5|$|In 2100, 28 years later, the company's failed {{stocks and}} <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> bought by a Russian oligarch named Anatoly Korenchkin, a former black market {{operator}} {{who sought to}} make money in legitimate ways. He re-licensed and restored the company to its former status in the following decade. Along with producing healthcare and consumer products, Korenchkin signed weapons contracts with various military organizations, private and political-owned. The new UNN was almost virtually powerless with Korenchkin exercising control over them.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, NuScale's largest investor, Kenwood Group, was {{investigated}} by the Securities Exchange Commission and later plead guilty to operating a Ponzi scheme. The SEC investigation {{was not related to}} any of Kenwood's dealings with NuScale, but Kenwood's <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> frozen just as NuScale was expecting additional funding. The company started making staffing and pay cuts as executives looked for new funding sources and most of the company's employees were laid off within a few months.|$|E
50|$|Nontraded assets (or: nonmarketable assets or {{perfectly}} nonliquid <b>assets)</b> <b>are</b> <b>assets</b> that <b>are</b> not {{traded on}} the market.

5|$|In July 1999, York ceased {{ownership}} of Bootham Crescent when their real property <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> {{transferred to a}} holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings. Craig announced the ground would close by 30 June 2002, and under Batchelor York's lease was replaced with one expiring in June 2003. In March 2003, York extended the lease to May 2004, and proceeded with plans to move to Huntington Stadium under the {{ownership of}} the Supporters' Trust. The club instead bought Bootham Crescent in February 2004, using a £2million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF).|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{division}} did not fare well, though it improved quickly. Its anti-aircraft and armor <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> used as mobile artillery, which continuously pounded Chinese positions. The 45th, in turn, was under constant artillery and mortar attack. It also conducted constant small-unit patrols {{along the border}} seeking to engage Chinese outposts or patrols. These small-unit actions made {{up the majority of}} {{the division}}'s combat in Korea. Chinese troops were well dug-in and better trained than the troops of the inexperienced 45th, and it suffered casualties and frequently had to disengage when it was attacked.|$|E
5|$|Keynes was {{ultimately}} a successful investor, {{building up a}} private fortune. His <b>assets</b> <b>were</b> nearly wiped out following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, {{which he did not}} foresee, but he soon recouped. At Keynes's death, in 1946, his net worth stood just short of £500,000 – equivalent to about £11 million ($16.5 million) in 2009. The sum had been amassed despite lavish support for various good causes and his personal ethic which made him reluctant to sell on a falling market, in cases where he saw such behaviour as likely to deepen a slump.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond {{creating}} {{the most basic}} <b>asset,</b> it <b>is</b> also possible to make assets either divisible or callable. If an <b>asset</b> <b>is</b> made divisible (or callable) upon its initial issuance, it must always be divisible (or callable) with every issuance thereafter. A divisible user-created <b>asset</b> <b>is,</b> like, bitcoin and XCP, divisible up to 8 decimal places. A callable <b>asset</b> <b>is</b> an <b>asset</b> which the issuer can call back (i.e. repurchase) from its owners at a date (...) and for a price (...) specified at the initial issuance.|$|R
50|$|GFCF is not {{a measure}} of total investment, because only the value of net {{additions}} to fixed <b>assets</b> <b>is</b> measured, {{and all kinds of}} financial <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> excluded, as well as stocks of inventories and other operating costs (the latter included in intermediate consumption). If, for example, one examines a company balance sheet, {{it is easy to see}} that fixed <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> only one component of the total annual capital outlay.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Asset</b> price {{inflation}} <b>is</b> an economic phenomenon denoting {{a rise in}} price of assets, as opposed to ordinary goods and services. Typical <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> financial instruments such as bonds, shares, and their derivatives, as well as real estate and other capital goods. Although the values of such <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> often casually said to [...] "inflate," [...] {{this should not be}} confused with inflation as a defined term. A more accurate description for an increase in the value of a capital <b>asset</b> <b>is</b> appreciation.|$|R
