DESIGN Case-control study. ANIMALS Plasma samples from 42 horses (25 with atrial fibrillation and 17 without cardiovascular or systemic disease [control group]). PROCEDURES Results of hematologic tests (ie, plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations, prothrombin and <b>activated</b> <b>partial</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>times,</b> and antithrombin activity) in horses were recorded to assess coagulation and fibrinolysis. Historical and clinical variables, as associated with a hypercoagulable state in other species, were also recorded. RESULTS Horses with atrial fibrillation and control horses lacked clinical signs of hypercoagulation or thromboembolism. Compared with control horses, horses with atrial fibrillation had significantly lower antithrombin activity. No significant differences in plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations and prothrombin and <b>activated</b> <b>partial</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>times</b> existed between horse groups. In horses with atrial fibrillation versus control horses, a significantly larger proportion had an abnormal plasma D-dimer concentration (10 / 25 vs 2 / 17), test results indicative of subclinical activated coagulation (18 / 25 vs 6 / 17), or abnormal coagulation test results (25 / 121 vs 7 / 85), respectively.

40|$|Severe fever with {{thrombocytopenia}} syndrome (SFTS) is {{an emerging}} infectious disease that was recently identified in China, South Korea and Japan. The {{objective of the}} study was to evaluate the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of SFTS in South Korea. SFTS is a reportable disease in South Korea. We included all SFTS cases reported to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) from January 2013 to December 2015. Clinical information was gathered by reviewing medical records, and epidemiologic characteristics were analyzed using both KCDC surveillance data and patient medical records. Risk factors for mortality in patients with SFTS were assessed. A total of 172 SFTS cases were reported during the study period. SFTS occurred throughout the country, except in urban areas. Hilly areas in the eastern and southeastern regions and Jeju island (incidence, 1. 26 cases / 105 person-years) were the main endemic areas. The yearly incidence increased from 36 cases in 2013 to 81 cases in 2015. Most cases occurred from May to October. The overall case fatality ratio was 32. 6 %. The clinical progression was similar to the 3 phases reported in China: fever, multi-organ dysfunction, and convalescence. Confusion, elevated C-reactive protein, and prolonged <b>activated</b> <b>partial</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>times</b> were associated with mortality in patients with SFTS.

Microscopically, numerous amastigote-laden macrophages were seen in histologic sections of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes; fewer parasite-laden macrophages were in the bronchial-associated lymphoid tissues and renal glomeruli. Hematological findings included thrombocytopenia (terminal), neutropenia, and lymphopenia. Blood lymphocyte blastogenesis in response to concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin was decreased markedly at day 24 post-infection (PI).

Clotting titration curves of heparinized baboon blood demonstrate an anticoagulant effect of protamine {{that is not}} seen with recombinant platelet factor 4.

After 30 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass, recombinant platelet factor 4 normalized thrombin <b>times</b> and <b>activated</b> <b>partial</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>times</b> within 5 minutes of injection, but protamine did not.

However, the increase in plasma C 3 a was small and neither drug caused {{a significant increase in}} plasma neutrophil elastase-α 1 proteinase inhibitor complex. We conclude that recombinant platelet factor 4 is effective and safe in baboons, does not have an anticoagulant effect with excess concentration, and reverses in vivo heparin more rapidly than protamine.

METHODS: The turbidities of 20 normal plasmas and 16 reconstituted lyophilised plasmas were determined by comparing a 1 in 4 dilution in distilled water with a standard suspension in an Aminco Fluorocolorimeter (American Instrument Co) in nephelometric mode. The turbidities of five other plasmas were determined before and after lyophilisation. The turbid components of fresh and reconstituted lyophilised plasmas were studied using electron microscopy. The effects of turbidity on five types of coagulometer were determined by adding varying concentrations of a turbidity enhancing material. RESULTS: Reconstituted lyophilised plasmas were more turbid than normal plasmas, because of agglomerated liposomes. Serum depleted of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins was not rendered more turbid by lyophilisation. Three out of five types of automated coagulometer tested gave <b>activated</b> <b>partial</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>times</b> which were appreciably affected by plasma turbidity. One of the instruments was unable to detect a clot in a moderately turbid plasma. A second instrument gave results which were significantly affected by turbidity.

Although thromboembolic events have complicated support with these devices, the HeartMate left ventricular assist device developed by Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc., Woburn, Massachusetts, was specifically designed with a textured blood-contacting surface to minimize this risk. Clinical experience with this device has been encouraging, inasmuch as minimal thromboembolic complications have occurred {{despite the absence of}} anticoagulation. The coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways in these individuals were investigated to better understand the hematologic status of patients treated with the Thermo Cardiosystems device. Despite apparently normal prothrombin and <b>activated</b> <b>partial</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>times,</b> as well as platelet counts, evidence of significant thrombin generation and fibrinolysis was present. To eliminate underlying cardiac failure as the responsible factor for these abnormalities, we made similar measurements in patients with end-stage heart failure who were not supported by an assist device or anticoagulation. These measurements revealed no evidence of thrombin generation or fibrinolysis. These data demonstrate that patients supported with a left ventricular assist device, while successfully sustained without systemic anticoagulation, nevertheless have evidence of activation of coagulation. These phenomena appear {{to be related to the}} presence of the device rather than to the underlying cardiac abnormalities. Although procoagulant and fibrinolytic pathways are apparently balanced in these patients, these data underscore the potential for the development of bleeding or thrombosis in clinically relevant settings.
