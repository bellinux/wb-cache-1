The series has been described by the British Film Institute as having [...] "created a phenomenon unlike any other British TV programme", and by The Times newspaper as [...] "quintessential to being British". Newman had long been a science-fiction fan: [...] "p to the age of 40, I don't think there was a science-fiction book I hadn't read.

[...] Robert Garland, in the New York Journal American suggested that Rodgers and Hammerstein [...] "had confused allegro [...] with, say, lento, which means 'slow', 'unhurried', and even downright 'serious'". [...] Critic George Jean Nathan, {{in a special}} piece in the Journal American, decried [...] "such hokum mush as the familiar wedding scene and {{the ghost of a}} mother who returns at intervals to keep her son from error, but a cocktail party chatterbox number paraphrased from an old Noël Coward movie, a college number dittoed from an earlier George Abbott one, and various other elements hardly rivaling the daisy in freshness". [...] In Theatre Arts, Cecil Smith called Allegro [...] "acceptable only as an exercise in stagecraft, not as a work of art... Allegro fails where Our Town succeeded... Joseph Taylor, Jr.'s life has little or nothing to tell us <b>about</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> lives." [...] Louis Kronenberger of New York P.M. called the show [...] "an out-and-out failure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later in December, {{there was}} {{controversy}} regarding Obama's admissions {{of drug use}} as a teen. Obama first publicly acknowledged the issue in his 1995 book, Dreams from My Father. In the book, Obama said [...] "Pot had helped, and booze. Maybe a little blow when you could afford it." [...] The issue was revived {{on the campaign trail}} after a November 2007 speech at a New Hampshire high school. Obama told the students, [...] "I've made some bad decisions that I've actually written about," [...] noting that his [...] "drinking and experimenting with drugs" [...] accounted for a lot of [...] "wasted time" [...] in high school. Some, including Republican candidate Mitt Romney, criticized Obama for discussing these examples with students. Romney said that [...] "in order to leave the best possible example for our kids, we're probably wisest not to talk <b>about</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> indiscretions in great detail." [...] However, fellow GOP candidate Rudy Giuliani and Partnership for a Drug-Free America president Stephen J. Pasierb praised Obama's candor. [...] "I respect his honesty," [...] Giuliani said. Pasierb told CNN that [...] "really the truth works best" [...] when discussing drug use with kids. Bill Shaheen, the co-chairman of Clinton's campaign in New Hampshire, mentioned the drug use in a December 12 conference call with reporters. Shaheen said that if Obama were to win the nomination, Republicans would use Obama's admissions against him in a general election. He suggested that in such a scenario, Republicans would ask, [...] "'When was the last time? Did you ever give drugs to anyone? Did you sell them to anyone?'" [...] He added that such [...] "Republican dirty tricks" [...] would be difficult to overcome. The comments immediately caused controversy, and Shaheen resigned the next day. Clinton denounced the comments and personally apologized to Obama. Her spokesman said that she [...] "made it clear that this kind of negative personal statement has no part in this campaign." [...] Appearing on Hardball with Chris Matthews, Axelrod accused the Clinton campaign of giving a [...] "wink and a nod" [...] to negative tactics. He criticized Clinton's December 3 statement in which she signaled a more aggressive approach and called it the [...] "fun part" [...] of the campaign. Axelrod said that the signal should come [...] "from the top" [...] that the campaigns will not be waged [...] "in the gutter." ...|$|E
