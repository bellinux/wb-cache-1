5|$|The {{discovery}} of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the {{discovery of}} the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. Finally, the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome. This project was essentially completed in 2003, with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in <b>a</b> <b>globalized</b> effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.|$|E

25|$|Italy and Lebanon {{are linked}} by an ancient friendship, which finds {{its roots in}} their common Mediterranean heritage, their antique civilizations and {{thousands}} of years of common history, intense trade relations and deep cultural and human exchanges. In the 16th century, the special relationship between Emir Fakhreddine and the Medicis family of Tuscany was instrumental in forging modern Lebanon as we know it today, which is a unique mixture of Western and Arabic cultures. Lebanon also left important traces in Italy’s history: in 1584 the Maronite College was founded in Rome, fostering contacts between clergymen, researchers and young students, which today is being continued under the framework of Inter-University cooperation. This excellent level of bilateral relations between Italy and Lebanon is reinforced today by the common views of the two countries on a number of Middle East issues, and by the growing awareness that in <b>a</b> <b>globalized</b> world the two shores of the Mediterranean sea share the same destiny.|$|E
500|$|Mark Gevisser {{writes that}} the Kremlin's backing of the law was {{reflective}} of a [...] "dramatic tilt toward homophobia" [...] in Russia {{that began in the}} years preceding the law's passage.

[...] He writes: [...] "Many Russians feel they can steady themselves against this cultural tsunami by laying claim to 'traditional values,' of which rejection of homosexuality is the easiest shorthand. This message plays particularly well for a government wishing to mobilize against demographic decline (childless homosexuals are evil) and cozy up to the Russian Orthodox Church (homosexuals with children are evil)." ...|$|E

According to Debora Halbert, {{author of the book}} The State of Copyright: The Complex Relationships of Cultural Creation in <b>a</b> <b>Globalized</b> World, Golden Sounds are not the original creators of the chorus too, since it has been adapted from [...] "military marches of unknown origins that go back as far as World War II." ...|$|E
500|$|The phrase's literal use extends {{into the}} 21st century, with Sara Boyce of the Children's Law Centre in Northern Ireland drawing {{on it to}} {{advocate}} for the legal rights of the region's children. The 2008 book Child Labour in <b>a</b> <b>Globalized</b> World used the phrase {{to call attention to}} the role of debt bondage in child labor. Sara Dillon of Suffolk University Law School used the phrase [...] "What about the children" [...] in her 2009 book, International Children's Rights, to focus on child-labor program conditions. Benjamin Powell used the phrase differently in his book, Out of Poverty: Sweatshops in the Global Economy, writing that in the absence of child labor some youth faced starvation. In a 2010 book on human rights, Children's Rights and Human Development, child psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry used the phrase [...] "think of the children" [...] to urge clinicians to incorporate a process sensitive to developmental stages when counseling youth.|$|E

Olympus demonstrates all too painfully how much Old Japan tolerates a lack of accountability among senior executives; inadequate disclosure; a disinclination to challenge authority and absolute deference to corporate boards regardless of share performance." [...] While he also observed that {{the independence of the}} directors was inadequate, he said Japanese executives were much more moderately paid compared to American ones. [...] "Shareholders assume directors are smart, devoted people working for the good of Japan Inc. Tough questions are rarely asked." [...] Errol Oh of The Star said a company apology for a fall in the share price [...] "trivialises the possible wrongdoings and misplaces emphasis on an effect rather than the cause ... Takayama's remark on the 'inconvenience' of a fall in share price reflects a common flaw in the mindset of the people who run listed companies. Somehow, they {{lose sight of the fact}} that they manage businesses, not share prices." ...|$|E

500|$|The novel also {{deals with}} the issue of globalisation. Courteau {{observed}} that although Little Bee learns English from newspapers she acquires at the English detention centre, her reference points are still Nigerian, and thus through her narrative voice Cleave [...] "illustrates the forcible dislocations of <b>a</b> <b>globalized</b> world." [...] Cleave chose to explore the issue in The Other Hand as he believes that, although globalisation is frequently discussed, people rarely consider its meaning. He explained: [...] "money can move freely across national borders, but people can't. They're actively prevented from going where the money is. Capital is global, but labour isn't. I believe that's the cause of two major crises that we're involved in as a species – one is a financial crisis and one is a refugee crisis. Imagine a world where money can't move, where capital is stuck in its country of origin, but people can freely move where the work is! That's an alternate interpretation of globalization that would solve a lot of problems." [...] Although Cleave did not intend for the novel to be heavily political, he felt it was important to raise the issue, given the refugee subject matter of The Other Hand.|$|E
