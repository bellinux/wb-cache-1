40|$|Traditionally, the {{adrenal gland}} has been {{considered}} an important endocrine component of the pathway to inhibit acute inflammation via hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) -mediated secretion of glucocorticoid. Immunoreactive CRH found in inflamed tissues is <b>a</b> potent <b>proinflammatory</b> factor. Using genetic and pharmacological models of CRH deficiency, we now show that CRH deficiency unmasks <b>a</b> major <b>proinflammatory</b> effect of epinephrine secreted from the adrenal medulla. Together, epinephrine and peripheral CRH stimulate inflammation, and glucocorticoid acts as a counterbalancing force in this regard. Our findings suggest that stimulation of the acute inflammatory response should be included with the other “fight-or-flight” actions of epinephrine...|$|R

50|$|According to {{this theory}} the {{effector}} {{function of the}} immune response is mediated by the glycans (polysaccharides) displayed by the cells and humoral components of the immune system.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{myocardial}} structure, cardiomyocyte function, and intramyocardial signaling {{were shown to}} be specifically altered in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). A new paradigm for HFPEF development is therefore proposed, which identifies <b>a</b> systemic <b>proinflammatory</b> state induced by comorbidities {{as the cause of}} myocardial structural and functional alterations. The new paradigm presumes the following sequence of events in HFPEF: 1) a high prevalence of comorbidities such as overweight/obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and salt-sensitive hypertension induce <b>a</b> systemic <b>proinflammatory</b> state; 2) <b>a</b> systemic <b>proinflammatory</b> state causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation; 3) coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation reduces nitric oxide bioavailability, cyclic guanosine monophosphate content, and protein kinase G (PKG) activity in adjacent cardiomyocytes; 4) low PKG activity favors hypertrophy development and increases resting tension because of hypophosphorylation of titin; and 5) both stiff cardiomyocytes and interstitial fibrosis contribute to high diastolic left ventricular (LV) stiffness and heart failure development. The new HFPEF paradigm shifts emphasis from LV afterload excess to coronary microvascular inflammation. This shift is supported by a favorable Laplace relationship in concentric LV hypertrophy and by all cardiac chambers showing similar remodeling and dysfunction. Myocardial remodeling in HFPEF differs from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, in which remodeling is driven by loss of cardiomyocytes. The new HFPEF paradigm proposes comorbidities, plasma markers of inflammation, or vascular hyperemic responses to be included in diagnostic algorithms and aims at restoring myocardial PKG activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: HMGB 1 (amphoterin) is a 30 -kDa heparin-binding {{protein that}} mediates transendothelial {{migration}} of monocytes and has proinflammatory cytokine-like activities. In this study, we have investigated proinflammatory activities of both highly purified eukaryotic HMGB 1 and bacterially produced recombinant HMGB 1 proteins. Mass {{analyses revealed that}} recombinant eukaryotic HMGB 1 has an intrachain disulphide bond. In mass analysis of tissuederived HMGB 1, two forms were detected: the carboxyl terminal glutamic acid residue lacking form and a full-length form. Cell culture studies indicated that both eukaryotic and bacterial HMGB 1 proteins induce TNF- � secretion and nitric oxide release from mononuclear cells. Affinity chromatography analysis revealed that HMGB 1 binds tightly to <b>proinflammatory</b> bacterial substances. <b>A</b> soluble <b>proinflammatory</b> substance was separated from the bacterial recombinant HMGB 1 by chloroform-methanol treatment. HMGB 1 interacted with phosphatidylserine in both solid-phase binding and cell culture assays, suggesting that HMGB 1 may regulate phosphatidylserinedependent immune reactions. In conclusion, HMGB 1 polypeptide has <b>a</b> weak <b>proinflammatory</b> activity by itself, and it binds to bacterial substances, including lipids, that may strengthen it...|$|R

IL- 1 is <b>a</b> pleiotropic <b>proinflammatory</b> cytokine; however the {{mechanisms by which}} increased IL- 1 signaling promotes autoreactive T cell activity are not clear. Here we show that autoimmune-prone NOD and IL- 1 receptor antagonist-deficient C 57 BL/ 6 mice both produce high levels of IL- 1, which drives autoreactive effector cell expansion. IL- 1 beta drives proliferation and cytokine production by CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) FoxP 3 (-) effector/memory T cells, attenuates CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) FoxP 3 (+) regulatory T cell function, and allows escape of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (-) autoreactive effectors from suppression. Thus, inflammation or constitutive overexpression of IL- 1 beta in a genetically predisposed host can promote autoreactive effector T cell expansion and function, which attenuates the ability of regulatory T cells to maintain tolerance to self...|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>proinflammatory</b> {{cytokine}} may {{be present}} in adipose tissues. Adipocytes generate TNF-α and other interleukins. Cytokines derived from adipose tissue serve as remote regulators such as hormones. Studies have shown that TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations are elevated in obesity. Obesity leaves an excess of nutrients for the body, thereby causing adipocytes to release more proinflammatory cytokines. Classically activated macrophages in the visceral fat accumulate in the fat tissues and continuously release proinflammatory cytokines, causing chronic inflammation in obese individuals.|$|E
