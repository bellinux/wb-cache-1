The screen then fades to black.|$|E
25|$|When Napoleon's Grand Army finally {{occupies}} {{an abandoned}} and burning Moscow, Pierre takes {{off on a}} quixotic mission to assassinate Napoleon. He becomes anonymous in all the chaos, shedding his responsibilities by wearing peasant clothes and shunning his duties and lifestyle.

25|$|The {{next morning}} during roll call, Miklós finds Saul {{and tells him}} that he needs a {{replacement}} body, {{similar to the one}} Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the Kaddish. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> him, the only time he is shown with a smile. As the boy runs away, guards run past {{in the direction of the}} shed. Gunfire echoes as the camera follows the boy into the woods.|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Shaun Silva, was filmed in Paris, London, and Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The Union Station hotel is featured as {{a train station}} in the video. Kelley explained that the director decided to shoot parts of the music video in Europe because he wanted the video to be [...] "as authentic as possible". The video begins with a young woman, Joy, played by actress Danielle Donn, entering a train and discovering an iPad in her backpack. The iPad has a video of her lover with a sign written in French words that mean [...] "Don't forget about me," [...] and also some videos of the couple's travels throughout London, Paris, and Berlin, after which the couple bid each other farewell. A subsequent scene shows Joy's boyfriend finding her sitting on a train seat and they share a kiss. Joy is then seen awoken from sleep as a man named Brady, who looks exactly like the boyfriend in Joy's dream, sits next to her. Brady apologizes for waking her and asks if she minds if he sits next to her. The two make introductions, and Joy mentions her dream. Brady then takes out his iPad case (exactly the same case as the one Joy had in her dream), <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> her. Joy smiles back, having experienced this deja vu moment. The group members are seen singing at a Tennessee train station, and on the train itself.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{telling a story}} about a very famous Hollywood actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, {{standing}} on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!" [...] She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E

2500|$|The video {{features}} Yamaguchi in {{the role}} of a black shawled ferryman, transporting a woman played by Ayami Nakajō across a darkened lake. As they progress across the lake, there are flashbacks to a [...] "painful story" [...] between her and a man, played by Akira Kameyama. Later in the video, the woman is shown embracing the man as he lies collapsed on a skating rink. He appears on the boat, and she reaches out and touches him, but he is no longer there. She sees him standing {{on the edge of the}} lake, <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E

60|$|Young Calidore is {{paddling}} o'er the lake; His healthful spirit {{eager and}} awake To feel {{the beauty of}} a silent eve, Which seem'd full loath this happy world to leave; The light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly.

Scarce can his clear and nimble eye-sight follow The freaks, and dartings of the black-wing'd swallow, Delighting much, to see it half at rest, Dip so refreshingly its wings, and breast 'Gainst the smooth surface, and to mark anon, The widening circles into nothing gone.|$|E

6000|$|Upon {{the first}} point, also, letters from Mary soon enlightened him. It {{appeared}} that {{shortly after his}} departure Sir Jonah, in a violent fit of rage, brought on by drink and a remark of his wife's that had she married Colonel Monk she [...] "would have been a happy woman," [...] burst a small blood-vessel in his head, with the strange result that from a raging animal of a man he {{had been turned into}} an amiable and perfectly harmless imbecile. Under so trying a domestic blow, naturally, Mary explained, Colonel Monk felt it to be his duty to support and comfort his old friend to the best of his ability. [...] "This," [...] added Mary, [...] "he does for about three hours every day. I believe, indeed, that a place is always laid for him at meals, while poor Sir Jonah, for whom I feel quite sorry, although he was such a horrid man, sits in an armchair <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> him continually." ...|$|E
6000|$|But my {{aunt was}} a woman who flew from one subject to another, and she had already ceased to think of me. She was in the hall. [...] "The dear old home?" [...] she cries, though she had been in it but once before, {{regarding}} lovingly each object as her eye rested upon it, nay, caressingly when she came to the great punch-bowl and the carved mahogany dresser, and the Peter Lely over the broad fireplace. [...] "What memories they must bring to your mind, my dear," [...] she remarks to her husband. [...] "'Tis cruel, as I once said to dear papa, that we cannot always live under the old rafters we loved so well as children." [...] And the good lady brushes away a tear with her embroidered pocket-napkin. Tears that will come in spite of us all. But she brightens instantly <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> the line of servants drawn up to welcome them. [...] "This is Scipio, my son, who was with your grandfather when your father was born, and before." [...] Master Philip nods graciously in response to Scipio's delighted bow. [...] "And Harvey," [...] my aunt rattles on. [...] "Have you any new mares to surprise us with this year, Harvey?" [...] Harvey not being as overcome with Mrs. Grafton's condescension as was proper, she turns again to Mr. Carvel.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then comes his bath, {{and there}} is a sad display of want of faith upon his part. He enjoys the process, but he is {{convinced}} that only his own exertions keep him from drowning, so his little fists are desperately clenched, his legs kick up and down the whole time, and he watches every movement of mother and nurse with suspicion. He enjoys being dressed, <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> first, and then he suddenly remembers that he has not had his breakfast. Then the smiles vanish, the small round face grows so red and angry, and all covered with little wrinkles, {{and there is}} a dismal wailing--poor darling! If the bottle is not instantly forthcoming he will howl loudly, and beat the air with his fists until he gets it. He DOES remind me so of his father sometimes. He is always hunting for his bottle, and will seize my finger, or a bit of my dress, or anything, and carry it to his mouth, and when he finds it isn't what he wants, he throws it away very angrily. When finally he does get the bottle, he becomes at once the most contented being in the whole world, and sucks away with such great long pulls, and such dear little grunts in between. Then afterwards, a well-washed, well-fed atom, he is ready to look about him and observe things. I am sure that he has his father's brains, and that he is storing up all sorts of impressions and observations for future use, for he notices EVERYTHING. I used to think that babies were stupid and indifferent--and perhaps other babies are--but HE is never indifferent. Sometimes he is pleased and amused, and sometimes angry, and sometimes gravely interested, but he is always wide awake and taking things in. When I go into his room, he always looks at my head, and if I have my garden hat with the flowers, he is so pleased. He much prefers chiffon to silk.|$|E
