40|$|Acinetobacter baumannii, an {{opportunistic}} ESKAPE pathogen, causes respiratory and {{urinary tract}} infections. Its prevalence increases gradually {{in the clinical}} setup. Pathogenicity of Acinetobacter is significantly influenced by its ability to infect and survive in human pulmonary cells. Therefore, {{it is important to}} study the infection of A. baumannii in human pulmonary host cell (A- 549), monitoring surface interacting and internalized bacteria. It was found that during infection of A. baumannii, about 40 % bacteria adhered <b>to</b> <b>A-</b> 549, whereas 20 % got internalized inside pulmonary cell and induces threefold increase in the reactive oxygen species production. We have synthesized polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) -capped AgNPs using chemical methods and tested its efficacy against carbapenem-resistant strain of A. baumannii. PVP-capped silver nanoparticles (PVP-AgNPs) (30 [*]µM) have shown antibacterial activity against carbapenem-resistant strain of A. baumannii and this concentration does not have any cytotoxic effect on the human pulmonary cell line (IC 50 is 130 [*]µM). Similarly, PVP-AgNPs treatment decreases 80 % viability of intracellular bacteria, decreases adherence of <b>A.</b> baumannii <b>to</b> <b>A-</b> 549 (40 [*]to 2. 2 %), and decreases intracellular concentration (20 to 1. 3 %) of A. baumannii. This concludes that PVP-AgNPs can be developed as a substitute for carbapenem to control the infection caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii...|$|R

40|$|The aminocatechol A- 3253 {{is active}} against several {{pathogenic}} fungi, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus albidus, and Aspergillus niger. A- 3253 interferes {{with both the}} in vitro biosynthesis of (1, 3) -beta-glucan and the activity of topoisomerases I isolated from Candida spp. It is likely that {{one or more of}} the enzymes involved in glucan biosynthesis rather than topoisomerase I is the primary intracellular target of A- 3253, since a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking topoisomerase I is as susceptible <b>to</b> <b>A-</b> 3253 as cells containing wild-type levels of topoisomerase I.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{plethora of}} {{evidence}} has recently accumulated {{to suggest that}} Rab guanosine triphosphates (GTPases) may have functions other than those originally proposed in vesicle formation, movement, docking, and fusion. Studies have shown, for example, that Rab proteins interact with actin filaments and microtubules, illustrating cross-talk between intracellular transport and cytoskeletal dynamics. In this report, we show that Rab 4 A associates with adherens junction signaling proteins in the testis. By immunoprecipitation, Rab 4 <b>A</b> was found <b>to</b> interact with <b>a-</b> and b-catenin {{as well as with}} actin, vimentin, a- and b-tubulin, and protein kinase C (PKC) a and-e. Additionally, administration of Adjudin to adult rats upregulated the Rab 4 A level, which coincided with the loss of spermatocytes, round and elongating/elongated spermatids from the seminiferous epithelium. More importantly, the ability of Rab 4 <b>A</b> <b>to</b> associate with <b>a-</b> and b-catenin increased during Adjudin-induced junction restructuring in the testis, illustrating that Rab 4 A 2 catenin interactions are likely {{to be involved in the}} disassembly of Sertoli– germ cell contacts.

Specific gravity, Atterberg limits, compaction, California bearing ratio (CBR), unconfined compression and permeability tests were conducted on each of the soil-RAP blends. Results obtained show that as RAP content in the blend increased, the plasticity index, optimum moisture content, maximum dry unit weight, swell potential, unconfined compressive strength and permeability decreased while the specific gravity, soaked and unsoaked California bearing ratios increased. These results indicate that RAP effectively improved, especially, the plasticity and permeability of the soil.
