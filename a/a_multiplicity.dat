5|$|Sited {{adjacent}} to Housing and Development Board apartment {{blocks of the}} Marine Parade Housing Estate, the Marine Parade Community Building {{could be seen as}} an attempt to engage the wider community. The activities of the community building were planned to overlap and to coalesce, as a one-stop destination for the entire family. The rich congruence of the multiple programmes for the building is expressed architecturally as a collage of diverse elements. The building was designed by a local architectural firm, William Lim Associates, which adopted a postmodern pluralist approach, expressed through <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity</b> of materials and forms.|$|E
5|$|The vault of {{the nave}} rises steeply {{in a simple}} quadripartite form, {{in harmony with the}} nave arcade. The eastern end of the choir was {{extended}} and the whole upper part elaborated {{in the second quarter of}} the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity</b> of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of the aisles of the choir also have a unique pattern.|$|E

25|$|Bergson {{responds}} {{by saying}} that the antinomies are the result of analysis, not intuition. An example of this is Duration itself, which Bergson maintains isn’t <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity</b> or a unity. Depending on the viewpoint from which one begins, he will either reconstruct the absolute Duration as a unity or <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity.</b> Hence the antinomy of substance pluralism and substance monism, which can only be resolved through showing they are two representations of the same thing via a simple act of intuition. Thus real philosophy consists in placing oneself above the fray of oppositional schools of thought.|$|E
25|$|There have {{traditionally}} been several races at each event for various classes of motorcycles, based on engine size, and one class for sidecars. Classes for 50 cc, 80cc, 125cc, 250cc, 350cc, and 500cc solo machines have existed at some time, and 350cc and 500cc sidecars. Up through the 1950s {{and most of the}} 1960s, four-stroke engines dominated all classes. In part this was due to rules, which allowed <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity</b> of cylinders (meaning smaller pistons, producing higher revs) and <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity</b> of gears (giving narrower power bands, affording higher states of tune). In the 1960s, two-stroke engines began to take root in the smaller classes.|$|E
