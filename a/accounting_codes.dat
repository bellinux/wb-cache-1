Additionally, a pair of NA-16s were purchased directly from North American to act as prototypes. The first of these two aircraft was the fixed undercarriage NA-16-1A (similar in design to the BT-9); the second was the retractable undercarriage NA-16-2K (similar to the BC-1). These two aircraft were also known by their NAA project <b>accounting</b> <b>codes</b> (NA-32 for the NA-16-1A and NA-33 for the NA-16-2K) sometimes leading to confusion; these <b>accounting</b> <b>codes</b> (or [...] "charge" [...] codes) were used internally by NAA to track their projects and were not the actual aircraft model numbers. During August 1937, the NA-16-1A arrived in Australia and, following its re-assembly, flew {{for the first time}} at Laverton on 3 September of that year, exactly two years before war was declared on Nazi Germany by the United Kingdom and France. During September 1937, the NA-16-2K arrived in Australia and likewise flew shortly afterwards.

Overhead charges are not applied to hours worked by contracted labor, which represent a substantial amount of work.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{introduce}} the AAAJ special issue on “Accounting as codified discourse”, explicate the idea of codification and locate {{the notion of a}} “codified discourse” within the broader tradition of discourse studies in management. Design/methodology/approach – The approach is conceptual and discursive, and provides a theoretical framework for understanding codification and a discursive context for the accepted papers in this special issue. Findings – Theoretically, consideration of the more determinate relationship between codified discourse and practice can add to the general understanding of the discourse/practice dynamic in organisation studies. Several issues are identified that call for further empirical investigation. First, some of the broad-spectrum <b>accounting</b> <b>codes</b> (e. g. historic cost) are currently under review in the expectation that change will enable constructive accounting innovation. Second, the impact of more codified accounting on management practice in organisations requires evaluation. Third, how far “intangibles” and “externalities” can be codified is a pertinent current agenda. Fourth, work is needed on whether and to what extent professional power is curtailed when politicians and policy makers introduce more codified discourses. Research limitations/implications – Currently “codification” is not well understood in the literature. This AAAJ special issue opens up the debate but there remains considerable scope for future work to take this agenda forward – to enable more detailed understanding of accounting as codified discourse. Originality/value – Although “discourse studies” and “discourse analysis” are now firmly embedded in the organisational/management literature, “codified discourses” have not featured in the debate. This is a significant omission as codification is a key feature of many discourses – especially in professional fields like accounting, law, and medicine. Moreover, codified discourses are becoming more widespread. The value of this paper lies in its exposition of accounting as codification in relation to discourse.

Treatment costs were estimated based on AR-DRG cost <b>accounting</b> <b>codes</b> assigned to each patient hospital episode. Results: A total of n= 114 patients with deep surgical site infection were identified. The majority of patients (74 %) were first treated with debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR), which was successful in eradicating the infection in 60. 3 % of patients with an average cost of $ 13, 187. The remaining first treatments were 1 -stage revision, successful in 89. 7 % with average costs of $ 27, 006, and 2 -stage revisions, successful in 92. 9 % of cases with average costs of $ 42, 772. Multiple treatments following 'failed DAIR' cost on average $ 29, 560, for failed 1 -stage revision were $ 24, 357, for failed 2 -stage revision were $ 70, 381 and were $ 23, 805 for excision arthroplasty. Conclusions: As treatment costs in Australia are high primary prevention is important and the economics of competing treatment choices should be carefully considered. These currently vary greatly across international settings. © 2013 Merollini et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

IRS obligated and expended available Information Technology Investment Account (ITIA) appropriations in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 to pay for external business systems modernization costs. In fiscal years 1999 and 2000, IRS expended about $ 12. 8 million and $ 120. 2 million, respectively, of ITIA appropriations and, as of September 30, 2000, had an additional $ 66 million of ITIA appropriations obligated to modernize its external business systems. IRS' use of ITIA appropriations appears to be for no purposes consistent with the fiscal year 1998 and 1999 appropriations acts and within the $ 249 million approved ITIA expenditure plans. IRS used its information systems (IS) appropriations and other appropriations to fund {{both internal and external}} business systems modernization costs. IRS paid its internal business systems modernization costs from its appropriations for IS; Tax Law Enforcement; and Processing, Assistance, and Management. However, the amount of these costs is unknown because IRS did not have a cost accounting system in place to track its internal costs for business systems modernization. IRS initiated actions in fiscal year 2000 to begin tracking its internal costs associated with specific projects through the use of project <b>accounting</b> <b>codes</b> in conjunction with its time and attendance reporting. However, these actions were not fully implemented during GAO's review. In addition, IRS used its IS appropriations to fund some external business systems modernization costs. IRS also expended $ 48. 6 million of IS appropriations to pay for external business systems modernization costs. Also during this period, IRS expended an additional $ 9. 3 million of IS appropriations for both modernization and nonmodernization costs but could not distinguish between the two. There were no instances in which IRS' internal controls failed to assure that expenditures against ITIA appropriations were for business systems modernization. However, GAO recently reported that, despite important progress, IRS has yet to fully implement the capabilities needed to effectively manage the business systems modernization program. In addition, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that internal controls for managing IRS' business systems modernization efforts were inadequate before the Business Systems Modernization Office began operations in July 2000 but have since improved. ...|$|E
