5|$|Occasionally <b>a</b> <b>hospice</b> will {{be unable}} to provide care to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue.

Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E

5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges <b>a</b> <b>hospice</b> can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E

5|$|Home Health Aide: The home health, or hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for <b>a</b> <b>hospice</b> patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every patient on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by the patient and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E
