40|$|This {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} describes {{the patterns of}} antibiotic use {{for the treatment of}} ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the Calgary Zone of Alberta Health Services. Timing, <b>appropriateness,</b> and duration <b>of</b> antibiotics were evaluated in two hundred consecutive cases of VAP derived from 4 adult intensive care units (ICU). Antibiotic therapy was initiated in less than 24 hours from VAP diagnosis in 83 % of cases. Although most patients (89 %) received empiric therapy that demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to the identified pathogens, only 24 % of cases were congruent with the 2008 Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (AMMI) guidelines. Both ICU (p= 0. 001) and hospital (p= 0. 015) mortality were significantly lower and there was a trend for shorter ICU length of stay (p= 0. 051) in patients who received appropriate versus inappropriate initial antibiotics. There were no outcome differences related to compliance with AMMI guidelines. This exploratory study provides insight into the use of antimicrobials for the treatment of VAP in a large Canadian health region.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} management {{options for}} limiting general practitioner use of open access radiology - a service {{for which there}} is increasing demand which is difficult to meet. In the current climate of cost containment, restriction of general practitioner access to these expensive diagnostic facilities has management appeal. However, it is difficult to justify blanket restriction of access to radiology services as {{there is no evidence that}} it would be economically or clinically sensible. An explicit quota system is unlikely to be feasible because of the small number of referrals made by general practitioners and the element of chance which will inevitably enter into the referral process. Managers should examine more closely the manipulation of incentives and costs which are used, often implicitly, to balance the conflicting desires of clinicians and managers. The best management option would appear to involve a re-evaluation of the role of the radiologist to include responsibility for managing the service. This should include <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriateness</b> of referral by reference to guidelines for investigation and the behaviour of acknowledged good practitioners...|$|E
40|$|To fill {{a gap in}} {{knowledge}} {{about the effectiveness of}} brief intervention for hazardous alcohol use among Indigenous Australians, we attempted to implement a randomised controlled trial in an urban Aboriginal Medical Service (AMS) as a joint AMS-university partnership. Because of low numbers of potential participants being screened, the RCT was abandoned in favour of a two-part demonstration project. Only 16 clients were recruited for follow-up in six-months, and the trial was terminated. Clinic, patient, Aboriginal health worker, and GP factors, interacting with study design factors, all contributed to our inability to implement the trial as designed. The key points to emerge from the study are that alcohol misuse is a difficult issue to manage in an Indigenous primary health care setting; RCTs involving inevitably complex study protocols may not be acceptable or sufficiently adaptable to make them viable in busy, Indigenous primary health care settings; and gold-standard RCT-derived evidence for the effectiveness of many public health interventions in Indigenous primary health care settings may never be available, and decisions about appropriate interventions will often have to be based on qualitative <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriateness</b> and evidence from other populations and other settings...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mental and {{physical}} health problems are common in people with substance misuse problems and medications are often required in their management. Given the extent of prescribing for service users who attend specialist addiction services, {{it is important to}} consider how prescribers in this setting assess the <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> service users' prescribed medications. Objective: To explore prescribers' views and experiences <b>of</b> assessing the <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> medications prescribed for service users coming in for treatment as well as the differences between prescribers. Setting: A specialist addiction service in the North of England. Method: A phenomenological approach was adopted. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four nurse prescribers and eight doctors. Data were analysed using thematic framework analysis. Main outcome measure: Prescribers' views and experiences <b>of</b> assessing the <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> prescribed medications. Results: <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> prescribed medications involved reviewing medications, assessing risk, history-taking, involvement of service users, and comparing guideline adherence and 'successful' prescribing. Doctors and nurse prescribers assessed the <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> medications they considered to be within their competency. Doctors provided support to nurse prescribers and general practitioners (GPs) when dealing with issues around prescribing. Conclusion: <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> prescribed medications is complex. The recent reduction in medical expertise in specialist addiction services may negatively impact on the clinical management of service users. It appears that there is a need for further training of nurse prescribers and GPs so they can provide optimal care to service users...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the frequency and}} type of drug related problems (DRPs) in geriatric patients (> 65 years), and to assess their contribution to hospital admission; to explore the appropriateness of drug therapy according to the Beers' criteria. Methods: Cross-sectional observational survey of 110 elderly patients admitted during three non-consecutive months to the geriatric ward of a university hospital. Explorative <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriateness</b> of drug therapy prior to hospital admission based on the Beers' criteria. Results: A DRP was the dominant reason for hospital admission in 14 out of the 110 patients (12. 7 %); for another 9 patients (8. 2 %), a DRP was partly contributing to hospital admission. For these 23 patients, adverse drug reactions and noncompliance {{were the most important}} types of DRPs. We found no relationship between drug related hospital admission and intake of a drug listed in the Beers criteria for inappropriate drug use in the elderly.

40|$|Objective: To develop valid, {{reliable}} {{criteria for}} assessing {{the appropriateness of the}} management of common ailments and nonprescription drug therapy in community pharmacies in the UK. Methods: The criteria were developed by an expert panel using the nominal group technique. The validity of the criteria was tested by surveying a random sample of pharmacists who were asked to rate the importance of each criterion on a semantic differential scale from 1 (low) to 7 (high). Subsequently, the reliability of the criteria was assessed: a random sample of pharmacists were each asked to apply the criteria to four vignettes of patient counseling on two separate occasions. Results: All assessment criteria exceeded our predefined level of face, content, and consensual validity. In reliability testing, the overall <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriateness,</b> along with five component assessment criteria, surpassed our predefined level of reliability. Three criteria, however, did not meet our predefined standard. These criteria were rational content of advice, rational product choice, and referral to another health professional. Conclusions: This represents the first systematic attempt to develop an instrument of general applicability {{for assessing the}} appropriateness of patient counseling and to subject it to rigorous validity and reliability testing. We suggest that further work is required to refine the criteria that did not meet reliability standards and to understand the decision-making processes underlying the assessment of vignettes of patient counseling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe way American {{medicine}} is practiced is changing rapidly. By {{the beginning of}} the next century, most Americans may be enrolled in for-profit managed care plans in which physicians are responsible for both a budget and a population of patients. As health care is revolutionized, the overriding issue is whether the mission of health care organizations will be simply to contain costs, or whether it will be to increase the value (i. e., the quality) that we get for the money we are willing to spend on health care. The {{purpose of this article is}} to illustrate for carotid endarterectomy how quality can remain on the health care reform agenda. Vascular surgeons must assume a leadership role, and they must be willing to alter their practice patterns. More specifically, they should: (1) support and facilitate the development of clinically-detailed multispecialty criteria that describe under what circumstances carotid endarterectomy is both appropriate and necessary; (2) support the development of a system for publicly reporting outcome data by physician and hospital; (3) support regionalization of carotid endarterectomy; (4) conduct a prospective <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriateness</b> before the procedure is performed; (5) consider changing the system by which carotid angiographies are read to increase their reliability; and (6) help develop a system to ensure that people who need carotid endarterectomy are offered the procedure.

40|$|Aim: to {{determine}} whether a program of optimization polypharmacy regimens by a multidisciplinary medical team would improve medication regimens appropriateness. Methods: Selection of 16 stamps each with a different patient with his combination of chronic diseases and his medication regimen from a database of general practice observatory. Analysis medication regimens by a pharmacologists team using an electronic thesaurus (Vidal), then optimization medication regimens by a multidisciplinaryteam with six doctors and one pharmacologist in two times : an individual <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriateness</b> with the MAI (Medication appropriateness index) grid, then a meeting expert group for proposals of medication regimen changes. Results: Among 11 stamps considered during review meeting, number of prescribed drugs was reduced 29 %. This reduction is linked to stop prescription in 2 / 3 of cases (with a median reduction of 3 drugs per prescription). The effect of optimization is an improvement of 46 % on drug-disease interactions and an improvement of 66 % on drug-drug interactions. The 4 main causes of inappropriate prescribing (11 proposed) are : therapeutic indication, effectiveness, dosage and distribution over 24 hours. Conclusion: This is an experimental study on real prescriptions from general practice, whose objective was to show the theoretical possibility of improving polypharmacy regimens. The limitations of this work are the incompleteness of medical records suggested to experts, the absence of prescriberâs arguments and the amount of work necessary for experts to get this result.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the reliability of the European version of the AEP (EU-AEP). Design. Nineteen English-language medical records were reviewed by a physician reviewer from each of six participating countries: Austria, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the UK. Each of the six reviewers was asked to assess the appropriateness of the 19 admissions and 31 hospitalization days (19 admission days and 12 randomly selected days of hospital stay, excluding days of discharge) using the revised review instrument. To evaluate inter-rater reliability, the Îº statistic was used to measure overall and pair-wise agreement for the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriateness</b> of admission and of day of care, respectively. Results. For admission, the overall Îº statistic among the six reviewers was 0. 64, with Îº values for each pair of reviewers in the range 0. 46 - 0. 86. For day of care, the Îº was 0. 59, with pair-wise Îºcoefficients in the range 0. 25 - 0. 95. Conclusion. The observed agreement could be considered substantial, especially if the fact that medical records were handwritten in a language native to only one of the reviewers is considered.

In Italy elderly h ospital admissions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary (COPD) disease {{is one of}} the chosen indicators to measure the appropriate use of services. This study describes the characteristics of hospital admissions at a regional level for COPD â DRG 88 and to evaluates their relationship with other indicators linked to the provision of hospital or community care services. Methods Data on hospital admissions for COPD in the years 2006 and 2011 were collected from hospital discharge records. Correlations among acute in-patients admission rates by Italyâs Regions and provision of Long Term Care (LTC) services have been analyzed through univariate and multivariate linear regression models. Results The national rate of hospitalization for COPD decreased from 2006 to 2011 (- 35 %). The COPD in-patient admission rate showed a weak inverse relation with the provision of LTC that was statistically significant only for 65 - 74 age-group in 2006. The reduction was greater than 60 % for those under the age of 75 and around 14 % for those over 74 years. The inclusion in the interpretative model the rate of beds per capita in and the rate of General Practitioners improves the percentage of variability between the regions in the rate of hospitalization for the DRG 88 explained by the model itself. Conclusion The reduction in hospitalizations for COPD in the over-fifty age group is particularly noticeable; it seems mainly related to factors other than to the operation of those services outside the hospital. </p...|$|E
40|$|Virtual {{patients}} {{represent a}} useful tool in teaching students clinical reasoning skills. Virtual Cases (www. e-kazuistiky. cz) represent a newly developed interactive problem-based learning system, drawing information from virtual clinics, covering different fields of internal medicine, generating sets of unique virtual patients according to user-predefined program settings (spectrum of diagnoses, number of patients and criteria for passing the course). Basic clinical information including personal data, medical history, symptoms, laboratory values, etc. is generated for each virtual patient. The main task for the student {{is to determine the}} optimal diagnostic algorithm (choose adequate diagnostic steps in the correct order), and to determine the correct diagnosis in each virtual patient. Results of diagnostics tests and clinical findings are presented utilising a multimedia presentation (images, video-sequences, audio-recordings).
