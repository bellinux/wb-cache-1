5|$|Following the Anschluss, the {{historical}} {{aim of the}} German nationalists who supported the union between Austria and Germany was completed. The pan-Germanists were then fully <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Nazi Party (NSDAP).|$|E
5|$|In June 1962, the Atomic Energy Commission {{released}} its custody and {{ownership of the}} weapons to the Air Force. The personnel and property of the later named Caribou Air Force Station were <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> adjacent Loring Air Force Base.|$|E
50|$|It quickly <b>absorbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> skin, {{replenishing}} {{moisture and}} creating a protective barrier on the skin to help prevent dehydration.|$|R
50|$|Lignosulphonates: Wood pulp derived polymers. Effective in all Portland cements {{and added}} in {{concentrations}} of 0.1% to 1.5% BWOC. It <b>absorbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> C-S-H gel and {{causes a change}} of morphology to a more impermeable structure.|$|R
50|$|Patients {{who have}} Endotine {{implants}} in their foreheads risk moving their newly adjusted tissues with relatively small movements {{just after the}} operation and before complete healing takes place. While <b>the</b> implant <b>absorbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> body, the Endotine generally {{does not support the}} very thick forehead flesh and heavy brows often seen in some overweight males.|$|R
5|$|In {{the adult}} fish, the four {{chambers}} are not {{arranged in a}} straight row but, instead form an S-shape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described {{as part of the}} aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having been <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller's fourth main philanthropy, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Foundation, {{was created}} in 1918. Through this, he {{supported}} work in the social studies; this was later <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Rockefeller Foundation. In total Rockefeller donated about $550 million.|$|E
5|$|The Society's medical {{collections}} were {{donated to}} the Warren Anatomical Museum around 1870, while its library was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Boston Medical Library in 1875.|$|E
50|$|After {{entering}} the intestines, the oxygen from <b>the</b> cocktail <b>absorbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> blood, where it stimulates metabolism, blood circulation, redox and the immune system. The activated metabolism also stimulates the digesting of other cocktail’s ingredients, thereby enhancing their medical action.|$|R
25|$|The Ink or Toner {{does not}} <b>absorb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> substrate, as does {{conventional}} ink, but forms a layer {{on the surface}} and may be fused to the substrate by using an inline fuser fluid with heat process (toner) or UV curing process (ink).|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the good}} {{permeability}} of blonanserin, the volume of distribution in {{the central nervous system}} is greater than that in the periphery (Vd central = 9500 L, Vd periphery = 8650 L) although it is slower to <b>absorb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> central compartment.|$|R
5|$|Alternatively dsRNA can be {{supplied}} without genetic engineering. One {{approach is to}} add them to irrigation water. The molecules are <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
5|$|Copper is a {{constituent}} of tobacco smoke. The tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals, such as copper {{from the surrounding}} soil into its leaves. These are readily <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> user's body following smoke inhalation. The health implications are not clear.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E

5|$|Ecgberht {{was unable}} to {{maintain}} this dominant position, and within a year Wiglaf regained the throne of Mercia. However, Wessex did retain control of Kent, Sussex, and Surrey; these territories were given to Ecgberht's son Æthelwulf to rule as a subking under Ecgberht. When Ecgberht died in 839, Æthelwulf succeeded him; the southeastern kingdoms were finally <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kingdom of Wessex after Æthelwulf's death in 858.|$|E
5|$|Ickenham had {{a parish}} council but came within the Uxbridge Rural District until 1925, {{when this was}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Municipal Borough of Uxbridge. This {{remained}} until 1965, when the borough {{was included in the}} newly established London Borough of Hillingdon. Within the borough of Hillingdon, Ickenham has its own ward, with Conservative Councillors John Hensley, Raymond Puddifoot and David Simmons representing it.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 the L was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Southern Railway, {{and began}} an upgrade programme. All locos & coaches were repainted in Southern Maunsell Green livery, the wagons were repainted in Southern Umber livery and track and {{buildings}} were improved. A fifth locomotive, Lew was purchased in 1925, with {{improvements to the}} original Manning Wardle design.|$|E

5000|$|Setting spray {{is used as}} {{the last}} {{step in the process}} of {{applying}} makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An alternative to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products are claimed to keep makeup from <b>absorbing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> skin or melting off.|$|R
5000|$|QR&O 20 {{defines a}} drug as [...] "a {{controlled}} substance... in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act" [...] {{or any other}} physiologically or psychologically impairing substance, except for alcohol, prohibited by the Chief of the Defence Staff. It defines [...] "use" [...] as any act of injecting, swallowing, inhaling, smoking, ingesting or otherwise <b>absorbing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> human body.|$|R
5|$|In September 1623, {{a second}} colony led by Governor-General Robert Gorges {{was created in}} the {{abandoned}} site at Wessagusset. This colony was rechristened as Weymouth and was also unsuccessful, and Governor Gorges returned to England the following year. Despite that, some settlers remained in the village and it was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{is a global}} issue since lead mining and smelting, and battery manufacturing/disposal/recycling, are common in many countries. Lead enters the body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled lead is <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> body; for ingestion, the rate is 20–70%, with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults.|$|E
5|$|No.80 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing of World War II. The {{unit was}} formed on 15May 1944 and {{eventually}} comprised three squadrons equipped with Spitfire fighter aircraft. The wing's headquarters was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> newly formed No. 11 Group on 30July 1945.|$|E
50|$|In masonry foundations, {{interior}} sealers {{will not}} provide permanent protection from water infiltration where hydrostatic pressure is present. However, interior sealers {{are good for}} preventing high atmospheric humidity inside <b>the</b> basement from <b>absorbing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> porous masonry and causing spalling. Spalling is a condition where constant high humidity or moisture breaks down masonry surfaces, causing deterioration and shedding of the concrete surfaces.|$|R

5|$|Plutonium-239 and 240 emit {{ionizing}} radiation {{in the form}} of alpha particles. Inhalation is the primary pathway by which plutonium enters the body, though plutonium can also enter the body through a wound. Once inhaled, plutonium increases the risk of lung cancer, liver cancer, bone cancer, and leukemia. Once <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> body, the biological half life of plutonium is about 200 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} saw {{its final}} {{action at the}} Battle of P'ohang-dong, fighting unsuccessfully to take the town from U.N. troops. Racked by U.N. naval and air forces and suffering extensive losses from continuous fighting, the regiment was forced to retreat from the P'ohang-dong battlefield. It moved north, joining a concentration of other KPA units, before being disbanded and <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> KPA's 12th Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of East Anglia was <b>absorbed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kingdom of England. Norfolk and Suffolk {{became part of}} the new earldom of East Anglia, when in 1017, Thorkell the Tall was made earl of East Anglia by Cnut the Great. The restoration of the ecclesiastical structure in the region saw the two former East Anglian bishoprics replaced by a single one based at North Elmham.|$|E
