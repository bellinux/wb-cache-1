During the 1960s the McMaster University Medical School pioneered problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials that have since been adopted by other programs and faculties within the university. PBL is now used in medicine, occupational therapy, physical therapy, nursing, midwifery, and other allied fields. Most medical schools in Canada and more than 80 percent of medical schools in the United States employ PBL in their curriculum, and many international universities do the same.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about Aboriginal culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E

40|$|Aims and Objectives: <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> refer <b>to</b> {{the manner}} in which {{students}} engage in learning tasks. Approaches encompass two signficant aspects of <b>learning</b> - motivation <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and the choice of learning strategies that students make. Research has identfied two distinctly different approaches that can be broadly categorised as deep or surface <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> A number of studies have established an association between deep <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and qualitatively better learning outcomes, which are characterised by a high level of understanding.

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between students' motivational goal orientation, {{their perceptions of the}} general education classroom learning environment, and deep <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> strategies. Participants (N =  494) were first- and second-year college students enrolled in any of the general education courses in higher education in Thailand.

Across different programs or even different instructors outcomes could be interpreted differently, leading to a difference in education, even though the same outcomes {{were said to be}} achieved. By outlining specific outcomes, a holistic <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> is lost. Learning can find itself reduced to something that is specific, measurable, and observable.

25|$|The book {{refers to}} the book of learning, however, for a {{university}} that sought to implement the Oxbridge traditions of teaching excellence, {{it is important to}} note that the La Trobe book, unlike Oxford, Cambridge, Sydney or Monash, does not contain clasps, which signifies that the book cannot be opened with ease. Its absence does not suggest that the La Trobian <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> is any less rigorous, rather, it represents a different approach towards knowledge that can only be seen in conjunction with the other heraldic symbols. That is, that learning and the pursuit of enlightenment is attained through the journey that one undertakes to achieve their desired outcome. Even then, the outcome at which one has reached, may not have been the outcome initially sought. Thus, it is the importance placed on the journey of learning, and what is derived from it, that forms the heart of the university philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Soloveitchik's four step {{scholarly}} <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> {{has influenced}} {{many of his}} students. The approach {{can be traced back}} to the approach of the Gaon of Vilna. The first step is concentrating on the text. This follows the Vilna Gaon's approach of carefully amending the texts of both exoteric (the Talmud) and esoteric works (for instance, the Torat Kohanim, Tosefta, Avot de-Rabbi Natan, etc.). The second step is knowing the physical reality of the objects described. Third is the conceptual analysis proffered by Rishonim. At this point he introduces an important distinction between Rishonim, which are primary sources, and must be mastered, even if one has to struggle to understand them; and Achronim, which are secondary sources, which can be exploited (if you find good material, use it, but if you don't understand it, don't spend too much time on it). The fourth and final step is sevarah, creating the intellectual framework underpinning the Torah.|$|E

Data was gathered through these students’ scores on the scale of “Deep <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> Learning” and “Surface <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> Learning”. Pre and post interviews were also conducted with the students. The results show that the change in students’ <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> varies from each other.

The third student maintained both “deep approach” and “surface approach” <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> The reason why two of the three students changed their <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> deeply is that through 5 E learning model, these students become active participants in the process of learning.

Secondly, it identifies contextual features surrounding these <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and which are central to an understanding of them. The paper suggests how these findings can be used immediately to make changes within teaching and assessment practice through a phenomenographic pedagogy which: seeks to make students' conceptions of the subject matter explicit; provides diagnostic tools for the identification of distinctively different conceptions of the subject and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning; and addresses issues of preconceptions and relevance within teaching and assessment.

Approach: The aim of this study was <b>to</b> investigate student <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> in physics. We explore whether different streams of study or exposure to different syllabi are associated with deep or surface <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> A total of 2, 030 first year physics students at an Australian metropolitan university over three different year cohorts and three streams completed an adaptation of the Study Processes Questionnaire (SPQ) which produces measures of Deep and Surface <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> Students studied within âAdvancedâ, âRegularâ and âFundamentalsâ streams, based upon prior experience in physics study.

Results: Findings show that the behavior of the mean scale scores for students in different streams in first year physics is in agreement with expectations; advanced streams reported higher levels of deep approaches while Fundamentals streams reported higher levels of surface approaches. Furthermore, different year cohort performance on the scales reflects changes in senior high school syllabus; with a new syllabus reflecting a shift toward more deep <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> Conclusion/Recommendations: It is promising to see that revision of syllabi has a direct impact upon student approaches learning.
