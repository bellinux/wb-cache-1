5|$|Generally, {{justice is}} costly to provide and many legal systems, {{especially}} in Asia, are fraught with {{issues such as}} weak legal institutions, corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges, excessive delays and limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>justice</b> stemming from high legal costs {{and the lack of}} legal aid. It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>justice</b> is key to advancing the rule of law.|$|E

5|$|Democratic Montana Senator Burton K. Wheeler {{was on the}} {{investigating}} {{committee and}} {{assumed the role of}} prosecutor when hearings began on March 12, 1924. Jess Smith had engaged in influence peddling before his suicide, conspiring with two other Ohioans, Howard Mannington and Fred A. Caskey, to accept payoffs from alcohol bootleggers to secure either immunity from prosecution or the release of liquor from government warehouses. Mannington and Caskey's residence became infamous as the Little Green House on K Street. Some witnesses, such as Smith's divorced wife Roxy Stinson, and corrupt former FBI agent Gaston Means, alleged that Daugherty was personally involved. Coolidge requested Daugherty's resignation when the Attorney General indicated that he would not allow Wheeler's committee <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>Justice</b> Department records, and Daugherty complied on March 28, 1924.|$|E

25|$|In Nicaragua, between 2000 and 2010, around 172,500 births were {{recorded}} for girls under 14, representing around 13% of the 10.3 million births during that period. These {{were attributed to}} poverty, laws forbidding abortion for rape and incest, lack of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>justice,</b> and beliefs held in the culture and legal system. A 1992 study in Peru found that 90% of babies delivered to mothers aged 12–16 were conceived through rape, typically by a father, stepfather, or other close relative. In 1991 in Costa Rica, the figure was similar, with 95% of adolescent mothers under 15 having become pregnant through rape.|$|E
25|$|Another {{component}} of devolved {{central government expenditure}} in Scotland is on justice.

Police Scotland is the territorial force responsible for law enforcement in Scotland. Since 2007, the SNP-led Scottish Government has remained committed to the 1,000 extra police officers pledge, with the force now having consistent funding for officer numbers to remain over the 17,200 mark and not to fall below that number. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) manages the prisons in Scotland, which collectively house over 8,500 prisoners.|$|E

25|$|In July 1996, Lord Woolf {{published}} <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>Justice,</b> {{a report}} on the accessibility of the courts to the public. Woolf identified civil litigation as being characterised by excessive cost, delay and complexity, and managed to replace the diverse rules with a single set of Civil Procedure Rules. Before Woolf had even published his final report, Sir Jeffery Bowman, the recently retired senior partner of PriceWaterhouse, was commissioned to write {{a report on}} the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal. Bowman noted a growing workload and delays, with 14 months between setting down and disposing of a case in 70 percent of cases, the rest taking even longer than that – some had taken five years. He recommended extending the requirement to ask leave to appeal to almost all Appeal cases, to allow certain appeals to be heard at a lower level, to focus procedure, impose time limits on oral arguments and move judicial time more towards reading and less towards sitting in court.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{specific}} rights apply in criminal cases. Persons in custody {{have the right}} to consult a solicitor by virtue of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>Justice</b> Act 1999 allows an individual to request confidential and free legal advice. The prosecution is under a common law duty to disclose all relevant evidence including that which may assist the defendant. The accused also benefits from a limited right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. Confessions are admissible as evidence under certain conditions laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The accused additionally benefits from a presumption of innocence. In discharging the burden of proof, the onus is on the prosecution as established in Woolmington v DPP. For example, in R v Wang it was held that it was never permissible for a judge to direct a jury to find a defendant guilty. There is also a right to jury trial, the accused should be able to follow proceedings and {{they have a right to}} be present during proceedings. The application of the double jeopardy rule was limited by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E
25|$|Articles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child {{prohibits the}} {{exploitation}} of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse {{can be considered a}} victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>justice,</b> with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that {{they have a right to}} assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and children at risk. Whether or not exploitation takes place in a context of trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the Fundamental Right {{of the people}} ́s <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Justice</b> System {{as one of the}} fundamental elements <b>to</b> achieve Social <b>Justice.</b> It presents theoretical considerations about the theme from a historical perspective of the category “access <b>to</b> the <b>Justice</b> System”, starting from the formation of the national States`s legal systems as to approach the theme studied in this paper. It demonstrates the importance of the French Revolution ́s ideals as the primary formal defense of human rights. It ́s ideals influenced the formation of later national legal systems, helping historically to approach “social justice” sustaining that without the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> all of the Human Fundamental Rights, Social Justice can ́t be achieved at all. It indicates the necessity of a new social organization (democratic, fair, and equal) for the plain achievement of human dignity, as a starting point <b>to</b> discuss social <b>justice</b> – in connection with the social struggle <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the Brazilian <b>to</b> <b>Justice</b> System, specifically in the State of Maranhão. This study demonstrates that the applicability of Social Rights is a sine qua non condition the applicability of the other Human Fundamental Rights. Finally, it presents as an alternative for facing the matter of the inaccessibility of the Human Beings` Fundamental Rights, the elaboration as well as the implementation of public policies directed to guarantee the plain, unrestricted, and efficient way to achieve the social right <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the <b>Justice</b> System...|$|R
