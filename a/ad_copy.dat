500|$|A {{believer in}} [...] "competitive {{cooperative}} consumerism", Romney {{was effective in}} his frequent appearances before Congress. [...] He discussed {{what he saw as}} the twin evils of [...] "big labor" [...] and [...] "big business", and called on Congress to break up the Big Three. [...] As the Big Three automakers introduced ever-larger models, AMC undertook a [...] "gas-guzzling dinosaur fighter" [...] strategy, and Romney became the company spokesperson in print advertisements, public appearances, and commercials on the Disneyland television program. [...] Known for his fast-paced, shirt-sleeved management style that ignored organization charts and levels of responsibility, he often wrote the <b>ad</b> <b>copy</b> himself.|$|E
500|$|Having a Rave Up was {{released}} in the US on 15 November 1965 by the Yardbirds' American label, Epic Records. The album cover photo shows the group posing in matching black suits in a mock performance; Yardbirds' biographer Adam Clayson compares it to [...] "more of a tea dance than a rave-up". [...] Clapton, who left the band eight months earlier, is not pictured on the album cover. The liner note reads like <b>ad</b> <b>copy,</b> with {{no mention of the}} band members or recording information. [...] The album entered Billboard magazine's Top LPs chart in December 1965 at number 137 and reached number 53 in February 1966. [...] In total, it spent 33 weeks in the chart. Having a Rave Up remained in print until 1972, longer than any other Yardbirds album on Epic.|$|E
500|$|Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush also commended [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] and its musical style, saying [...] "The song is {{infused with}} the tropical, island groove {{that she has}} {{explored}} on 'Loud' and which harks back to her upbringing in Barbados." [...] Sciarretto also noted that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] would be very popular in bars and clubs because of the lyrical content. Andy Gill of The Independent called the song an anthem with which the weekend can start. Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times said that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] is the best song on the album, saying [...] " [...] a wise, world-weary paean from a gal at the bar who's seen some stuff, has moved on and wants to buy everybody a round of fruity shots." [...] However, Chris Richards of The Washington Post stated that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] did not meet his expectations and commented that the song is a lowlight in Rihanna's career, stating [...] "'Turn it around with another round,' Rihanna bellows over the mid slog, as if setting <b>ad</b> <b>copy</b> to music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Director of {{publicity}} Claude Puech {{came up with}} humorous and inventive marketing campaigns. Robert Delpire of the Delpire Agency {{was responsible for the}} brochures. <b>Ad</b> <b>copy</b> came from Jacques Wolgensinger Director of PR at Citroën. Wolgensinger was responsible for the youth orientated [...] "Raids", 2CV Cross, rallies, the use of [...] "Tin-Tin", and the slogan [...] "More than just a car— a way of life". A range of colours was introduced, starting with Glacier Blue in 1959, then yellow in 1960. In the 1960s 2CV production caught up with demand. In 1966 the 2CV got a third side window, This window made them look slightly bigger in size. In February 1965 Citroën Belgium introduced the 3CV AZAM6 which featured the 602cc, 23PS Ami6 engine and the Ami's improved chassis. This version was manufactured until October 1967 and was also exported to certain continental markets although it was never offered in France.|$|E
