25|$|Prior to the {{deterioration}} of the rail network, Argentina had a greater number of rolling stock manufacturers which supplied trains and cars throughout the railways, however today only a few companies like Materfer, Grupo Emepa, TecnoTren and Fabricaciones Militares remain. While Materfer make the CMM 400-2 diesel multiple units and the MTF-3300 diesel cargo locomotives, Emepa manufacture the <b>Alerce</b> EMU/DMU which is to be used on the Belgrano Norte Line. At the same time, Fabricaciones Militares only makes freight cars, such as those used in the Belgrano Cargas network, though in the past they made electric trains for suburban and underground lines. There have been signs that the industry is reviving and expanding, {{while at the same time}} there are many workshops around the country which refurbish and modernise older rolling stock.|$|E
60|$|We stayed {{three days}} in this harbour, on one of which Captain Fitz Roy, with a party, {{attempted}} to ascend to the summit of San Pedro. The woods here had rather a different appearance from those on {{the northern part of}} the island. The rock, also, being micaceous slate, there was no beach, but the steep sides dipped directly beneath the water. The general aspect in consequence was more like that of Tierra del Fuego than of Chiloe. In vain we tried to gain the summit: the forest was so impenetrable, that no one who has not beheld it can imagine so entangled a mass of dying and dead trunks. I am sure that often, for more than ten minutes together, our feet never touched the ground, and we were frequently ten or fifteen feet above it, so that the seamen as a joke called out the soundings. At other times we crept one after another, on our hands and knees, under the rotten trunks. In the lower part of the mountain, noble trees of the Winter's Bark, and a laurel like the sassafras with fragrant leaves, and others, the names of which I do not know, were matted together by a trailing bamboo or cane. Here we were more like fishes struggling in a net than any other animal. On the higher parts, brushwood takes the place of larger trees, with here and there a red cedar or an <b>alerce</b> pine. I was also pleased to see, at an elevation of a little less than 1000 feet, our old friend the southern beech. They were, however, poor stunted trees, and I should think that this must be nearly their northern limit. We ultimately gave up the attempt in despair.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Alerce</b> Costero National Park (Parque Nacional <b>Alerce</b> Costero, [...] ) is a {{protected}} wild {{area in the}} Cordillera Pelada about 137 km from Valdivia and 49 km from La Unión. Fitzroya trees grow inside the protected area and give the area its name, with <b>Alerce</b> Costero translating as Coastal Fitzroya. The Natural Monument has a total area of 24,000 ha.|$|E
50|$|They are {{surrounded}} totally or partially by millennial <b>alerce</b> {{also known as}} larch forests. The <b>Alerce</b> tree is the second oldest tree species on the planet.

50|$|Lake Futalaufquen {{is located}} within the {{national}} park Los <b>Alerces.</b> It originates from a glacier, and is in a deep valley, the ancient remains of a large glacier that was there 10,000 years behind {{the end of the}} last ice age.|$|R
50|$|The partido is bordered to {{the north}} by the Cushamen Department, {{to the south and}} east by the Languiñeo {{department}} and to the west by Chile.

50|$|Meanwhile, Argentina {{has taken}} some actions to {{implement}} the national plans. These include monitoring in the Los <b>Alerces</b> National Park, new Huemul survey work in Estancia Los Huemules, and continued updating of a database of records maintained by the National Parks Administration for both protected and unprotected areas. Contributions {{have been made to}} a study of the phylogeography and demographic history of the Huemul by Bio-Bio University in Chile. Work has also been underway in Argentina to update the management plans for the Lanín National Park and the Andino Norpatagónica Biosphere Reserve, with specific reference to measures for Huemul conservation. A project proposal has been developed for controlling livestock in the area occupied by Huemuls in the Los <b>Alerces</b> National Park. Awareness activities have included public talks, production of a two booklet on the conservation of the species linked to the Andino Norpatagónica Biosphere Reserve, and posters distributed in three of the country’s National Parks.|$|R

It grows very slowly and belongs to the family Cupressaceae. The principal forest in the park, visited by tourists, is at Puerto Sagrario at the northern end of Lago Menéndez.

50|$|The Chilean myrtle grows along water {{currents}} in the Valdivian temperate rain forests in Chile, while in Argentina it grows from Neuquén {{south to the}} Chubut River. The main forests are on the Quetrihué Peninsula (Mapuche for 'myrtles') and on Isla Victoria on the Nahuel Huapi Lake, within the Los Arrayanes National Park and Nahuel Huapí National Park, respectively, in Argentina. It can be also found in lesser numbers along the Arrayanes River in Los <b>Alerces</b> National Park. Trees in these protected areas are up to 650 years old. The notable Chilean myrtle forest of the Los Arrayanes National Park covers 20 ha of the Quetrihué Peninsula, where the cinnamon-coloured myrtles leave almost no space for other trees.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Viola maculata Cav., Violaceae, {{grows in}} the {{underwood}} along the Los Andes mountain system from Neuquén to Tierra del Fuego and Islas Malvinas. It {{is also known as}} violeta amarilla or as pilundeu, and is used in popular medicine by the Mapuches as stimulant, in dermatology, and as a lavage in eye diseases. The aim of this work is to examine the morpho-anatomical traits of the leaves and petiole of V. maculata (collected at Parque Nacional Los <b>Alerces,</b> Patagonia, Argentina). Cross sections and scanning electron microscopy of leaves blade and petiole showed a simple organization with simple unicellular trichomes and cells containing tannins, and crystals of calcium oxalate mainly in the spongy parenchyma. As V. maculata is used in traditional medicine, the specification of the anatomical characters is relevant to describe the species...|$|R
