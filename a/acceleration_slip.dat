Near the trench a supershear rupture front emerges {{ahead of the}} main front, accompanied by an <b>acceleration</b> of <b>slip</b> rate up to ~ 6.5 m/s due {{to the effect of}} the free surface (Nielsen, 1998).

The model is applicable to a plate boundary where asperities are located sparsely but the afterslip associated with the rupture of an asperity can reach nearby asperities. Aftershock area expansion, which is conspicuous off Sanriku, is also explained by the model.

30|$|There {{are some}} other {{possible}} factors that may affect seismicity rate changes and/or occurrences of large earthquakes. The first is the contribution of dynamic stress changes (e.g., Hill et al., 1993; Anderson et al., 1994).

The second factor is pore pressure change. An <b>acceleration</b> of <b>slip</b> at the deeper plate boundary might cause excess fluid dehydration, affecting the seismicity in a tiny volume of the region studied. The third factor is the contribution of post-seismic slip along the plate boundary and large aftershocks, although the slip of aftershocks that occurred just after the mainshock is included.|$|R

From 1993 to 1997, sole engine for the Formula and Trans Am was the 5.7 L LT1 V8, essentially identical to the LT1 in the C4 Corvette except for more flow-restrictive intake and exhaust systems.Steering wheel audio controls were included with optional uplevel cassette or compact disc stereo systems. Beginning with 1994 model year cars, [...] "Delco 2001"-series stereo systems replaced the previous Delco units. This revised series, also introduced for other Pontiac car lines, featured ergonomically-designed control panels with larger buttons and an optional seven-band graphic equalizer. Also in 1994, the fourth-generation convertible was available; every Firebird (and Camaro) convertible featured a glass rear window with a built-in electric defroster. The 1995 models {{were the same as}} those of previous years, but traction control (ASR: <b>acceleration</b> <b>slip</b> regulation) was available for LT1 Firebirds, controlled by a switch on the console. The steering wheels in all Firebirds was also changed; their optional built-in audio controls were more closely grouped on each side. The [...] "Trans Am GT" [...] trim level was dropped from the lineup after its model year run in 1994. For 1995, all Trans Ams received 155-mph speedometers and Z-rated tires. 1995 was also {{the first year of the}} vented version of the Opti-Spark distributors on LT1 F-cars, addressing a common mechanical fault with the unit. The 'transmission perform' button was available only in the 1994 and 1995 Formula and Trans Am. This option was stopped for the 1996 and later models, but the connections remain for 1996 and 1997 Formula and Trans Am. While 1995 cars still used the OBD-I (on-board diagnostic) computer system (the last year of F-body to use OBD-I), a majority of them had OBD-II connector ports under the dash.Firebird performance levels improved for 1996, with the establishment of the stronger 200-hp 3.8 L V6 as the new base engine, and the power rating of the LT1 increased to 285 for 1996, due to its new dual catalytic-converter exhaust system. 1996 was also the first model year of the OBD-II computer system. Optional performance enhancements were available for each Firebird trim level; the Y87 performance packages for V6s added mechanical features of the V8 setups, such as four-wheel disc brakes, faster-response steering, limited-slip rear differential, and dual tailpipes. For Formulas and Trans Ams, functional dual-inlet [...] "Ram Air" [...] hoods returned as part of the WS6 performance package. The optional package boosted rated horsepower from 285 to 305, and torque from 325 lb·ft to 335. Also included were 17" [...] x 9" [...] wheels with 275/40ZR17 tires, suspension improvements, oval dual tailpipe tips, and a WS6 badge. Bilstein shocks were a further option with the package. The 1997 model year introduced standard air conditioning, daytime running lamps (utilizing the front turnsignal lamps), digital odometers, and optional 500-watt Monsoon cassette or compact disc stereo systems to all Firebird trim levels. For V6 Firebirds, a W68 sport appearance package was also introduced as a counterpart to the Camaro RS trim level. The WS6 [...] "Ram Air" [...] performance package was now also an option for the Formula and Trans Am convertibles, although these convertibles did not receive the 17-inch wheel-and-tire combination. There were 41 Formula convertibles and 463 Trans Am convertibles produced from 1996 to 1997 with the WS6 package.|$|E

The tasks of the strategy include controlling the slip ratio to make full use of the road grip and controlling the yaw rate to eliminate the lateral movement due {{to the difference between}} motor torques. The rate of the slip ratio change can be controlled by controlling the motor torque, so that the slip ratio can be controlled by applying a proportional-integral control strategy to control the rate of the slip ratio change. The yaw rate can be controlled to almost zero by applying torque compensation based on yaw rate feedback. A coordination control strategy for the slip ratio control and yaw rate control is proposed based on analysis of the priorities and features of the two control processes.

Because the adopted analytical expression for the state variable evolution controls the slip velocity time histories, we test different evolution laws to investigate slip duration and the healing mechanisms. We show that the classic slowness or slip laws do not yield fast restrengthening or self-healing, although they appropriately describe rupture initiation, propagation and the long-term restrengthening during the interseismic period. Self-healing rupture mode, yielding to short slip durations, has been obtained for homogeneous faults by modifying the evolution law introducing a fast restrengthening of dynamic traction immediately after the weakening phase.

With a view to illustrating the applicability of the mathematical model developed here, the analytic explicit expressions of axial velocity, wall shear stress, and fluid acceleration are given. The slip condition {{plays an important role in}} shear skin, spurt, and hysteresis effects. The fluids that exhibit boundary slip have important technological applications such as in polishing valves of artificial heart and internal cavities. The effects of slip condition, magnetic field, porous medium, and body acceleration have been discussed. The obtained results, for different values of parameters into the problem under consideration, show that the flow is appreciably influenced by the presence of Knudsen number of slip condition, permeability parameter of porous medium, Hartmann number of magnetic field, and frequency of periodic body acceleration. The study is useful for evaluating the role of porosity and slip condition when the body is subjected to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ...|$|R
