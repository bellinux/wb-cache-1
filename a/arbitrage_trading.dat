25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trading</b> desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E

500|$|The war's end {{swung the}} {{pendulum}} back. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed {{it after the}} war. Britain was an exception: it retained DST nationwide {{but over the years}} adjusted transition dates for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. Now under a European Community directive summer time begins annually on the last Sunday in March, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016). The U.S. was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden. Only a few U.S. cities retained DST locally thereafter, including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trading</b> with London, and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York. Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding opposed DST as a [...] "deception". Reasoning that people should instead {{get up and go to}} work earlier in the summer, he ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 08:00 rather than 09:00 during summer 1922. Some businesses followed suit though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model to {{determine}} the optimal investment time for energy storage systems (ESSs) in a price <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trade</b> application under conditions of uncertainty over future profits. The adoption of ESSs can generate profits from price <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trade,</b> which are uncertain because the future marginal prices of electricity will change depending on supply and demand. In addition, since the investment is optional, an investor can delay adopting an ESS until it becomes profitable, and can decide the optimal time. Thus, when we evaluate this investment, we need to incorporate the investorâ€™s option which is not captured by traditional evaluation methods. In order to incorporate these aspects, we applied real option theory to our proposed model, which provides an optimal investment threshold. Our results concerning the optimal time to invest show that if future profits {{that are expected to}} be obtained from <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trade</b> become more uncertain, an investor needs to wait longer to invest. Also, improvement in efficiency of ESSs can reduce the uncertainty of arbitrage profit and, consequently, the reduced uncertainty enables earlier ESS investment, even for the same power capacity. Besides, when a higher rate of profits is expected and ESS costs are higher, an investor needs to wait longer. Also, by comparing a widely used net present value model to our real option model, we show that the net present value method underestimates the value for ESS investment and misleads the investor to make an investment earlier...|$|R
40|$|Market {{participants}} and policymakers alike {{were surprised by}} the large, prolonged dislocations in credit market <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trades</b> {{during the second half}} of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In this paper, we examine three explanations proposed by market participants: increased idiosyncratic risks, strategic positioning by some market participants, and regulatory changes. We find some evidence of increased idiosyncratic risk during the relevant period but limited evidence of asset managers changing their positioning in derivative products. While we cannot quantify the contribution of these two channels to the overall spreads, the relative changes in idiosyncratic risk levels and in asset managers' derivatives positions appear small relative to the post-crisis increase in cost of capital. We present the mechanics of the CDS-bond <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trade,</b> tracing its impact on a stylized dealer balance sheet and the return-on-equity (ROE) calculation. We find that, given current levels of regulatory leverage, the CDS-bond basis would need to be significantly more negative relative to pre-crisis levels to achieve the same ROE target...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:â€ƒ The {{relationship}} between past {{net asset value}} returns and the current discount on investment trusts is investigated. The relationship is weaker for the component that is common to all trusts in the same sector, and is significantly stronger for more liquid trusts. The time lag before returns have their full impact on discounts {{is consistent with the}} requirements of distinguishing 'skill' from noise. Although discounts vary widely even within the same sector, the range of variation appears to be consistent with an arbitrage equilibrium, in which the profits of exploiting apparent pricing anomalies are just insufficient to invite <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trades.</b> Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2004. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} studies the general {{equilibrium}} implications of <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trades</b> by strategic players in segmented financial markets. Arbitrageurs exploit client`ele effects and choose {{to specialize in}} one category of trades, taking into consideration all other arbitrage strategies. This results in an equilibrium network of arbitrageurs. The optimal network for arbitrageurs is of the hub-spoke kind. The equilibrium network, in contrast, is never optimal for arbitrageurs and is never hub-spoke. The reason is that equilibrium networks suffer from a Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma problem that prevents network externalities from being internalized. We show that, {{as the number of}} intermediaries grows, equilibrium allocations converge to those of the frictionless complete-markets Arrow-Debreu economy...|$|R

50|$|When {{companies}} {{raise capital}} by offering stock {{on more than}} one exchange, the potential exists for discrepancies in the valuation of shares on different exchanges.

50|$|Covered {{interest}} arbitrage is an <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trading</b> strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on {{the interest rate}} differential between two countries by using a forward contract to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Using forward contracts enables arbitrageurs such as individual investors or banks {{to make use of}} the forward premium (or discount) to earn a riskless profit from discrepancies between two countries' interest rates. The opportunity to earn riskless profits arises from the reality that the interest rate parity condition does not constantly hold. When spot and forward exchange rate markets are not in a state of equilibrium, investors will no longer be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries and will invest in whichever currency offers a higher rate of return. Economists have discovered various factors which affect the occurrence of deviations from covered interest rate parity and the fleeting nature of covered {{interest arbitrage}} opportunities, such as differing characteristics of assets, varying frequencies of time series data, and the transaction costs associated with <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trading</b> strategies.|$|E

When funds compete for investors' dollars, they may engage in a counterproductive race towards the open-end form, even though this form leaves them ill-suited to undertaking certain types of <b>arbitrage</b> <b>trades.</b> One implication of the analysis is that, even absent short-sales constraints or other frictions, economically large mispricings can coexist with rational, competitive arbitrageurs who earn small excess returns. ...|$|R
