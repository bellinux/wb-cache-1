Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. <b>Adolescent</b> <b>and</b> adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E

40|$|Cancers in <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> {{young adults}} are {{uncommon}} but can have far-reaching consequences and a substantial disease burden. There is also growing recognition {{that young people}} with cancer have distinct biological, psychosocial and information needs. This is the first report to present a comprehensive picture of national statistics on cancer in young Australians aged 15 – 29. It provides an evidence base to underpin improvements in cancer outcomes {{as part of a}} broader initiative to reduce the impact of cancer on <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults. Cancer incidence has become steady and cancer mortality has fallen Between 1983 and 1996, cancer incidence in <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults increased by 1. 5 % per year, after which there was no significant change in the rates to 2007. However, cancer mortality in those aged 15 – 29 decreased by 1. 9 % per year between 1983 and 2007. Melanoma was the most common cancer diagnosed and brain cancer was the leading cause of cancer death In the period 2003 – 2007, 8, 783 new cases of reportable cancer were diagnosed among <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults aged 15 – 29. This represented an age-standardised rate of 419 cases per million. Cancers in <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults accounted for 1. 7 % of all cancer cases diagnosed in Australia. The most common cancer diagnosed in this age group was melanoma. During the same period, there were 1, 018 cancer deaths in <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults, comprising 9 % of all deaths in this age group. The leading cause of cancer death was brain cancer. Survival from cancer in <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults was relatively high and has improved In the period 2004 – 2010, <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults with cancer were 95 % as likely to live 1 year and 88 % as likely to live 5 years after diagnosis as their counterparts in the general population. Relative survival was highest for <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults with thyroid carcinoma, followed closely by gonadal germ cell cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma. Between 1983 – 1989 and 2004 – 2010, 5 -year relative survival from all cancers increased significantly from 80 % to 88 % in <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults. There were significant increases in survival from most cancers, with the greatest improvement for leukaemias. Outcomes for <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults vary In the period 2003 – 2007, <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults living outside Major cities were more likely to be diagnosed with and to die from cancer than their counterparts in Major cities. There was no significant association between survival and remoteness area; however, relative survival from all cancers was higher for <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults living in areas of the highest socioeconomic status than for their counterparts in areas of the lowest socioeconomic status...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the psychometric properties of a multidimensional measure of prosocial behaviors to use with early <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> middle <b>adolescents.</b> One hundred thirty-eight students (X age = 15. 8 years; 80 girls; 70 % White, non-Hispanic) from a public {{middle school and high school}} completed measures of prosocial moral reasoning, sympathy, perspective taking, aggression, ascription of responsibility, social desirability, verbal skills, and a revised prosocial tendencies measure (PTM-R). The questionnaires were completed in two sessions each separated by a 2 -week time span (to assess test-retest reliability of the PTM-R). Moreover, teacher ratings of adolescents’ generosity and helpfulness toward others were obtained. Analyses were conducted separately for early <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> middle <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> results showed adequate reliability and evidence of validity for PTM-R.
