5|$|King's Highway55, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway55 and historically as the Niagara Stone Road and Black Swamp Road, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, which connected the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) with Niagara-on-the-Lake, following Niagara Stone Road. The route divided <b>a</b> <b>swath</b> of wineries {{at the foot of the}} Niagara Escarpment, passing at an oblique angle to the concession road grid.|$|E
5|$|Under Basil II, the Byzantines {{established}} <b>a</b> <b>swath</b> of new themata, stretching northeast from Aleppo (a Byzantine protectorate) to Manzikert. Under the Theme {{system of}} military and administrative government, the Byzantines could raise a force at least 200,000 strong, though in practice these were strategically placed throughout the Empire. With Basil's rule, the Byzantine Empire reached its greatest height in nearly five centuries, and indeed {{for the next four}} centuries.|$|E

There, he points the tank's cannon into the sky and shoots down a Major League Baseball satellite; inside are detailed documents on everybody's behaviors. Mark McGwire appears, distracts the citizens with a long home run, and hides the evidence under his cap. Marge takes Bart off Focusyn for good and puts him back on Ritalin. Major League Baseball, however, still spies on the Simpson family due to an autographed bat McGwire gave Bart that has a hidden camera.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of the New Mexico–Texas border was unsettled {{at the time of}} Taylor's inauguration. The territory newly won from Mexico was under federal jurisdiction, but the Texans claimed <b>a</b> <b>swath</b> of land north of Santa Fe and were determined to include it within their borders, despite having no significant presence there. Taylor sided with the New Mexicans' claim, initially pushing to keep it as a federal territory, but eventually supported statehood so as to further reduce the slavery debate in Congress. The Texas government, under newly instated governor P. Hansborough Bell, tried to ramp up military action in defense of the territory against the federal government, but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the planet}} is {{predicted}} to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary search {{is expected to be}} carried out using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to shorten the search. Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this search together, and both teams cooperatively expect the search to take up to five years. Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, <b>a</b> <b>swath</b> of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the search space to 600–800 square degrees of sky.|$|E
5|$|Due to its unusual nature, both heavy {{snowfall}} {{and strong}} winds caused <b>a</b> <b>swath</b> of devastation {{stretching from the}} Mid-Atlantic states to northern New England. In the Middle-Atlantic region, moderate damage occurred at sea but little was noted inland. In New England, strong gusts inflicted significant damage to numerous churches. Widespread residential damage, in contrast, was mostly negligible and had no lasting consequences. Thousands of trees were knocked over, obstructing roads and fiscally damaging the timber industry throughout the region. Cold temperatures, wet snow, and high winds downed numerous branches in fruit orchards, froze potato crops, flattened dozens of barns, and killed over a hundred cattle. In general, the agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock trades suffered most acutely following {{the passage of the}} snow hurricane, while structural damage was widespread but generally inconsequential.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} damage {{occurred in}} <b>a</b> <b>swath</b> stretching from Kerry to Limerick {{as well as}} the counties of Sligo and Donegal. In these areas, the hurricane's powerful winds damaged or destroyed many buildings and downed trees and power lines. In the hardest hit areas, communication was not restored for over four days. Many roads were blocked by debris for up to two days. Crops and trees were badly damaged. Approximately two percent of the trees in the forestry industry were snapped or uprooted, with some areas losing up to twenty-four percent. In general, corn and wheat crops fared better than expected, with only 25–30 percent being lost; however, some farmers reported barley losses greater than 50 percent. Downed trees from the storm wreaked havoc, leaving considerable damage and loss of life behind. All told, Hurricane Debbie was responsible for 12 deaths in the Republic of Ireland. Four people were killed in County Cavan – a widow, her two daughters and granddaughter – after a tree fell on their car. Five deaths resulted from fallen trees and three others were from building collapses. At least 50 people were injured, few of which were serious. A study in 2012 estimated that damage from the storm was at least US$40–50 million across Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Krovanh, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Niña, was a {{moderate}} tropical cyclone that caused <b>a</b> <b>swath</b> of damage stretching from the Philippines to Vietnam in August2003. The fifteenth named storm and sixth typhoon in the western Pacific that year, Krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough on August13. Despite rather favorable conditions, the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August18. However, these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later. Intensification was rather rapid upon the storm's reformation– the depression reached tropical storm status on August20 and then typhoon intensity two days later. Shortly after, Krovanh made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph). The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm, though {{it was able to}} restrengthen over warm waters. Once again at typhoon intensity, Krovanh clipped Haiyan before moving over the Leizhou Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near Cẩm Phả, Vietnam on August25. Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as Krovanh moved across northern Vietnam, where the storm met its demise the following day.|$|E

A relatively strong tornado tore a path across Mississauga (then part of Toronto Township) on 24 June 1923, cutting <b>a</b> <b>swath</b> from present-day Meadowvale to near Cooksville, killing 4 people and causing massive property damage {{in a time when}} most of Mississauga was still rural farmland dotted with fruit orchards.|$|E
25|$|The small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH) {{configuration}} reduces wave-generating {{resistance by}} moving displacement volume below the waterline, using {{a pair of}} tubular, submarine-like hulls, connected by pylons to the bridge deck with a narrow waterline cross-section. The submerged hulls are minimally affected by waves. The SWATH form was invented by Canadian Frederick G. Creed, who presented his idea in 1938 and was later awarded a British patent for it in 1946. It was first used in the 1960s and 1970s as an evolution of catamaran design for use as oceanographic research vessels or submarine rescue ships. In 1990, the US Navy commissioned the construction of <b>a</b> <b>SWATH</b> ship to test the configuration.|$|E

The Desert Force cut <b>a</b> <b>swath</b> through the Italian rear areas, stitching its way between the desert and the coast, capturing strongpoint after strongpoint by cutting off and isolating them, The Italian guns proved to be no match for the heavy British Matilda tanks and their shells bounced off the armour.
