The other reliable identification test at genus level is chromosomal DNA transformation assay. In this assay, a naturally competent tryptophan <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutant</b> of Acinetobacter baylyi (BD4 trpE27) is transformed with the total DNA of a putative Acinetobacter isolate and the transformation mixture is plated on a brain heart infusion agar. The growth is then harvested after incubation for 24 h at 30 °C, plating on an Acinetobacter minimal agar (AMA), and incubating at 30 °C for 108 h. Growth on the AMA indicates a positive transformation assay and confirms the isolate {{as a member of}} the genus Acinetobacter. E. coli HB101 and A. calcoaceticus MTCC1921T can be used as the negative and positive controls, respectively.|$|E
50|$|In a {{microbial}} process employing an <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutant</b> (nutritionally requiring mutant), {{excess supply}} of the required nutrient results in abundant cell growth with little accumulation of the desired metabolite due to feedback inhibition and /or end-product repression. Starvation of the required nutrient, however, lowers cell growth {{as well as the}} overall production of the desired metabolite, as the production rate is usually proportional to the cell concentration. In such a bioprocess, the accumulation of the desired metabolite can be maximized by growing the mutant on a limited amount of the required nutrient. To cultivate the mutant on a low concentration of the required nutrient, it is fed to the batch culture at a controlled rate. This technique is often used in industrial amino acid productions with the auxotrophic mutants. An example is lysine production with homoserine- or threonine/methionine-requiring mutant of Corynebacterium glutamicum being lacking for homoserine dehydrogenase gene.|$|E

All the strains formed nodules and fixed nitrogen in both hosts with some relative differences. The diversity of rhizobia that form symbioses with {{the roots of}} both hosts, an economically important leguminous tree species, was examined by inoculating seedling root zones with samples of <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants</b> of rhizobia derived from both mutagens, acridine and ascorbic acid. Nitrogen fixation, total nitrogen accumulation, and plant growth varied significantly among both hosts seedlings inoculated with the representative isolates. All <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants</b> derived from the parental strain FFAMU- 8, stimulated chlorophyll (a) formation in Sesbania sesban, relative to the negative control. Although, three of <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants,</b> asc 2 -FFAMU- 8, asc 3 -FFAMU- 8 and asc 4 -FFAMU- 8 affected to significantly increase chlorophyll (b) formation than their negative and positive control plants. Both <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants,</b> asc 3 -FFAMU- 8 and asc 3 -ARCG- 10 affected to significantly greater below ground biomass components in Leucaena leucocephala than their in the positive control plants. In addition, some of <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants</b> derived from the strain HRT- 27 affect to significantly increase woody, aerial and root biomass over the positive control of Sesbania sesban.

We show here that <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants</b> of diploid industrial sake yeast strains were routinely obtained by a standard mutant selection procedure following UV mutagenesis. We isolated His−, Met−, Lys−, Trp−, Leu−, Arg−, and Ura− <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants</b> of five sake strains, Kyokai no. 7, no. 9, no. 10, no. 701, and no. 901, by screening only 1, 700 to 3, 400 colonies from each treated strain. Wild-type alleles were cloned and used as markers for transformation. With HIS 3 as a selectable marker, the yeast TDH 3 overexpression promoter was inserted upstream of ATF 1, encoding alcohol acetyltransferase, by one-step gene replacement in a his 3 mutant of Kyokai no. 7. The resulting strain contained exclusively yeast DNA, making it acceptable for commercial use, and produced a larger amount of isoamyl acetate, a banana-like flavor. We argue that the generally recognized difficulty of isolating <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants</b> of diploid industrial yeast strains is misleading and that genetic techniques used for haploid laboratory strains are applicable for this purpose...|$|R

30|$|In Aspergillus, <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants,</b> such as pyrG, niaD (nitrate reductase), or sC (ATP-sulfurylase)-deficient mutants, can {{be simply}} {{isolated}} {{because they are}} positively selected {{in the presence of}} the counter-selective compounds ([Arst 1968]; Daboussi et al. [1989]; Goosen et al. [1987]). To advance molecular biology in A. aculeatus, we designed and validated a HR method for gene replacement by deleting the Aaku 80 gene. The Aaku 80 deletion drastically increased the gene-targeting frequency from 3 % to 94 % and enabled the construction of double <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants</b> (Aaku 80, argB–, pyrG–). This drastic increase in gene-targeting frequency reduced the labor required to isolate <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutants,</b> such as an arginine auxotroph, without the use of counter-selective compounds. The 94 % targeting frequency in A. aculeatus was high enough for practical use in gene replacement. However, the targeting frequency for approximately 1 -kb homologous sequences was lower than in N. crassa (Ninomiya et al. [2004]). Because homology length is critical to the homologous integration frequency, A. aculeatus might require a longer homologous region for gene targeting.|$|R

The probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii would be especially well suited for this purpose due to its ability, in contrast to probiotic prokaryotes, to perform eukaryotic post translational modifications. This probiotic yeast thus {{has the potential to}} express a broad array of therapeutic proteins. Currently, however, use of wild type (WT) S. boulardii relies on antibiotic resistance for the selection of transformed yeast. Here we report the creation of <b>auxotrophic</b> <b>mutant</b> strains of S. boulardii that can be selected without antibiotics and demonstrate that these yeast can express functional recombinant protein even when recovered from gastrointestinal immune tissues in mice. A UV mutagenesis approach was employed to generate three uracil auxotrophic S. boulardii mutants that show a low rate of reversion to wild type growth. These mutants can express recombinant protein and are resistant in vitro to low pH, bile acid salts, and anaerobic conditions. Critically, oral gavage experiments using C 57 BL/ 6 mice demonstrate that mutant S. boulardii survive and are taken up into gastrointestinal immune tissues on a similar level as WT S. boulardii. Mutant yeast recovered from gastrointestinal immune tissues furthermore retain expression of functional recombinant protein.
