500|$|The album's {{cover and}} {{interior}} artwork {{were designed by}} Badu and graphic artist Emek. The cover features an abstract portrayal of Badu, who dons vintage nameplate knuckle rings bearing the album title and an Afro decorated in a bric-a-brac manner with various emblems. Badu and Emek sought to reflect the former's perspective on various topics, including music, religion, governments, and economics, and incorporate emblems to depict American culture and modern society. Images featured in the Afro include those of flowers, spray cans, dollar signs, power plants, musical notes, toilets, raised fists, needles, laptops, turntables, handcuffs, broken chains, bar codes, drugs, and guns. The album's interior artwork features ominous, psychedelic, futuristic, and apocalyptic imagery. The artwork includes illustrations of a red-eyed Uncle Sam pointing a gun, robotic creatures tattooing each other, a bar code bearing the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>message</b> [...] "50C1AL 5Y5T3M", and a suited skeleton with a dollar sign on its skull lecturing to a headless audience from a podium that bears the pyramid image from the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States. The illustration of a soft melting fork, hypodermic needle, and spoon is an adaptation of Salvador Dalí's 1931 painting The Persistence of Memory.|$|E
50|$|In 2017, {{the city}} {{installed}} a new sound {{system and a}} small videoboard beyond left field, costing $173,000, of which $56,000 was {{paid for by the}} Silver Knights. The videoboard supersedes a two-line <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>message</b> board that had not worked for the preceding four years and could not be repaired.|$|E

50|$|In {{a meeting}} in late October 1984, the French part of the DF900 project {{submitted}} a proposal {{for the provision of}} an enhanced paging service, with diffusion of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>messages</b> to mobile users with acknowledgment capabilities. The messaging system would be two-way, unlike paging systems. On 12 November 1984 at {{a meeting in}} London, this proposal became simply the transmission of short <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>messages</b> with acknowledgement capabilities.|$|R
50|$|TAP, {{initially}} {{known as}} Motorola Page Entry (PET) was adopted in September 1988, by the Personal Communication Industry Association. TAP defines an industry standard for sending <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>messages</b> to pagers.|$|R
50|$|There are two message coding formats for {{the data}} {{messages}}. Numeric messages are sent as 4 bit BCD values, and <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>messages</b> are sent as 7-bit ASCII. The 7-bit ASCII is {{commonly referred to as}} 'alpha-paging', and 4-bit BCD is commonly referred to as 'numeric-paging'.|$|R
50|$|A pager (also {{known as}} a beeper) is a {{wireless}} telecommunications device that receives and displays <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>messages</b> and/or receives and announces voice messages. One-way pagers can only receive messages, while response pagers and two-way pagers can also acknowledge, reply to, and originate messages using an internal transmitter.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alphanumeric</b> <b>messages</b> are {{encoded in}} 7-bit ASCII {{characters}} {{packed into the}} 20 bit data area of a message codeword (bits 30-11). Since three seven bit characters are 21 rather than 20 bits and the designers of the standard {{did not want to}} waste transmission time, they chose to pack the first 20 bits of an ASCII message into the first code word, the next 20 bits of a message into the next codeword and so forth.|$|R
5000|$|The Timex Beepwear Datalink series {{features}} wearable pagers, {{using the}} Timex datalink platform. These watches also function as electronic organisers. The Beepware series is patented {{and was the}} product of a joint Timex-Motorola effort which resulted in a new company called Beepwear Paging Products. The Beepwear marketing motto was: [...] "One beeping great watch". It was the first watch/pager able to receive <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>messages.</b> It operates in the 900 MHz band. Beepware also featured FLEXtime which, if supported by the service provider, could synchronise the time of the watch with that of the network. It could also automatically adjust to the time zone of the wearer.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{proposal}} which {{initiated the}} development of SMS was made by a contribution of Germany and France into the GSM group meeting in February 1985 in Oslo. This proposal was further elaborated in GSM subgroup WP1 Services (Chairman Martine Alvernhe, France Telecom) based on a contribution from Germany. There were also initial discussions in the subgroup WP3 network aspects chaired by Jan Audestad (Telenor). The result {{was approved by the}} main GSM group in a June '85 document which was distributed to industry. The input documents on SMS had been prepared by Friedhelm Hillebrand (Deutsche Telekom) with contributions from Bernard Ghillebaert (France Télécom). The definition that Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert brought into GSM called for the provision of a message transmission service of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>messages</b> to mobile users [...] "with acknowledgement capabilities". The last three words transformed SMS into something much more useful than the prevailing messaging paging that some in GSM might have had in mind.|$|R
5000|$|In 1933 RCA Communications, New York {{introduced}} the first [...] "telex" [...] service. The first messages over RCA transatlantic circuits were between New York City and London and, {{in the first}} year of operation, approximately seven million words (300,000 radiograms) were transmitted. Radio has long sent <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>messages</b> via radiotelegraphy. The University of Hawaii began using radio to send digital information as early as 1971, using ALOHAnet. Friedhelm Hillebrand conceptualised SMS in 1984 while working for Deutsche Telekom. Sitting at a typewriter at home, Hillebrand typed out random sentences and counted every letter, number, punctuation, and space. Almost every time, the messages contained fewer than 160 characters, thus giving the basis for the limit one could type via text messaging. With Bernard Ghillebaert of France Télécom, he developed a proposal for the GSM (Groupe Spécial Mobile) meeting in February 1985 in Oslo. The first technical solution evolved in a GSM subgroup under the leadership of Finn Trosby. It was further developed under the leadership of Kevin Holley and Ian Harris (see Short Message Service). SMS forms an integral part of SS7 (Signalling System No. 7). Under SS7, it is a [...] "state" [...] with a 160 character data, coded in the ITU-T [...] "T.56" [...] text format, that has a [...] "sequence lead in" [...] to determine different language codes, and may have special character codes that permits, for example, sending simple graphs as text. This was part of ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and since GSM is based on this, made its way to the mobile phone. Messages could be sent and received on ISDN phones, and these can send SMS to any GSM phone. The possibility of doing something is one thing, implementing it another, but systems existed from 1988 that sent SMS messages to mobile phones (compare ND-NOTIS).|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Cellular {{networks}} are {{a critical component}} of the economic and social infrastructures in which we live. In addition to voice services, these networks deliver <b>alphanumeric</b> text <b>messages</b> to the vast majority of wireless subscribers. To encourage the expansion of this new service, telecommunications companies offer connections between their networks and the Internet. The ramifications of such connections, however, have not been fully recognized. In this paper, we evaluate the security impact of the SMS interface on the availability of the cellular phone network. Specifically, we demonstrate the ability to deny voice service to cities the size of Washington D. C. and Manhattan with little more than a cable modem. Moreover, attacks targeting the entire United States are feasible with resources available at most medium-sized organizations. This analysis begins with an exploration of the structure of cellular networks. We then characterize network behavior and explore a number of reconnaissance techniques aimed at effectively targeting attacks on these systems. We conclude by discussing countermeasures that mitigate or eliminate the threats introduced by these attacks. I...|$|R
