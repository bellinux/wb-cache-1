50|$|In general {{however the}} lenses never became popular for <b>anamorphic</b> <b>films</b> {{because they are}} very heavy and had {{breathing}} problems. Arri have sold most of them to India and are not even renting them out any more. The current market for PL mount anamorphic lenses is being serviced by Vantage Film (makers of the Hawks lenses), Elite and Joe Dunton Company.|$|R

50|$|One common {{misconception}} {{about the}} anamorphic format concerns the actual width {{number of the}} aspect ratio, as 2.35, 2.39 or 2.4. Since the anamorphic lenses in virtually all 35 mm anamorphic systems provide a 2:1 squeeze, one would logically conclude that a 1.375:1 full academy gate {{would lead to a}} 2.75:1 aspect ratio when used with anamorphic lenses. Due to differences in the camera gate aperture and projection aperture mask sizes for anamorphic films, however, the image dimensions used for <b>anamorphic</b> <b>film</b> vary from flat (spherical) counterparts. To complicate matters, the SMPTE standards for the format have varied over time; to further complicate things, pre-1957 prints took up the optical soundtrack space of the print (instead having magnetic sound on the sides), which made for a 2.55:1 ratio.|$|E
50|$|Dean is {{best known}} for her work in 16mm film, {{although}} she utilises a variety of media including drawing, photography and sound. Her films often employ long takes and steady camera angles to create a contemplative atmosphere. Her <b>anamorphic</b> <b>films</b> are shot by cinematographers John Adderley and Jamie Cairney. Her sound recordist is Steve Felton. She has also published several pieces of her own writing, which she refers to as 'asides,' which complement her visual work. Since the mid-1990s her films have not included commentary, but are instead accompanied by often understated optical sound tracks.|$|R
50|$|The {{anamorphic}} encoding on DVD {{is related}} to the <b>anamorphic</b> <b>filming</b> technique (like CinemaScope) only by name. For instance, Star Wars (1977) was filmed in 2.35:1 ratio using an anamorphic camera lens, and shown in theaters using the corresponding projector lens. Since it is a widescreen film, when encoded on a widescreen-format DVD the studio would almost certainly use the anamorphic encoding process. Monty Python and the Holy Grail was filmed in 1.85:1 ratio without using an anamorphic lens on the camera, and similarly was shown in theaters without the need for the decompression lens. However, since it is also a widescreen film, when encoded on a widescreen-format DVD the studio would probably use the anamorphic encoding process.|$|R
50|$|Cinerama was {{an earlier}} attempt {{to solve the}} problem of {{high-quality}} widescreen imaging, but anamorphic widescreen eventually proved to be more practicable. Cinerama preceded <b>anamorphic</b> <b>films,</b> but consisted of three projected images side-by-side on the same screen: the images never blended together perfectly at the edges, and it required three projectors; a 6-perf-high frame, which required four times as much film; and three cameras (eventually just one camera with three lenses and three streaming reels of film and the attendant machinery, which presented synchronization problems). Nonetheless, the format was popular enough with audiences to spur studios to the wide screen developments of the early 1950s. A few films were distributed in Cinerama format and shown in special theaters. Anamorphic widescreen was attractive to studios because of its similar high aspect ratio (Cinerama was 2.59), without the disadvantages of Cinerama's added complexities and costs.|$|R
50|$|Cinematographer Tom Stern {{shot the}} film with Arri Alexa XT digital cameras and Panavision C-, E- and G-Series <b>anamorphic</b> lenses. The <b>film</b> is Eastwood's second {{to be shot}} digitally, after Jersey Boys.|$|R
50|$|The {{distributed}} 35 mm film prints have Dolby Stereo {{audio and}} the 70mm <b>Anamorphic</b> Blow-Up <b>film</b> prints featured Six-Track Dolby Stereo audio. All 70mm prints were encoded for a Megasound option, in which theaters {{needed to be}} outfitted with more speakers and sound equipment. Outland {{was one of four}} films released by Warner Bros. to officially make use of their Megasound movie theater sound system, in the early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|RKO {{used the}} Superscope {{process in which}} the {{standard}} 35 mm image was cropped and then optically squeezed in post-production to create an <b>anamorphic</b> image on <b>film.</b> Today's Super 35 is a variation of this process.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Kerns H. Powers, {{a member}} of the SMPTE Working Group on High-Definition Electronic Production, first {{proposed}} the 16:9 (1.7:1) aspect ratio at a time when nobody was creating 16:9 videos. The popular choices in 1980 were: 1.3:1 (based on television standard's ratio at the time), 1.6:1 (the European [...] "flat" [...] ratio), 1.85:1 (the American [...] "flat" [...] ratio), 2.20:1 (the ratio of 70 mm films and Panavision) and 2.39:1 (the CinemaScope ratio for <b>anamorphic</b> widescreen <b>films).</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 17 July 2001, Columbia Tri-Star / Sony {{released}} the {{films in the}} US in a two-disc box set, with the second disc being double-sided, containing Once Upon a Time in China II {{on one side and}} Once Upon a Time in China III on the other. In creating the discs, Colombia took a non-anamorphic master and interpolated it to make it <b>anamorphic.</b> The <b>films</b> in this release feature Cantonese and Mandarin soundtracks, with English, Spanish and French subtitle options.|$|R
50|$|Into Darkness began {{principal}} photography on January 12, 2012, with {{a scheduled}} release date of May 16, 2013. Cinematographer Dan Mindel shot the film {{using a combination}} of <b>anamorphic</b> 35mm <b>film</b> and 15 perforation IMAX cameras. About 30 minutes of the film is shot in the IMAX format, while some other scenes were also shot on 8 perforation 65mm. Into Darkness was released in 3D. On February 24, 2012, images from the set surfaced of Benedict Cumberbatch's character in a fight with Spock. Edgar Wright directed one shot in the film.Production ended in May 2012.|$|R
50|$|In {{the film}} version, the {{animation}} {{from the stage}} show is used, but certain shots (including the School Master turning into a hammer) were stretched from their original full-frame image to a 2.39:1 aspect ratio. The rest of the animation that was featured reused the original cels though expanded the backgrounds to fill the cinematic image. Waters used the <b>film's</b> <b>anamorphic</b> version for his 2010-13 tour of The Wall.|$|R
5000|$|The common <b>anamorphic</b> {{widescreen}} <b>film</b> format in {{use today}} is commonly called 'Scope' or 2.35:1 (the latter being a misnomer born of old habit; see [...] "2.35, 2.39 or 2.40?" [...] below). Filmed in Panavision is a phrase contractually required for films shot using Panavision's anamorphic lenses. All of these phrases mean the same thing: the final print uses a 2:1 anamorphic projector lens that expands the image by exactly twice the amount horizontally as vertically. This format {{is essentially the same}} as that of CinemaScope, except for some technical developments, such as the ability to shoot closeups without any facial distortion. (CinemaScope films seldom used full facial closeups, because of a condition known as [...] "CinemaScope mumps", which made faces appear distorted as they got closer to the camera.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Carpenter is {{an outspoken}} proponent of {{widescreen}} filming, {{and all of}} his theatrical films (with the exception of Dark Star and The Ward) were <b>filmed</b> <b>anamorphic</b> with a 2.35:1 or greater aspect ratio. The Ward was filmed in Super 35, the first time Carpenter has ever used that system. Carpenter has stated he feels that the 35mm Panavision anamorphic format is [...] "the best movie system there is", preferring it to both digital and 3D film.|$|R
50|$|On December 2, 2008, Warner Home Video {{released}} the film on DVD in North America. However, like a concurrent DVD release of another Hanna-Barbera feature, The Man Called Flintstone, this release alters {{the opening of}} the film by removing the Columbia Pictures logo and its credit references. Unlike the former, it is presented in 1.78:1 <b>anamorphic</b> widescreen (both <b>films</b> were animated in 1.33:1 and matted to 1.85:1 for theaters). A R2 DVD was released in the UK on January 31, 2011, and is also presented in 1.78:1.|$|R
5000|$|Based on the Shintō myth of {{the storm}} god Susanoo's battle with the Yamata no Orochi, the color, [...] "TōeiScope" [...] <b>anamorphic</b> format <b>film</b> is scripted by Ichirō Ikeda and Takashi Iijima and {{directed}} by Yūgo Serikawa. It {{is considered one of}} the very best of the Tōei Dōga features and a landmark in anime and animated features in general, placing 10th in the list of the 150 best animated films and series of all time compiled by Tokyo's Laputa Animation Festival from an international survey of animation staff and critics in 2003. It features distinctively modernist, abstracted character, background and color design, formalised the role of animation director, performed here by Yasuji Mori, in the Japanese system and drew attention to the talents of key animators Yasuo Ōtsuka and Yōichi Kotabe (whose key animation for the film, though he is credited in it as an in-betweener, is his first) and assistant directors Isao Takahata and Kimio Yabuki. The score, composed by Akira Ifukube, is also acclaimed.|$|R
500|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} for The Argentine {{to be shot}} using <b>anamorphic</b> 16 mm <b>film</b> because, according to the director, it needed [...] "a bit of Bruckheimer but scruffier". He kept to his plan of shooting The Argentine anamorphically, and Guerrilla with spherical lenses. Soderbergh {{wanted to use the}} new RED One rather than 16mm film because of its ability to replicate film stock digitally but initially, it {{was not going to be}} available on time. However, their Spanish work papers and visas were late and Del Toro and Soderbergh were grounded in Los Angeles for a week. The director was meanwhile informed that the prototype cameras were ready.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} shot with Arri Alexa digital cameras and Panavision C-Series <b>anamorphic</b> lenses. The <b>film's</b> {{lighting}} {{was designed to}} accommodate black and white screening, and was converted from color to black and white in post-production because Payne {{said he wanted to}} produce an [...] "iconic, archetypal look". According to cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, the choice was to use [...] "the poetic power of the black and white in combination with these landscapes and of course the landscapes are playing a huge role in this story". The choice of black and white was made against distributor Paramount Vantage's wishes. A color version of the film was also produced in an effort to satisfy distributor Paramount Vantage's concerns; Payne said that he hopes no one ever sees it. Despite this, the network Epix announced in August 2014 that it would show the color version as a [...] "limited time showing".|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} was threatened by the advent of television—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of color films, three-dimensional films, stereophonic sound, and widescreen movies. Cinerama {{was one of the}} first widescreen movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a picture on one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to a process it branded CinemaScope: in this system, the film was shot with <b>anamorphic</b> lenses. The <b>film</b> was then exhibited with a complementary anamorphic lens on the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected aspect ratio (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the image area on the physical frame of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—The Robe (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel of work with their anamorphic underwater system.|$|R
