5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began {{systematic}} studies on the mechanisms of the mosaic color patterns of maize seed and the unstable inheritance of this mosaicism. She identified two new dominant and interacting genetic loci that she named Dissociator (Ds) and <b>Activator</b> (Ac). She found that the Dissociator did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the <b>Activator</b> was also present, which included making certain stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both Dissociator and <b>Activator</b> could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.|$|E

40|$|Isoform-specific {{protein kinase}} C (PKC) <b>activators</b> {{may be useful}} as {{therapeutic}} agents {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer disease. Three new ϵ-specific PKC <b>activators,</b> made by cyclopropanation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been developed. These <b>activators,</b> AA-CP 4, EPA-CP 5, and DHA-CP 6, activate PKCϵ in a dose-dependent manner. Unlike PKC <b>activators</b> that bind to the 1, 2 -diacylglycerol-binding site, such as bryostatin and phorbol esters, which produce prolonged down-regulation, the new <b>activators</b> produced sustained activation of PKC. When applied to cells expressing human APPSwe/PS 1 δ, which produce large quantities of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), DCP-LA and DHA-CP 6 reduced the intracellular and secreted levels of Aβ by 60 – 70 %. In contrast to the marked activation of α-secretase produced by PKC <b>activators</b> in fibroblasts, the PKC <b>activators</b> produced only a moderate and transient activation of α-secretase in neuronal cells. However, they activated endothelin-converting enzyme to 180 % of control levels, suggesting that the Aβ-lowering ability of these PKCϵ <b>activators</b> is caused by increasing the rate of Aβ degradation by endothelin-converting enzyme and not by activating nonamyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Transactivation by {{hepatitis}} B virus X protein (pX) is promiscuous, but {{it requires}} cellular <b>activators.</b> To study {{the mode of}} action of pX, we coexpressed pX with Gal 4 -derived <b>activators</b> in a cotransfection system. Twelve different <b>activators</b> bearing different types of activation domains were compared for their response to pX. Because pX indirectly increases {{the amount of the}} <b>activators,</b> tools were developed to compare samples with equivalent amount of <b>activators.</b> We demonstrate that pX preferentially coactivates potent <b>activators,</b> especially those with acidic activation domains. Weak <b>activators</b> with nonacidic activation domains are not potentiated by pX. Interestingly, Gal 4 E 1 a, which is not rich in acidic residues but interacts with similar molecular targets, also responds to pX. The response to pX correlated with the strength of the activation domain. Collectively, these data imply that pX is a coactivator, which offers a molecular basis for the pleiotropic effects of pX on transcription...|$|R

40|$|SummaryWe {{recently}} {{showed that}} topically applied PPARα <b>activators</b> promote epidermal differentiation in intact adult mouse skin. In {{this study we}} determined the effect of clofibrate and Wy- 14, 643, <b>activators</b> of PPARα, on hyperproliferative epidermis in hairless mice, induced either by repeated barrier abrogation (subacute model) or by essential fatty acid deficiency (chronic model). The hyperproliferative epidermis was characterized by an increased number of proliferating cells expressing proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Topical treatment with PPARα <b>activators</b> resulted in a substantial decrease in epidermal hyperplasia in both the subacute and chronic models of hyperproliferation. Following topical treatment, proliferating cell nuclear antigen-expressing cells were restricted to the basal layer, similar to normal epidermis. In hyperproliferative epidermis there was decreased expression of involucrin, profilaggrin-filaggrin, and loricrin as assayed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Following topical treatment with PPAR <b>activators</b> staining for these mRNAs and proteins increased towards normal levels. Finally, topically applied clofibrate also increased apoptosis. This study demonstrates that topical PPAR <b>activators</b> have profound effects on epidermal gene expression in hyperproliferative skin disorders. Treatment with PPARα <b>activators</b> normalizes cell proliferation and promotes epidermal differentiation, correcting the cutaneous pathology. This study identifies PPARα <b>activators</b> as potential skin therapeutic agents...|$|R
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an <b>activator</b> protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E

5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen <b>activator</b> inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E

40|$|Two {{plasminogen}} <b>activators</b> (1 and 2) {{were isolated}} from human seminal plasma by hiigh-speed centrifugation, Sephadex-gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. The <b>activators</b> {{were shown to}} be homogeneous by polyacrylamide-disc -gel electrophoresis at pH 8. 3 and 4. 5, and by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights of <b>activators</b> 1 and 2 were estimated as 69 000 and 74 000. Their amino acid compositions are very similar, both being high in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, glycine and leucine, and low in methionine, tryptophan, tyrosine, isoleucine and histidine. <b>Activators</b> 1 and 2 each possess 16 cysteine residues. Both <b>activators</b> have isoelectric points of approx. 7. 0, are stable over a wide pH range at temperatures up to 60 degrees C, but lose activity at higher temperatures, particularly under very basic or acidic conditions.

5|$|P. acnes also provokes skin {{inflammation}} {{by altering}} the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by P. acnes {{is of particular}} importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation leads to increased activity of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases activity of <b>activator</b> protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. The inflammatory properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium's ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase. These free fatty acids spur production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.|$|E

40|$|The {{transcription}} apparatus (TA) {{is a huge}} molecular machine.

Based on the general structural organizations of the TA, we propose how the TA dynamically orchestrates transcriptional responses. The <b>activators</b> rapidly cycle {{in and out of}} a clamp-like space temporarily formed between the enhancer and the Mediator, with the concentration of <b>activators</b> encoded as their temporal occupancy rate (RTOR) within the space. The entry of <b>activators</b> into this space induces allostery in the Mediator, resulting in a facilitated circumstance for transcriptional reinitiation. The reinitiation rate is much larger than the cycling rate of <b>activators,</b> thereby RTOR guiding the amount of transcripts.
