40|$|The <b>air</b> <b>cond</b> i tion in {{the city}} of Jambi getting hot. Smog haze occurs almost every year since 1997. On the other hand, {{attempts}} to perform the actions that are environmentally friendly as well have been started. Economic and educational level of the woman citizens influence the sensitivity and attitudes towards environmental issues such as air emissions, flooding and waste management. The research underlying this article -about women's attitudes towards the Jambi city’s environment- through qualitative method, find that almost all the informants agree to protect the environment and air, but also almost all of the informants did not agree to pay the levy for air quality improvement. Awareness to protect the environment and the air has started and implanted since kindergarten. Awareness to maintain air quality continues to be done, both by the government, and social units who want a better Jambi city environments. </pre...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} study of annular jets with central aspiration is presented. Two flow regimes were studied for creating either local <b>air</b> <b>cond</b> 1 t 1 oning or local ventilation systems. The local air-conditioning system was developed by maintaining the same flow rates of the non-swirling annular jet and central aspiration, A new concept of a 'local ventilation system' was created by combining the swirling annular air jet impinging on the plate and central aspiration. Due to the rather small consumption of energy, the tested air-conditioning and ventilation systems are very functional and capable of maintaining local and confined micro-climate or ventilated zones in large volumes. In order to study dynamic and thermal conditions in the air conditioning system an experimental rig was built and tested. The results of the experimental research, using visualization and thermocouple measurements as well as 2 D velocity fields obtained by a LDV system are presented and discussed. The visualizations show {{the existence of a}} stable calm low velocity zone in the core of the annular air jet. The thermocouple measurements, as well as LDV measurements, prove the dynamic and thermal stability of the region. A dynamically and thermally defined stable local zone 1 S a protected volume where comfort conditions can he maintained. Velocity measurements also show the size of the vortex located between the annular jet exhaust and the central air return. Another experimental rig was built in order to study the conditions created by the proposed ventilation system. The presence of an aspirating ascending jet in the form of swirling flow -tornado, was registered between the proposed device and the impingement plate. This flow regime is very efficient in ventilating the local zone...|$|E
