5|$|In March 2013, the Barmouth Viaduct <b>Access</b> <b>Group</b> (B-VAG), was {{established}} to investigate an alternative route from the town centre to the bridge, as the current walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs. In June, the toll was removed after the collectors left and were not replaced. The council have not yet decided {{how to pay for}} the bridge's maintenance costs, which were £39,405 for the year. This has proved to be problematic as the revenue collected from tolls has not been sufficient to cover the council's share of costs, and there is not a sufficient budget to employ any full-time staff to collect payments.|$|E
25|$|ODBC was {{originally}} developed by Microsoft and Simba Technologies {{during the early}} 1990s, and {{became the basis for}} the Call Level Interface (CLI) standardized by SQL <b>Access</b> <b>Group</b> in the Unix and mainframe field. ODBC retained several features that were removed as part of the CLI effort. Full ODBC was later ported back to those platforms, and became a de facto standard considerably better known than CLI. The CLI remains similar to ODBC, and applications can be ported from one platform to the other with few changes.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 several vendors, {{mostly from}} the Unix and {{database}} communities, formed the SQL <b>Access</b> <b>Group</b> (SAG) {{in an effort to}} produce a single basic standard for the SQL language. At the first meeting there was considerable debate over whether or not the effort should work solely on the SQL language itself, or attempt a wider standardization which included a dynamic SQL language-embedding system as well, what they called a Call Level Interface (CLI). While attending the meeting with an early draft of what was then still known as MS Data Access, Kyle Geiger of Microsoft invited Jeff Balboni and Larry Barnes of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to join the SQLC meetings as well. SQLC was a potential solution to the call for the CLI, which was being led by DEC.|$|E
