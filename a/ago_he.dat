5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is said to}} be {{the founder}} of Jainism by the {{different}} Jain sub-traditions. Jain chronology places Rishabhanatha in ahistorical terms, as someone who lived millions of years <b>ago.</b> <b>He</b> is stated to have lived for 8,400,000 purva years. His height is described in the Jain texts to be 500 arc lengths (800 ells), or about 1,200 feet. Such descriptions of non-human heights and age are also found for the next 21 Tirthankaras in Jain texts, and according to Kristi Wiley – a scholar at University of California Berkeley known for her publications in Jainism, most Indologists and scholars consider all the first 22 of 24 Tirthankaras to be prehistorical, or ahistorical and a part of Jain mythology. However, among Jain writers and some Indian scholars, some of the first 22 Tirthankaras are considered to reflect historical figures, with a few conceding that the inflated biographical statistics as mythical.|$|E

5|$|The Kirtlandian faunal age {{was named}} by Lucas and Sullivan in 2003, and found by their {{original}} study to date from 74.9 to 72million years ago. In 2006, Sullivan and Lucas refined their estimate, {{stating that the}} Kirtlandian ranged from 75 to 72.8million years ago. Later that year, Sullivan changed the time range again, finding that the faunal age lasted only 2 million years, from 74.8 to 72.8million years <b>ago.</b> <b>He</b> said that the later part of the Kirtlandian, from the De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation, dated to 73 million years ago, {{on the basis of}} ash layers dating to 73.04 and 73.37million years ago. This observation was based on findings by Sullivan and Lucas, who dated the two ash layers from 73.04 ± 0.25 and 73.37 ± 0.28million years ago. They also dated the earlier ashes from the Fruitland Formation, which dated to 75.56 ± 0.41, 74.55 ± 0.29, and 74.11 ± 0.62 million years ago. The first ash, called by them the Dog Eye Pond, was found slightly higher than the start of the Fruitland Formation, which meant that the start of the Fruitland Formation was older than 75.5 million years ago. More precise dating in 2010 by Longrich found that the second youngest ash can actually be dated more precisely than thought by Sullivan (2006), only having an error range of 0.18million years. Longrich also dated the two older ashes, finding a date {{the same as that of}} Sullivan in 2006. These ash datings are what Sullivan used to find the precise age of the Kirtlandian age.|$|E
