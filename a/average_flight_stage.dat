40|$|To assist NASA in {{identifying}} research art, {{with the greatest}} potential for improving the air transportation system, two models were developed {{as part of its}} Aviation System Analysis Capability (ASAC). The ASAC Flight Segment Cost Model (FSCM) is used to predict aircraft trajectories, resource consumption, and variable operating costs for one or more flight segments. The Network Cost Model can either summarize the costs for a network of flight segments processed by the FSCM or can be used to independently estimate the variable operating costs of flying a fleet of equipment given the number of departures and <b>average</b> <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> lengths...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{aimed to}} {{identify}} and analyze the explanatory variables for airlines productivity during 2000 2005, by testing the Pearson correlation between the single factor productivity capital, energy and labor of a sample of 45 selected international airlines (4 Brazilian carriers among them) and their productivity explanatory variables like medium stage length, aircraft load factor, hours flown and cruise speed for selected routes besides aircraft seat configuration and airlines number of employees. The research demonstrated, that a set of variables can explain differences in productivity for passenger airlines, such as: investment in personnel training processes, automation, airplane seat density, occupation of aircraft, <b>average</b> <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> length, density and extension of routes, among others...|$|E

40|$|Birds on {{migration}} normally {{switch between}} <b>flight</b> <b>stages</b> and periods of stopover where fuel stores are replenished. How migratory birds divide their time between flight and stopover {{is still not}} well known. Short-term recoveries of passerine birds ringed in Sweden were analysed to investigate how far long-distance migrating passerines fly during a <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> and whether they migrate one or more <b>flight</b> <b>stages</b> in a row. Included {{in the study were}} birds recovered at least 50 km from the ringing site and within seven days from ringing. The median distance covered by the recovered birds was 245 km. About 40 % of the recoveries within 24 hours from ringing were found at least 200 km from the ringing site. The distances covered varied and many birds moved only short distances, perhaps as a result of searching for good stopover sites, while others moved much further away. Two recoveries of Sedge Warblers three days after ringing indicated that these birds had flown three nights in a row before being controlled. The results suggest that long-distance passerine migrants regularly perform several <b>flight</b> <b>stages</b> in a row, with short rests in between, before refuelling, even if there are no major barriers ahead...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{deals with}} dynamic {{airspace}} sectorization (DAS) problem by an improved genetic algorithm (iGA). A graph model is first constructed {{that represents the}} airspace static structure. Then the DAS problem is formulated as a graph-partitioning problem to balance the sector workload under the premise of ensuring safety. In the iGA, multiple populations and hybrid coding are applied to determine the optimal sector number and airspace sectorization. The sector constraints are well satisfied by the improved genetic operators and protect zones. This method is validated by being applied to the airspace of North China in terms of three indexes, which are sector balancing index, coordination workload index and sector <b>average</b> <b>flight</b> time index. The improvement is obvious, as the sector balancing index is reduced by 16.5  %, the coordination workload index is reduced by 11.2  %, and the sector <b>average</b> <b>flight</b> time index is increased by 11.4  % during the peak-hour traffic.|$|R
