The maximal inhibitory response at 5 mg/kg of <b>ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> was 40. 0 ± 1. 69 compared to 65. 0 ± 0. 94 control values. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> also caused a positively correlated biphasic {{response in the}} serum female hormonal concentrations with an initial increase, followed by a time-dependent decrease in the serum values of luteinizing (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin. Furthermore <b>ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> also caused time- and dose- dependent effects on the haematological parameters. The effects were biphasic-increase within 72 hours {{and a reduction in}} the values of haemoglobin and packed cell volume within 7 - 28 days. The white blood count and lymphocyte counts were also reduced significantly at P ≤ 0. 05. However the neutrophil counts were increased dose- and time-dependently. Finally, <b>ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> caused a dose-dependent destruction of the liver and female reproductive organs namely the uterus, ovary and fallopian tubes.

40|$|A simple, rapid, and {{economical}} spectrophotometric method is {{developed for the}} determination of sulfur dioxide in sugar and air samples. The developed method {{is based on a}} red-brown peroxovanadate complex (lambda(max) = 470 nm) produced in 2 M sulfuric acid when <b>ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> is treated with hydrogen peroxide. Under fixed concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and <b>ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate,</b> when sodium metabisulfite (Na 2 S 2 O 5 = 2 SO(2)) is added, it preferentially reacts with hydrogen peroxide producing sulfuric acid, and the unreacted hydrogen peroxide then reacts with ammonium metavanadate; therefore, the concentration of sulfur dioxide is directly proportional to a decrease in the concentration of the peroxovanadate complex. The stoichiometric ratio between hydrogen peroxide and <b>ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> as well as the stability constant of the complex are determined by the modified Job's method and the respective values are found to be 1 : 1 and 2. 5 x 10 (4) mol(- 1) L, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{protective}} {{effect of the}} common mallow (Malva sylvestris) decoction on renal damages in rats induced by <b>ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> poisoning was evaluated. On the one hand, vanadium toxicity is associated {{to the production of}} reactive oxygen species, causing a lipid peroxidation and an alteration in the enzymatic antioxidant defence. On the other hand, many medicinal plants are known to possess antioxidant and radical scavenging properties, thanks to the presence of flavonoids. These properties were confirmed in Malva sylvestris by two separate methods; namely, the Diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl assay and the Nitroblue Tetrazolium reduction assay. Results In 80 rats exposed to <b>ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> (0. 24 mmol/kg body weight in drinking water) for 90 days, lipid peroxidation levels and superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured in kidney. A significant increase in the formation of free radicals and antioxidant enzyme activities was noticed. In addition, a histological examination of kidney revealed a structural deterioration of the renal cortical capsules and a shrinking of the Bowman space. In animals intoxicated by metavanadate but also given a Malva sylvestris decoction (0. 2 g dry mallow/kg body weight), no such pathologic features were observed: lipid peroxidation levels, antioxidant enzyme activities and histological features appeared normal as compared to control rats. Conclusion Malva sylvestris is proved to have a high antioxidative potential thanks to its richness in phenolic compounds. </p...|$|E

The reverse reaction, the isothermal recombination of V₂ 0 ₅ with ammonia and water vapour has also been investigated. The decomposition and recombination reactions were followed by continuously recording the mass loss of the sample with time using a Cahn R. G. Automatic Electrobalance. This enabled small samples (~ lOmg) to be used and consequently any self cooling of the sample during the decomposition was minimized. The intermediates and final products formed have been characterized by chemical analysis, X-ray powder diffraction studies, infrared spectroscopy and the mass loss involved in their formation. The changes in the physical properties of the samples during decomposition and recombination have been investigated by surface area measurements (using the BET method and krypton adsorption) and eIectron microscopy. Values for the enthalpy changes involved in the decomposition have been obtained by differential scanning calorimetry. The stoichiometry of the isothermal decomposition of <b>ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate,</b> under the various conditions of surrounding atmosphere has been discussed. Except for the later stages of the decomposition in ammonia, the results correspond well to the gradual reduction of the ratio of "(NH₄) ₂ 0 " to "V₂ 0 ₅" units from the original 1 : 1 ratio in <b>ammonium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> to pure "V₂ 0 ₅" with ammonia and water being evolved throughout the decomposition in the mole ratio of 2 : 1.
