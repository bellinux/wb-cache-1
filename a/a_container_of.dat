5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> makeup powder spray in the air and smears <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
5|$|Dougie steals the deputy's {{wedding ring}} and knocks over <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> Epsom salts {{into the tub}} where the {{unconscious}} Greer is soaking after Scully removed several specimens from his neck wounds. While Angela Villareal relieves herself, she spots the creature in the tub with the deputy. Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone. Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water but is a living form of water, becoming visible only when it attacks. He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce, with the body's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures. Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Jacobs {{was living}} with his mother in Manor Road, Tottenham, {{at the time of}} the riot. He had spent time in a {{residential}} school in Reading, and in 1985 joined a Tottenham gang, the Park Lane Crew. He was named shortly after the riot by two of those arrested, and was arrested himself five days later on suspicion of murder. The police had a photograph of him from the night carrying a petrol bomb and <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> rocks, though he told them he had first arrived at the estate after midnight, two hours after Blakelock was killed. In the end he was charged with affray, and in November 1986 was sentenced to eight years by Judge Neil Denison (the longest sentence handed out for affray during the riot, according to Rose), reduced on appeal to six years. Jacobs was one of nine suspects that the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge with Blakelock's murder at the conclusion of Commander Perry Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry.|$|E

5|$|Redback spiders {{are also}} found in small colonies in areas of New Zealand. They are {{frequently}} intercepted by quarantine authorities, often among steel or car shipments. They were introduced into New Zealand in the early 1980s and now are found around Central Otago (including Alexandra, Bannockburn and near Wanaka) in the South Island and New Plymouth in the North Island. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates warn residents and visitors of redback spiders, which have been present since 1990. Colonies have also been established in greenhouses in Belgium, and isolated observations indicate possible presence in New Guinea, the Philippines, and India. Some redbacks were found in Preston, Lancashire, England, after <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> parts arrived from Australia; some may have escaped into the countryside before pest controllers could destroy them. One redback {{was found in a}} back garden in Dartford in Kent. Two females were discovered in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E

Intricate carpets (alfombras) line the streets during the week’s celebration. Easter processions begin at sunrise and everyone comes to join the festivities.|$|E
25|$|ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) is a {{high-level}} programming interface to OLE DB. It uses a hierarchical object model to allow applications to programmatically create, retrieve, update and delete data from sources supported by OLE DB. ADO {{consists of a}} series of hierarchical COM-based objects and collections, an object that acts as <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> many other objects. A programmer can directly access ADO objects to manipulate data, or can send an SQL query to the database via several ADO mechanisms. ADO is made up of nine objects and four collections.|$|E

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{work performed}} under a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement (CRADA) with Corning, Inc., {{to analyze and}} test various techniques for controlling the motion of a high speed robotic arm carrying <b>an</b> open <b>container</b> <b>of</b> viscous liquid, in this case, molten glass. A computer model was generated to estimate the modes of oscillation of the liquid based on the shape <b>of</b> the <b>container</b> and the viscosity of the liquid. This fluid model was experimentally verified and tuned based on experimental data from a capacitive sensor on the side <b>of</b> the <b>container.</b> <b>A</b> model <b>of</b> the robot dynamics was also developed and verified through experimental tests on a Fanuc S- 800 robot arm. These two models were used to estimate the overall modes of oscillation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> open <b>container</b> <b>of</b> liquid being carried by a robot arm. Using the estimated modes, inverse dynamic control techniques {{were used to determine}} a motion profile which would eliminate waves on the liquid`s surface. Experimental tests showed that residual surface waves in <b>an</b> open <b>container</b> <b>of</b> water at the end of motion were reduced by over 95 % and that in-motion surface waves were reduced by over 75 %...|$|R
25|$|The Exhibits Design and Production Laboratory, {{located at}} Fort Stanton, was opened in October 1974. It was there where {{preparations}} {{for a new}} museum building took place. In 1976, it suffered a fire after masonite sheets fell from a forklift, and into <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> lacquer thinner. Staff were unable {{to call for help}} due to the fire damaging the phone lines. The damage cost approximately $75,000 and no one was injured. The museum became the first Smithsonian museum to use labels for the hearing impaired in their exhibitions, in 1980. An archives devoted to the area of Anacostia was created in 1977.|$|E
25|$|In 1809, Samuel Thomas von Soemmering {{developed}} the first telegraph. He used a device with 26 wires (1 wire for each {{letter of the}} German alphabet) terminating in <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> acid. At the sending station, a key, which completed a circuit with a battery, was connected as required {{to each of the}} line wires. The passage of current caused the acid to decompose chemically, and the message was read by observing at which of the terminals the bubbles of gas appeared. This is how he was able to send messages, one letter at a time.|$|E
25|$|When energy {{transfer}} ceases from a system, this condition {{is referred to}} as thermodynamic equilibrium. Usually this condition implies the system and surroundings are at the same temperature so that heat no longer transfers between them. It also implies that external forces are balanced (volume does not change), and all chemical reactions within the system are complete. The timeline varies for these events depending on the system in question. <b>A</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> ice allowed to melt at room temperature takes hours, while in semiconductors the heat transfer that occurs in the device transition from an on to off state could be on the order of a few nanoseconds.|$|E

As {{he looked in}} to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry would touch various parts of his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. In this manner, he {{may or may not}} have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was so upset after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.|$|E
25|$|Jo {{asks her}} school friend, Tama, a science student, to assist her and Louisa and Nicholas. When Louisa and Tama meet {{for the first}} time, they {{instantly}} fall for each other - with the romantic bond between them deepening as time passes. There is also a romantic bond between Jo and Nicholas. Sir Ivor, who had earlier taken Nicholas' family signet ring (saying {{it was for the}} ring's 'safekeeping'), calls for Nicholas to be brought to him and then takes the ring from a desk drawer. Sir Ivor drops the ring into <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> toxic waste - in front of the horrified Nicholas - and warns Nicholas not to attempt to retrieve his ring from the container.|$|E
25|$|When {{describing}} <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>of</b> gas, {{the term}} pressure (or absolute pressure) {{refers to the}} average force per unit area that the gas exerts {{on the surface of}} the container. Within this volume, it is sometimes easier to visualize the gas particles moving in straight lines until they collide with the container (see diagram at top of the article). The force imparted by a gas particle into the container during this collision is the change in momentum of the particle. During a collision only the normal component of velocity changes. A particle traveling parallel to the wall does not change its momentum. Therefore, the average force on a surface must be the average change in linear momentum from all of these gas particle collisions.|$|E
