This {{is central to the}} Baptist tradition that belongs to the EFC, as well as the close the relationship between faith and baptism. EFC learn and practice a Baptist dopsyn which means that persons who profess their faithin Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, are baptized in the Triune God's name, even in Christ. It is normal that in the early church, by immersion in water. It is a form that shows what happens: a transition from death to life. Baptism is a gift from God and human response to God's call to forgiveness, repentance and new life. Baptism of Christ is a baptism into the body of Christ. The baptism itself leaves the individual to Christ-Community of the Church and its life of Christ discipleship. Church's witness outwardly in word and deed the love of God, God's salvation and the kingdom of God, one testimony that can be both seen and heard among all people. This mission is shared by all Christians, but separating church and sends some of specific transnational tasks for which they have personal equipment and calling. The assignment can be realized both in the local environment and in a completely different cultural environments, [...] "nextIn congregations that only the EFC-related only baptism practiced at his own confession of faith. But many congregations are, {{for the sake of the}} historical development of the Christian church at large and the ecumenical situation, open to members who receive Christians from churches of other traditions than the Baptist, but they are baptized as believer. Parishes that are also connected to other communities presupposes respect EFKsproprietary nature of the Baptist denomination. The conscious baptism presupposes free will. Faith is a personal belief. It is an important Baptist principle that faith is a free response to God's word, a personal assignment to Jesus Christ as Lord. It is therefore necessary for freedom in religious matters, while congregation and faith community in Bible study and conversation deepen their common faith. This principle of freedom and free will justify the extension of the conscience and religious freedom for all in every society, Baptists who fought for throughout history. With the pattern of Jesus (Mark 10:13-16) parts Assembly over a parent's joy newborn children and offers children a blessing. This expresses our faith that God has a head start ineach child's life and represents a prayer for God's blessing and the child later to receive a personal belief and self ask to be baptized and a member of the church. Children's Blessing has a natural follow-up in the spiritual guidance provided by Assembly's children and youth. All believers have the same status in Christ and is called for in different ways to be Godkingdom of witnesses and servants. The Baptist <b>assembly</b> <b>view</b> vein, there is equality in the Assembly life and community. Social differences and other divisions cease to be valid parish life. The reconciled Community is a sign to the world and a radical force that create commitment to change in the surrounding community. An important manifestation of this is the mutual help and Community around the table where the Lord's Supper being celebrated in order to determine the concerns of the Assembly invited all members to call in and prayerfully the guidance of the Spirit together seek God's will (Acts 15:28, cf v 22). This fundamental equality is justified by the conviction that the spiritual gifts that Assembly required for the service given by the Spirit [...] "so that the self-will" [...] (1 Corinthians 12:11). Among these rewards are also different forms of spiritual leadership (Eph 4:7-13). Assembly members, gathered at the Assembly meeting, trying in prayer before God and call people call to serve in such data. In the case of the congregation often church leaders; such as pastors, elders and deacons. They are responsible to God and Assembly.|$|E

The philosophy of design derived from the concept that a round central Part with spikes would improve primary sta-bility. The inner shape of the proximal humerus (inner part of tuberosities) fits the round prosthesis shape so that a more stable refixation can be achieved than with a narrow or Square prosthesis design.

The RMF {{has been shown to}} improve filtration throughput when compared to other conventional methods such as cross-flow filtration. A concern with the RMF was that backpressure, or reverse flow through the disk, would damage the filter membranes. Reverse flow might happen {{as a result of an}} inadvertent valve alignment during flushing. Testing was completed in the Engineering Development Laboratory (EDL) located in SRNL to study the physical effects of backpressure as well as to determine the maximum allowable back-pressure for RMF disks. The RMF disks tested at the EDL were manufactured by SpinTek{trademark} Filtration and used a Pall Corporation PMM 050 filter membrane (0. 5 micron nominal pore size) made from 316 L stainless steel. Early versions of the RMF disks were made from synthetic materials that were incompatible with caustic solutions and radioactive service as well as being susceptible to delaminating when subjected to backpressure. Figure 1 - 1 shows the essential components of the RMF; 3 rotating disks and 3 stationary turbulence promoters (or shear elements) are shown. Figure 1 - 2 show the <b>assembly</b> <b>view</b> of a 25 disk RMF proposed for use at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and at the Hanford Facility. The purpose of the testing discussed in this report was to determine the allowable backpressure for RMF disks as well as study the physical effects of backpressure on RMF disks made with the Pall PMM 050 membrane. This was accomplished by pressurizing the disks in the reverse flow direction (backpressure) until the test limit was reached or until membrane failure occurred. Backpressure was applied to the disks with air while submerged in deionized (DI) water. This method provided a visual representation of membrane integrity via bubble flow patterns. Membrane failure was defined as the inability to filter effectively at the nominal filter pore size. Effective filtration was determined by turbidity measurements of filtrate that was produced by applying forward-pressure to the disks while submerged in a representative simulant. The representative simulant was Tank 8 F simulated sludge produced for SRNL by Optima Chemical. Two disks were tested. Disk 1 was tested primarily to determine approximate levels of backpressure where membrane failure occurred. These levels were then used to define the strategy for testing the Disk 2; a strategy that would better define and quantify the mode of failure...|$|E
