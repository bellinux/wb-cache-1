5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the diagram, the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> translated the design into one executable on the shop floor. After overcoming the manufacturing challenges posed by the curved refractor panels and the cabinet legs, the speaker entered production in late 1957.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{determinants}} {{of the position}} of the PPF at any given time are the state of technology and management expertise (which are reflected in the available production functions) and the available quantities of factors of production (materials, direct labor, <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> overhead).|$|E
5|$|After {{five days}} in Florida, {{production}} moved to England. The primary location was Pinewood Studios, home to among other sets, a recreation of the Fontainebleau, the South American city of the pre-title sequence and both Goldfinger's estate <b>and</b> <b>factory.</b> Three places near the studio were used, Black Park for the car chase involving Bond's Aston Martin and Goldfinger's henchmen inside the factory complex, RAF Northolt for the American airports and Stoke Park Club for the golf club scene.|$|E
25|$|Aisles {{can also}} be seen in shops, warehouses, <b>and</b> <b>factories,</b> where rather than seats, they have {{shelving}} to either side. In warehouses <b>and</b> <b>factories,</b> aisles may consist of storage pallets, <b>and</b> in <b>factories,</b> aisles may separate work areas. In health clubs, exercise equipment is normally arranged in aisles.|$|R

5|$|As the Second World War progressed, Sellers {{continued}} {{to develop his}} drumming skills, and played {{with a series of}} touring bands, including those of Oscar Rabin, Henry Hall and Waldini, as well as his father's quartet, before he left and joined a band from Blackpool. Sellers {{became a member of the}} Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), which provided entertainment for British forces <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> workers during the war. Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts, including impersonations of George Formby, with Sellers accompanying his own singing on ukulele.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} an {{important}} industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, new construction added approximately 137,000 square meters (1.5 million square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> space. More than 1,300 people move into the city daily, bolstering the economy by approximately 100 million Yuan.|$|E
5|$|A mockup of the cockpit, center {{fuselage}} and wing {{center section}} was built and was inspected by the BuAer {{in the fall}} 1944. However, the contract for the prototype XTSF-1s was terminated in January 1945. This was due {{to a variety of}} factors, including the Navy's belief that the Grumman engineers <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> were already at capacity producing the F6F Hellcat, the F7F, and the F8F Bearcat, that the XTSF-1 would be too large for practical operations from escort carriers, and because it was believed the Grumman G-70, to be built as the XTB3F, was a better prospect. In addition, the F7F was proving difficult to certify for operations from aircraft carriers, further prejudicing the Navy against the design.|$|E

50|$|The Hollinwood Branch Canal was {{comparatively}} rural {{in character}} apart from mills <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> at Droylsden. Its main {{purpose was to}} carry coal from numerous local collieries to the many mills <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> in the neighbourhood of the Ashton Canal. Passengers were also carried along its length.|$|R
5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at a meeting at the Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E
5|$|Feminism in Russia {{originated}} in the 18thcentury, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and mostly confined to the aristocracy. Throughout the 19thcentury, the idea of feminism remained closely tied to revolutionary politics and to social reform. In the 20thcentury Russian feminists, inspired by socialist doctrine, shifted their focus from philanthropic works to organizing among peasants <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> workers. After the February Revolution of 1917, feminist lobbying gained suffrage and nominal equality for women in education and the workplace; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience discrimination in certain career-paths (including politics) as well as income inequality and a greater burden of household work. In spite of this, the concern with feminism waned during this period.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{economic}} growth marked McKinley's presidency. He promoted the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> workers from foreign competition, and in 1900, he secured {{the passage of}} the Gold Standard Act. McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict, but when negotiation failed, he led the nation into the Spanish–American War of 1898; the U.S. victory was quick and decisive. As part of the peace settlement, Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; Cuba was promised independence, but at that time remained {{under the control of the}} U.S. Army. The United States annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898 and it became a U.S. territory.|$|E

50|$|Factories may {{be invoked}} in various ways, most often a method call (a factory method), {{sometimes}} by being called {{as a function}} if the factory is a callable object (a factory function). In some languages constructors <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> have identical syntax, while in others constructors have special syntax. In languages where constructors <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> have identical syntax, like Python, Perl, Ruby, Object Pascal, and F#, constructors can be transparently replaced by factories. In languages where they differ, one must distinguish them in interfaces, and switching between constructors <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> requires changing the calls.|$|R
5|$|Six IK-3s were {{serviceable}} {{when the}} Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941. All six were in service with the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun near the capital, Belgrade. Pilots flying the IK-3 {{claimed to have}} shot down 11 aircraft during the 11-day conflict. According to one account, {{to prevent them from}} falling into German hands, the surviving aircraft and incomplete airframes were destroyed by their crews <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> staff. Another account indicates that one aircraft survived the invasion but it was later destroyed through sabotage. The IK-3 design was used {{as the basis for the}} post-war Yugoslav-built Ikarus S-49 fighter.|$|E
5|$|The Duesenberg Model A was {{the first}} {{automobile}} in series production to have hydraulic brakes and the first automobile in series production in the United States with a straight-eight engine. Officially known as the Duesenberg Straight Eight, the Model A was first shown in late 1920 in New York City. Production was delayed by substantial changes {{to the design of}} the car, including a change in the engine valvetrain from horizontal overhead valves to an overhead camshaft; also during this time, the company had moved its headquarters <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> from New Jersey to Indiana. The Model A was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana, from 1921 to 1925 by the Duesenberg Automobiles and Motors Company and from 1925 to 1926 at the same factory by the restructured Duesenberg Motor Company. The successors to the company began referring to the car as the Model A when the Model J was introduced.|$|E

He was soon bored by this {{and entered the}} Jim Russell Racing School at Le Circuit Mont Tremblant to gain a racing licence. He then had a very successful season in Quebec regional Formula Ford, running his own two-year-old car and winning seven of the ten races he entered. The next year he progressed to Formula Atlantic, competing there for four years, running his own car again {{for one of those}} seasons. He won his first Atlantic race in 1975 at Gimli Motosport Park in heavy rain. In 1976, teamed with Chris Harrison's Ecurie Canada <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> March race engineer Ray Wardell, he dominated the season by winning {{all but one of the}} races and taking the US and Canadian titles. He won the Canadian championship again in 1977.|$|E

In Toraja, a coffee plantation <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> was established by Key Coffee of Japan, and Torajan coffee regained a reputation for quality within the growing international specialty coffee sector Multinational oil and mining companies opened new operations in Indonesia during the 1970s and 1980s. Torajans, particularly younger ones, relocated {{to work for the}} foreign companies—to Kalimantan for timber and oil, to Papua for mining, to the cities of Sulawesi and Java, and many went to Malaysia. The out-migration of Torajans was steady until 1985. and has continued since, with remittances sent back by emigre Torajans performing an important role within the contemporary economy.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} {{employers}} is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It {{is one of the}} major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in industrial estates on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as kitchen furniture <b>and</b> <b>factory</b> machinery. A high number of construction jobs have been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to many Health and Social Care jobs at local care homes and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital. As of the 2001 census, 1.9% of the town's population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.|$|E
