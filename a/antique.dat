40|$|<b>Antiques</b> {{tourism is}} a form of {{heritage}} tourism, wherein people travel in pursuit of <b>antiques,</b> or stop to shop for <b>antiques</b> during a trip for another purpose. It is an increasingly popular development strategy for cities and towns across North Carolina and throughout the United States. There have been few attempts to inventory or understand <b>antiques</b> tourism from an academic perspective, thus creating a need for site-specific empirical studies. This study describes the place of the <b>antiques</b> tourism trade in three eastern North Carolina communities —Selma, New Bern, and Wilson. Surveys, personal interviews, and general observation reveal significant differences in the ways in which entrepreneurs define what is “authentic ” antiques-based development. There is variation in the scale and spatial form of <b>antiques</b> districts, the level of town involvement in promoting the <b>antiques</b> trade, the marketing strategies of owners and operators, the use of the Internet in promoting and selling <b>antiques,</b> and the types of <b>antiques</b> and customers...|$|R

5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially <b>antique</b> world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this <b>antique</b> world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
