5|$|The game's sound team {{consisted}} of ten people: five handling general sound design, and five handling music composition. Hajime Wakai acted as the game's sound director and lead composer, {{with the other}} composers being Shiho Fujii, Mahito Yokota, and Takeshi Hama. Longtime series composer Koji Kondo had a supervisory role, only composing a single piece by himself: the music accompanying the prologue video describing the mythical origins of Demise and Hylia. He also helped in arranging the other composer's pieces, using an electric piano and a Mac computer. Fujii {{was responsible for the}} music focused on environments, dungeons, boss battles: among her work was the music for Skyloft. She used art and environmental assets so that her compositions would fit in with their environments. A first for the Zelda series, the music was performed using a live orchestra rather than synthesized instruments. It was the first time Nintendo EAD had used a live orchestra. Any previous orchestral elements in Twilight Princess, which amounted only to one track, were handled by their Tokyo division. Due to his experience, the department's musical lead Yokota was brought on to help orchestrate the score. Aonuma initially did not think of using an orchestra, and was still sure the score would remain synthesized even after Wakai <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> An orchestra was finally chosen after Miyamoto insisted upon it, a decision which surprised the entire team.|$|E

He also used the type font from our very first single, and I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{and he had no}} idea. He was just on point." [...] Fairey also remarked [...] "I use red {{frequently}} because it is a visually powerful, emotionally potent color. Red gets people's attention. In this case there is the added possibility that the red liquid could be blood, giving it an even more sinister sense of foreboding." [...] The red color of the artwork was changed for most of the special edition releases. The Best Buy reissue features a black-and-white version of the original artwork.|$|E
2500|$|In 1878, Newman's {{old college}} elected him an honorary fellow, and he {{revisited}} Oxford after an interval of thirty-two years, {{on the same}} day Pope Pius IX died. Pius had mistrusted Newman but his successor, Pope Leo XIII, was encouraged by the Duke of Norfolk and other English Catholic laymen to make Newman a cardinal, {{despite the fact that he}} was neither a bishop nor resident in Rome. Cardinal Manning seems not to have been interested in having Newman become a cardinal, and remained silent when the Pope <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] Ullathorne, as Newman's immediate superior, sent word to Pope Leo that he would welcome the honour. The offer was made by Rome in February 1879. Newman accepted the gesture as a vindication of his work, but made two requests: that he not be consecrated a bishop on receiving the cardinalate, as was usual at that time; and that he might remain in Birmingham.|$|E

"Why, if {{you should}} go and <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> if he is really penitent, he will be troubled most to think of his disobedience in going; into the bad company; but {{if he is not}} penitent, he will not think of that, but only go to scolding about the bad boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is another}} of Father's mysteries. When I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{he said that it}} was perhaps the most {{valuable}} thing he had, except one.

He hid it {{when he saw me}} and looked real silly; but after I had talked to him awhile I just <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and told him that the gossips said he wrote poetry in it, and if he did would he tell me, because I was dying to know. He said he wrote a little of {{everything}} in it; and then I begged him to read me something out of it, and he read me the story of Ursula and Kenneth." ...|$|E

60|$|Still, Olga {{could never}} {{understand}} why he sometimes had to leave her {{for three or four}} days together, and why during his absence, when she was left all alone at night in the solitary fort with those dreadful Buriats, they kept watch and ward so carefully all the time, and seemed so relieved when Niaz came back again. But whenever she <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Niaz only looked grave and anxious, and replied with a would-be careless wave of the hand that part of his duty was to guard the frontier, and that the Czar had not conferred a title and an order upon him for nothing. Olga felt frightened and disquieted on all such occasions, but somehow felt, from Niaz's manner, that she must not question him further upon the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father never {{wished to}} speak about this. It {{attracted}} my attention from the first; but when I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> he said: 'I shall {{tell you all about}} it some day, little girl--if I live! But not yet! The story is not yet told, as I hope to tell it to you! Some day, perhaps soon, I shall know all; and then we shall go over it together. And a mighty interesting story you will find it--from first to last!' Once afterward I said, rather lightly I am afraid: 'Is that story of the sarcophagus told yet, Father?' He shook his head, and looked at me gravely as he said: 'Not yet, little girl; but it will be--if I live--if I live!' His repeating that phrase about his living rather frightened me; I never ventured to ask him again." ...|$|E
60|$|The stone {{had made}} a jagged wound and for some days Lawson went about with a bandaged head. He had invented a likely story {{to account for the}} {{accident}} when the fellows at the club <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but he had no occasion to use it. No one referred to the matter. He saw them cast surreptitious glances at his head, but not a word was said. The silence could only mean that they knew how he came by his wound. He was certain now that Ethel had a lover, and they all knew who it was. But there was not the smallest indication to guide him. He never saw Ethel with anyone; no one showed a wish to be with her, or treated him in a manner that seemed strange. Wild rage seized him, and having no one to vent it on he drank more and more heavily. A little while before I came to the island he had had another attack of delirium tremens.|$|E

6000|$|A rustic named Curma, of Tullium, near Hippo, Augustine's town, {{fell into}} a catalepsy. On {{reviving}} he said: [...] "Run {{to the house of}} Curma the smith and see what is going on". Curma the smith was found to have died just when the other Curma awoke. [...] "I knew it," [...] said the invalid, [...] "for I heard it said in that place whence I have returned that not I, Curma of the Curia, but Curma the smith, was wanted." [...] But Curma of the Curia saw living as well as dead people, among others Augustine, who, in his vision, baptised him at Hippo. Curma then, in the vision, went to Paradise, where he was told to go and be baptised. He said it had been done already, and was answered, [...] "Go and be truly baptised, for that thou didst but see in vision". So Augustine christened him, and later, hearing of the trance, <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> when he repeated the tale already familiar to his neighbours. Augustine thinks it a mere dream, and apparently regards the death of Curma the smith as a casual coincidence. Un esprit fort, le Saint Augustin! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear he {{has been}} {{somewhat}} disingenuous {{with me on the}} subject. I think he tried to prevent the matter coming to my ears; and when I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he certainly implied--in fact, I grieve to say he left me under the impression that he had taken the house with a view to marrying dear Constance, and settling down. I expressed some surprise at his going so far out of town; but he did not volunteer any further explanation, and so the matter dropped." [...] The Rev. George paused, and then continued in a lower tone, [...] "Not long afterward I met him at a very late hour. He had perhaps exceeded a little in his cups; for he spoke to me with the most shocking cynicism, inviting me to supper at this house of his, and actually accusing me of knowing perfectly well the terrible truth about his occupation of it. He assured me that she--meaning, I presume, the unhappy person with whom he lives there--was exceptionally attractive; and I have since discovered that she is connected with the theatre, and of great notoriety. I need not tell you how dreadful all this is to me, Jasper; but {{to the best of my}} judgment, which I have fortified by earnest prayers for guidance, it is my imperative duty to tell you of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seven {{years ago}} your father gave his note to old James Patterson, Jacob's brother," [...] said Mrs. Duncan. [...] "It was for nine hundred dollars. Two years {{afterwards}} the note fell due and he paid James Patterson {{the full amount}} with interest. I remember the day well. I have only too good reason to. He {{went up to the}} Patterson place in the afternoon with the money. It was a very hot day. James Patterson receipted the note and gave it to your father. Your father always remembered that much; he was also sure that he had the note with him when he left the house. He then went over to see Paul Sinclair. A thunderstorm came up while he was on the road. Then, as you know, Ernest, just as he turned in at Paul Sinclair's gate the lightning flash struck and stunned him. It was weeks before he came to himself at all. He never did come completely to himself again. When, weeks afterwards, I thought of the note and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> we could not find it; and, search as we did, we never found it. Your father could never remember what he did with it when he left James Patterson's. Neither Mr. Sinclair nor his wife could recollect seeing anything of it {{at the time of the}} accident. James Patterson had left for California the very morning after, and he never came back. We did not worry much about the loss of the note then; it did not seem of much moment, and your father was not in a condition to be troubled about the matter." ...|$|E
5000|$|The post-canonical Pali Commentary [...] {{explains}} {{that at the}} time the sutta was preached there was great discussion over the whole of Jambudvipa regarding the definition of blessings.
