40|$|Fully {{convolutional}} networks (FCNs) {{have been}} proven very successful for semantic segmentation, but the FCN outputs are unaware of object instances. In this paper, we develop FCNs {{that are capable of}} proposing instance-level segment candidates. In contrast to the previous FCN that generates one score map, our FCN is designed to compute a small set of instance-sensitive score maps, each of which is the outcome of a pixel-wise classifier of a relative position to instances. On top of these instance-sensitive score maps, a simple <b>assembling</b> <b>module</b> is able to output instance candidate at each position. In contrast to the recent DeepMask method for segmenting instances, our method does not have any high-dimensional layer related to the mask resolution, but instead exploits image local coherence for estimating instances.

A transition to a durable, industrial and flexible approach is required. To accomplish such, a system is developed combining industrial manufacturing as well as reusing waste materials from demolition. To demonstrate the potential of the building method, a mock-up for a hikers’ cabin is developed by students of Eindhoven University of Technology. The cabin is an accommodation for shortstay holidays, commissioned by SNK (organization of natural campsites). Cabins are constructed by two fully <b>assembled</b> <b>modules</b> with a lightweight structure based on inner doors (reclaimed from demolition), timbered (inside and outside also reclaimed materials from demolition), and with insulation obtained from reclaimed inlay elements of modular ceilings.

40|$|Energy-based {{learning}} (EBL) is {{a general}} framework to describe supervised and unsupervised training methods for probabilistic and non-probabilistic factor graphs. An energy-based model associates a scalar energy to configurations of inputs, outputs, and latent variables.

The following operations can be performed on all BioBricks++ modules. The most fundamental operation is the arbitrary assembly of any two modules. In addition, the assembly of the two modules can be made seamless, with no extra intervening sequence inserted between the modules.

Each social media source utilizes different data types such as textual and visual. For example, Twitter is used to transmit short text messages, whereas Flickr is used to convey images and videos. Moreover, Facebook uses all of these data types. From the social media users’ standpoint, it is highly desirable to find patterns from different data formats. The result of the huge amount of data from different sources or types has provided many opportunities for researchers {{in the fields of}} data mining and data analytics. Not only the methods and tools to organize and manage such data have become extremely important, but also methods and tools to discover hidden knowledge from such data, which can be used for a variety of applications. For example, the mining of a user's profile on social media could help to discover any missing information, including the user's location or gender information. However, the task of developing such methods and tools is very challenging. Social media data is unstructured and different from traditional data because of its privacy settings, data noise, and large capacity of data. Moreover, combining image features and text information annotated by users reveals interesting properties of social user mining, and serves as a useful tool for discovering unknown information about the users. Minimal research has been conducted on the combination of image and text data for social user mining. To address these challenges and to discover unknown information about users, we proposed a novel mining framework for social user mining that includes: 1) a data <b>assemble</b> <b>module</b> for different media source, 2) a data integration module, and 3) mining applications.
