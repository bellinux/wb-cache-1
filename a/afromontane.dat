5|$|The Ethiopian hare is {{endemic to}} Africa, and {{is found in}} the <b>Afromontane</b> Biozone of Ethiopia, and in the borders of the Sudanian Savanna Biozone; it also occurs west of the Rift Valley, in the Ethiopian Highlands, and abundantly found around the Lake Tana in Ethiopia. It has also been {{possibly}} recorded in southeastern Sudan and in extreme northwestern Kenya.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian hare (Lepus fagani) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Leporidae. It was first {{described}} in 1903, by the British mammologist Oldfield Thomas. The dorsal pelage is brownish buff, and is finely grizzled with black. The ventral pelage is fluffy and white in colour. Endemic to Africa, it {{is found in the}} <b>Afromontane</b> Biozone of Ethiopia, and in the borders of the Sudanian Savanna Biozone. It is rated as a data deficientspecies by theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is an area}} of rich highveld and montane {{grassland}} flora. It {{has more}} than sixty grass species and a large variety of bulbs and herbs. Each of these species has its own flowering time, meaning that veld flowers can be seen throughout the summer. The park also has <b>Afromontane</b> forests and high-altitude Austro-Afro alpine grassland, which is scarce in South Africa. The ouhout (Leucosidea sericea), an evergreen species, is the most common tree in the park. Ouhout is a favourite habitat of beetles and 117 species occur on these trees in the park. The Lombardi poplars and weeping willows in the park are introduced species, but are kept because of their cultural and historic connection with the eastern Free State. Other exotic species in the park, for example wattle and bluegum, are systematically eradicated.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Klein {{studied the}} fossils of Hippotragus species in South Africa. Most {{of these were}} found to {{represent}} the bluebuck and the roan antelope. The fossil record suggested that the bluebuck occurred in large numbers during the last glacial period (nearly 0.1million years ago), and was more common than sympatric antelopes. The bluebuck could adapt to more open habitats than could the roan antelope, a notable point of difference between these species. Fossils of the bluebuck {{have been found in}} the Klaises River and the Nelson Bay Cave (near Plettenberg Bay) and Swartklip (to the west of the Hottentots Holland mountains). Faith et al. 2013 noted that the western and southern CFR were separated by biogeographical barriers, such as the Cape Fold Belt and <b>afromontane</b> forests. A 2011 study suggested that low sea levels facilitated migrations for large mammals; therefore the rise in sea levels with the beginning of the Holocene would have led to fragmented bluebuck populations and distanced many populations from the western coast (fossils dating to this period are scarce in the western coast but have been recorded from the southern coast). Thus, a mass extinction could have taken place, leaving behind mainly the populations that remained in the resource-rich western CFR. The causes of the drastic decline in bluebuck populations just before the 15th and 16th centuries have not been investigated; competition with livestock and habitat deterioration could have been major factors in its depletion.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia is an ecologically diverse country, {{ranging from}} the deserts along the eastern border to the {{tropical}} forests {{in the south to}} extensive <b>Afromontane</b> in the northern and southwestern parts. Lake Tana in the north {{is the source of the}} Blue Nile. It also has a large number of endemic species, notably the gelada, the walia ibex and the Ethiopian wolf ("Simien fox"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.|$|E

2500|$|The Cape Peninsula has {{an unusually}} rich biodiversity. Its {{vegetation}} consists predominantly of several {{different types of}} the unique and rich Cape Fynbos. The main vegetation type is endangered Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos, [...] but critically endangered Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Shale Renosterveld and <b>Afromontane</b> forest occur in smaller portions on the mountain ranges of the Peninsula.

2500|$|The flora in the Tibesti is Saharomontane, mixing Mediterranean, Sahara, Sahel and <b>Afromontane</b> vegetation. Biodiversity and {{endemism}} {{levels are}} much higher in the Tibesti than in the Aïr Mountains or the Ennedi Plateau, although the vegetation's coverage is highly dependent on rainfall. A number of oases lie along the courses of the enneris such as Enneri Yebige, which is virtually unexplored. These oases, which are more numerous {{to the north and}} west of the range, have vegetation of the genera Acacia, Ficus (fig trees), Hyphaene and Tamarix. Most gueltas are lined with macrophytes including Cyperus laevigatus, Equisetum ramosissimum, Juncus fontanesii and Scirpus holoschoenus. Acacia nilotica grow near these water basins. Myrtus nivellei and Nerium oleander grow between elevations of [...] {{in the western part of}} the range, while Tamarix nilotica grow at similar elevations in its northern part. Downstream, where the current of the enneris is slower and the riverbed is deeper, there are dense thickets of Tamarix aphylla and Salvadora persica (locally known as yii).|$|E
2500|$|Remnant {{patches of}} {{indigenous}} forest {{persist in the}} wetter ravines. However, much of the indigenous forest was felled by the early European settlers for fuel for the lime kilns needed during {{the construction of the}} Castle. The exact extent of the original forests is unknown, though most of it was probably along the eastern slopes of Devil's Peak, Table Mountain and the Back Table where names such as Rondebosch, Kirstenbosch, Klaassenbosch and Witteboomen survive (in Dutch [...] "bosch" [...] means forest; and [...] "boomen" [...] means trees) [...] Hout Bay (in Dutch [...] "hout" [...] means wood) was another source of timber and fuel as the name suggests. In the early 1900s commercial pine plantations were planted on these slopes {{all the way from the}} Constantiaberg to the front of Devil’s Peak, and even on top of the mountains, but these have now been largely cleared allowing fynbos to flourish in the regions where the indigenous <b>Afromontane</b> forests have not survived, or never existed.|$|E
50|$|In South Africa, <b>Afromontane</b> forests {{cover only}} 0.5% of the country's land area. The <b>Afromontane</b> forests occur along the mountainous {{arc of the}} Drakensberg Range, from Limpopo Province in the {{northeast}} to the Western Cape Province in the southwest. The <b>Afromontane</b> forests generally occur in well-watered areas, including ravines and south-facing slopes. The <b>Afromontane</b> forests are intolerant of fire, and the frequent fires of the surrounding fynbos, savanna, and grassland limit {{the expansion of the}} forests. Despite their small area, the <b>Afromontane</b> forests of South Africa produce valuable timber, particularly the real yellowwood (Podocarpus latifolius), Outeniqua yellowwood (Afrocarpus falcatus), and stinkwood (Ocotea bullata).|$|E
5000|$|The {{forest in}} Sheka {{which is also}} part of the Southwest Highlands Forests of Ethiopia is {{important}} for the conservation of <b>Afromontane</b> forest vegetation types, especially the <b>Afromontane</b> Rainforest and Alpine Bamboo thickets. <b>Afromontane</b> forest vegetation has long been {{considered one of the most}} threatened eco-regions in the world.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Afromontane</b> laurel forests {{describe}} {{the plant and}} animal species common to the mountains of Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula. The <b>afromontane</b> regions of Africa are discontinuous, separated from each other by lowlands, resembling a series of islands in distribution. Patches of forest with <b>Afromontane</b> floristic affinities occur all along the mountain chains. <b>Afromontane</b> communities occur above 1500-2000 m elevation near the equator, and as low as 300 m elevation in the Knysna-Amatole montane forests of South Africa. <b>Afromontane</b> forests are cool and humid. Rainfall is generally greater than , and can exceed 2000 mm in some regions, occurring throughout the year or during winter or summer, depending on the region. Temperatures can be extreme at some of the higher altitudes, where snowfalls may occasionally occur.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Afromontane</b> {{regions are}} subregions of the Afrotropical realm, {{one of the}} Earth's eight biogeographic realms, {{covering}} the {{plant and animal species}} found in the mountains of Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula.
