5|$|Dalmazzo urged Roatta {{to expand}} Italian links with Serb {{nationalist}} groups into {{an alliance with}} them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were {{under the impression that}} the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta {{was under the impression that}} Jevđević represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, and that they were aligned with Dangić. In early March, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jevđević sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorović and were concentrating around Nevesinje ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.|$|E
5|$|The {{elections}} of autumn 1790 {{resulted in a}} new group of deputies joining those already elected. A second Marshal of the Sejm was elected (Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha). As Małachowski was seen as associated with the reformers, Sapieha was initially seen as a conservative, although he would later switch sides and join the reformers. The doubled number of deputies exceeded the capacity of the parliament chambers, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the deputies could secure a seat; public interest also grew and the entire building and the observation galleries were often overcrowded.|$|E

25|$|By 1985 {{there were}} more than 1,000 teacher {{training}} schools - an indispensable tool in the effort to solve the acute shortage of qualified teachers. These schools, however, were unable to supply the number of teachers needed to attain modernization goals through 1990. Although a considerable number of students graduated as qualified teachers from institutions of Higher Learning, the relatively low social status and salary levels of teachers hampered recruitment, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the graduates of teachers' colleges became teachers. To attract more teachers, China tried to make teaching a more desirable and respected profession. To this end, the government designated September 10 as Teachers' Day, granted teachers pay raises, and made teachers' colleges tuition free. To further arrest the teacher shortage, in 1986 the central government sent teachers to underdeveloped regions to train local schoolteachers.|$|E

Many critics praised Wilder and Pryor, as well as Kevin Spacey's performance, but they mostly agreed that the script was terrible. Roger Ebert called it [...] "a real dud"; the Deseret Morning News described the film as [...] "stupid", with an [...] "idiotic script" [...] that had a [...] "contrived story" [...] and too many [...] "juvenile gags", while Vincent Canby called it [...] "by far the most successful co-starring vehicle for Mr. Pryor and Mr. Wilder", also acknowledging that [...] "this is not elegant movie making, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the gags are equally clever".|$|E

500|$|Ghosts I–IV is {{an almost}} entirely {{instrumental}} album, {{with only a few}} tracks containing sampled vocals. Reznor described the album's sound as [...] "the result of working from a very visual perspective—dressing imagined locations and scenarios with sound and texture; a soundtrack for daydreams." [...] PopMatters' review of the album compared its musical style to that of Brian Eno and Robert Fripp, ultimately categorizing it as [...] "dark ambient". The review went on to describe the music as [...] "a tonal painting, a collection of moods <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these moods are good ones." [...] NPR compared the album to the music of Erik Satie and Brian Eno; Rolling Stones review to [...] Brian Eno, specifically the album's sound to the instrumentals of Another Green World (1975) and the rhythm collages of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981).

500|$|In 1634 and 1635, Winthrop {{served as}} an assistant, while the influx of {{migrants}} brought first John Haynes and then Henry Vane to the governorship. [...] Haynes, Vane, Anne Hutchinson, and pastors Thomas Hooker and John Wheelwright all espoused religious or political views that were at odds {{with those of the}} earlier arrivals, including Winthrop. [...] Hutchinson and Wheelwright subscribed to the Antinomian view that following religious laws was not required for salvation, while Winthrop and others believed in a more Legalist view. [...] This religious rift is commonly called the Antinomian Controversy, and it significantly divided the colony; Winthrop saw the Antinomian beliefs as a particularly unpleasant and dangerous heresy. [...] By December 1636, the dispute reached into colonial politics, and Winthrop attempted to bridge the divide between the two factions. He wrote an account of his religious awakening and other theological position papers designed to harmonize the opposing views. [...] (It is not known how widely these documents circulated, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them have survived.)
