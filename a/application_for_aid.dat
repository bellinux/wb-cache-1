There was also a certain James who claimed to be the King of Majorca, a large island in the Mediterranean Sea, who was in much the same situation in respect to his kingdom. Prince Edward promised to aid Don Pedro in recovering his throne, and he forthwith began to make preparations to this end. He also promised James that, as soon as he had accomplished the work which he had undertaken for Don Pedro, he would fit out an expedition to Majorca, and so restore him too to his kingdom.|$|E

40|$|In {{this case}} note, Leonard J. Morreale, Jr. {{analyzes}} Peninsula General Nursing Home v. Sugarman, 57 App. Div. 2 d 268, 394 N. Y. S. 2 d 644 (1 st Dep 2 ̆ 7 t 1977). Jacob Stupler, an alleged indigent, {{was enrolled in}} the federal Medicare program which reimbursed the petitioner, Peninsula General Nursing Home, {{for the cost of}} medical care and services rendered to him. When federal benefits were terminated, petitioner promptly applied for Medicaid coverage on behalf of Mr. Stupler pursuant to the New York State Medical Assistance for Needy Persons Plan. The Social Services Department of the City of New York denied the application because Mr. Stupler had sold his house less than one year before the date of his <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>aid.</b> Social Services Law § 366 (1) (e) provides that a transfer of property within one year of the date of <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>aid</b> creates a presumption that the transfer was for the purpose of qualifying for aid. This presumption would render an applicant ineligible. The nursing home requested a hearing before the Department of Social Services to challenge the denial of the aid application. The Department denied this request, ruling that the Social Services Law allows only the recipient of aid or his family to obtain review. The trial court ruled that Social Services Law section 366 and the regulations thereunder do not afford the petitioner due process and are therefore unconstitutional. It enjoined the Commissioner of Social Services from enforcing the provisions of the statute without giving the petitioner an opportunity for a hearing on the denial of public assistance to its patient. The appellate division affirmed, ruling that the petitioner should obtain the hearing it requested...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the percentage of}} students who do not take up their federal need-based student financial aid entitlements and sheds light on determinants of this behavior. Against the background that educational mobility in Germany is low although extensive student financial aid for needy students is available, it is crucial to know whether students assert their claims for student aid at all. To investigate non-take-up, we set up a microsimulation model for the German Socio-Economic Panel Study 2002 - 2013 and estimate the respective aid amounts students would have received, had they filed an application for need-based aid. The results indicate that about 40 % of the eligible low-income students do not take up their entitlements. We employ instrumental variable techniques and a sample selection model to consider several potential explanatory factors for this behavior. Our results suggest that non-take-up is inversely related to the level of benefits, though the elasticity is rather low. Apart from that, a shorter expected duration of benefit receipt is related to a higher non-take-up rate, whereas the possibility to draw upon older siblings' experience with completing the complex <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>aid</b> is associated with higher probabilities to claim. Moreover, we find robust evidence that significantly more students socialized in the former socialist East Germany choose to take up student aid than similar West German students. Finally, in line with behavioral economic theory, debt aversion of highly impulsive and impatient students is associated with higher rates of non-take-up...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedToday's {{expanding}} {{global society}} has caused {{changes in the}} needs of the workforce as well as the level of skills and education required by various jobs across the United States. While the number of jobs demanding a post-secondary degree increase, the U. S. output of college graduates has not kept pace. A previous leader in secondary and tertiary educational attainment, the U. S. has been outperformed by other countries in recent years. Specifically, the State of Hawaii has experienced a decline in college-going rates over the last decade. Affordability has been identified by the literature as a potential barrier for students, particularly low-income students, to attend college.; This research study adds to the literature by studying factors which may inhibit <b>application</b> <b>for</b> financial <b>aid</b> by low-income students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, the research campus of the University of Hawaii public higher education system. The focus of the study was on students newly enrolled on the campus and their attitudes toward college financial assistance. Specifically, students’ perceptions of the information available about financial aid and financial aid resources as well as their attitudes toward the financial aid application process were studied. Overall, it was found that information about financial aid and financial aid deadlines was readily available to students but that they needed to be compelled and motivated to apply, including feeling that they could not attend college without aid and that they would qualify <b>for</b> <b>aid.</b> In addition, the application process was very difficult and laborious, but students felt that it was worthwhile to apply. Persistent support and external pressure (i. e., from parents or siblings, counselors, etc.) were essential to complete the Free <b>Application</b> <b>for</b> Federal Student Aid.; The findings from this study will help policymakers and educational leaders to develop policies and programs to increase <b>application</b> <b>for</b> financial <b>aid</b> by low-income students. Ultimately, it is recommended that federal policymakers simplify the Free <b>Application</b> <b>for</b> Federal Student <b>Aid,</b> that state officials support educational institutions in their quest to assist students to enroll in college, and that college and high school educators work together to provide mandatory sessions that motivate students {{to go to college and}} give practical, hands-on assistance to apply to college and apply <b>for</b> financial <b>aid...</b>|$|R
