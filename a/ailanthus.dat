5|$|Several {{species of}} Lepidoptera utilise {{the leaves of}} <b>ailanthus</b> as food, {{including}} the Indian moon moth (Actias selene) and the common grass yellow (Eurema hecabe). In North America the tree is the host plant for the <b>ailanthus</b> webworm (Atteva aurea), though this ermine moth is native to Central and South America and originally used {{other members of the}} mostly tropical Simaroubaceae as its hosts. In its native range A. altissima is associated with at least 32 species of arthropods and 13 species of fungi.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{the tree}} of heaven has a long and rich history. It was {{mentioned}} in the oldest extant Chinese dictionary and listed in countless Chinese medical texts for its purported ability to cure ailments ranging from mental illness to baldness. The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as an astringent. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the <b>ailanthus</b> silkmoth, a moth involved in silk production. <b>Ailanthus</b> has {{become a part of}} western culture as well, with the tree serving as the central metaphor and subject matter of the best-selling American novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{vegetation}} in the catchment of {{the lake}} consists of Melia, <b>Ailanthus,</b> Robinia, Daphne, Celtis, Rose, Ephedra, Pinus roxburghii, Pinus halepensis, Pinus gerardiana, Cupressus torulosa and Cupressus arizonica. The valley also has a rich cultivation of crops such as paddy, wheat and fodder.|$|E
5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states {{that when the}} leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of <b>ailanthus,</b> catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ailanthus</b> {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} trees are widely {{gathered}} as fodder for livestock and some can be eaten by humans but {{they tend to}} be high in tannins which makes them bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (e.g., Thai food) and <b>Ailanthus</b> (e.g., in Korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the European bay tree (Laurus nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used for flavouring food. Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to make picking the leaves easier.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant life}} around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek {{includes}} various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's riparian buffer contains old growth forest, including tulip poplar trees. In addition to tulip popular, hemlock and pine also {{occur in the}} Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some riparian buffering. Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas are full of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include Japanese knotweed, Norway Maple, and <b>Ailanthus.</b> Overall, the riparian buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ailanthus</b> {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Not {{all silk}} is {{produced}} by Bombyx mori. There are several species of Saturniidae that also are farmed for their silk, such as the <b>Ailanthus</b> moth (Samia cynthia group of species), the Chinese oak silkmoth (Antheraea pernyi), the Assam silkmoth (Antheraea assamensis), and the Japanese silk moth (Antheraea yamamai).|$|E
25|$|Natural {{vegetation}} around Bisbee has a semi-desert appearance with shrubby acacia, oak and the like, {{along with}} cacti, grass, ocotillo and yucca. The town itself {{is much more}} luxuriant with native trees such as cypress, sycamore and cottonwood plus the introduced <b>ailanthus</b> and Old World cypresses, cedars and pines. Palms are capable of large size, but are not reliably hardy. A few higher-elevation trees such as blue spruce and white fir are growing fairly well in Bisbee.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{tendered}} {{drawings of}} plants and flowers from the late 1940s on. <b>Ailanthus</b> (1948) is the first plant drawing that he executed in Boston, Hyacinth (1949) {{was the first one}} he did when he was in Paris. Beginning in 1949, while living in Paris (and influenced in this choice of subject by Henri Matisse and Jean Arp) he began to draw simple plant and seaweed forms. The plant studies are, for the most part, contour drawings of leaves, stems and flowers done in clean strokes of pencil or pen and centered on the page.|$|E
25|$|As with coppicing, only {{species with}} {{vigorous}} epicormic growth {{may be made}} into pollards. In these species (which include many broadleaved trees but few conifers), removal of the main apical stems releases the growth of many dormant buds under the bark on {{the lower part of}} the tree. Trees without this growth will, of course, die without their leaves and branches. Some smaller tree species do not readily form pollards, because cutting the main stem stimulates growth from the base, effectively forming a coppice stool instead. Examples of trees that do well as pollards include broadleaves such as beeches (Fagus), oaks (Quercus), maples (Acer), black locust or false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), hornbeams (Carpinus), lindens and limes (Tilia), planes (Platanus), horse chestnuts (Aesculus), mulberries (Morus), redbud (Cercis canadensis), tree of heaven (<b>Ailanthus</b> altissima), willows (Salix), and a few conifers, such as yews (Taxus).|$|E
500|$|In Chinese literature, <b>ailanthus</b> {{is often}} used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree {{representing}} {{a father and a}} stump being a spoiled child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write [...] "wishing your <b>ailanthus</b> and daylily are strong and happy", with <b>ailanthus</b> metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a [...] "good-for-nothing <b>ailanthus</b> stump sprout", meaning the child is irresponsible. This derives from the literature of Zhuangzi, a Taoist philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later scholars associated this tree with <b>ailanthus</b> and applied the metaphor to children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they don't follow rules or traditions.|$|E
500|$|<b>Ailanthus</b> altissima , {{commonly}} known as tree of heaven, <b>ailanthus,</b> or in Standard Chinese as chouchun (...) , is a deciduous tree in the Simaroubaceae family. It is native to both northeast and central China, as well as Taiwan. Unlike {{other members of the}} genus <b>Ailanthus,</b> it is found in temperate climates rather than the tropics. The tree grows rapidly and is capable of reaching heights of [...] in 25years. However, the species is also short lived and rarely lives more than 50years, though its remarkable suckering ability makes it possible for this tree to clone itself indefinitely and live considerably longer [...] (since they are linked to the mother tree and thus partly fed by it, the suckers are less vulnerable than the seedlings and can grow faster).|$|E
500|$|<b>Ailanthus</b> is an {{opportunistic}} {{plant that}} thrives {{in full sun}} and disturbed areas. It spreads aggressively both by seeds and vegetatively by root sprouts, re-sprouting rapidly after being cut. It is considered a shade-intolerant tree and cannot compete in low-light situations, though it is sometimes found competing with hardwoods, but such competition rather indicates it {{was present at the}} time the stand was established. On the other hand, a study in an old-growth hemlock-hardwood forest in New York found that <b>Ailanthus</b> was capable of competing successfully with native trees in canopy gaps where only 2 to 15% of full sun was available. The same study characterised the tree as using a [...] "gap-obligate" [...] strategy in order to reach the forest canopy, meaning it grows rapidly during a very short period rather than growing slowly over a long period. It is a short lived tree in any location and rarely lives more than 50 years. <b>Ailanthus</b> is among the most pollution-tolerant of tree species, including sulfur dioxide, which it absorbs in its leaves. It can withstand cement dust and fumes from coal tar operations, as well as resist ozone exposure relatively well. Furthermore, high concentrations of mercury have been found built up in tissues of the plant.|$|E
500|$|Light was shed on the taxonomic {{status of}} <b>ailanthus</b> in 1788 when René Louiche Desfontaines {{observed}} the samaras of the Paris specimens, which were still labelled Rhus succedanea, {{and came to}} the conclusion that the plant was not a sumac. He published an article with an illustrated description and gave it the name <b>Ailanthus</b> glandulosa, placing it in the same genus as the tropical species then known as A. integrifolia (white siris, now A. triphysa). The name is derived from the Ambonese word ailanto, meaning [...] "heaven-tree" [...] or [...] "tree reaching for the sky". The specific glandulosa, referring to the glands on the leaves, persisted until as late as 1957, but it was ultimately made invalid as a later homonym at the species level. The current species name comes from Walter T. Swingle who was employed by the United States Department of Plant Industry. He decided to transfer Miller's older specific name into the genus of Desfontaines, resulting in the accepted name <b>Ailanthus</b> altissima. Altissima is Latin for [...] "tallest", and refers to the sizes the tree can reach. The plant is sometimes incorrectly cited with the specific epithet in the masculine (glandulosus or altissimus), which is incorrect since botanical, like Classical Latin, treats most tree names as feminine.|$|E
500|$|The 1943 book A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith {{uses the}} tree of heaven as its central metaphor, using it as an analogy for the ability to thrive in a {{difficult}} environment. At that {{time as well as}} now, <b>ailanthus</b> was common in neglected urban areas. She writes: ...|$|E
500|$|Ingo Vetter, a German {{artist and}} {{professor}} of fine arts at Umeå University in Sweden, {{was influenced by the}} idea of the [...] "ghetto palm" [...] and installed a living <b>ailanthus</b> tree taken from Detroit for an international art show called Shrinking Cities at the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{prolonged}} {{periods of}} natural fire suppression, {{much of the}} Pine Bush has evolved into northern or southern hardwood forests. These forests, often dominated by invasive species, occupy roughly [...] of the Albany Pine Bush Preserve. The southern hardwood forests are dominated by black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), which is exotic, and black cherry (Prunus serotina); [...] with lesser numbers of native oaks (Quercus) and maples (Acer), and the exotic, invasive tree of heaven (<b>Ailanthus</b> altissima). The shrub layer is dominated by black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) and other brambles (Rubus sp.). In contrast the northern hardwood forests are dominated by aspen (Populus), black cherry, red maple (Acer rubrum), white pine (Pinus strobus), gray birch (Betula populifolia), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and oaks.|$|E
500|$|The pale yellow, {{close-grained}} and satiny wood of <b>ailanthus</b> {{has been}} used in cabinet work. It is flexible and well suited to the manufacture of kitchen steamers, which are important in Chinese cuisine for cooking mantou, pastries and rice. Zhejiang Province in eastern China is most famous for producing these steamers. It is also considered a good source of firewood across much of its range as it moderately hard and heavy, yet readily available. The wood is also used to make charcoal for culinary purposes. [...] There are problems with using the wood as lumber, however. Because the trees exhibit rapid growth for the first few years, the trunk has uneven texture between the inner and outer wood, which can cause the wood to twist or crack during drying. Techniques have been developed for drying the wood so as to prevent this cracking, allowing it to be commercially harvested. Although the live tree tends to have very flexible wood, the wood is quite hard once properly dried.|$|E
500|$|In 1784, {{not long}} after Jussieu had sent seeds to England, some were {{forwarded}} to the United States by William Hamilton, a gardener in Philadelphia. In both Europe and America it quickly became a favoured ornamental, especially as a street tree, and by 1840 it was available in most nurseries. The tree was separately brought to California in the 1890s by Chinese immigrants who came during the California Gold Rush. It has escaped cultivation in all areas where it was introduced, but most extensively in the United States. It has naturalised across much of Europe, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, the Pannonian region (i.e. southeastern Central Europe around the Danube river basin from Austria, Slovakia and Hungary south to the Balkan ranges) and most countries of the Mediterranean Basin. In Montenegro and Albania A. altissima is widespread in both rural and urban areas and while in the first it was introduced as an ornamental plant, it very soon invaded native ecosystems with disastrous results and became an invasive species. <b>Ailanthus</b> has also been introduced to Argentina, Australia (where it is a declared weed in New South Wales and Victoria), New Zealand (where it is listed under the National Pest Plant Accord and is classed an [...] "unwanted organism"), the Middle East and in some countries in South Asia such as Pakistan. In South Africa it is listed as an invasive species which must be controlled, or removed and destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{result of}} this {{overgrazing}} on the native plant ecology and grassland was catastrophic. [...] Animals selectively graze on plant species they co-evolved to consume.

Along the shared [...] "lasso spur" [...] is a canal for mosquito control {{as well as an}} intersection with the old Hunter Island causeway's cobblestone approach path. Going counterclockwise from the intersection with the two [...] "loops", the trail passes through a grove of 100 Norway Spruces planted in 1918; a black locust forest from the 1970s; and a thicket of shrubs and vines.

60|$|In {{this great}} Class, the Lepidoptera almost alone afford means for judging of the {{proportional}} {{numbers of the}} sexes; for they have been collected with special care by many good observers, and have been largely bred from the egg or caterpillar state. I had hoped that some breeders of silk-moths might have kept an exact record, but after writing to France and Italy, and consulting various treatises, I cannot find that this has ever been done. The general opinion appears {{to be that the}} sexes are nearly equal, but in Italy, as I hear from Professor Canestrini, many breeders are convinced that the females are produced in excess. This same naturalist, however, informs me, that in the two yearly broods of the <b>Ailanthus</b> silk-moth (Bombyx cynthia), the males greatly preponderate in the first, whilst in the second the two sexes are nearly equal, or the females rather in excess.|$|E
60|$|The trees {{planted by}} a later generation, both shade and fruit, were more varied. The most {{abundant}} was the mulberry, {{of which there}} were many hundreds, mostly in rows, forming walks, and albeit {{of the same species}} as our English mulberry they differed from it in the great size and roughness of the leaves and in producing fruit of a much smaller size. The taste of the fruit was also less luscious and it was rarely eaten by our elders. We small children feasted on it, but it was mostly for the birds. The mulberry was looked on as a shade, not a fruit tree, and the other two most important shade trees, in number, were the acacia blanca, or false acacia, and the paradise tree or pride of China. Besides these there was a row of eight or ten <b>ailanthus</b> trees, or tree of heaven as it is sometimes called, with tall white smooth trunk crowned with a cluster of palm-like foliage. There was also a modern orchard, containing pear, apple, plum, and cherry trees.|$|E
60|$|Here, too, was the breeding-place of the {{beautiful}} black-and-white stilt, and of other species too many to mention. But my greatest delight was in finding breeding in this place a bird I loved {{more than all the}} others I have named--a species of marsh trupial, a bird {{about the size of the}} common cowbird, and like it, of a uniform deep purple, but with a cap of chestnut-coloured feathers on its head. I loved this bird for its song--the peculiar delicate tender opening notes and trills. In spring and autumn large flocks would occasionally visit our plantation, and the birds in hundreds would settle on a tree and all sing together, producing a marvellous and beautiful noise, as of hundreds of small bells all ringing at one time. It was by the water I first found their breeding-place, where about three or four hundred birds had their nests quite near together, and nests and eggs and the plants on which they were placed, with the solicitous purple birds flying round me, made a scene of enchanting beauty. The nesting-site was on a low swampy piece of ground grown over with a semi-aquatic plant called durasmillo in the vernacular. It has a single white stalk, woody in appearance, two to three feet high, and little thicker than a man's middle finger, with a palm-like crown of large loose lanceolate leaves, so that it looks like a miniature palm, or rather an <b>ailanthus</b> tree, which has a slender perfectly white bole. The solanaceous flowers are purple, and it bears fruit the size of cherries, black as jet, in clusters of three to five or six. In this forest of tiny palms the nests were hanging, attached to the boles, where two or three grew close together; it was a long and deep nest, skilfully made of dry sedge leaves woven together, and the eggs were white or skim-milk blue spotted with black at the large end.|$|E
60|$|Besides {{the more}} active {{habits of the}} males, their earlier {{emergence}} from the cocoon, {{and in some cases}} their frequenting more open stations, other causes may be assigned for an apparent or real difference in the proportional numbers of the sexes of Lepidoptera, when captured in the imago state, and when reared from the egg or caterpillar state. I hear from Professor Canestrini, that it is believed by many breeders in Italy, that the female caterpillar of the silk-moth suffers more from the recent disease than the male; and Dr. Staudinger informs me that in rearing Lepidoptera more females die in the cocoon than males. With many species the female caterpillar is larger than the male, and a collector would naturally choose the finest specimens, and thus unintentionally collect a larger number of females. Three collectors have told me that this was their practice; but Dr. Wallace is sure that most collectors take all the specimens which they can find of the rarer kinds, which alone are worth the trouble of rearing. Birds when surrounded by caterpillars would probably devour the largest; and Professor Canestrini informs me that in Italy some breeders believe, though on insufficient evidence, that in the first broods of the <b>Ailanthus</b> silk-moth, the wasps destroy a larger number of the female than of the male caterpillars. Dr. Wallace further remarks that female caterpillars, from being larger than the males, require more time for their development, and consume more food and moisture: and thus they would be exposed during a longer time to danger from ichneumons, birds, etc., and in times of scarcity would perish in greater numbers. Hence it appears quite possible that in a state of nature, fewer female Lepidoptera may reach maturity than males; and for our special object we are concerned with their relative numbers at maturity, when the sexes are ready to propagate their kind.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have already}} seen that animals may be habituated to a changed diet; but some {{additional}} instances may be given. In the Polynesian Islands and in China the dog is fed exclusively on vegetable matter, and the taste {{for this kind of}} food is to a certain extent inherited. (24/34. Gilbert White 'Nat. Hist. Selborne' 1825 volume 2 page 121.) Our sporting dogs will not touch the bones of game birds, whilst most other dogs devour them with greediness. In {{some parts of the world}} sheep have been largely fed on fish. The domestic hog is fond of barley, the wild boar is said to disdain it; and the disdain is partially inherited, for some young wild pigs bred in captivity showed an aversion for this grain, whilst others of the same brood relished it. (24/35. Burdach 'Traite de Phys.' tome 2 page 267 as quoted by Dr. P. Lucas 'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 1 page 388.) One of my relations bred some young pigs from a Chinese sow by a wild Alpine boar; they lived free in the park, and were so tame that they came to the house to be fed; but they would not touch swill, which was devoured by the other pigs. An animal when once accustomed to an unnatural diet, which can generally be effected only during youth, dislikes its proper food, as Spallanzani found to be the case with a pigeon which had been long fed on meat. Individuals of the same species take to new food with different degrees of readiness; one horse, it is stated, soon learned to eat meat, whilst another would have perished from hunger rather than have partaken of it. (24/36. This and several other cases are given by Colin 'Physiologie Comp. des Animaux Dom.' 1854 tome 1 page 426.) The caterpillars of the Bombyx hesperus feed in a state of nature on the leaves of the Cafe diable, but, after having been reared on the <b>Ailanthus,</b> they would not touch the Cafe diable, and actually died of hunger. (24/37. M. Michely de Cayenne in 'Bull. Soc. d'Acclimat.' tome 8 1861 page 563.) ...|$|E
