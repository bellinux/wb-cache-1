40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{coverage}} of the <b>atelocollagen</b> membrane at the chondral defect after subchondral drilling might improve the beneficial effects for cartilage repair because of the prevention of scattering and accumulation of cells and growth factors from bone marrow within the chondral defect. On the other hand, it might block cells and factors derived from the synovium or cause high pressure in the chondral defect, resulting in prevention of cells and growth factors gushing out from the bone marrow, which leads to disadvantages for cartilage repair. MethodWe tested this hypothesis in a 2 -mm-diameter chondral defect created in the articular cartilage of the patellar groove in a rat models. Defects were left untreated, or were drilled or drilled and covered with an <b>atelocollagen</b> membrane; healing was evaluated by histology and gene expression analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. ResultsMembrane coverage induced bone tissue ingrowth into the punched chondral defect. At 1 week, expression of TGFβ, Sox 9, Runx 2, osteocalcin, Col 1 a 1, and Col 2 a 1 in the drilling group {{was significantly higher than}} in the covering group. At 4 weeks, expressions of TGFβ, Runx 2, and Col 1 a 1 were all significantly higher in the drilling group, while Sox 9, osteocalcin, and Col 2 a 1 were significantly higher in the covering group.

40|$|ObjectiveIntimal {{hyperplasia}} is a {{major obstacle}} to patency in grafted veins. Although migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) pivotally affect the vascular remodeling process, no therapy has been established to prevent intimal hyperplasia of vein grafts. We previously reported that the actin-binding protein Girdin crucially affects arterial remodeling. In this study, we investigated the role of Girdin in venous SMCs and evaluated a therapeutic strategy for vein graft failure in vivo using small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets Girdin. MethodsWe investigated the relationship between Girdin expression and intimal hyperplasia using a rabbit vein graft model. Vein grafts under low-flow conditions were performed in Japanese White rabbits. For in vitro analyses, we isolated primary venous SMCs from vein graft neointima. siRNA that targets Girdin was mixed with <b>atelocollagen,</b> which stabilizes and releases nucleic acid reagents slowly and is applied perivascularly to the vein grafts at operation. Intimal hyperplasia was evaluated 4  weeks later. ResultsIn the rabbit model, increased Girdin expression {{was seen in the}} neointima after the grafting operation. Using primary venous SMCs, we showed that Girdin is required for rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in venous SMCs and that siRNA-mediated Girdin knockdown significantly reduced venous SMC migration and proliferation. Girdin knockdown via perivascular application of siRNA using <b>atelocollagen</b> markedly reduced intimal thickening after the grafting operation. ConclusionsDepletion of Girdin attenuated venous SMCs migration and proliferation in vitro and intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts in vivo. Our findings suggest that Girdin affects migration and proliferation of vascular SMCs in vein grafts and that controlled release of Girdin siRNA using <b>atelocollagen</b> could be a novel therapeutic strategy for vein graft failure.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} {{interest}} in the use of biomaterials to stimulate wound healing. This is largely due to their ability to centralize high concentrations of compounds known to promote wound healing at a needed location. Joints present a unique challenge to using scaffolds because of the presence of enzymes in synovial fluid which are known to degrade materials that would be stable in other parts of the body. The hypothesis of this study was that <b>atelocollagen</b> scaffolds would have greater resistance to enzymatic degradation than scaffolds made of gelatin, fibrin and whole blood. To test this hypothesis, collagen and fibrin-based scaffolds were placed in matrix metallopeptidase- 1 (MMP- 1), elastase, and plasmin solutions at physiologic concentrations, and the degradation of each scaffold was measured at varying time points. The <b>atelocollagen</b> scaffolds had a significantly greater resistance to degradation by MMP- 1, elastase and plasmin over the fibrin based scaffolds.

40|$|Currently {{two factors}} hinder {{the use of}} {{collagen}} as building block of regenerative devices: the limited mechanical strength in aqueous environment, and potential antigenicity. Polymeric collagen is naturally found in the cross-linked state and is mechanically tougher than the monomeric, acid-soluble collagen ex vivo. The antigenicity of collagen, on the other hand, is mainly ascribed to inter-species variations in amino acid sequences of the non-helical terminal telopeptides. These telopeptides can be removed through enzymatic treatment to produce <b>atelocollagen,</b> although {{the effect of this}} cleavage on triple helix organization, amino acidic composition and thermal properties is often disregarded. Here, we compare the structural, chemical and physical properties of polymeric and monomeric type I collagen with and without telopeptides, in an effort to elucidate the influence of either mature covalent crosslinks or telopeptides. Circular dichroism (CD) was used to examine the triple helical conformation and quantify the denaturation temperature (Td) of both monomeric collagen (36. 5 °C) and monomeric <b>atelocollagen</b> (35. 5 °C). CD measurements were combined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in order to gain insight into the triple helix-to-coil thermal transition and shrinkage temperature (Ts) of polymeric atelo collagen (44. 8 °C), polymeric collagen (62. 7 °C), monomeric atelo collagen (51. 4 °C) and monomeric collagen (66. 5 °C). Structural and thermal analysis was combined with high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the content of specific collagen amino acidic residues used as markers for the presence of telopeptides and mature crosslinks.

Therefore, BMP has been investigated as an osteoinductive factor for preparation of a bone substitute. This preliminary report presents bone augmentation using repeated injection of <b>atelocollagen</b> (AC) solution with BMP in mice and rats. The crude BMP and bone type Ⅰ <b>atelocollagen</b> were prepared from fresh bovine bones. Intramuscular injection of the AC solution with crude BMP resulted in reproducible bone induction after 2 weeks. BMP activity depended on the concentration of the AC solution as a carrier, and the 0. 75 % AC solution with BMP induced the highest BMP activity. Repeated injection of the AC solution with BMP did not incite a significant decrease of BMP activity which suggested an immunological response inhibiting osteoinduction. The 3 -consecutive-day subperiosteal injection over the rat cranium elicited significantly higher and wider deposits of bone formation than the 3 -consecutive-week one after 8 weeks. Moreover, in the 3 -consecutive-day injection, each injected implant unified as a mass. On the other hand, in the 3 -consecutive-week injection, each induced bone deposit was individually encapsulated by fibrous connective tissues without unification. The repeated injection method of the AC solution with BMP resulted in extensive bone induction easily and reproducibly, in the consecutive-day injection. The results obtained suggest a possibility of c 1 inical applications of the repeated injection method of the AC solution with BMP not only for bone augmentation but also for all osseous reconstructions, considering the interval，f requency, and location of injection...|$|E
40|$|Argon plasma {{treatment}} {{was used to}} modify the surface of <b>atelocollagen</b> films using a plasmochemical reactor. To evaluate {{the effects of the}} treatment, the untreated and treated samples were characterized by Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. Cell growth was carried out by culturing human immortalized keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells and proliferation was measured via MTT assay. It was observed that argon {{plasma treatment}} significantly enhanced the extent of cell proliferation, which was ascribed to the favourable role of plasma treatment in inducing surface oxygen-containing entities together with increasing surface roughness. This can be considered as a potentially promising approach for tissue regeneration purposes...|$|E
40|$|Collagen {{thin films}} were {{prepared}} via bovine <b>atelocollagen</b> matrices. The film casting {{was carried out}} by using different culture dishes, concentrations, equipment, drying processes and periods of time. In order to optimise the repeatability and reproducibility, microscopic analyses were utilised to explore the film quality and topographical patterning. In addition, the human immortalised non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) was seeded onto the obtained specimens, and the cell proliferation was determined by using the MTT assay. These results indicated how the substrate, its concentration and processing conditions influence the cellular response. The attempted technique shows itself to be an excellent procedure for continuous collagen film preparation with optimal cell-proliferation rates, which may potentially be used in tissue engineering or wound-healing applications...|$|E
40|$|Silencing gene {{expression}} by siRNAs is rapidly becoming {{a powerful tool}} for the genetic analysis of mammalian cells. However, the rapid degradation of siRNA and the limited duration of its action call for an efficient delivery technology. Accordingly, we describe here that <b>Atelocollagen</b> complexed with siRNA is resistant to nucleases and is efficiently transduced into cells, thereby allowing long-term gene silencing. Site-specific in vivo administration of an anti-luciferase siRNA/Atelocollagen complex reduced luciferase expression in a xenografted tumor. Furthermore, Atelocollagen-mediated transfer of siRNA in vivo showed efficient inhibition of tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft model of a human non-seminomatous germ cell tumor. Thus, for clinical applications of siRNA, an Atelocollagen-based non-viral delivery method could be a reliable approach to achieve maximal function of siRNA in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the application of salmon <b>atelocollagen</b> (SAC) to a scaffold. SAC has a low denaturation temperature and needs to be cross-linked before being used as a scaffold. In the present study, SAC was cross-linked by 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) or dehydrothermal treatment (DHT). The material properties (degree of cross-linking and solubility in phosphate-buffered saline) of the SAC scaffolds cross-linked by EDC (EDC-SAC) and DHT (DHT-SAC) were evaluated. It was found that EDC-SAC had a high degree of cross-linking and high stability compared with DHT-SAC. Human periodontal ligament (HPDL) cells were cultured in the scaffolds for 2 weeks in vitro, and the activities (proliferation rate and alkaline phosphatase [ALP] activity) of HPDL cells cultured in EDC-SAC and DHT-SAC were compared with those cultured in bovine <b>atelocollagen</b> (BAC) scaffolds cross-linked by EDC (EDC-BAC) and DHT (DHT-BAC), respectively. The proliferation rate of HPDL cells cultured in EDC-SAC was equivalent to that in EDC-BAC, and the ALP activity in EDC-SAC was found to be significantly higher than that in EDC-BAC. In the cross-linking by DHT, the cell proliferation rate and the ALP activity in DHT-SAC were lower than those in DHT-BAC. DHT seemed to provide insufficient cross-linking, and DHT-SAC was found to be breakable and contractile, resulting in less cell activity. In contrast, there was no difference in the thermal stability, porous structure, and cell proliferation rate between EDC-SAC and EDC-BAC. In addition, the collagen helix of EDC-SAC was found to be partially denatured, and this structure resulted in the enhancement of ALP activity of HPDL cells compared with that using EDC-BAC. In conclusion, our results indicate that EDC-SAC could be used as a scaffold for in vitro culture...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveIntimal {{hyperplasia}} is a {{major obstacle}} to patency after vein grafting. Despite of a diverse array of trials to prevent it, a satisfactory therapeutic strategy for clinical use has not been established. However, sufficient inhibition of early stages of intimal hyperplasia may prevent this long-term progressive disease. Midkine (MK) is a heparin-binding growth factor that was originally discovered {{as the product of}} a retinoic acid-responsive gene. We previously demonstrated that MK-deficient mice exhibit a striking reduction of neointima formation in a restenosis model, which is reversed on systemic MK administration. In this study, we evaluated a strategy of using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MK as a therapy for vein graft failure. MethodsWe first made a highly effective siRNA to rabbit MK. Jugular vein-to-carotid artery interposition vein grafts, which are applied to a low flow condition, were made in Japanese white rabbits. Small interfering RNA mixed with <b>atelocollagen</b> was administrated to the external wall of grafted veins. Cy 3 -conjugated stabilized siRNA was used to confirm its stability and successful transfer into the vein graft wall. Neointimal hyperplasia was evaluated 4 weeks after the operation. The proliferation index and leukocyte infiltration were determined. ResultsMK expression was induced and reached the maximum level 7 days after operation. Fluorescence of Cy 3 -labeled siRNA could be detected in the graft wall even 7 days after operation. Knockdown of the gradually increasing expression was achieved by perivascular application of siRNA using <b>atelocollagen.</b> The intima-media ratio and the intima thickness at 28 days after grafting were both reduced > 90 % by this treatment compared with controls. This phenomenon was preceded by significant reductions of inflammatory cell recruitment to the vessel walls and subsequent cell proliferation in MK siRNA-treated grafts. ConclusionsThese results suggest that midkine is a candidate molecular target for preventing vein graft failure. Furthermore, for clinical applications of siRNA, a single intraoperative atelocollagen-based nonviral delivery method could be a reliable approach to achieve maximal function of siRNA in vivo. This strategy may be a useful and practical form of gene therapy against human vein graft failure. Clinical RelevanceIntimal hyperplasia {{is a major}} obstacle to patency after vein grafting. Despite a diverse array of trials to prevent it, a satisfactory therapeutic strategy for clinical use has not been established. However, sufficient inhibition of early stages of intimal hyperplasia may prevent this long-term progressive disease. Here, we report almost complete suppression of intimal hyperplasia. Knockdown of growth factor midkine expression was achieved by the perivascular application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) using <b>atelocollagen.</b> Our data indicate that the combination of siRNA and its controlled release could be a therapeutic strategy for vein graft failure and that midkine is a potent molecular target for the prevention of intimal hyperplasia...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Collagen {{membranes}} {{are used}} extensively as bioabsorbable barriers in guided bone regeneration. However, collagen has different effects on tissue restoration {{depending on the}} type, structure, degree of cross-linking and chemical treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the inflammatory reaction, bone formation, and degradation of dehydrothermal treated porcine type I <b>atelocollagen</b> (CollaGuideⓇ) compared to of the non-crosslinked porcine type I, III collagen (BioGideⓇ) and the glutaldehyde cross-linked bovine type I collagen (BioMendⓇ) in surgically created bone defects in rat mandible. Methods: Bone defect model was based upon 3 mm sized full-thickness transcortical bone defects in the mandibular ramus of Sprague-Dawley rats. The defects were covered bucolingually with CollaGuideⓇ, BioMendⓇ, or BioGide Ⓡ (n= 12). For control, the defects were not covered by any membrane.

40|$|Dissolution and {{gelation}} {{procedures have}} a great influence on gelation time, microstructure and mechanical properties of reconstituted collagen products. We have investigated the dissolution of <b>atelocollagen</b> in CO 2 /water solutions at low temperature (4 °C) at different CO 2 pressures (0. 3 – 0. 9 MPa), as well as gelation kinetics and physico-chemical properties of the hydrogel obtained after CO 2 removal. Compared to conventional methods, the CO 2 -assisted technique resulted in faster soluble collagen dissolution and faster gelation into transparent gels characterized by thin 10 nm fibrils. Electrophoresis and CD spectroscopy demonstrated that the process did not denature the soluble collagen. The possibility to obtain collagen dissolution and gelation {{without the use of}} chemical agent other than water and CO 2 makes this process particularly appealing for biomedical applications...|$|E
40|$|Collagen films (<b>Atelocollagen</b> from bovine Achilles tendon) were {{prepared}} in tissue culture dishes and their surfaces were modified by using air and nitrogen plasma treatment. The treated samples were characterised by surface probe techniques including attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), {{scanning electron microscopy}} imaging (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, human immortalised nontumorigenic keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) was seeded on the treated and untreated films and cell proliferation was measured by using MTT assay test. The characterisation results confirmed physical and chemical changes on the collagen surface, such as increase in the extent of surface oxidation and surface roughness as well as, the treated samples showed better cell growth than untreated ones, and therefore this approach may {{be taken into account}} in the development of promising materials for tissue regeneration applications.
