A 2010 study by the Food and Agriculture Organisation ranks India amongst the 10 countries with the largest forest <b>area</b> <b>coverage</b> in the world (the other nine being Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan).

25|$|The Orfordness Rotating Wireless Beacon, known {{simply as}} the Orfordness Beacon or {{sometimes}} the Black Beacon, was an early radio navigation system introduced by the United Kingdom in July 1929. It allowed the angle to the station to be measured from any aircraft or ship with a conventional radio receiver, and was accurate to about a degree. A second station operating on the same principle {{was set up to}} provide wider <b>area</b> <b>coverage</b> and allow two-bearing fixes between Orford Ness and Farnborough Airport. The system was similar to the earlier German Telefunken Kompass Sender and the later Sonne system.|$|E

50|$|The total {{coverage}} by impervious surfaces in an area, {{such as a}} municipality or a watershed is usually expressed {{as a percentage of}} the total land <b>area.</b> The <b>coverage</b> increases with rising urbanization. In rural areas, impervious cover may only be one or two percent. In residential <b>areas,</b> <b>coverage</b> increases from about 10 percent in low-density subdivisions to over 50 percent in multi-family communities. In industrial and commercial <b>areas,</b> <b>coverage</b> rises above 70 percent. In regional shopping centers and dense urban areas, it is over 90 percent. In the contiguous 48 states of the USA, urban impervious cover adds up to 43,000 square miles (110,000 km²) — an area nearly the size of the State of Ohio. Continuing development adds another quarter of a million acres (1,000 km²) each year. Typically two-thirds of the cover is pavements and one-third is building roofs.|$|R

40|$|Deploying Femtocells {{inside a}} {{macrocell}} network can significantly increase the macrocell capacity {{in terms of}} network optimisation. However, the deployment of femtocells within a macrocell <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> causes severe femto-femto interferences, which may {{have an impact on}} the overall performance of femtocells. Avoiding such interference is very important for co-existence of femtocells. In this paper, we propose a novel femtocell resource allocation scheme to alleviate the problem of Co-tier interference. In the proposed scheme orthogonal resources are allocated to the closed access femtocells to avoid interference to other femtocells, while we divide the open access femtocell <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> into two <b>coverage</b> <b>area,</b> an inner and an outer <b>coverage</b> <b>area.</b> The resources are allocated to both <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> of the open access femtocells in a way that avoids co-tier interference while increasing the spectrum efficiency...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{commercial}} location based services have appeared during recent years. Location awareness {{is becoming more}} important also in environments where satellite-based positioning are not available, such as urban areas and indoors. In this work, a method to estimate the <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> of a wireless communication node is presented. Also a method to use a database of such <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> estimates for personal positioning is presented. <b>Coverage</b> <b>area</b> estimates are computed using location fingerprinting. The <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> is solved by forming the posterior distribution of the parameters using Bayes' rule. The <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> of a communication node is modeled as an ellipse and is assumed to follow a multivariate normal linear model, which {{is presented as a}} general case. The <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> estimate is derived using both noninformative and informative priors. Also a model which assumes a possibility of outliers and a Bayesian method for detecting outliers are presented. A positioning method which uses the <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> estimates is presented. The distribution of a position estimate is derived using Bayes' rule. The position estimate is weighted average of the centers of ellipses and the weights are determined by the shape parameters of ellipses. Finally, the accuracy and consistency of a position estimate are studied using different coverage estimates.
