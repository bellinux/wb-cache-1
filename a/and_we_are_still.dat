2500|$|The {{government}} {{is accused of}} having ignored warnings about fire safety in tower blocks. A former chief fire officer and secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety, Ronnie King, said ministers stonewalled requests for meetings and efforts to tighten rules. He said that the then–housing minister Gavin Barwell, refused requests for meetings. King said: “We have had replies, but the replies were {{to the effect that}} you have met my predecessor [...] and {{there were a number of}} matters that we are looking at <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> looking at it. (...) They always seem to need a significant loss of life before things are changed.” After six people were killed in the 2009 Lakanal House fire, the coroner made a series of safety recommendations for the government to consider, and the Department for Communities and Local Government agreed to hold a review in 2013. In March 2014, the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group sent a letter to then–Minister for Communities Stephen Williams, which said in part: [...] After further correspondence, Williams replied: [...] Jeremy Corbyn has called for sprinklers to be retrofitted in all high-rise social housing.|$|E
