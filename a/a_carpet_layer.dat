40|$|In {{this study}} {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during carpet installations employing water-based adhesives were characterized. The potential impacts of 4 adhesives on indoor air quality were evaluated. Headspace sampling and analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry were used to qualitate VOC emissions. Adhesives and carpet/adhesive composite samples were prepared for quantitative analysis of VOC emissions by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. Volatiles were concentrated using a monitoring device and collected on charcoal adsorption tubes. Sampling intervals ranged from 30 minutes to 21 days. The adhesives emitted primarily aromatic, alicyclic and aliphatic compounds as toluene, m-xylene, 1, 2 -dimethylcyclohexane, alpha-pinene, 2 -methylheptane, octane, nonane, decane and undecane. Emission profiles depended on performance characteristics and manufacturer. <b>A</b> <b>carpet</b> boundary <b>layer</b> slowed VOC decay by acting as a sink. Potential overexposure within 24 hours to specific and total VOCs was indicated {{for one of the}} adhesives. This study suggests that water-based <b>carpet</b> adhesives are <b>a</b> potential source of indoor air pollutants...|$|R
40|$|<b>Carpet</b> <b>layers</b> and age-matched {{controls}} were investigated {{both at the}} beginning of a working day and at the end with four subtests of a neuropsychological test battery (NES 2). Exposure to toluene, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, and heptane was measured with personal air sampling methods. One group of <b>carpet</b> <b>layers</b> used water-based adhesives (WBA) on the day the investigation took place and the other group used contact adhesives (CA) on that day. The WBA group was exposed primarily to toluene, and the CA group was exposed to other solvents as well. Initial (before work) differences in neuropsychological scores between all exposed workers and controls could be attributed to differences in education, the <b>carpet</b> <b>layers</b> being somewhat higher educated. No differences were found between the solvent-exposed and control groups that would suggest persistent effects of chronic solvent exposures. The improvement in test scores over the day was the same in both groups. However, evidence for exposure-related changes in test scores over the day were found within the exposed group...|$|R

40|$|<b>Carpet</b> <b>layers</b> {{comprise}} {{less than}} 0. 06 % of the United States workforce yet they submit 6. 2 % of compensation claims for traumatic knee inflammation. Their work involves multiple sources of acute and chronic knee trauma including kneeling, pressure from sharp objects, {{and use of}} a device called a "knee kicker" to stretch wall to wall carpet. To characterise the knee morbidity in <b>carpet</b> <b>layers</b> and to identify occupational risk factors, a questionnaire was completed by 112 <b>carpet</b> and floor <b>layers,</b> 42 tile and terrazo setters, and 243 millwrights and bricklayers (MWBL). The MWBL comparison workers seldom kneel and do not use a knee kicker. Physical and xray examinations were conducted on a subset of 108 respondents to validate the questionnaire responses. Compared with the MWBL, <b>carpet</b> <b>layers</b> reported more frequent bursitis (20 % v 6 %), needle aspiration of knee fluid (32 % v 6 %), and skin infections of the knee (7 % v 2 %). A score indicating frequency of using the knee kicker was the only statistically significant predictor of bursitis, whereas the score for kneeling {{was one of several}} predictors of knee aspiration and skin infections of the knee. These data suggest that <b>carpet</b> and floor <b>layers</b> experience substantially more knee morbidity than other occupational groups, and that kneeling and use of the knee kicker are risk factors providing opportunities for prevention...|$|R
40|$|Cationic {{amphiphilic}} diblock copolymers were synthesized by RAFT polymerization and the nanostructure {{of their}} monolayers was investigated by π-A isotherm and X-ray reflectivity. <b>Carpet</b> <b>layer</b> (dense hydrophilic block layer) formation under the hydrophobic layer was confirmed and a “brush” layer was found beneath the <b>carpet</b> <b>layer.</b> However, {{the thickness of}} brush layer was much thinner {{than that of the}} fully-stretched chain length. The critical salt concentration was found to be 0. 01 M NaCl, which is much lower than that of the previous strongly anionic brush. These differences were probably caused by the low effective charge on the brush chains due to the hydrophobic nature of the quarternized ammonium cation...|$|R
50|$|Prepatellar bursitis, {{also known}} as housemaid's knee, is a common cause of {{swelling}} and pain above the patella (kneecap), and is due to inflammation of the prepatellar bursa. It is common in people who frequently kneel, such as roofers, plumbers, <b>carpet</b> <b>layers,</b> and gardeners. It is also common in wrestlers due to the repeated impact on the knee when shooting.|$|R

He also appeared as one of Ken Barlow's university lodgers Milo, in a very early episode of Coronation Street, later returned to play [...] "Harold" [...] <b>a</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>layer</b> who put in some carpets for Hilda Ogden, and Jimmy Kemp's father in the acclaimed nuclear war drama Threads.

Drew won an athletics scholarship to Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he graduated in 1926. An outstanding athlete at Amherst, Drew also joined Omega Psi Phi fraternity. [...] He attended medical school at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, receiving his MDCM in 1933, and ranked 2nd in his class of 127 students.

50|$|After {{graduating from}} a Catholic {{high school in}} Memphis, Dorsey tried his hand as a {{professional}} boxer becoming a Southern pro champ before working {{at a number of}} daytime jobs, which included a cotton picker, an oiler on a Mississippi riverboat, a fisherman, <b>a</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>layer.</b> He was finally to work at the Crown Electric Company with Paul Burlison as an apprentice electrician and would spend six years studying for an electrician's license. Johnny Burnette also worked as a deck hand on barges, which traversed the Mississippi River and though they worked separately, each of them would bring his guitar on board and write songs during his spare time. After work, they would perform those and other songs together at local bars with a varying array of sidemen. Paul Burlison joined them after his discharge from the US Armed Forces and in 1952 or 1953 they formed a group, which may have been called The Rhythm Rangers at the time. Johnny Burnette sang the vocals and played acoustic guitar, Dorsey played bass and Paul Burlison played lead guitar.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>carpet</b> plot is {{any of a}} few {{different}} {{specific types}} of plot. The more common plot referred to as <b>a</b> <b>carpet</b> plot is one that illustrates the interaction between two or more independent variables and one or more dependent variables in a two-dimensional plot. Besides the ability to incorporate more variables, another feature that distinguishes <b>a</b> <b>carpet</b> plot from <b>an</b> equivalent contour plot or 3D surface plot is that <b>a</b> <b>carpet</b> plot {{can be used to}} more accurately interpolate data points. <b>A</b> conventional <b>carpet</b> plot can capture the interaction of up to three independent variables and three dependent variables and still be easily read and interpolated.|$|R

40|$|Polyol/nanosilica organic–inorganic hybrids (Si/Lpol) were {{prepared}} through facile sol–gel chemistry. Tetraethoxyorthosilane (TEOS) and linseed polyol (Lpol) obtained by hydroxylation of linseed oil {{were used as}} inorganic and organic precursors, respectively. Si/Lpol was further treated with toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI) to obtain silica embedded polyurethane (Si/LPU). The structure of the organic–inorganic hybrid was confirmed by FTIR, 1 H NMR, and 13 C NMR spectral analysis. The polyol/nanosilica network shows strong interaction with the remnant polyol backbone through hydrogen bonding, which also has bearing on Tg of polymers. Morphological studies of Si/LPU show the formation of uniform, spherical silica nanoparticles of 2 – 30 [*]nm size embedded in the polymer matrix. Si/LPU was further reinforced with 2 and 5 [*]wt. -% fumed silica (FS-Si/LPUs); their morphology revealed <b>a</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>layer</b> formation on top of Si/LPU. Thermogravimetric analysis showed improved thermal stability of Si/LPU and FS-Si/LPUs. The polymers exhibit mild to moderate antibacterial behavior against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively, and will pave way in plethora of biological and chemical applications as coating materials...|$|E
