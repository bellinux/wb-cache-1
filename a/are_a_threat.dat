5|$|Raëlians {{say they}} {{encourage}} adult homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual relationships and that society should recognize them legally. Some Swiss government authorities responded to Raëlians' views about Sensual Meditation with {{a fear that}} Raëlians <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to public morals for supporting liberalized sex education for children. They express the view that such liberalized sex education teaches youngsters how to obtain sexual gratification which would encourage sexual abuse of underage children.|$|E
5|$|The {{species in}} all {{probability}} {{has little or no}} direct impact or influence on human interests and concerns but agricultural and real estate development <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the species' very narrow habitat. Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by the millions of ants which eat the bait in the trap the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear or wind {{gradients}} <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to parachutists, {{particularly to}} BASE jumping and wingsuit flying. Skydivers {{have been pushed}} off of their course by sudden shifts in wind direction and speed, and have collided with bridges, cliffsides, trees, other skydivers, the ground, and other obstacles. Skydivers routinely make adjustments {{to the position of}} their open canopies to compensate for changes in direction while making landings to prevent accidents such as canopy collisions and canopy inversion.|$|E
50|$|Threats to {{this species}} include {{poaching}} for the horticultural trade; however, most plants {{are located on}} inaccessible terrain. Widening of highways may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b> Sand and sandstone mining may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sedimentation of streams {{because of}} mining <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{localized}} <b>threat.</b> The species is also collected for food, {{although it is}} not known whether this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> at present.|$|R

5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is {{concerned}} that the increasing numbers of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. It is discovered that they are entering ship systems, interfering with their functions, and consuming any edible contents present. Kirk realizes that if the tribbles are getting into the ship's stores, they <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the grain aboard the station. He examines the holds but learns that it is already too late: The tribbles have indeed eaten the quadrotriticale, and Kirk is literally buried in grain-gorged tribbles when he opens a grain hold with an overhead hatch. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy discover that about half the tribbles in the hold are dead {{and many of the}} rest are dying, alerting them that the grain has been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{was once}} common across the Sydney region, and particularly abundant between the localities of Parramatta and Penrith. It dramatically declined in numbers between 1875 and 1895, although rare sightings in western Sydney and the Blue Mountains {{were recorded in}} the mid-twentieth century. The turquoise parrot was trapped for the aviary trade and used as pie-filling. Almost all of its preferred habitat, the Cumberland Plain, across western Sydney, had disappeared with development. Over half the woodland in New South Wales, and 80% across Australia has been cleared, and the remaining habitat is fragmented. A key issue is removal of mature eucalypts with resulting loss of hollows available for nesting. The species is thus listed as a Vulnerable species under Schedule 2 of the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 because of habitat destruction (TSC Act). Fire-burning regimes may be resulting in the regeneration favouring shrubs rather than grasses, which are the preferred food source for the species. Feral cats and foxes <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat,</b> particularly to nesting birds and young.|$|E

Despite threats and limited available habitat, the species appears to be stable.|$|R
25|$|Man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS or MPADS) are shoulder-launched surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SLSAMs). They are typically guided weapons and <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to low-flying aircraft, especially helicopters.|$|E

25|$|The {{species is}} {{often found in}} heavily grazed lower edges of the cloud forest where grazing, {{deforestation}} and fires <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to local populations.

25|$|Wildfires <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to {{flora and}} fauna within the park, and require fire {{protection}} and management, especially for areas such as core koala-breeding habitat. Threats of arson have also been made, both outside and within the park. Arson and accidental fires from bushwalkers have been {{the main reason for}} bushfires within the park.|$|E

Generally MANPATS fall into three distinct categories. The first {{consist of a}} small, disposable preloaded launch tube firing a high explosive anti-tank warhead operated by a single soldier. The second is a firing system onto /into which a rocket is loaded, operated by a single soldier. The third are manufactured prepacked and issued as a single unit of ammunition with the launcher discarded after a single use.|$|E

25|$|In total, {{there are}} seven species of {{introduced}} mammals and four introduced bird species within the park. Foxes and feral dogs <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to koalas, and Feral cats and foxes are a real danger to many threatened species within the Upland Swamp region. Bats are especially vulnerable to feral cat predators. Feral cats, foxes and mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) have been listed as creating key threatening processes (predation, competition and vegetation alteration) under the Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 (NSW). Chytrid fungus infecting frogs and feral deer causing environmental degradation (such as trampling and accelerating erosion), are also considered to cause threatening processes.|$|E
25|$|The hillsides {{have largely}} been cleared of {{woodland}} for fruit growing and other agriculture and the urban growth of Adelaide particularly on the lower slopes, leading to loss of habitat and local extinction of wildlife species including all species of bettong and quoll marsupials and birds including regent honeyeater (Xanthomyza phrygia), swift parrot (Lathamus discolor), king quail (Coturnix chinensis), brown quail (C. ypsilophora), and azure kingfisher (Alcedo azurea). Clearance and agriculture are ongoing and livestock grazing continues to cause damage to habitats while introduced cats, foxes and rabbits <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to habitats and wildlife. Protected areas tend to be small and fragmented. Kangaroo Island has been less affected and also does not have rabbits or foxes, although koalas have been introduced from the Australian mainland and are causing damage to habitats.|$|E
25|$|At the low altitudes {{at which}} the ISS orbits, there is a variety of space debris, {{consisting}} of different objects including entire spent rocket stages, defunct satellites, explosion fragments—including materials from anti-satellite weapon tests, paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, and coolant released by US-A nuclear-powered satellites. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, are a significant threat. Large objects could destroy the station, but are less of a threat because their orbits can be predicted. Objects {{too small to be}} detected by optical and radar instruments, from approximately 1cm down to microscopic size, number in the trillions. Despite their small size, some of these objects <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> because of their kinetic energy and direction in relation to the station.
