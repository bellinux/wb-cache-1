25|$|Science and {{religion}} {{are based on}} different <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> experience. In science, explanations {{must be based on}} evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science {{and religion}} are separate and address <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.|$|E
