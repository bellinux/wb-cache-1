5|$|Seamounts {{can form}} {{in a wide}} variety of tectonic settings, {{resulting}} in a very diverse structural bank. Seamounts come {{in a wide variety}} of structural shapes, from conical to flat-topped to complexly shaped. Some <b>are</b> <b>built</b> very large and very low, such as Koko Guyot and Detroit Seamount; others <b>are</b> <b>built</b> more steeply, such as Loihi Seamount and Bowie Seamount. Some seamounts also have a carbonate or sediment cap.|$|E

5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes <b>are</b> <b>built</b> {{almost entirely}} of fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They <b>are</b> <b>built</b> up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the Boston {{architectural}} firm Cram, Goodhue, and Ferguson {{was awarded a}} major construction contract that set the predominantly neogothic architectural style still seen today. Most of the buildings of the central cadet area are in this style, as typified by the Cadet Chapel, completed in 1910. These buildings are nearly all constructed from granite that has a predominantly gray and black hue. The barracks that {{were built in the}} 1960s were designed to mimic this style. Other buildings on post, notably the oldest private residences for the faculty, <b>are</b> <b>built</b> in the Federal, Georgian, or English Tudor styles. A few buildings, such as Cullum Hall and the Old Cadet Chapel, <b>are</b> <b>built</b> in the Neoclassical style.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants can {{generally}} {{be built in}} a few years because solar plants <b>are</b> <b>built</b> almost entirely with modular, readily available materials.

5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They <b>are</b> <b>built</b> in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|All {{the ships}} of this class <b>are</b> <b>built</b> using DMR 249A special grade high-tensile steel, {{produced}} by the state-owned Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), and carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials.
