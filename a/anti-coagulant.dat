25|$|During {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} conflict, the Rhodesian {{government}} resorted to biological warfare. Watercourses at several sites close to the Mozambique border were deliberately contaminated with cholera and the toxin Sodium Coumadin, an <b>anti-coagulant</b> commonly used as the active ingredient in rat poison. Food stocks in the area were contaminated with anthrax spores. These biological attacks had little impact on the fighting capability of ZANLA, but caused considerable distress to the local population. Over 10,000 people contracted anthrax in the period 1978 to 1980, of whom 200 died. The facts about this episode became known during the hearings of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission during the late 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|Thrombosis {{prophylaxis}} {{is often}} prescribed for hospitalized patients routinely {{by a number}} of means. Anticoagulants are often prescribed. Pre-operatively some patients receive low-molecular-weight heparin once a day. Additional risk factors such as obesity, disease, malignancies, long surgeries, and immobility may influence the prescribed dosage. Anticoagulant medications prevent the formation of blood clots in people who are at high risk for their development. Treating blood clots that have already formed is managed by the use of anti-hemolytic ("clot busters"). The list below describes some of the more common medications used to prevent blood clots. Note that generally that since blood clotting is inhibited, a side effect typically is bleeding, though it can be reversed by administering a medication that stops the bleeding or by discontinuation of the medication itself. <b>Anti-coagulant</b> administration is often given {{before the start of the}} operation. There are concerns with the potential of increased risk of bleeding and so many surgeons start giving anti-coagulants the first 6 hours after surgery.Medications that inhibit blood clot formation include: ...|$|E
2500|$|A port (often {{referred}} to by brand names such as Port-a-Cath or MediPort) is a central venous line {{that does not have}} an external connector; instead, it has a small reservoir that is covered with silicone rubber and is implanted under the skin. Medication is administered intermittently by placing a small needle through the skin, piercing the silicone, into the reservoir. [...] When the needle is withdrawn the reservoir cover reseals itself. [...] The cover can accept hundreds of needle sticks during its lifetime. [...] It is possible to leave the ports in the patient's body for years; if this is done however, the port must be accessed monthly and flushed with an <b>anti-coagulant,</b> or the patient risks it getting plugged up. [...] If it is plugged it becomes a hazard as a thrombus will eventually form with an accompanying risk of embolisation. [...] Removal of a port is usually a simple outpatient procedure; however, installation is more complex and a good implant is fairly dependent on the skill of the radiologist. Ports cause less inconvenience and have a lower risk of infection than PICCs, and are therefore commonly used for patients on long-term intermittent treatment.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Different {{immunoglobulin}} {{manufacturing processes}} may influence its effectiveness for Kawasaki disease. However, nationwide studies with longitudinal follow-up are still lacking. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of immunoglobulin preparations from a nationwide perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a nationwide retrospective cohort study with a new user design. Data came from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. From 1997 to 2008, children under 2 years old who received immunoglobulin therapy for the first time under the main diagnosis of Kawasaki disease were enrolled. The manufacturing processes were divided into β-propiolactonation, acidification and those containing IgA. The endpoints were immunoglobulin non-responsiveness, acute aneurysm, prolonged use of anti-platelets or <b>anti-coagulants,</b> and recurrence. RESULTS: In total, 3830 children were enrolled. β-propiolactonation had a relative risk of 1. 45 (95 % CI 1. 08 ~ 1. 94) of immunoglobulin non-responsiveness, however, the relative risks for acidification and containing IgA were non-significant. For acute aneurysms, acidification had a relative risk of 1. 49 (95 % CI 1. 17 ~ 1. 90), however the relative risks for β-propiolactonation and containing IgA were non-significant. For prolonged use of anti-platelets or <b>anti-coagulants,</b> β-propiolactonation had a relative risk of 1. 44 (95 % CI 1. 18 ~ 1. 76), and acidification protected against them both with a relative risk of 0. 82 (95 % CI 0. 69 ~ 0. 97), whereas the relative risk for containing IgA was non-significant. For recurrence, all three factors were non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of immunoglobulin may differ among different manufacturing processes. β-propiolactonation had a higher risk of treatment failure and prolonged use of anti-platelets or <b>anti-coagulants.</b> Acidification may increase the risk of acute coronary aneurysms...|$|R

We intend this case to graphically illustrate the theoretical considerations that must govern the perioperative use of these drugs in high-risk patients. </p...|$|R
