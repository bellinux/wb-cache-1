5|$|Rich {{families}} from Rome usually {{had two or}} more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) {{and at least one}} luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum), {{but it was not a}} place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity. It was also a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.|$|E
5|$|Scattered evidence, {{including}} the records in Irish annals <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> of warriors like those depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll in Easter Ross, {{suggest that in}} Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, society was dominated by a military aristocracy, whose status was dependent in a large part on their ability and willingness to fight. Below {{the level of the}} aristocracy it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, working their own small farms or holding lands as free tenants. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had the right to bear arms, represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the temple}} is a Shaiva shrine, it {{contains}} {{the images of}} numerous Shakta deities as Parsvadevatas sculpted on its walls. The temple is the first among Bhubaneswar temples to contain Saptamatrika images, a group of seven goddesses. These images are located in between representations of Ganesha and Virabhadra. Except for Ganesha, all other images are depicted with their respective vahanas (vehicles). An eight-armed dancing Ardhanarishvara, an image of Siva-Parvati <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> of Ganga and Yamuna are also found {{on the wall of}} the temple. There are also images of Vishnu, Indra, Surya and Yama in the rectangular niches around the base of the porch. A sculpture of Kartikeya riding on his peacock vehicle is present on the southern wall. Other noteworthy carvings are those of Shiva subduing the demon-king Ravana, who is seen trying to uproot Mount Kailasa, the abode of Shiva. Shiva is sculpted as Nataraja in various tandavas (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Orissa temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs. A floral motif trailing from the tail of a bird is common between this temple and the ones in Vaital Deula, while a motif of vase and flowers is common between it and the ones in Mukteshvara Temple.|$|E

25|$|The Middle Ages {{brought a}} harsh {{interpretation}} of dreams. They {{were seen as}} evil, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> as temptations from the devil. Many believed that during sleep, the devil could fill the human mind with corrupting and harmful thoughts. Martin Luther, founder of Protestantism, believed dreams were {{the work of the}} Devil. However, Catholics such as St. Augustine and St. Jerome claimed that the direction of their lives was heavily influenced by their dreams.|$|E
25|$|Places or {{backgrounds}} hence require, and reciprocally impose, order (often {{deriving from}} the spatial {{characteristics of the}} physical location memorized, in cases where an actual physical structure {{provided the basis for}} the 'places'). This order itself organizes the images, preventing confusion during recall. The anonymous author also advises that places should be well lit, with orderly intervals, and distinct from one another. He recommends a virtual 'viewing distance' sufficient to allow the viewer to encompass the space <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> it contains with a single glance.|$|E

25|$|On January 1, 1932, {{in celebration}} of George Washington's 200th anniversary of birth, the U.S. Post Office {{released}} its Washington Bicentennial Issue, a series of twelve postage stamps each with a different portrait of Washington.

25|$|The Battle of Länkipohja was a Finnish Civil War battle {{fought in}} the village of Länkipohja (now part of the Jämsä municipality) in 16 March 1918 between the Whites and the Reds. Together with the battles fought in Kuru, Ruovesi and Vilppula between 15 and 18 March, the Battle of Länkipohja was one the first {{military}} operations related to the Battle of Tampere, which was the decisive battle of the Finnish Civil War. The battle is known of its bloody aftermath as the Whites executed 70–100 capitulated Reds.

25|$|Representations {{of sexual}} acts are widely found in Roman art, {{although}} surviving male-female scenes greatly outnumber same-sex couples. It cannot {{be assumed that}} homoerotic art was uncommon as the modern record may be biased due to selective destruction or non-publication of pederastic works in later times. Illustrated drinking cups, often in pairs, were intended as dinner-party conversation pieces. Roman artwork on pottery, glass and wall-paintings with sexual acts represented were popular and were intended {{to be seen by}} all sections of society. The Romans had no word for homosexuality <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> on the Warren Cup provide an important insight into this aspect of their culture.|$|E

By this stage there were {{thousands}} of people watching the situation develop from the banks of the river, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> were seen across the world. The excitement of the previous day had disappeared, and there was now serious concern that the whale would be unable to survive for much longer. As the barge rushed along the Thames towards the sea, news channels provided non-stop coverage of the journey. It reached the Thames Barrier at approximately 5:00 pm. Later, despite the darkness, it was reported that crowds were lining the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge {{to catch a glimpse of}} the barge.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Orthodox {{tradition}} {{holds that}} the creation of Christian images dates back to the very early days of Christianity, and there it has been a continuous tradition since then. Modern academic art history considers that, while images may have existed earlier, the tradition can only {{be traced back to the}} 3rd century, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> that survive from Early Christian art were often very different from later ones. The icons of later centuries can be linked, often closely, to images from the 5th century onwards, though very few of these survive. There was enormous destruction of images during the Byzantine Iconoclasm of 726-842, although this did settle for good the question of the appropriateness of images. Since then icons have had a great continuity of style and subject; far greater than in the images of the Western church. At the same time there has been change and development.|$|E
