25|$|In {{television}} sets and computer monitors, the entire front {{area of the}} tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster. An image is produced by controlling the intensity {{of each of the}} three electron beams, one for each <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>color</b> (red, green, and blue) with a video signal as a reference. In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by magnetic deflection, a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of electronic test instrument.|$|E

25|$|The RGB color {{model is}} an {{additive}} color {{model in which}} red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce {{a broad array of}} colors.

50|$|Further, H and h are not identical, because HSL space uses as <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> {{the three}} <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> red, green, blue (H = 0, 120, 240°). Instead, the LCh system uses the four {{physiological}} elementary colors yellow, green, {{blue and red}} (h = 90, 180, 270, 360°). Regardless the angle h, C = 0 means the achromatic colors, that is, the gray axis.|$|R
50|$|However, when {{complementary}} {{colors are}} chosen based on definition by light mixture, {{they are not}} the same as the artists' <b>primary</b> <b>colors.</b> This discrepancy becomes important when color theory is applied across media. Digital color management uses a hue circle defined according to <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> (the RGB color model), as the colors in a computer monitor are additive mixtures of light, not subtractive mixtures of paints.|$|R

The subtractive system using primaries that are the secondaries of the additive system can be viewed as an alternative approach to reproducing a wide range of colors by controlling the relative amounts of red, green, and blue light that reach the eye.|$|R
50|$|Colors can {{be created}} on {{computer}} monitors with color spaces based on the RGB color model, using the <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> (red, green, and blue). A three-dimensional representation would assign {{each of the three}} colors to the X, Y, and Z axes.

50|$|Without halftoning, {{the three}} <b>primary</b> process <b>colors</b> could be printed only as solid blocks of color, and {{therefore}} could produce only seven colors: the three primaries themselves, plus three secondary colors produced by layering {{two of the}} primaries: cyan and yellow produce green, cyan and magenta produce blue, yellow and magenta produce red (these subtractive secondary colors correspond roughly to the <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors),</b> plus layering {{all three of them}} resulting in black. With halftoning, a full continuous range of colors can be produced.|$|R
25|$|Monopack color {{films are}} based on the {{subtractive}} color system, which filters colors from white light by using superimposed cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A subtractive <b>primary</b> <b>color</b> (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the <b>additive</b> <b>primaries</b> and was processed to produce a dye image in the complementary subtractive primary.|$|R
50|$|Color {{televisions}} {{are based}} on using phosphors of the three <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> (red, green and blue, RGB). In order to produce reasonable resolution {{similar to that of}} a black and white set, the phosphors have to be deposited in very small dots or stripes. An electron gun {{at the back of the}} tube cannot be focused tightly enough to hit only a single phosphor color if that phosphor is as small as desired. Some secondary system needs to be used to refocus the beam.|$|R
50|$|Green is {{the color}} between blue and yellow on the {{spectrum}} of visible light. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of roughly 495570 nm.

2500|$|Most televisions, {{computer}} displays, and projectors produce colors {{by combining}} red, green, and blue light in varying intensities—the so-called RGB <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors.</b> The resulting mixtures in RGB color space can reproduce {{a wide variety}} of colors (called a gamut); however, the relationship between the constituent amounts of red, green, and blue light and the resulting color is unintuitive, especially for inexperienced users, and for users familiar with subtractive color mixing of paints or traditional artists’ models based on tints and shades (...) [...] Furthermore, neither additive nor subtractive color models define color relationships the same way the human eye does.|$|R
50|$|The Foveon X3 sensor is {{an image}} sensor for digital cameras, {{designed}} by Foveon, Inc. (now part of Sigma Corporation) and manufactured by Dongbu Electronics.It uses an array of photosites, each of which consists of three vertically stacked photodiodes, organized in a two-dimensional grid. Each of the three stacked photodiodes responds to different wavelengths of light; that is, each has a different spectral sensitivity curve. This difference is because different wavelengths of light penetrate silicon to different depths.The signals from the three photodiodes are then processed, resulting in data that provides the amounts of three <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors,</b> red, green, and blue.|$|R

5000|$|The color {{shown in}} the color box above is the color called [...] "Fuchsia" [...] in A Dictionary of Color. That is why the name fuchsia {{was chosen as the}} {{equivalent}} to one of the three secondary <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors,</b> electric magenta, because A Dictionary of <b>Color</b> was the <b>primary</b> reference on <b>color</b> names (besides the Munsell Book of Color) before the introduction of personal computers. The color shown above is somewhat brighter than most actual flowers of the fuchsia plant. The color shown as magenta in A Dictionary of Color is a somewhat different color than the color shown in that book as fuchsia—it is the original color magenta now called rich magenta or magenta (dye) (see the article on magenta for a color box displaying a sample of this original magenta).|$|R
50|$|Red {{is one of}} the <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> {{of visible}} light, along with green and blue, which in Red Green Blue (RGB) color systems are {{combined}} to create all the colors on a computer monitor or television screen. Red {{is one of the}} subtractive secondary colors, resulting from the combination of yellow and magenta. (See CMYK color model.) Traditionally, it was viewed as a primary subtractive colour, along with yellow and blue, in the RYB color space and traditional color wheel formerly used by painters and artists. Reds can vary in shade from very light pink to very dark maroon or burgundy; and in hue from the bright orange-red scarlet or vermilion to the bluish-red crimson. Red is the complementary color of cyan.|$|R
50|$|In modern color theory, {{also known}} as the RGB color model, red, green and blue are <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors.</b> Red, green and blue light {{combined}} together makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television. For example, purple on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment: it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen. Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light.|$|R
25|$|For an <b>additive</b> set of <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> {{for human}} vision, as in a {{television}} or computer display screen, projector, or other emissive electronic visual displays, the usual choice is red, green, and blue (RGB), although the primaries' specific chromaticities can vary.|$|R
500|$|Green is {{the color}} between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light with a has {{dominant}} wavelength of roughly 495570 nm. In subtractive color systems, [...] used in painting and color printing, it is created {{by a combination of}} yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, {{it is one of the}} <b>additive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors,</b> along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. [...] By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.|$|R
50|$|Single-shot capture systems {{use either}} one sensor chip with a Bayer filter mosaic, or three {{separate}} image sensors (one each for the <b>primary</b> <b>additive</b> <b>colors</b> red, green, and blue) which {{are exposed to}} the same image via a beam splitter (see Three-CCD camera).|$|R
50|$|By convention, {{the three}} <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> in {{subtractive}} mixing are yellow, magenta and cyan; however, {{for a long}} time painters have used yellow, red and blue in place of these. In subtractive mixing of color, the absence of color is white and the presence of all three <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> is black. The secondary colors are the same as the <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> from <b>additive</b> mixing, and vice versa. This is not an accident. By mixing additive secondary colors subtractively one can reachieve the <b>primary</b> <b>additive</b> <b>colors.</b> Subtractive mixing is used to create a variety of colors when printing on paper by combining a small number of ink colors, and also when painting. Green is a part of mixing yellow and blue. Orange is a part of mixing red and yellow. Purple is a part of mixing blue and red.|$|R
5000|$|An RGB {{color space}} is any {{additive}} color space {{based on the}} RGB color model. [...] A particular RGB color space {{is defined by the}} three chromaticities of the red, green, and blue <b>additive</b> <b>primaries,</b> and can produce any chromaticity that is the triangle defined by those <b>primary</b> <b>colors.</b> [...] The complete specification of an RGB color space also requires a white point chromaticity and a gamma correction curve. As of 2007, sRGB {{is by far the most}} commonly used RGB color space.|$|R
50|$|The color {{defined as}} {{blue in the}} RGB color model, X11 blue, is shown at right.

It {{is one of the}} three <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> used on the RGB color space, along with red and green. The three <b>additive</b> <b>primaries</b> in the RGB color system are the three colors of light chosen such as to provide the maximum gamut of colors that are capable of being represented on a computer or television set.|$|R
40|$|A {{color space}} is a {{mathematical}} {{representation of a}} set of colors. The three most popular color models are RGB (used in computer graphics); YIQ, YUV, or YCbCr (used in video systems); and CMYK (used in color printing). However, none of these color spaces are directly related to the intuitive notions of hue, saturation, and brightness. This resulted in the temporary pursuit of other models, such as HSI and HSV, to simplify programming, processing, and enduser manipulation. All of the color spaces can be derived from the RGB information supplied by devices such as cameras and scanners. RGB Color Space The red, green, and blue (RGB) color space is widely used throughout computer graphics. Red, green, and blue are three <b>primary</b> <b>additive</b> <b>colors</b> (individual components are added together to form a desired color) and are represented by a three-dimensional, Cartesian coordinate system (Figure 3. 1). The indicated diagonal of the cube, with equal amounts of each primary component, represents various gray levels. Table 3. 1 contains the RGB values for 100 % amplitude, 100 % saturated color bars, a common video test signal...|$|R
