We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill <b>asked</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E

From 16 August 144 RAC regularly worked with 153rd (Highland) Brigade of 51st Highland. 'On arriving at Brigade Headquarters, Major Secretan {{found that he was}} to support the 1st Gordons, the beginning of a long association between B Squadron and that battalion... this was really the beginning of our close connection with 153 Infantry Brigade, an association which was to continue {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Each infantry battalion also grew accustomed to being supported by the same squadron and in this way very close ties of confidence and friendship were established between A Squadron and the 5th Black Watch, B squadron and the 1st Gordons, and between C Squadron and the 5/7th Gordons... In order to make us feel part of the family, the 51st Highland Division <b>asked</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> wear the famous HD flash and issued every man in the brigade with one, a gesture which was very much appreciated'.|$|E
25|$|Housing {{and urban}} {{development}} were major issues throughout Bates’ long tenure as mayor. Bates’ success in promoting an environmental agenda as a member the California Assembly led him to partner with the environmental groups like the Sierra Club in promoting a series of “Smart Growth” policies for Berkeley and the Bay Area. In addition to advocating dense, transit-oriented urban development, Bates worked to mitigate the effects of Berkeley’s rapidly rising housing costs on the city’s low-income residents. Bates proposed a municipal density bonus program to incentivize the inclusion of affordable units in new developments and to increase the fees that developers must pay into the city’s Housing Trust Fund. Bates also put up resistance to UC Berkeley’s expansion. In 2004, following the release of UC’s Long-Range Development Plan, Bates promised to fight the expansion “tooth and nail.” Claiming, “The university <b>asked</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> sign {{the equivalent of a}} blank check,” Bates announced that the city would file a $4.1 million lawsuit against the university. After a year of negotiations in which the university agreed to increase its ongoing fiscal support for city services, the lawsuit was settled for $1.2 million.|$|E

500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was {{developed}} by UK-based computer game company Zippo Games, headed by Ste and John Pickford; {{this was the first}} game Zippo developed for fellow UK-based video game company Rare. At the time, Zippo Games had just completed a previous game titled Cosmic Pirate - a game that was published by Palace Software and released for the Commodore64, AtariST, and Amiga in 1988. New to the technical capabilities of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Pickford brothers visited Rare and were pleased with their NES library, though they thought they were backtracking by deciding to develop games for the console. According to Ste Pickford: [...] "The NES seemed primitive by comparison, sub-Commodore64. But the games were ten times better than everything being released for home computers, which we appreciated, and we wanted to try to make games as good as that." [...] Rare decided to hire Zippo Games to develop this Wizards & Warriors sequel; Pickford remarked: [...] "Rare showed us Wizards & Warriors and <b>asked</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> develop the sequel, and pretty much left us to it." [...] Rare felt that Zippo Games was trustworthy enough to develop the sequel without much help from them.|$|E

They <b>asked</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> spell it." [...] Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls needed to talk to Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel {{said that it}} took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and one to talk to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears.|$|E
