5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Fauxlivia and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) investigate {{reports of a}} Fringe event in the Rosencrantz building, and speak with Derek, who tells them he has not noticed <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> The two leave, and Derek is left paging sadly through a photo album filled with pictures {{of him and his}} late wife and their daughters.|$|E
5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production {{expected it to}} be <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
25|$|The defence case {{began on}} the morning of 12 March 2012 and lasted half a day. The court heard from a number of {{witnesses}} who worked in the offices of Infrastructure Managers Ltd, who spoke {{to the fact that they}} did not see <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> at the premises in Thistle Street on 4 May 2010. Mr Gilroy declined to give evidence in his own defence.|$|E

25|$|The dynasty is {{regarded}} as the greatest native Yemeni state since the fall of pre-Islamic Himyarite Kingdom. They were of Turkic descent. They claimed an ancient Yemenite origin to justify their rule. The Rasulids were not the first dynasty to create a fictitious genealogy for political purposes, nor were they doing <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> in the tribal context of Arabia. By claiming descent from a solid Yemenite tribe, the Rasulids brought Yemen to a vital sense of unity in an otherwise chaotic regional milieu.|$|E
25|$|Very {{soon after}} arrival over the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea), at 10:35., North Korea {{reacted to the}} {{presence}} of the EC-121, but not {{in a way that would}} jeopardize the mission. At 12:34 local time, roughly six hours into the mission, the Army Security Agency and radars in Korea detected the takeoff of two North Korean Air Force MiG-21s from East Tongchong-ni near Wonsan and tracked them, assuming that they were responding in some fashion to the mission of Deep Sea 129. In the meantime the EC-121 filed a scheduled activity report by radio on time at 13:00 and did not indicate <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary,</b> but this was the last message sent from the plane. Twenty-two minutes later the radars lost the picture of the MiGs and did not reacquire it until 13:37, where they were closing with Deep Sea 129 for a probable intercept.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} care home where Roland lives. When they gently {{ask him about}} the night of the murder, he tells them he had not seen <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> He also {{inadvertently}} reveals his mathematical prowess by rapidly counting the star designs visible on Scully's blouse; however, his handwriting does not match the fourth sample taken from the whiteboard. The discussion ends when Roland experiences a violent vision and has {{what seems to be a}} fit. Later that night, Roland has another vision in which he sees someone killing Keats. He appears at the lab and murders Keats by submerging his head in a tank of liquid nitrogen. Keats' frozen body is left to shatter as Roland begins typing at one of the computers.|$|E

2500|$|Arthur Rubinstein {{described}} his first exposure to Richter as follows: [...] "It really wasn't <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> [...] Then {{at some point}} I noticed my eyes growing moist: tears began rolling down my cheeks." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the testimonies for {{the first}} charge, Downer pointed out they need not prove that Zuma did <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> to help Shaik as [...] "you can corrupt a {{politician}} by paying him to do something he is paid to do every day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Space Shuttle Discovery {{launched}} on time at 19:43 EDT without any issues. Upon initial review of early ascent imagery, mission managers {{did not see}} <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> with debris at launch. [...] "We didn't see anything {{at all in the}} first quick look," [...] noted Bill Gerstenmaier, Associate Administrator for Space Operations, during the post-launch news conference. [...] "I’ve seen a lot of launches," [...] commented Launch Director Michael D. Leinbach during the conference, [...] "and this was the most visibly beautiful launch I’ve ever seen." [...] After reaching orbit, the STS-119 crew got to work on their orbit operations, opening the payload bay doors, deploying the Ku band antenna, and activating and checking out the shuttle's robotic arm. The crew also downlinked the imagery taken of the external tank separation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care {{anything}} about Silas Grantley. What I {{want to know}} is, how this rascal manages to make <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political pickings <b>of</b> a town like Leith." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] said Prescott. [...] "I don't {{expect much}} from him. He's <b>the</b> kind <b>of</b> man who's guided by {{appearances}} and seldom does <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how about}} the case?" [...] asked the baronet. [...] "Have you made <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tangle? I don't know that Watson and I are much the wiser since we came down." ...|$|R
2500|$|Other reasons {{include the}} passage not being {{something}} a devout Jew such as Josephus would write (especially, [...] "if it be lawful {{to call him}} a man" [...] and [...] "doer of incredible deeds"), as his writing was usually sophisticated and would have explained <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> to his Gentile audience, such as explaining what the word [...] "Christ" [...] means, why Jesus was called that and further explanations such as how he won over many Jews and Greeks, as he did for every other group (see [...] ), or why he would mention Jesus [...] "appearing" [...] in the [...] "third day"—a Christian creed—without explaining it and how {{no one seemed to}} notice this passage until the 4th century, not even Origen who quotes Josephus extensively in his works, thus leading mythicists to think that the Testimonium Flavianum is a forgery of the 4th century, perhaps written by Eusebius in order to provide an outside Jewish authority for the life of Jesus.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{have asked}} you to come down, Master Cap," [...] he commenced, [...] "in order to inquire if you have remarked <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common way in <b>the</b> {{movements}} <b>of</b> Eau-douce this evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that'll be all right. There won't be <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way," [...] put in Waxy hastily, {{afraid that}} he had said too much. [...] "They'll have a lively time, but {{everything}} will be perfectly all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ice {{and snow}} principally," [...] {{answered}} Barwell Dawson, smiling. [...] "I {{do not look}} for <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> It is only the honor of having {{been able to reach}} that point." ...|$|E
60|$|His companion's eyes {{happened}} to fall upon the telltale mark. There {{was an almost}} imperceptible raising of the man's eyebrows; but he said nothing to indicate that he had noticed <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b>|$|E
60|$|All walked {{completely}} {{around the}} tent and the camp fire, but failed to see <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> The collie had now ceased barking and was wagging his tail, apparently as happy and free from anxiety as ever.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think that}} we do <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way,' said Sophia. 'I haven't the {{slightest}} idea what papa's income is; but if we're to live at all, I don't know how we are to make a change.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were down}} in the churchyard, and the gate was open, and so we walked up;--that was all. If we'd meant to do <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way we shouldn't 'a come like that, nor yet at that hour. Why, it worn't midnight, Mr. Fenwick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'One--or two, Regie?' said Jane, as {{they all}} laughed at his sally. 'I think I had better go up and see whether I can get <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. Do you mean to have her down to dinner, Lily,' she added, glancing at the clock.|$|R
60|$|The rest of {{the hunting}} tour passed without <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> happening. Many small animals were brought in by both Dave and Henry, and Barringford varied the sport by laying low a wildcat that came one night to rob them {{of some of the}} meat.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is useless}} {{for a woman}} to think of her future; she can do so little towards {{planning}} it, or bringing about her plans.

6000|$|... 'Don't {{you think}} it's <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{way to be}} engaged {{to a young man}} and then to throw him over?

60|$|Indeed the {{occurrence}} {{is not very}} explicable on any principles, as a detail not visible without search was sought and verified, and that by a habitual mocker at <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common way. For example, Hone published a comic explanation, correct or not, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> famous Stockwell mystery.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} natural {{that you should}} do so," [...] Mrs. Glover said; [...] "for, if fault there is, it rests with Nat, who always spoke of his own adventures in a jesting sort of way, and gave us no idea that they were <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common." ...|$|R
