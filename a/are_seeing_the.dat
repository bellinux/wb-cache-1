25|$|McCulley {{writes that}} the {{progression}} through Minsky's three borrowing stages was evident as the credit and housing bubbles built through approximately August 2007. Demand for housing was both a cause and effect of the rapidly expanding shadow banking system, which helped fund the shift to more lending of the speculative and ponzi types, through ever-riskier mortgage loans at higher levels of leverage. This helped drive the housing bubble, as the availability of credit encouraged higher home prices. Since the bubble burst, we <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> progression in reverse, as businesses de-leverage, lending standards are raised and the share of borrowers in the three stages shifts back towards the hedge borrower.|$|E

2500|$|Keller {{states that}} this new {{perspective}} on long poem and reexamination of forgotten long poems has revived the form as a realm of possibilities for upcoming female writers. Female writers <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> long poem as a genre that should not only be open and inclusive to them, {{but also as a}} genre that theoretically could benefit the female writer as much if not more than the male writers the form previously favored. Women writers are now able to combat the [...] "dominant traditions" [...] at play within the long poem genre to mold the genre into their own, creating what critic Susan Friedman terms a [...] "re-vision" [...] of the form.|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Sundlof, {{director}} of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, says [...] "Melamine is not very toxic as a chemical, so we're wondering why we <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> kinds of serious conditions, especially the kidney failure, that we're seeing in cats and dogs... We are focusing on the melamine right now because we believe that, even if melamine is not the causative agent, it is somehow associated with the causative agent, so {{it serves as a}} marker". Even at the highest observed concentrations found in wheat gluten, the melamine exposure is much smaller than the rat and mouse doses for which effects were seen. Instead, the FDA has suggested a second contaminant may be responsible for the ill effects and melamine, as the most easily identifiable contaminant, may serve as a biomarker, or indicator, for contaminated wheat gluten.|$|E

2500|$|Daniel Dennett {{argued that}} {{the way we think}} we <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> world is, for the most part, an illusion. Part of Dennett's {{argument}} is the claim that each of us possess what he calls a [...] "Cartesian theater", in which we believe there is a full representation of the visual world in our mind {{and that there is a}} place in the mind where it is observed. According to Dennett, none of this exists. Instead, the only place where a full and rich representation exists is directly on the fovea, and every time a saccade occurs, the information is overwritten. Therefore, there is no such thing as transsaccadic memory. Information previously lost only appears to be retained in visual memory because we can look again. In this way, the outside world acts as a visual memory. Since our eyes are constantly moving, we are not aware that visual inputs are constantly being refreshed to give the illusion of the completed picture we think we are seeing.|$|E
2500|$|From 1977 to 1981, Jon [...] "Bowzer" [...] Bauman hosted {{other musicians}} on his {{television}} show Sha Na Na. He talked with Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Charlie Thomas of the Drifters, discovering {{in the process}} {{that they were being}} victimized by [...] "knock-off" [...] groups of performers using the name of a famous group without having a member of that group. Ben E. King said he, Thomas and Bill Pinkney were losing out on potential gigs and income because there were [...] "so many fake Drifters performing". Herb Reed of the Platters told Bauman that his group had experienced [...] "about 30" [...] court cases fighting against fake groups. Researching the laws, Bauman found that the original musicians had scant legal protection against their group name being used by promoters or other performers, so he determined to amend the existing laws to increase protection for the original musicians. He allied with the Vocal Group Hall of Fame (VGHF) to bring famous musicians together to help promote these new laws. VGHF President Bob Crosby said of the fake groups [...] "It's a form of identity theft to the artists... Most importantly it is misleading the public for them to think they <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> artist who made the hits when they are not." [...] Mary Wilson of the Supremes joined the effort, appearing with Bauman before the US Congress in March 1999. She said [...] "We want these fake groups to say they are tribute groups or get their own name." ...|$|E

6000|$|And if any say, as {{they have}} a right to say--"But these are {{subjects}} which can hardly be taught to young women in public lectures;" [...] I rejoin--of course not, unless they are taught by women--by women, of course, duly educated and legally qualified. Let such teach to women, what every woman ought to know, and what her parents will very properly object to her hearing from almost any man. This is one of the main reasons why I have, for twenty years past, advocated the training of women for the medical profession; and one which countervails, in my mind, all possible objections to such a movement. And now, thank God, we <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> common sense of Great Britain, and indeed of every civilised nation, gradually coming round to that which seemed to me, when I first conceived of it, a dream too chimerical to be cherished save in secret--the restoring woman to her natural share in that sacred office of healer, which she held in the Middle Ages, and from which she was thrust out during the sixteenth century.|$|E
60|$|In {{saying that}} the time-order which events seem to have {{is the same as}} the time-order which they really have, it is {{necessary}} to guard against a possible misunderstanding. It must not be supposed that the various states of different physical objects have the same time-order as the sense-data which constitute the perceptions of those objects. Considered as physical objects, the thunder and lightning are simultaneous; that is to say, the lightning is simultaneous with the disturbance of the air in the place where the disturbance begins, namely, where the lightning is. But the sense-datum which we call hearing the thunder does not take place until the disturbance of the air has travelled as far as to where we are. Similarly, it takes about eight minutes for the sun's light to reach us; thus, when we see the sun we <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> sun of eight minutes ago. So far as our sense-data afford evidence as to the physical sun they afford evidence as to the physical sun of eight minutes ago; if the physical sun had ceased to exist within the last eight minutes, that would make no difference to the sense-data which we call 'seeing the sun'. This affords a fresh illustration of the necessity of distinguishing between sense-data and physical objects.|$|E
