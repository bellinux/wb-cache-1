40|$|A firm {{introduces}} a product and consumers {{do not know}} how much they value it, while they know how they value a rival’s product. If the product is low quality, the firm will advertise detailed product information that enables consumers to determine their matches: it will not if it is high quality. By contrast, the rival would like to <b>advertise</b> <b>match</b> information about the unknown product only if it is high quality. Such “comparative ” advertising leads to higher prices. It may improve welfare if qualities are similar, although it may deter desirable entry of high quality products. For different qualities, it has a detrimental impact on welfare by leading more consumers to consume the low quality product: this effect dominates the benefits from improved consumer information and induces a lower social welfare if qualities are different enough. We extend the model to allow consumers to not know quality unless it is advertised (consumers know there is a positive probability that neither firm knows quality: this circumvents the classic quality disclosure unravelling of the persuasion game). Then a high quality firm will advertise quality, and the rival will <b>advertise</b> <b>match</b> information. The reverse happens for a low quality entrant...|$|R

40|$|Consumer {{information}} on products affects competition and profits. We analyze firms' decisions to impart product information through advertising: comparative advertising also {{allows them to}} impart information about rivals' products. If firms sell products of similar qualities, both want to advertise detailed product information that enables consumers to determine their matches: there is no role for comparative advertising. If qualities are sufficiently dissimilar, the high-quality one will not want to disclose match information. If legal, the low-quality firm rival would like to <b>advertise</b> <b>match</b> information about its rival. Such "comparative" advertising may have a detrimental impact on welfare by leading more consumers to consume the low quality product: this effect can dominate the benefits from improved consumer information and reduce social welfare if qualities are different enough. comparative advertising, information, product differentiation, quality...|$|R

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of online distribution methods for videos, content owners require easier and more effective methods for monetization through <b>advertising.</b> <b>Matching</b> advertisements with related content has {{a significant impact on}} the effectiveness of the ads, but current methods for selecting relevant advertising keywords for videos are limited by reliance on manually supplied metadata. In this paper we study the feasibility of using text available from video content to obtain high quality keywords suitable for matching advertisements. In particular, we tap into three sources of text for ad keyword generation: production scripts, closed captioning tracks, and speech-to-text transcripts. We address several challenges associated with using such data. To overcome the high error rates prevalent in automatic speech recognition and the lack of an explicit structure to provide hints about which keywords are most relevant, we use statistical and generative methods to identify dominant terms in the source text. To overcome the sparsity of the data and resulting vocabulary mismatches between source tex...|$|R
