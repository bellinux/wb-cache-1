5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the <b>afternoon</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
5|$|The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and Macau's Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau both hoisted {{strong wind}} signal 1 on August1 {{as the system}} was located within 800km (497mi) of their {{respective}} cities. As Prapiroon neared the southern coast of China, the signal was raised to strong wind signal 3 as strong winds were expected to strike the area. In Macau in particular this was further increased to strong wind signal 8 SE on August3, as gale-force winds were expected in the southeastern areas. All signals were cancelled the next <b>afternoon</b> <b>as</b> Prapiroon moved inland.|$|E

5|$|After {{making its}} final Florida landfall, Allison rapidly weakened. Tropical storm force winds {{continued}} over the eastern Florida Panhandle until late that <b>afternoon,</b> <b>as</b> the storm moved northward into Georgia. It weakened to a tropical depression {{on the evening}} of June 5 over southern Georgia. Early on June 6, Allison began to transition into an extratropical storm as it interacted with a warm front to the northeast while tracking across the Carolinas. The remnant low emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Cape Hatteras that evening. It then raced across the western Atlantic, crossing the easternmost part of Nova Scotia on June 8 and Newfoundland on June 9. It continued northward across the Labrador Sea, dissipating on June 11.|$|E

Late in the day, Johnson dropped Washbrook in the slips cordon from the bowling of Toshack when the batsman was on 80. Washbrook reached stumps unbeaten on 85, and Johnson's miss only cost five runs, as the fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day. Johnson ended with 0/16 from seven overs.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{continued}} to intensify throughout the <b>afternoon</b> <b>as</b> the storm became more symmetrical. However, {{due to the}} location of the storm, {{there was a lack of}} accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper-level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of Josephine, the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the morning}} Hurricane Gustav {{continued}} to rapidly strengthen. Deep convection around the eye flared intensely and the hurricane's minimum central pressure dropped precipitously—24mbar (0.71inHg) in 24hours. By 1000UTC it had reached Category3 strength {{and continued to}} strengthen. Another drop in pressure–down 11mbar (0.32inHg) in 6hours to 954mbar (28.17inHg)–was quickly followed {{by an increase in}} wind speed to , making Hurricane Gustav a Category4 hurricane when it had been a mere tropical storm only 24 hours earlier. That <b>afternoon,</b> <b>as</b> Hurricane Gustav continued moving northwest towards Cuba, its western eyewall passed directly over the Isle of Youth.|$|E
5|$|A slow {{weakening}} trend began {{early on}} September 27 {{due to the}} increased shear while remaining on a west-northwest track. At the same time, the center of circulation became exposed at times due to the southwesterly wind shear. As a result, an unusual wind field was observed in that the strongest winds were recorded well {{to the east and}} to the northwest of the center. The weakening trend remained fairly slow that evening as the storm continued to produce persistent deep convection. The weakening trend accelerated on September 28 as the convection weakened and the circulation became more disorganized in the high-shear environment. By that morning, Karen weakened to a minimal tropical storm with 40mph (65km/h) winds. Karen also turned abruptly to the north for a short while, as convection interacted with the low-level center and southerly winds increased in the low-level environment. The weakening trend slowed that <b>afternoon</b> <b>as</b> deep convection returned to the disorganized storm. Early on September 29, the high wind shear continued and Karen weakened to a tropical depression with a very poorly defined center. That afternoon, the circulation dissipated while east of the Lesser Antilles. Remnant squalls continued across the area east of the Lesser Antilles for a few days after dissipation.|$|E
5|$|After making {{landfall}} near Jacmel, Hurricane Gustav began traversing northwestward {{across the}} mountainous terrain of southwestern Haiti, dumping heavy rains as it passed. With favorable atmospheric conditions the storm maintained its hurricane intensity {{for several hours}} after landfall, but the high mountains over which it was traveling disrupted its lower level circulation. The eye because ragged and clouded over as Gustav weakened to a tropical storm. A large mid- to upper-level anticyclone over the Florida Straight slowed Gustav's movement, holding it over the northern coast of Haiti's southern peninsula. Rainfall from the storm, which had been heavy since its landfall, began to accumulate as the storm's movement stalled. Although the storm's upper levels began experiencing moderate shear, and although parts of its circulation were still interacting with the mountains of southwestern Haiti, enough of Gustav's convection was over the Gulf of Gonâve that {{on the morning of}} August 27 its organization started to improve. That <b>afternoon,</b> <b>as</b> a broad ridge extended from the Gulf of Mexico into the western Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Gustav began to slowly pull to the west, away from the island of Hispaniola. Increased shear weakened the storm as the building ridge to the north of Gustav imparted a southerly component to the storm's motion.|$|E

5|$|Earlier that <b>afternoon,</b> <b>as</b> Meade {{realized}} {{the folly of}} Sickles's movement, he ordered Hancock to send a division from the II Corps to reinforce the III Corps. Hancock sent the 1st Division under Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell from its reserve position behind Cemetery Ridge. It arrived at about 6 p.m. and three brigades, under Cols. Samuel K. Zook, Patrick Kelly (the Irish Brigade), and Edward E. Cross moved forward; the fourth brigade, under Col. John R. Brooke, was in reserve. Zook and Kelly drove the Confederates from Stony Hill, and Cross cleared the Wheatfield, pushing Kershaw's men back {{to the edge of}} Rose Woods. Both Zook and Cross were mortally wounded in leading their brigades through these assaults, as was Confederate Semmes. When Cross's men had exhausted their ammunition, Caldwell ordered Brooke to relieve them. By this time, however, the Union position in the Peach Orchard had collapsed (see next section), and Wofford's assault continued down the Wheatfield Road, taking Stony Hill and flanking the Union forces in the Wheatfield. Brooke's brigade in Rose Woods had to retreat in some disorder. Sweitzer's brigade was sent in to delay the Confederate assault, and they did this effectively in vicious hand-to-hand combat. The Wheatfield changed hands once again.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or <b>afternoon,</b> <b>as</b> well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|In diurnal animals, it {{is typical}} for {{blood levels of}} the hormone cortisol—which is used to {{increase}} blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stress—to be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning. However, cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the <b>afternoon.</b> <b>As</b> a result, {{this time of day}} is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels. Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon, owing to the sun's high angle in the sky. The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny, harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion {{landed on the}} battlefield, the Viet Cong had intercepted a radio {{conversation}} between the aforementioned unit and the 52nd Ranger Battalion in the district centre; several months earlier the 7th Airborne Battalion {{was involved in the}} battle at Bình Giã, so they vowed to avenge the loss of their comrades. Thus, from the soccer field, the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion marched up to Thuận Lợi, against only light opposition. The South Vietnamese paratroopers arrived at the area where the first group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, was dropped off and they collected seven survivors and 55 bodies. In the <b>afternoon,</b> <b>as</b> elements of the 7th Airborne Battalion moved through the Thuận Lợi rubber plantation to search for remnants of the second group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment started attacking the South Vietnamese paratroopers in a manner which had characterised earlier ambushes. Taking advantage of the poor weather conditions that had limited U.S. air strikes, as well as their numerical superiority, the Viet Cong broke the South Vietnamese formation into small groups and destroyed many of them. On the next day, the strength of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion was reduced from 470 to just 159 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Karl {{originated}} {{in a strong}} tropical wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 13. The wave gradually became better organized, and it was declared Tropical Depression Twelve about 670miles (1,080km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands on the morning of September 16, as it headed westward in the open tropical Atlantic following the periphery of the subtropical ridge. That afternoon, the depression continued to rapidly organize and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karl. Due to healthy outflow around an upper-level anticyclone over Karl and a favorable environment with the warmest sea surface temperatures of the year, rapid deepening began on the evening of September 17, with the storm developing a small eye and being upgraded to Hurricane Karl. With water around 28°C (83°F) and low wind shear, the cyclone continued to rapidly intensify on the morning of September 18. The intensity leveled off somewhat that <b>afternoon</b> <b>as</b> a strong Category2 hurricane with winds of 110mph (175km/h).|$|E
