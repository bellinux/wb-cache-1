25|$|If {{a number}} is the {{successor}} of another number, {{then the first}} number is said to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> than the other number. If a number <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than another number, and if the other number <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than a third number, then the first number <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> than the third number. Example: five <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than four, and four <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than three, therefore five <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than three. But six <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than five, therefore six <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> than three. But seven <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than six, therefore seven <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> than three... therefore eight <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than three... therefore nine <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than three, etc.|$|R

5|$|Vacuoles, like vesicles, are membrane-bound sacs {{within the}} cell. They <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> than vesicles and their {{specific}} function varies. The operations of vacuoles are different for {{plant and animal}} vacuoles.|$|E
5|$|All nuclei that <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> {{than the}} {{critical}} nucleus will form bubbles, and all nuclei that are smaller will not.

5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development are seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have {{lower levels of}} fecundity.|$|E

5|$|Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar: This {{subspecies}} {{grows in}} coastal Queensland {{as far north}} as Proserpine. For most of its range it is the only subspecies, but near its southern limit it co-occurs with B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia. The two subspecies are distinguishable by their leaves, which <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> and glossy with wavy margins on B.integrifolia subsp. compar.|$|E
5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful. Additionally, the feeding territories <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> {{during the winter months}} when these birds spend much of their time foraging with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E

30|$|The {{role of the}} {{parameter}} μ in the triggered function (8) is {{adjusting the}} rate of decrease for the Lyapunov function. From equation (8) we know that when the parameter μ <b>is</b> <b>large,</b> the allowable error <b>is</b> <b>large.</b> This means that when μ <b>is</b> <b>large,</b> the trigger frequency is low.

5|$|In {{comparison}} {{to those of}} Tachyoryctes audax, the nasal bones <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> and have angles at the sides. T.annectens, which is nearly as large, has smaller teeth and nasals; in T.rex, the basioccipital is broader, and the back part of the mandible (lower jaw) is better developed and has the capsule of the incisor placed further to the front.|$|E

5|$|Leucangium carthusianum, the Oregon black truffle, {{is roughly}} similar in appearance, habitat, and growing season, {{but can be}} {{distinguished}} by its darker (charcoal black) peridium.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} diurnal {{variation}} of the air-pressure system in the urban Tokyo.

After sunset, firstly the pressure rise <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> in the downtown Tokyo, thereafter <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> in the suburban Tokyo. In winter, the diurnal variation is almost opposite. Commonly, while the area-averaged air-pressure drops, the pressure drop <b>is</b> firstly <b>larger</b> in the downtown; while rises, the pressure rise <b>is</b> firstly <b>larger</b> in the suburban. The development of local cyclones/anticyclones and semi-diurnal atmospheric tides also contribute to these diurnal variations...|$|R
5|$|M. c. ashbyi, {{described}} by Mathews in 1912, is found on Kangaroo Island, {{and has been}} separated from the mainland subspecies for around 9000 years. Birds of this subspecies <b>are</b> <b>larger,</b> have narrower bills and darker plumage than birds on nearby mainland South Australia. Females from Kangaroo Island are more uniformly grey in plumage than mainland birds.|$|E
5|$|M. c. cyaneus, the {{nominate}} subspecies {{described in}} 1782, is found throughout Tasmania.

5|$|M. l. edouardi, like M. l. leucopterus, have {{black-and-white}} coloured males, and {{are found}} only on Barrow Island, also off the western coast of Australia. Birds of this subspecies <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> {{than those of}} M. l. leucopterus but have a shorter tail.
