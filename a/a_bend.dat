40|$|A load–displacement {{prediction}} for <b>a</b> <b>bended</b> {{slotted disc}} using the energy method Noor Fawazi 1, 2, Jung-Youn Lee 3 and Jae-Eung Oh 4 A slotted disc spring {{consists of two}} segments: a coned disc segment {{and a number of}} lever arm segments. In this study, a load–displacement formula for the slotted disc spring is newly developed in the form of energy method by considering both rigid and bending deflections of the two segments. This formula is developed with the aim to further improve the SAE formula which is limited to a straight slotted disc spring. The coned and the lever arm angles of the straight slotted disc spring are the same. They are different for <b>a</b> <b>bended</b> slotted disc spring. Because of this limitation, it is geometrically impractical to employ the SAE formula for <b>a</b> <b>bended</b> slotted disc spring. To achieve the goal of this study, new calculations based on geometric and material properties inputs are developed for <b>a</b> <b>bended</b> slotted disc spring. A firm background study based on the theory of Almen is presented in developing new load–displacement calculations for <b>a</b> <b>bended</b> slotted disc spring...|$|R

5|$|Commercially navigable only at its mouth, the Saw Mill River {{itself was}} useless {{as a way}} to bring crops to market, {{limiting}} settlement further upriver. Nevertheless, the roots of present-day communities along the river were established during the colonial era. In 1695, a land agent named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor, in the flat land between <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> in the river. Other farmers came to the area, and the settlement ultimately became today's village of Pleasantville.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> in the river at Strangeways, {{on the border with}} Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, {{the decision was made to}} straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|E
5|$|Responding to this attack, militia Colonel Henry Dodge {{gathered}} {{a force of}} twenty-nine mounted volunteers and set out {{in pursuit of the}} attackers. On June 16, Dodge and his men cornered about eleven of the raiders at <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> in the Pecatonica River. In a brief battle, the Americans killed and scalped all of the Natives. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend (or Battle of Pecatonica) was the first real American victory in the war, and helped restore public confidence in the volunteer militia force.|$|E
5|$|The land housing Old Fort Schuyler {{was part}} of a 20,000-acre (80.94km²) portion of {{marshland}} granted by King George II to New York governor William Cosby on January2, 1734. Since the fort was located near several trails (including the Great Indian Warpath), its position—on <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> at a shallow portion of the Mohawk River—made it an important fording point. The Mohawk called the bend Unundadages ("around the hill"), and the Mohawk word appears on the city's seal.|$|E

5|$|At <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> in the highway, {{there is}} a small patch of development, with a few houses near the highway. At the {{intersection}} with Township Road 529, State Route 664 enters Gallagher Township. Eventually, the large patch of forests in the surroundings come towards a clearing, where the highway intersects with Old Dirt Road. After crossing a stream, State Route 664 gains the moniker of the Coudersport Pike. The highway passes a small patch of development, reaching another clearing in the forest. After entering another forest, State Route 664 ends at an intersection with State Route 44 in the community of Haneyville.|$|E
5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a dead-end road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> to the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, the woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E
5|$|For many years, {{the four}} lanes from Sacramento stopped at Riverton, where the {{original}} two-lane road {{continued through the}} canyon and over Echo Summit. The state rejected a proposed $133 million total realignment between Riverton and Kyburz in 1985, instead opting for a less expensive program of spot improvements including new bridges and passing lanes. Portions of the work were completed by 1987, including a four-lane bridge at Riverton (though two lanes are used by traffic turning at Ice House Road at {{the east end of}} the bridge). Between White Hall and Kyburz, a pair of four-lane bridges over the South Fork American River, carrying a realignment across <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> in the river, were dedicated on May 31, 1995, as the El Dorado County Veterans Bridges.|$|E

5|$|In Saginaw, the two {{parallel}} streets continue east and meet M-84 which runs north–south along Bay Street. The {{distance between the}} {{two parallel}} streets decreases east of North Carolina Street when Davenport Avenue shifts to the south. The intersection with Hill Street {{marks the beginning of}} the connections to the exit3 interchange along <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> in the I-675 freeway. Hill Street is one-way carrying traffic southbound exiting from southbound I-675 to either direction of M-58. Two blocks east, Michigan Avenue carries traffic northbound under the freeway, connecting to a ramp to northbound I-675 before continuing north through the city of Saginaw. East of this intersection, State Street curves to the north, intersecting Davenport Avenue and merging into the ramp for southbound I-675. A loop ramp across the freeway provides access from northbound I-675 to Davenport Avenue. This interchange complex marks the eastern terminus of M-58.|$|E
5|$|Most French rulers {{since the}} Middle Ages {{made a point}} of leaving their mark on a city that, {{contrary}} to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map. At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the île Saint-Louis, the île de la Cité; a third one is the 1827 artificially created île aux Cygnes.|$|E
5|$|PA848 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US11 (Main Street) in New Milford. The route runs east towards Cobb Street, making <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> to the southeast. Passing through a residential area, the route leaves the borough of New Milford {{and enters the}} township of New Milford. The surroundings become more rural, and at the intersection with State Route2061 (SR2061), the route curves to the southeast into a dense forested area. PA848 remains a two-lane road through New Milford Township. The route soon reaches SR2063 (Far Hill Road) and later with SR2081 (Oliver Road), which serves as the connection between Interstate81's (I-81) exit219 southbound and PA848. After crossing over I-81, PA848 intersects the northbound ramps {{before returning to the}} rural Gibson Township. After the intersection with Creek Road, PA848 enters the village of Gibson, where it terminates at an intersection with PA547 and Township Road574.|$|E

5|$|The Stella power {{stations}} were {{a pair of}} now-demolished coal-fired {{power stations}} in the North East of England that were a landmark in the Tyne valley for over 40years. The stations stood {{on either side of}} <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> of the River Tyne: Stella South power station, the larger, near Blaydon in Gateshead, and Stella North power station near Lemington in Newcastle. Their name originated from the nearby Stella Hall, a manor house close to Stella South that by the time of their construction had been demolished and replaced by a housing estate. They operated from shortly after the nationalisation of the British electrical supply industry until two years after the Electricity Act of 1989, when the industry passed into the private sector.|$|E
5|$|The Territorals and 10 Troop made a {{sweep of}} the river line, but on {{rounding}} <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> in the stream were suddenly fired upon by the hidden guerrillas. A sergeant from the TF was killed, as well as Rifleman Hennie Potgeiter of the RLI. RLI Rifleman Ken Lucas suffered a gunshot wound to the leg. The insurgents now held their fire to prevent giving their position away. Incorrectly believing from the inactivity that the cadres had fled, and thinking that the two fallen soldiers were still alive, Major Hank Meyer ordered the leader of 7 Troop, Lieutenant Joe du Plooy, to sweep around the river and send Coey out to treat the men.|$|E

During the 1850s, plank roads were built through the marshland surrounding the city. Utica's suburbs have more hills and cliffs than the city. Located where the Mohawk Valley forms a wide floodplain, the city has a generally sloping, flat topography.|$|E
