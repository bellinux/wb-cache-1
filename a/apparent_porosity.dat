One can not underestimate the slow down of neutrons by other elements even if they are less effective. Certain effects, such as lithology, clay content, and amount and type of hydrocarbons, can be recognized and corrected for only if additional porosity information is available, for example from sonic and/or density log. Any interpretation of a neutron log alone should be undertaken with a realization of the uncertainties involved.|$|E
5000|$|Vitrification is the {{progressive}} partial fusion of a clay, or of a body, {{as a result}} of a firing process. As vitrification proceeds the proportion of glassy bond increases and the <b>apparent</b> <b>porosity</b> of the fired product becomes progressively lower. Vitreous bodies have open porosity, and may be either opaque or translucent. In this context 'zero porosity'; may be defined as less than 1% water absorption. However, various standard procedures define the conditions of water absorption. An example is by ASTM, who state [...] "The term vitreous generally signifies less than 0.5% absorption. except for floor and wall tile and low-voltage electrical insulators which are considered vitreous up to 3% water absorption." ...|$|E
50|$|Neutron {{porosity}} {{logging tools}} contain an americium-beryllium neutron source, which irradiates the formation with neutrons. These neutrons lose energy through elastic collisions with nuclei in the formation. Once their energy has decreased to thermal level, they diffuse randomly {{away from the}} source and are ultimately absorbed by a nucleus. Hydrogen atoms have essentially the same mass as the neutron; therefore hydrogen is the main contributor to the slowing down of neutrons. A detector at {{some distance from the}} source records the number of neutron reaching this point. Neutrons that have been slowed down to thermal level have a high probability of being absorbed by the formation before reaching the detector. The neutron counting rate is therefore inversely related to the amount of hydrogen in the formation. Since hydrogen is mostly present in pore fluids (water, hydrocarbons) the count rate can be converted into <b>apparent</b> <b>porosity.</b> Modern neutron logging tools usually include two detectors to compensate for some borehole effects. Porosity is derived from the ratio of count rates at these two detectors rather than from count rates at a single detector.|$|E

This article reviews a novel technique for wastewater treatment using a Sayong ball clay (SBC) membrane to remove nickel from industrial wastewater. SBC powder was achieved through milling using a planetary ball mill (milling time; 10, 20 and 30 Â h), further labelled as SBC 10, SBC 20 and SBC 30, with a ball-to-powder of ratio 7 : 1 and rotation speed of 300 Â rpm. The physical characteristics of the <b>apparent</b> <b>porosities,</b> bulk density and shrinkage were investigated. XRD was used to study the phase, while FESEM was used to analyse the microstructure of the fired membrane. The FESEM microstructure indicates a decreased particle size (SB 30). Filtration was conducted using a dead-end filtration system. The fabricated SBC 10, 20 and 30 membranes showed significant removal of nickel from industrial wastewaterâ 88. 87 %, 82. 96 % and 85. 13 %, respectively.
