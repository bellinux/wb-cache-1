5|$|Historically, the Mangalorean Catholic diet was {{completely}} vegetarian. This changed during the 20th century, when {{with the advent}} of Westernisation, meat came to be consumed increasingly in the community, especially amongst the elite. Coconut and curry leaves are common ingredients to most curries. Sanna-Dukra Maas (Sanna is idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas is pork) {{is one of the most}} popular dishes of the Mangalorean Catholic community. Rosachi Kadi (Ros Curry), a fish curry made with coconut milk (ros), is a traditional curry served during the Ros ceremony. Patrode, <b>a</b> <b>dish</b> <b>of</b> colocasia leaves stuffed with rice, dal, jaggery, coconut, and spices is popular.

5|$|The 1894-S Barber dime {{is one of}} {{the great}} numismatic rarities, with a {{published}} mintage of 24 proof pieces. Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist, the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of worn-out coins, just enough to coin 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was, and she would be able to sell them for a good price. According to the story, she spent one on <b>a</b> <b>dish</b> <b>of</b> ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.|$|E

The guest cook (usually a celebrity) prepares <b>a</b> <b>dish</b> <b>of</b> their own choosing and places it in competition against a similar dish submitted by Ramsay. The dishes are judged by diners who are unaware of who cooked which dish and, if the guest wins (as they have on numerous occasions), their dish is served at Ramsay's restaurant.|$|E
25|$|St Giles {{was unique}} in that food was {{provided}} for children who were getting free education elsewhere. It is also noted that St Giles arranged for seven poor scholars to receive board at the hospital during their term at Norwich School. Accommodations of early medieval hospitals were frequently communal. For example, in St Giles, the master and brothers ate in the common hall while sisters ate by themselves. St Giles hospital was a complex building that housed a community of clergy with cloister and residential accommodation, a hospital and a parish church. St Giles was also wealthy enough to maintain its own kitchen and staff. This allowed poor men to receive <b>a</b> <b>dish</b> <b>of</b> meat, fish, eggs or cheese {{in addition to the}} customary daily ration of bread and drink.|$|E

25|$|Sephardi-style hamin {{typically}} includes whole {{eggs in the}} shell, {{which are}} placed {{on top of the}} mixture in the stewing pot and turn brown in the course of all-night cooking. The brown eggs, called haminados (güevos haminadavos in Ladino, huevos haminados in Spanish), are shelled before serving and placed {{on top of the other}} cooked ingredients. In a Tunisian version, the brown eggs are cooked separately in a metal pot on the all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light brown, giving the egg a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, brown eggs are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (<b>a</b> <b>dish</b> <b>of</b> mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a Sabich sandwich.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the island}} {{location}} {{and the fact that}} the Cook Islands produce a significant array of fruits and vegetables, natural local produce, especially coconut, features in many of the dishes of the islands as does fresh seafood. While most food is imported from New Zealand, there are several Growers' Associations, such as Mangaian, Ngatangiia, Penrhyn, Puaikura, and Rakahanga, which contribute produce for local cuisine. Typical local cuisine includes arrowroot, clams, octopus, and taro, and seasonings such as fresh ginger, lime, lemon, basil, garlic and coconut. Rukau is <b>a</b> <b>dish</b> <b>of</b> taro leaves cooked with coconut sauce and onion. [...] A meal of octopus is known locally as Eke, and suckling pig is known as Puaka. Ika mata is <b>a</b> <b>dish</b> <b>of</b> raw fish marinated with lemon or lime and served with coconut cream, while Pai Ika and Keke Ika are also local fish fare. Poke is a dessert which can be made in one of two ways, either with banana and coconut milk or with pawpaw. Soursop, oranges and mangos are popular as juices. Coconut water, local beer (Cooks Lager), and coffee are popular beverages among the Cook Islanders.|$|E

She is equally scathing about Acton's [...] "Burlington Whimsey" [...] which she calls [...] "basically <b>a</b> <b>dish</b> <b>of</b> brawn"; she argues that the Victorians were too fond of it, and that Acton's recipe is [...] "the epitome of dull food dressed up to look whimsical." ...|$|E
