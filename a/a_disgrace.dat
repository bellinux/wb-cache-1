5|$|In 1911, as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{continued}} {{the project of}} eliminating at-grade crossings between streets and railroads, the Montclair Branch was the next to receive the structural change. Bloomfield criticized the Lackawanna railroad for making <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> of the community. The railroad proposed using $700,000 (1911 USD) of funds to construct a brand new station at Watsessing Avenue along with a new downtown Bloomfield Station. The cost of elevating and depressing the railroad came up to about $20,000 (1911 USD) for the Lackawanna. This contract by the railroad and township was approved after negotiations dating back to 1908. The negotiations included a park to be built between both stations {{on both sides of}} the railroad. The park land cost the township $50,000 to buy for the construction, and it was to be turned over to the Essex County Park Commission.|$|E

25|$|Frank Sinatra, who had {{declared}} Presley and {{rock and roll}} <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> in the 1950s, was keen to have him appear on his show. Parker, not one to forget harsh criticism, stated that the fee would be $125,000 for two songs, a total of eight minutes on screen; Sinatra himself was receiving a lower sum for the whole show, but he agreed.

25|$|The Japanese anime , a satire {{series that}} personifies various nations created by Hidekaz Himaruya, was banned from airing on the Japanese TV Station, Kid Station, after many protests arrived from South Korea {{about how the}} {{character}} that represents South Korea was <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> and did not represent South Koreans correctly. This is {{in spite of the}} fact that a Korean character does not appear in any episode of the animated series, though it appears on web comic versions. The animation continues to see distribution through mobile networks and internet streaming.|$|E
25|$|According to a custom, {{it would}} be <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> if a younger sister would marry before the elder sister. Therefore, Sophia's older sister Vasilisa was married off to Ivan Bielski, son of Jogaila's {{half-brother}} Vladimir Olgerdovich, in 1421. In February 1422, Sophia was baptized in the Roman Catholic rite (Sophia is her Catholic baptismal name). The wedding ceremony, carried out by Matthias of Trakai, Bishop of Samogitia, took place in Navahrudak on February 7 or 24. However, her coronation as Queen of Poland took place two years later, on March 5, 1424. This delay is explained by resistance from the Polish nobility and rather distant relationship between Sophia and Jogaila.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} this became almost a {{mandatory}} exercise {{and although it}} may seem to many to be a gross act of indecency, it was generally well received by the sometimes up to hundreds of tourists and locals. The Kai Tais or Beanie Boys, as the trans women were referred to by Anglophone white visitors, certainly did not mind either. By the mid-70s Singapore started a crackdown on this type of lewd behaviour and sailors were arrested at gunpoint by the local authorities for upholding the tradition. By this time those sailors brave enough to try it were dealt with severely and even shipped home in disgrace. Though many locals accepted this part of Singaporean culture, many conservative Singaporeans {{felt that it was}} <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> and it defaced Singapore's image.|$|E

25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all know {{something}} about my trip and {{the condition of the}} country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E
25|$|The colours {{were then}} struck to Éveillé, upon which her {{commander}} demanded Roddam come aboard his ship. Roddam refused, answering {{that if he}} was wanted on the French ship, a boat must be sent for him, or else he would rehoist the colours and defend the ship until she sank. A lieutenant was then sent over in a boat from the French ship, and Roddam came aboard. The French commander, Captain Merville, gave Roddam the bedding of the ordinary ship's company and a dirty rug, and did not allow him to change his clothes. Greenwich was ransacked, and the crew left unfed. Roddam protested, and demanded to be taken to see Bauffremont. After Roddam had expressed his grievances, Bauffremont asked Roddam why he had refused to come to present his surrender in his own boat. Roddam replied that he would have considered it <b>a</b> <b>disgrace,</b> and that his sword would have been delivered through the body of the person demanding it, had it happened to him.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, Pakistan was {{eliminated}} from the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after losing to India, New Zealand and Australia. Many were left disappointed after this and the PCB announced they would take action. There were initial talks that Ahmed Shehzad and Umar Akmal could face a potential 2-year ban following their poor performance {{but this was not}} verified. However, the focus was on Waqar Younis and Shahid Afridi. The highlight of this was that Waqar Younis had written up a 6-page report on recommendations along with discreet reasons he though contributed to the failure. However, the PCB were accused of leaking this report to the media, where all details were publicised, particularly popularising the fact Waqar thought it was Afridi's fault. The PCB then refused to meet with Younis, confirming to most that they were responsible in leaking the files. Younis announced his resignation due to this just after Afridi resigned as T20 captain in April 2016. He said the PCB's actions were <b>a</b> <b>disgrace.</b> The PCB apologised to Waqar Younis for the leak on 6 April 2016.|$|E

25|$|Schutz made further {{tests at}} Dartford of {{a ton of}} ore on 29 December 1578, and a half ton of ore on 20 January 1579. The latter test yielded a value of only £10 per ton, causing {{suspicion}} to fall on Schutz, Denham, Frobisher and Michael Lok, a major promoter of the Frobisher voyages. The Commissioners appointed to supervise the voyages then ordered Schutz to perform a further test in their presence at Tower Hill, which he did on 22 March 1579. This time he obtained results of £15 a ton, which appeared to satisfy the Commissioners. Seeing his reputation being thus brought into discredit Schutz offered, in partnership with Robert Denham, to buy the entire 1300 tons of ore at Dartford at 20 marks a ton, and to refine it at their own cost; their offer was delivered by Lok to Lord Burghley and Sir Francis Walsingham on 18 April 1579, along with a separate offer from Lok himself for 150 tons of the ore. The Privy Council was at first inclined to accept the offer; however Frobisher insinuated that Lok and Schutz were fraudulently trying to get valuable ore worth £40 a ton into their own hands, and Sir Thomas Gresham and the other Commissioners, influenced by Frobisher, then termed it <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> to the Queen to sell it.|$|E
