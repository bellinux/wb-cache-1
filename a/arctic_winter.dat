5|$|In 1989, {{a project}} was started to bring Bodø/Glimt {{back to the}} top league. Among the most {{important}} issues was to secure better training facilities, particularly during the <b>Arctic</b> <b>winter.</b> The club proposed upgrading the artificial turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch. The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the artificial turf field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on the artificial turf pitch and remove the turf. New artificial turf would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club {{would not be allowed to}} play their matches on a gravel pitch, and the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new artificial turf on the training pitch, which was taken into use in 1990.|$|E

25|$|According to Tim Garrett, an {{assistant}} professor of meteorology at the University of Utah involved in the study of Arctic haze at the university, mid-latitude cities contribute pollution to the Arctic, and it mixes with thin clouds, allowing them to trap heat more easily.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the major sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>winters</b> 2003 / 04 – 2009 / 10. There were 6 major SSWs (major warmings [MWs]) in 6 out of the 7 winters, in which the MWs of 2003 / 04, 2005 / 06, and 2008 / 09 were in January and those of 2006 / 07, 2007 / 08, and 2009 / 10 were in February. Although the winter 2009 / 10 was relatively cold from mid-December to mid-January, strong wave 1 activity led to a MW in early February, for which the largest momentum flux among the winters was estimated at 60 ° N/ 10 hPa, about 450 m 2 s − 2. The strongest MW, however, was observed in 2008 / 09 and the weakest in 2006 / 07. The MW in 2008 / 09 was triggered by intense wave 2 activity and was a vortex split event. In contrast, strong wave 1 activity led to the MWs of other winters and were vortex displacement events. Large amounts of Eliassen-Palm (EP) and wave 1 / 2 EP fluxes (about 2 – 4 × 10 5 kg s − 2) are estimated shortly before the MWs at 100 hPa averaged over 45 – 75 ° N in all winters, suggesting profound tropospheric forcing for the MWs. We observe an increase in the occurrence of MWs (~ 1. 1 MWs/winter) in recent years (1998 / 99 – 2009 / 10), as there were 13 MWs in the 12 <b>Arctic</b> <b>winters,</b> although the long-term average (1957 / 58 – 2009 / 10) of the frequency stays around its historical value (~ 0. 7 MWs/winter), consistent with the findings of previous studies. An analysis of the chemical ozone loss in the past 17 <b>Arctic</b> <b>winters</b> (1993 / 94 – 2009 / 10) suggests that the loss is inversely proportional to the intensity and timing of MWs in each winter, where early (December–January) MWs lead to minimal ozone loss. Therefore, this high frequency of MWs in recent <b>Arctic</b> <b>winters</b> has significant implications for stratospheric ozone trends in the northern hemisphere...|$|R

He did much reading, mainly Arctic history and classical literature, and thought about a possible return visit to Peru, a country which had captivated him during the Collingwood voyage. When spring returned, a series of sledging expeditions was launched to search for further signs of the missing crews. Markham played a full part in these activities, which produced no further evidence of Franklin, but led to the mapping of {{hundreds of miles of}} previously uncharted coast.

500|$|The best-known {{and most}} widely {{credited}} {{suggestion is that}} made by Ernst Tryde, a medical practitioner, in his book De döda på Vitön ("The Dead on Kvitøya") in 1952: that the men succumbed to trichinosis, which they had contracted from eating undercooked polar bear meat. Larvae of Trichinella spiralis were found in parts of a polar bear carcass at the site. Lundström and Sundman both favor this explanation. Critics note that the diarrhea, which Tryde cites as the main symptomatic evidence, hardly needs an explanation beyond the general poor diet and physical misery, but some more specific symptoms of trichinosis are missing. Also, Fridtjof Nansen and his companion Hjalmar Johansen had lived largely on polar bear meat {{in exactly the same}} area for 15 months without any ill effects. Other suggestions have included vitamin A poisoning from eating polar bear liver; however, the diary shows Andrée to have been aware of this danger. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a theory that has found a few adherents, such as the explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson. [...] The chief objection is that their primus stove had kerosene still in the tank when found. [...] Stefansson argues that they were using a malfunctioning stove, something he has experienced in his own expeditions. Lead poisoning from the cans in which their food was stored is an alternative suggestion, as are scurvy, botulism, suicide (they had plenty of opium), and polar bear attack. A combination favoured by Kjellström is that of cold and hypothermia as the <b>Arctic</b> <b>winter</b> closed in, with dehydration and general exhaustion, apathy, and disappointment. Kjellström argues that Tryde never takes the nature of their daily life into account, and especially the crowning blow of the ice breaking up under their promisingly mobile home, forcing them to move onto a glacier island. [...] "Posterity has expressed surprise that they died on Kvitøya, surrounded by food," [...] writes Kjellström. [...] "The surprise is rather that they found the strength to live so long" [...] (p.54).|$|E
