500|$|Williams {{warned the}} Beatles about the {{competition}} they would face by {{playing in the}} same club as the Hurricanes by saying, [...] "You'd better pull your socks up because Rory Storm and the Hurricanes are coming in, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> good they are. They're going to knock you for six." [...] In early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day, alternating with the Beatles. They were appalled at the living conditions the Beatles and other groups like Howie Casey and the Seniors (who were sleeping in one room {{at the back of}} the Kaiserkeller) had to put up with, so they booked into Hamburg's Seamens' Mission.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{supposed}} to be released in late 2007, but Carey spoke about reason the album got delayed: [...] "You can't really put records out in December if you want the whole world {{to have a chance to}} actually hear it, [...] my fans all over the world are very important to me", adding that she also wants to put out a pair of singles before the album drops. In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E

6000|$|... "She is, though. These women can't fool me. I {{told you}} days ago I {{suspected}} that. Now I'll gamble on it. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> I play my cards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] Dryfoos persisted. [...] "We {{got some}} {{photographs}} of him; he didn't {{like to sit}} very well; but his mother got him to; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> he looked." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{know very}} well,' pursued the colonel's bride, 'that Miss Drowvey wouldn't fall. You complained of it yourself. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> disgracefully the court-martial ended. As to our marriage; would my people {{acknowledge}} it at home?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, reflectively, [...] "I don't {{think there}} can be much. There's been {{a good deal of}} cold weather this winter, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> metal shrinks! No-o-o, I'm sure there can't be only a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Lois said so---when {{you were}} so cross because the poker had got {{on the same side}} as the tongs! She said she never saw such an old battledore, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> all the others took it up.' ...|$|E

6000|$|ANABEL W. (moving forward, {{and holding}} out her hand). You'd merely {{have been told}} what Freedom ISN'T; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that already. <b>How</b> are you, Oliver? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'God bless me!' she piteously repeated, in that shocked, indignant, yet saddened accent.

6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] said Rosa with a laugh. [...] "Your sister Blanche {{looked very}} well {{in one of my}} dresses last year; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> stout she is. We will find some means to {{accommodate}} them all, depend upon it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And this'll be your second, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> {{these things}} are managed. No gentleman'll marry her because she runs after him. Girls as knows what they're about should let the gentlemen run after them. That's my {{way of looking at}} it.' ...|$|E
