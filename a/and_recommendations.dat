40|$|BackgroundProvider <b>recommendations</b> <b>and</b> {{offers for}} {{influenza}} vaccination improve adult influenza vaccination coverage. Analysis {{was performed to}} describe receipt of influenza vaccination <b>recommendations</b> <b>and</b> offers among adults who visited a healthcare provider (HCP) during the 20112 ̆ 0132012 influenza season and describe differences between those receiving <b>and</b> not receiving <b>recommendations</b> <b>and</b> offers for influenza vaccination. Associations between influenza vaccination <b>and</b> receipt of <b>recommendations</b> <b>and</b> offers were examined. MethodsRespondents to a random digit dial telephone survey who had visited a HCP since July 1, 2011 {{were asked if they}} had received a recommendation for influenza vaccination. Those receiving a recommendation were asked if they received an offer for vaccination. Participants were characterized by demographic and access to health care variables. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between participant characteristics <b>and</b> <b>recommendation</b> alone, between participant characteristics <b>and</b> <b>recommendation</b> <b>and</b> offer, and between influenza vaccination <b>and</b> <b>recommendation</b> <b>and</b> offer.

The head of a large county of about 10,000 households was called a Prefect, while the heads of smaller counties were called Chiefs, and both could be referred to as Magistrates. A Magistrate maintained law and order in his county, registered the populace for taxation, mobilized commoners for annual corvée duties, repaired schools and supervised public works.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty new designs, in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.|$|E

Some shelters were damaged during the hurricane, forcing the evacuees to go elsewhere. Overall, the population responded little to the official advisories <b>and</b> <b>recommendations,</b> which potentially contributed to the death toll on the island. More than 1,000residents of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines evacuated to 28emergency shelters. On Barbados, officials closed schools and government buildings and prepared shelters prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane. To minimize danger, the island power grid was shut down. Four shelters opened on Saint Lucia, where many people sought safety during the storm.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 Intelligence Survey Group had {{produced}} the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, {{which found that}} the CIA had failed in its responsibilities in both the coordination and production of intelligence. In response, the U.S. National Security Council accepted the conclusions <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> of the report. It remained to implement them. In May 1950, President Truman decided that Smith was the man he needed for the CIA. Before Smith could assume the post on 7 October, {{there was a major}} intelligence failure. The North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which started the Korean War, took the administration entirely by surprise, and it raised fears of a third world war.|$|E

The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia (Islamic law) requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law, when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual ablution, <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine.|$|E

Several searching <b>and</b> <b>recommendation</b> techniques in the Information Retrieval (IR) domain {{have been proposed}} to apply in the Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) domain. However, few of them pay attention on particular properties of e-learning resources, which potentially {{improve the quality of}} searching <b>and</b> <b>recommendation.</b> In this paper, we propose an approach that studies relations between e-learning resources, which is a particular property existing in online educational systems, to support resource searching <b>and</b> <b>recommendation.</b> Concretely, we rank e-learning resources based on their relations by adapting the Google's PageRank algorithm. We integrate this ranking into a text-matching search engine to refine the search results. We also combine it with a content-based recommendation technique to compute the similarity between user profile and e-learning resources. Experimental results on a shared dataset showed the efficiency of our approach...|$|R
