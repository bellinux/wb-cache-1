5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E
25|$|Most of Chile {{and parts}} of Argentina saw a partial eclipse at sunset. In some places over half the sun was obscured. In Chile, Valdivia in Los Ríos saw 63% obscured, Quellón in Los Lagos saw 54% obscured. Chilean coastal {{locations}} were ideally situated to observe an eclipsing sunset over the Pacific Ocean. Points further north, up to about La Serena, saw the eclipse begin <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> setting.|$|E

Warren denied Sheridan's allegation that Warren had given the impression he wanted the sun to go down before the attack could be made and that there were 2.5 hours of daylight still left at 4:00p.m.|$|E

25|$|The snowball Earth {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} invoked to explain glacial deposits in the Huronian Supergroup of Canada, though the palaeomagnetic evidence that suggests ice sheets at low latitudes is contested. The glacial sediments of the Makganyene formation of South Africa are slightly {{younger than the}} Huronian glacial deposits (~2.25 billion years old) and were deposited at tropical latitudes. It has been proposed that rise of free oxygen {{that occurred during the}} Great Oxygenation Event removed methane in the atmosphere through oxidation. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> notably weaker at the time, Earth's climate may have relied on methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, to maintain surface temperatures above freezing.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, {{a former}} servant came {{by the house}} and covertly informed them that a refractory priest would be presiding at a secret Mass at a farm in Marsyllis, about ten miles (15km) away. This was the Abbé Andrew Fournet, the underground pastor of Maillé, who would give Bichier a new direction in her life, answering her longings. The following week she set out at night on a donkey, led by the same former servant, {{to take part in}} the service. After a journey of three hours, they arrived at the site. After the Mass, Fournet began to hear the confessions of the people. As Bichier approached him, the peasants gave way to her, an aristocrat. Fournet challenged Bichier over her presumption and she let him hear the confessions of the entire congregation, going last just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> rising.|$|E
25|$|The Aztec world {{consisted}} of three main parts: the earth world on which humans lived (including Tamoanchan, the mythical origin of human beings), an underworld which belonged to the dead (called Mictlan ("place of death")), and the upper plane in the sky. The earth and the underworld were both open for humans to enter, whereas the upper plane in the sky was impenetrable to humans. Existence was envisioned as straddling the two worlds in a cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth. Thus <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> believed to dwell in the underworld at night to rise reborn {{in the morning and}} maize kernels were interred to later sprout anew, so the human and divine existence was also envisioned as being cyclical. The upper and nether worlds were both thought to be layered. Mictlan had nine layers which were inhabited by different deities and mythical beings. The sky had thirteen layers, the highest of which was called Omeyocan ("place of duality") and served as the residence of the progenitor dual god Ometeotl. The lowest layer of the sky was a verdant spring-like place with abundant water called Tlalocan ("the place of Tlaloc").|$|E

25|$|David O. Stewart, in his {{biography}} of Burr, American Emperor, {{notes that the}} reports of Hamilton's intentionally missing Burr with his shot began {{to be published in}} newspaper reports in papers friendly to Hamilton only in the days after his death. But Ron Chernow, in {{his biography}}, Alexander Hamilton, states Hamilton told numerous friends well before the duel of his intention to avoid firing at Burr. Additionally, Hamilton wrote a number of letters, including a Statement on Impending Duel With Aaron Burr and his last missives to his wife dated before the duel, that also attest to this intention. The two shots, witnesses reported, followed one another in close succession, and none of those witnesses could agree as to who fired first. Prior to the duel proper, Hamilton took {{a good deal of time}} getting used to the feel and weight of the pistol (which had been used in the duel at the same Weehawken site in which his 19-year-old son had been killed), as well as putting on his eyeglasses in order to see his opponent more clearly. The seconds placed Hamilton so that Burr would have the rising sun behind him, and during the brief duel, one witness reported, Hamilton seemed to be hindered by this placement <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> in his eyes.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> {{starting}} to go down, William Whiting's division achieved the breakthrough on Longstreet's front. Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood's Texas Brigade move forward swiftly and aggressively and broke {{a hole in the}} line. Four of the nine regimental commanders in Whiting's two brigades were killed or wounded, as well as Captain William Balthis, the division's chief of artillery. Pickett's brigade also succeeded in its second assault of the day. Confederate breakthroughs on their center and right could not be countered and the Union line crumbled. A total of nine Union regimental commanders were killed or mortally wounded in the battle. Most of the 4th New Jersey along with its colonel was surrounded and taken prisoner by Longstreet's division; a lieutenant colonel assumed command of the remaining men in the regiment. Sykes's regulars conducted an orderly withdrawal from the McGehee house to Grapevine Bridge. The Union brigades of Brig. Gens. Thomas F. Meagher and William H. French arrived from the II Corps, too late to help other than as a rear guard for Porter's retreat. A battalion of the 5th U.S. Cavalry under Captain Charles J. Whiting made a desperate charge against the Texas Brigade, but were forced to surrender after heavy losses. By 4 a.m. on June 28, Porter withdrew across the Chickahominy, burning the bridges behind him. During the retreat from Gaines Mill, Brig. Gen John F. Reynolds was also captured by the Confederates while sleeping under a tree.|$|E

[...] At the North Bridge in Concord, approximately 400 militiamen engaged 100 regulars from three companies of the King's troops at about 11:00am, resulting in casualties on both sides. The outnumbered regulars fell back from the bridge and rejoined the main body of British forces in Concord.|$|E
500|$|To {{celebrate}} {{the launch of}} the London Free School's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people {{at the opening of the}} Roundhouse, attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull. In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers, mirrors and stretched condoms. After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation. On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace, London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> beginning to rise.

2500|$|... "Here Comes the Moon" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison {{from his}} 1979 album George Harrison. Harrison wrote the song while on holiday on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978. His inspiration for the composition was {{the appearance of the}} moon in the evening sky, just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> setting. Although the lyrics focus on this natural occurrence rather than on the symbolism it suggests, in the manner of Harrison's Beatles track [...] "Here Comes the Sun", the song is seen as a sequel to that similarly titled piece.|$|E

2500|$|The Aztecs were {{particularly}} noted for practicing human sacrifice {{on a large}} scale; an offering to Huitzilopochtli would be made to restore the blood he lost, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> engaged in a daily battle.

In the 1487 re-consecration of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan some estimate that 80,400 prisoners were sacrificed though numbers are difficult to quantify as all obtainable Aztec texts were destroyed by Christian missionaries during the period 1528–1548. [...] The Aztec, also known as Mexica, periodically sacrificed children as it was believed that the rain god, Tlaloc, required the tears of children.|$|E

2500|$|George Harrison wrote [...] "Here Comes the Moon" [...] {{while in}} Hana on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978. The {{purpose of the}} visit was partly to write {{material}} for his first album in two years, titled simply George Harrison, and partly for Harrison and his girlfriend, Olivia Arias, to enjoy a holiday after learning {{that they were to}} become parents for the first time. As with several of the songs on the album, Harrison drew inspiration for [...] "Here Comes the Moon" [...] from his surroundings on Maui. In his 1980 autobiography, I Me Mine, he recalls seeing [...] "marvellous" [...] sunsets there and regularly sighting whales. On this particular occasion, Harrison adds, [...] "the full moon was coming up <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> going down – all this and here comes the moon! Too much." [...] His experience was heightened by the effects of either LSD or magic mushrooms, the last of which provided inspiration for another new song, [...] "Soft-Hearted Hana".|$|E

And there appeared a smoking oven, and a flaming torch, which passed between the pieces. And God made a covenant with Abram to assign to his offspring the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates: the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
