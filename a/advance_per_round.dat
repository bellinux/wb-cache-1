40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the results of induced stress measurement in damaged regions around a test tunnel excavated by smooth blasting. The blasting design was for a test tunnel excavation 8 m 2 in cross section, with an <b>advance</b> <b>per</b> <b>round</b> of 2. 5 m. Five rounds were performed by two types of detonators, each with a large-hole cut and perimeter holes in a 0. 4 m spacing. One is electronic detonators (EDs) which were used in the holes on the perimeter of the right half, the other is conventional pyrotechnical long period delay detonators of 0. 25 deci second interval (PDs) which were used in the holes on the perimeter of the left half. In order to compare the delay accuracy of two detonators, a series of stress measurement was performed from the tunnel wall. It was made clear that EDs had little influence on remaining rock and surface, and PDs generated a damaged region. The damaged region generated by PDs was within 1 m from the tunnel surface and vertical stress hardly acted on the damaged region. ...|$|E
