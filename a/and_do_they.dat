500|$|Historically, the actuarial {{profession}} {{has been reluctant}} to specify the pass marks for its examinations ( [...] , [...] ). To address concerns that there are pre-existing pass/fail quotas, a former Chairman of the Board of Examiners of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries stated, [...] "Although students find it hard to believe, the Board of Examiners does not have fail quotas to achieve. Accordingly pass rates are free to vary (<b>and</b> <b>do).</b> <b>They</b> are determined by the quality of the candidates sitting the examination and in particular how well prepared they are. Fitness to pass is the criterion, not whether you can achieve a mark in the top 40% of candidates sitting." [...] In 2000, the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) decided to start releasing pass marks for the exams it offers [...] The CAS's policy is also not to grade to specific pass ratios; the CAS board affirmed in 2001 that [...] "the CAS shall use no predetermined pass ratio as a guideline for setting the pass mark for any examination. If the CAS determines that 70% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then those 70% should pass. Similarly, if the CAS determines that only 30% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then only those 30% should pass.".|$|E
