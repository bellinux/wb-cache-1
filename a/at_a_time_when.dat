50|$|Historic {{preservation}} {{was another}} aspect of Mohyla’s multifaceted career. He initiated substantial restoration projects of key historical monuments in Kiev and around the country. Among them was the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. People believed that for as long the Cathedral was standing the city would be spared from destruction. Thus by restoring St. Sophia and other monuments, Mohyla, on the one hand, strengthened the Ukrainian Church’s position, and on the other, his efforts were a morale booster for the whole country <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> national unity and independence were at risk.|$|R

5|$|B.integrifolia {{produces}} a dark amber-coloured honey of middling quality and therefore low commercial value.

5|$|Caragiale created Mitică <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the Romanian {{culture as}} {{developed}} in the Old Kingdom was the recipient of French influence, and the Romanian language was open to Francization.
