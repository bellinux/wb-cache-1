(CCL) in the Laboratory of Department of Entomology, University of Arid Agriculture Rawalpindi. It {{was concluded that}} Parbat proved to be highly susceptible against CCL as compared with Paidar- 91, the susceptible standard. The variety CM- 2000 proved to be susceptible. The variety Punjab- 91 and Pb- 2000 proved to be partially resistant while Bittle- 98 proved to be resistant against CCL.

Its {{deficiency}} or over secretion cause many disorders including polyurea, polydipsia, {{and weight loss}} in metabolism. Publications to date show strict relationships between insulin level <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors in a cell. In this respect a mathematical estimation on insulin level <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors may be important {{in order to understand}} some diseases related to insulin level <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors. In the present study, a queueing theory originated model is applied to insulin level <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors. Based on real data, some parameters such as optimum insulin level, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptor <b>and</b> minimum required energy spent were calculated by using queueing theory. Our results show an indirect correlation between insulin level and receptor. The total energy spent is also decreased up to optimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors <b>and</b> then it is increased. From the results, it could be said that queuing theory predicts the optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors. In conclusion, the data reveals that queueing theory can be applied to insulin level <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors. Estimation of insulin levels in insulin-insulin receptor complex <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors obtained through queueing analysis may identify etiological origins of some insulin-based metabolic disorders...|$|R

Fecal samples were collected for fecal egg counts (FEC) and abomasum samples were obtained for histopathological examination and eosinophil, mast cell and globule leucocyte counts. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Haemonchus spp. present in the abomasum was estimated from a 10 % aliquot of its content.
