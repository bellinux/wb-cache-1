5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Cardiff Bay Opera House scheme, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project,</b> the Wales Millennium Centre, met with more success. The necessary consents and funding were obtained, and work began in 2002 on a new multipurpose arts centre on the Cardiff Bay site. The centre included a 1,900-seat theatre, which, among other uses, became WNO's home base from 2004, with its own rehearsal space and offices in the complex.|$|E
5|$|In September 2001 {{development}} {{began on}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project,</b> Sam & Max Plunge Through Space. The game {{was to be}} an Xbox exclusive title, developed by Infinite Machine, a small company consisting {{of a number of}} former LucasArts employees. The story of the game was developed by Purcell and fellow designer Chuck Jordan and involved the Freelance Police travelling the galaxy to find a stolen Statue of Liberty. However, Infinite Machine went bankrupt within a year, partially due to the failure of their first game, New Legends, and the project was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} make money from Frog Fractions, Crawford first sold the game's soundtrack, with part of the {{proceeds}} going to the game's music team. He later decided to sell T-shirts containing jokes from the game in order to benefit its art team. While developing Frog Fractions, Crawford said that {{he came up with}} a lot of other video game ideas, but he then realized that he could implement them immediately into Frog Fractions rather than start <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project,</b> due to the game's unpredictable nature.|$|E
5|$|Khánh held {{a number}} of {{meetings}} with American officers in Huế {{during the first two}} weeks of January. In addition to routine military matters, coup discussions were also reported to have taken place. Khánh also regularly flew down to Saigon to take part in plotting with his colleagues. These usually took place in the secluded house of a colonel who was a nearby province chief. Meetings were also held at Khánh's headquarters in Huế. Khánh began growing a small goatee, which he customarily grew when he was attempting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project</b> and would only shave once the job had been completed.|$|E

5|$|Kirov was {{completely}} overhauled from 1949 to 1953. Her secondary armament was upgraded with electrically powered, fully automated 100mm B-34USM mountings and her fire-control system {{was replaced with}} a Zenit-26 system with SPN-500 stabilized directors. All of her light AA guns were replaced with nine twin gun water-cooled 37mm V-11 mounts. All of her radars were replaced with Soviet systems: Rif surface search, Gyuys air search, Zalp surface gunnery and Yakor' anti-aircraft gunnery radars. All anti-submarine weapons, torpedo launchers, aircraft equipment and boat cranes were removed. While expensive, about {{half the cost of}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>Project</b> 68bis , it was deemed a success and allowed Kirov to serve for another two decades.|$|E
5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} {{was at stake}} following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project</b> to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E
5|$|Since the T65 {{project was}} fading away, the Armored Force still needed a light {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, so they made <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project</b> (called T65E1) {{based on the}} new T24 chassis (a prototype of the M24 Chaffee). The T65E1 had the same overall layout as the T65 GMC – gun turret at rear with the engines {{in the middle of}} the chassis – with a few minor tweaks (including an angular gun shield instead of a straight one).|$|E

5|$|The one-act opera genre {{had become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno {{for the best}} such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project.</b> Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might {{be made into a}} trilogy of one-act operas.|$|E

5|$|After the Cardiff Bay Opera House {{project was}} rejected, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project</b> was {{conceived}} that included more than opera and was {{felt to be}} a better reflection of Welsh culture. The change of name symbolised this, but the project still had to overcome many hurdles. Funding from the Welsh Assembly and Millennium Commission took years to obtain. Cardiff Council had to buy the land after the previous owners, Grosvenor Waterside (Associated British Ports property division) threatened to build a retail centre there due to the delays. Further boosts were given by large donations from South African businessman Donald Gordon and a loan from the international bank, HSBC. The GB£20million donation from Donald Gordon was split evenly between the Royal Opera House and Wales Millennium Centre and was spread over five years. This {{is believed to be the}} largest single private donation ever made to the arts in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} point as Hooker's approach, Hawker had been working upon the {{development}} of a replacement fighter aircraft for the Hawker Hunter, designated as the P.1121. However, the P.1121 was cancelled shortly after the publishing of the 1957 Defence White Paper, which had advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. In light of this cancellation, Hawker found itself with the available resources to commit to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project,</b> and thus decided to study the use of the projected Pegasus engine as a basis for a new military aeroplane that would be able to conform with an active NATO specification that sought a new Light Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat G.91, particular attention was paid to meeting the specification's performance and load requirements.|$|E
5|$|By early 2000, McKagan {{had begun}} working on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project</b> with singer Mark Lanegan and drummer Geoff Reading. Though they {{recorded}} {{a number of}} songs, Lanegan left to join Queens of the Stone Age. After being convinced by Reading and Martin Feveyear to take over lead vocals, they continued to write and record new material at Jupiter Studios. With nearly an album's worth of material recorded, they decided to re-record some of the songs from Beautiful Disease {{to add to the}} material they already had. Though primarily recorded by McKagan and Reading, Dave Dederer, who joined the band as bassist, and Mike Squires recorded additional drums, while Feveyear, who also produced the album, recorded additional keyboards.|$|E

5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, {{and felt the}} album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project</b> in the works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E
5|$|Following the brothers' falling out, Max {{had formed}} a new band, Soulfly, and Igor had {{recorded}} four studio albums with Sepultura before leaving the band in January 2006. In July 2006, Max received an unexpected call from his brother, {{and by the end}} of the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix, Arizona, to perform in a Soulfly show. Igor joined Soulfly in concert and performed two Sepultura songs. After the show, Max suggested they begin <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project,</b> and Igor accepted. To complete the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and the Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier to play bass guitar. The group then recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co-producer Logan Mader in July 2007. Named after the band's original moniker, Inflikted was released through Roadrunner Records on 25 March 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, NATO issued NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) which {{specified}} a VTOL aircraft, {{albeit one}} with the supersonic performance of an aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom II, along with the VTOL capability. Recognising that the P.1127 would not satisfy this, Hawker commenced work upon <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>project,</b> designated P.1150, which was effectively a supersonic derivative of the P.1127, as well as another version, designated P.1154, which would meet the specified requirements of NBMR-3. The P.1154 was declared {{the winner of the}} NATO competition; prototype construction was already underway at the point of cancellation in 1965. The French government had withdrawn shortly after the P.1154's selection over the Dassault Mirage IIIV.|$|E
