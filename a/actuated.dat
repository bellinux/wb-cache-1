5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically <b>actuated</b> but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically <b>actuated</b> air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
40|$|A non-collinear valve {{actuator}} includes a primary <b>actuating</b> {{system and a}} return spring system with each applying forces to a linkage system in order to regulate the flow of a quarter-turn valve. The primary <b>actuating</b> system and return spring system are positioned non-collinearly, which simply means the primary <b>actuating</b> system and return spring system are not in line with each other. By positioning the primary <b>actuating</b> system and return spring system in this manner, the primary <b>actuating</b> system can undergo a larger stroke while the return spring system experiences significantly less displacement. This allows {{the length of the}} return spring to be reduced due to the minimization of displacement thereby reducing the weight of the return spring system. By allowing the primary <b>actuating</b> system to undergo longer strokes, the weight of the primary <b>actuating</b> system may also be reduced. Accordingly, the weight of the non-collinear {{valve actuator}} is reduced...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith the {{improving}} {{skills of}} oil exploration and exploitation, {{the proportion of}} the production of ultra-low permeable reservoirs is increasing. But the developing process has encountered many problems, such as poor reservoir properties, high injection <b>actuating</b> pressure, etc. Aimed at lowering the injection <b>actuating</b> pressure of ultra-low permeable oilfield, author has finished the indoor gradient test of <b>actuating</b> pressure, selected and evaluated a system of surface acting agent which later applied in the X oilfield as well. The results show that the gradient <b>actuating</b> pressure of Z reservoir in X oilfield ranges between 0. 0308 MPa/cm to 0. 2215 MPa/cm. And because the SAA system could largely reduce the surface tension between fluid and rock, the injection <b>actuating</b> pressure then can be reduced by 40 %- 50 %. And its application efficiency was 75 %. As a result, it is feasible to use SAA to lower the injection <b>actuating</b> pressure of ultra-low permeable reservoirs...|$|R
5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be <b>actuated</b> by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E

40|$|In AFM based robotic nanomanipulation system, {{one of the}} key {{technical}} problems is to realize high accurate <b>actuating</b> and positioning of the AFM probe. To solve the problem, based on analyzing the hysteresis and nonlinear characteristics of the AFM PZT actuator and previous <b>actuating</b> methods, a new <b>actuating</b> method called 'actuating method based on reappearing the scanning trajectory' is presented to <b>actuate</b> the PZT actuator. Besides, two kinds of probe positioning errors, namely kinematics coupling errors due to tube actuator bend motion, and probe tip positioning errors caused by cantilever deformation, are analyzed quantitively and compensated to further improve the probe positioning accuracy. Due to adopting the new <b>actuating</b> method and positioning error compensation method, the positioning accuracy of AFM probe can be significantly improved and thus nanomanipulation and nanoassembly can be performed accurately. Nanolithography experiments were presented to verify the effectiveness of the new <b>actuating</b> method and positioning error compensation method. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{solution}} for steering microrobotic swarm by dynamic <b>actuating</b> fields. In our approach, {{the motion of}} micro-robots is controlled by changing the <b>actuating</b> direction of a field applied to them. The time-series sequence of <b>actuating</b> field’s directions can be computed automatically. Given a target position {{in the domain of}} swarm, a governing field is first constructed to provide optimal moving directions at every points. Following these directions, a robot can be driven to the target efficiently. However, when working with a crowd of micro-robots, the optimal moving directions on different agents can contradict with each other. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a novel steering algorithm to compute a statistically optimal <b>actuating</b> direction at each time frame. Following a sequence of these <b>actuating</b> directions, a crowd of micro-robots can be transported to the target region effectively. Our steering strategy of swarm has been verified on a platform that generates magnetic fields with unique <b>actuating</b> directions. Experimental tests taken on aggregated magnetic micro-particles are quite encouraging. Author accepted manuscriptAdvanced Manufacturin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{piezoelectric}} micro-actuator with <b>actuating</b> range amplification {{structure has}} been proposed.

In case of general piezoelectric thin film actuator, applied voltage is low and almost zero power is consumed. Its switching time is very fast in comparison with electrostatic actuators and thermal actuators. However, the most drawback of piezoelectric actuator is short <b>actuating</b> range. A 100 µm length PZT actuator can only make movement of 100. In this research, we suggest an actuator which can provide geometric amplification of the PZT strain displacement in lateral direction.
