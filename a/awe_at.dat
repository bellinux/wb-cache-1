He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told it well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy and <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> life itself.|$|E

More than being compatible with Conservative Judaism, I {{would say that it}} is a mitzvah to learn about the world and the way it works {{to the best of our}} abilities, since that is to marvel with <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> God's handiwork. To not do so is sinful.|$|E

25|$|Jandamarra {{was held}} in awe by other Aboriginal people who {{believed}} he was immortal, his body simply a physical manifestation of a spirit that resided in a water soak near Tunnel Creek. It was believed that only an Aboriginal person with similar mystical powers could kill him. Police chasing Jandamarra were also in <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> his ability to cross the rugged ranges with no effect on his bare feet, despite their boots being cut to shreds by the sharp rocks.|$|E
25|$|The human {{target is}} the {{essential}} distinguishing feature of the impalement arts. It has been asserted by several sources, including well-known knife throwers, that the power and appeal {{of this type of}} act lies as much in audience appreciation of the target as in admiration of the skill of the thrower or archer. Various theories have been put forward to explain this, ranging from simple <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the , in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} carried out in extreme secrecy by a team {{consisting}} of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (<b>AWE)</b> <b>at</b> Aldermaston, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, and Hunting Engineering at Ampthill, Sperry Gyroscope at Bracknell, Lockheed Aerospace in the United States, and others too numerous to mention, both in the US and the UK. The system was tested at the US Eastern Test Range, Cape Canaveral, and the warheads were tested with two full scale underground nuclear tests - 'UGT's - (Fallon UGT in 1974 and Banon UGT in 1976) at the Nevada Test Site. There were also numerous weapon effects tests to prove the RV/warhead resistance to the radiation-effects of the Galosh warhead; and there were numerous missile tests at the Woomera Missile Range, Australia, to develop various aspects of the RVs, the PAC and decoys. Recent declassifications of official files show that more than half the total project costs were spent in the United States, with industry and government agencies.|$|E

500|$|During {{the autumn}} of 1660, while the Duke's Company was still getting financed (mostly {{by means of the}} actors buying company shares) and having {{temporary}} quarters set up, the King's Company offered a string of well-received productions. Their new albeit traditional theatre in Vere Street was already fully operational. The devoted playgoer Samuel Pepys called it [...] "the finest playhouse... that ever was in England" [...] in his diary, a sentiment he would need to revise many times over the coming decade, and recorded his <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> seeing Michael Mohun, [...] "who {{is said to be the}} best actor in the world", act on its stage. Davenant was far behind, but daringly put all his capital into the outfitting of a new superior playhouse in Lincoln's Inn Fields (simultaneously, with great foresight, prying loose the rising young star Thomas Betterton from the King's Company), and perfectly hit public taste.|$|E
500|$|Tom Carson, {{television}} {{critic for}} The Village Voice, praised the episode, {{which he said}} [...] "featured some amazing sick jokes about American affluence and obliviousness". Dianne Williamson of the Telegram & Gazette praised [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] for taking a chance with the source material, and said, [...] "Often I'm in <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> the courage of these [...] creators." [...] The Advertiser of Lafayette, Louisiana, called the episode [...] "hysterical" [...] and particularly praised its satire of American consumerism. The St. Paul Pioneer Press described the episode as [...] "hilarious" [...] and said, [...] "We know we shouldn't laugh, but we can't help it." [...] Vicki Englund of The Courier-Mail complimented the [...] "really bizarre storyline" [...] and {{the moral of the}} episode, and especially praised the jokes about Struthers: [...] "It {{might be a good idea}} not to eat during the hilarious second episode. Enough said." ...|$|E

Julian guessed their reason for leaving and was about to follow them when Stephanie took him by the hand.|$|R
500|$|By 1812, despite Grimaldi's {{success as}} a performer, {{he was close to}} {{bankruptcy}} {{as a result of his}} wife's extravagant spending, a number of thefts by his accountant and the cost of maintaining both an idyllic country lifestyle and his son JS's private education. [...] The strain on Grimaldi's finances caused him to accept as many provincial engagements as he could. [...] That year, he travelled to Cheltenham and appeared again as Scaramouche in a revival of Don Juan. In nearby Gloucester he met the poet Lord Byron, on whose poem the play was based, at a dinner party. [...] Byron was in <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> meeting the famous Clown, stating that he felt [...] "great and unbounded satisfaction in becoming acquainted with a man of such rare and profound talents". [...] Grimaldi returned to London to star as Queen Ronabellyana with much success in the Covent Garden Christmas pantomime, Harlequin and the Red Dwarf; or, The Adamant Rock. [...] After this, he increasingly played [...] "dame" [...] roles.|$|E
500|$|The Pillar {{quickly became}} a popular tourist attraction; Kennedy writes that [...] "for the next 157 years its ascent was a must on every visitor's list". Yet from the {{beginning}} there were criticisms, on both political and aesthetic grounds. The September 1809 issue of the Irish Monthly Magazine, edited by the revolution-minded Walter [...] "Watty" [...] Cox, reported that [...] "our independence has been wrested from us, not by the arms of France but by the gold of England. The statue of Nelson records the glory of a mistress and the transformation of our senate into a discount office". [...] In an early (1818) history {{of the city of}} Dublin, the writers express <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> the scale of the monument, but are critical of several of its features: its proportions are described as [...] "ponderous", the pedestal as [...] "unsightly" [...] and the column itself as [...] "clumsy". However, the Hibernian Magazine thought the statue was a good likeness of its subject, and that the Pillar's position in the centre of the wide street gave the eye a focal point in what was otherwise [...] "wastes of pavements".|$|E
500|$|Coach McKay had {{won four}} {{national}} championships while coaching at USC, {{and he never}} hesitated to express his lack of <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> the NFL. He earned enemies in the league with his dismissive comments and nonchalant attitude. The league liked to promote the games as having life-or-death significance, and were undercut by a coach who would make statements such as, ‚ÄúYou draw Xs and Os on a blackboard and that‚Äôs not so difficult. I can even do it with my left hand‚Äù. Such statements made the Buccaneers‚Äô road more difficult, as a feeling grew around the league that McKay was a newcomer who needed to be taught a lesson. Linebacker Richard ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù Wood echoed those sentiments: ‚ÄúIt was a brand-new organization. Who cared about us? They wanted to devastate us, beat us in the ground. And with coach McKay coming from college, they wanted to maybe even play us a little harder." [...] Examples given of opponents using McKay‚Äôs comments {{as an excuse to}} run up the score included the reverse that Denver ran late in a 48‚Äì10 victory, and the timeout that Chuck Fairbanks called {{at the end of the}} Patriots game to enable Steve Grogan to break the NFL record of season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. One sports analyst had predicted that McKay‚Äôs lucrative contract would encourage opposing coaches to run up the score on the Buccaneers, to be able to demonstrate to their team owners that they were deserving of similar money.|$|E

However there are Jack and Mettie on beyond ever so far.' And he elevated his voice in a coo-ee, after what he believed to be Australian fashion; but his weakness prevailed, and he laughed at his own want of power to shout much above his breath. 'You do it, Bill.' ...|$|R
500|$|The film's acting {{met with}} mixed reception. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{appreciated}} that guest stars Woodard and Cromwell {{were used in}} [...] "inventive contrast" [...] to their better-known images, as a [...] "serious dramatic actress" [...] and [...] "dancing farmer in Babe", respectively. Lloyd Rose of The Washington Post felt that while Woodard and Cromwell managed to [...] "take care of themselves", Frakes' direction of other actors was not inspired; Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times opined that only Cromwell received a choice role in the film, [...] "so he steals the show by default". A couple of reviews noted that Data's interactions with the Borg Queen {{were among the most}} interesting parts of the film; critic John Griffin credited Spiner's work as providing [...] "ambivalent frisson" [...] to the feature. Empire magazine's Adam Smith wrote that some characters, particularly Troi and Crusher, were lost or ignored, and that the rapid pacing of the film left no time for those unfamiliar with the series to know or care about the characters. Likewise, Emily Carlisle of the BBC praised Woodard's, Spiner's, and Stewart's performances, but felt the film focused more on action than characterization. Stewart, whom Thompson and Renzetti considered overshadowed by William Shatner in the previous film, received praise from Richard Corliss of Time: [...] "As Patrick Stewart delivers [...] line with a majestic ferocity worthy of a Royal Shakespeare Company alumnus, the audience gapes in <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> a special effect more imposing than any ILM digital doodle. Here is real acting! In a Star Trek film!" ...|$|E

The moon is under her feet and a halo of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to [...] "a woman clothed with the sun" [...] from Revelation 12:1-2.

50|$|West's only friend, {{the narrator}} {{initially}} attaches himself to West in college {{out of a}} kind of hero worship mentality, <b>awed</b> <b>at</b> the daring of West's experiments. Over time, though, as West's experiments become more morally reprehensible, and West seems to lose interest in science and instead indulge in sheer perversity, the narrator comes to fear West and becomes a kind of slave to him, too afraid of West's capacity for evil to outright abandon him. In the 1985 film adaptation, the character is (ostensibly) named Dan Cain (played by Bruce Abbott).|$|R

2500|$|Parts of Crews's 1975 {{collection}} Out of My System, the 1986 collection Skeptical Engagements, and the 2006 Follies of the Wise {{were also}} dedicated to literary criticism. Crews's repeated message to literary critics {{is to be}} critical of their own interpretation when making statements about the meaning of a work. Regarding Crews's position on literary criticism, C. A. Runcie notes, ‚ÄúWhat Frederick Crews says about psychoanalysis is true for all criticism and its theorizing: 'A critic's sense of limits, like Freud's own, must come from ‚Ä¶ his <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> how little he can explain.'‚Äù Crews has been identified by the literary theorist Joseph Carroll as one of [...] "the very few scholars who have consistently and effectively opposed poststructuralism." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Wind" [...] is {{cast in a}} form closely {{associated}} with Dafydd, the poem in which a messenger or llatai, usually a bird or animal, {{is sent to the}} poet's lover. [...] It {{is a good example of}} how Dafydd's works in this form can include a close and warmly-appreciative description of a llatai, even when, as is often the case in Dafydd's poems, he is describing nature in one of its harsher aspects. [...] The careering course of the wind is embodied in the headlong pace of the poem. [...] Rachel Bromwich called [...] "The Wind" [...] one of [...] "the outstanding expressions of Dafydd's wonder and <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> the mysteries of the cosmic forces", but pointed out that in the end Dafydd curbs this force to act as a love-messenger to Morfudd. [...] The poet Gwyneth Lewis sees the poem as [...] "a hymn to the havoc that art can work in the world", while for the scholar Helen Fulton the wind is a metaphor for [...] "freedom and autonomy from the laws of governing society". [...] This political aspect of the poem is particularly apparent in lines 19‚Äì22 (13‚Äì16 in some editions): ...|$|E
