Their findings were published in a treatise called Beiträge zur Kenntniss des indirecten Sehens (1857). From their work the eponymous [...] "Aubert-Förster law" [...] is derived. Aubert and Förster's data showed that visual acuity changes between central and peripheral vision in an approximately linear fashion with the visual <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>eccentricity.</b> Another eponym associated with him is [...] "Aubert's phenomenon", an optical illusion involving the factual position of a subjective vertical line when an observer's head is tilted.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of retino-tectal projections is dissimilar {{depending on whether}} the receptors are situated in the nasal and temporal visual hemiretinas. Indeed, it has been claimed that the superior colliculus receives a greater proportion of its input from the temporal visual hemifield (nasal hemi-retina) relative to the nasal hemifield (temporal hemi-retina). In order to investigate whether these subcortical projections influence face processing, we investigated the early cortical ERP responses to faces and houses presented in the temporal and nasal retinas using monocular viewing. Neutral or fearful faces were presented concurrently with houses on either side of a central fixation cross, while participants were asked to discriminate changes in luminance at the center. Results showed that the lateralized N 170, computed as the contralateral-ipsilateral electrode difference, was greater for faces appearing in the nasal relative to the temporal visual hemifield. This was due to a greater ipsilateral N 170 for temporal relative to nasal presentations. By contrast, no difference was found across emotional expressions. The enhanced ERP response to faces appearing in the temporal visual field, suggests that the retinotectal pathway modulates cortical processing, most likely through activation of a colliculo-pulvino-amygdalar pathway, with subsequent back-projections from the amygdala to visual cortical regions. However, unattended facial expressions do not seem to modulate the response, at least at these <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>eccentricity...</b>|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} the age of an observer, the peripheral location of a face stimulus on a display, {{and the intensity of}} the emotion expressed by the face all play a role in emotion perception. Older individuals have more difficulty identifying emotion in faces, especially at lower expressive intensities. The purpose of the current study was to understand how younger and older adults’ abilities to detect emotion in facial stimuli presented in the periphery would be affected by the intensity of the emotional expressions and the distance that the expressions are presented away {{from the center of the}} display. The current study presented facial stimuli for a short duration to bypass reactionary attentional influences. More intense fearful and angry expressions were expected to be easier to classify for both younger and older adults than lower intensity expressions, but all expressions were expected to become more difficult to classify when presented further in the periphery. Older adults and younger adults displayed similar emotion detection for typical and extreme intensity angry expressions and for high intensity fearful expressions. However, older adults struggled to detect typical intensity fear, and this deficit grew with the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>eccentricity</b> from which the stimuli were presented from the center of the display.

40|$|AbstractFor Listing’s law to be obeyed during eye movements, the “half-angle rule” must be satisfied: the eye {{velocity}} axis must tilt {{away from}} Listing’s plane by half the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> eye position <b>eccentricity</b> from primary position. We aimed {{to determine if}} this rule is satisfied during horizontal and vertical pursuit compared with saccades. Three-dimensional (3 -d) eye rotation data were acquired from five normal head-fixed humans using the search coil technique. Saccades were recorded in response to 40 ° horizontal or vertical steps in target position, at different elevations and azimuths. Pursuit was recorded while tracking a target moving horizontally or vertically at 20 °/s, with peak-to-peak amplitude of 40 °, at the same elevations and azimuths. First- and second-order surfaces were fitted to 3 -d eye position data from periods of fixation. In all subjects, eye positions did not lie on a planar surface, but on a twisted surface in 3 -d space. The tilt-angle coefficient (TAC) during saccades and pursuit was calculated as the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> eye velocity axis tilt to the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> eye position <b>eccentricity.</b> During horizontal saccades and pursuit, mean TACs were 0. 58 and 0. 64, respectively. During vertical saccades and pursuit, mean TACs were 0. 35 and 0. 43, respectively, and lower than their horizontal counterparts (p< 0. 05). These findings suggest that Listing’s law is not perfectly satisfied during saccades or pursuit. On the basis of model simulations, we propose that the discrepancy in horizontal and vertical TACs causes eye positions to lie on a twisted rather than a planar surface...|$|R

40|$|The elastic-plastic {{behavior}} of pin-ended reinforced concrete slender columns subjected to bi-axially eccentric loads is investigated experimentally and theoretically. The ultimate loads, longi-tudinal and transverse deformations {{and the behavior}} up to failure of the columns are examined in detail. A total of 36 column specimens with rectangular cross sections including square sections were tested. The ratios of column length to minimum depth ranged from 6 to 26. Loads were applied monotonically at each column end with equal eccentricities at various angles from an axis of sym-metry. The ultimate load carrying capacity of a slender column is reduced by additional eccentri-city due to lateral deflection even in a column having a length to depth ratio of 15. The numeri-cal analysis to solve the load-deformation response of the column predicts the test behavior very well. In the case of square columns, {{there is not much}} difference in the ultimate loads of the col-umns in spite of variation of the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>eccentricity</b> of the applied load. However, the remark-able effects of biaxial bending on the elastic-plastic behavior occurs with the rectangular columns. When the rectangular columns are subjected to biaxially eccentric load to cause bending about the near-strong axis, the ultimate loads and the deformation behavior are significantly affected by the bending about the weak axis of the section. 1...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of an eye movement that follows Listing's law is the half-angle rule that says that the angular velocity of the eye tilts by half the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>eccentricity</b> of the line of sight relative to primary eye position. Since all visually-guided eye movements in the regime of far viewing follow Listing's law (with the head still and upright), the question about its origin is of considerable importance. Here, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence that Listing's law results from a unique motor strategy that allows minimizing ocular torsion while smoothly tracking objects of interest along any path in visual space. The strategy consists in compounding conventional ocular rotations in meridian planes, that is in horizontal, vertical and oblique directions (which are all torsion-free) with small linear displacements of the eye in the frontal plane. Such compound rotation-displacements of the eye can explain the kinematic paradox that the fixation point may rotate in one plane while the eye rotates in other planes. Its unique signature is the half-angle law in the position domain, which means that the rotation plane of the eye tilts by half-the angle of gaze eccentricity. We show that this law does not readily generalize to the velocity domain of visually-guided eye movements because the angular eye velocity is the sum of two terms, one associated with rotations in meridian planes and one associated with displacements of the eye in the frontal plane. While the first term does not depend on eye position the second term does depend on eye position. We show that compounded rotation - displacements perfectly predict the average smooth kinematics of the eye during steady- state pursuit in both the position and velocity domain...|$|E
