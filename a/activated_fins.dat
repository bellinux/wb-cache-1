40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility of reducing the cost, size and weight of an <b>activated</b> <b>fin</b> stabilizer system of a ship with a large metacentric height, by the introduction of a free surface effect. The free surface causes a virtual reduction in the ship's metacentric height, and consequently lowers the requirements of the fin stabilization system. Calculations for a typical large warship indicated that the free surface effect could reduce the cost by about one-third, and the weight of the overall stabilization system by about 22 %. Space requirements were essentially unchanged. Achievement of these reductions, however, required the extensive use of broad, shallow tanks. It proved to b...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe theory of Roll stabilization of Ships {{is presented in}} the context of modern control theory. The most common systems used to reduce the roll are described, and the principal equations are formulated. A general approach for the analysis of roll stabilizers is developed and it is applied to an <b>activated</b> <b>fin</b> stabilizer system. For this approach parameter plane techniques were applied, and the system was simulated in the Digital Computer by means of the Continuous System Modeling Program CSMP-IBM/ 360. Finally a system is proposed which is intended to improve the performance of passive tank stabilizers introducing fluidic devices in the feedback loop in addition to a supply of air compressed to actuate on the water ballast. The system was simulated using the same program CSMP-IBM/ 360, and the results compared with those obtained in the simulation of a simple passive tank stabilizer, showing a significant increasing in the damping.

Currently, intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) treatment {{is the only}} approved therapy in the United States for anabolic bone growth in osteoporosis patients. The anabolic effects of PTH treatment are due, at least in part, to modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Activation of the Wnt/ β-catenin pathway using a small molecule inhibitor of GSK 3 β was previously shown to increase markers of bone formation in vitro. Our study utilized a zebrafish model system to study Wnt <b>activated</b> <b>fin</b> regeneration and bone growth. Wnt signaling is the first genetically identified step in fin regeneration, and bony rays are the main structure in zebrafish fins. Thus, zebrafish fin regeneration may be a useful model to study Wnt signaling mediated bone growth. Fin regeneration experiments were conducted using various concentrations of a GSK 3 β inhibitor compound, LSN 2105786, for different treatment periods and regenerative outgrowth was measured at 4 and 7 days post amputation. Experiments revealed continuous low concentration (4 - 5 nM) treatment {{to be most effective}} at increasing regeneration. Higher concentrations inhibited fin growth, perhaps by excessive stimulation of differentiation programs. In situ hybridization experiments were performed to examine effects of GSK 3 β inhibitor on Wnt responsive gene expression. Experiments showed temporal and spatial changes on individual gene markers following GSK 3 β inhibitor treatment. Additionally, confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence labeling data indicated that the Wnt signaling intracellular signal transducer, β-catenin, accumulates throughout GSK 3 β inhibitor treated tissues. Finally, experiments revealed increased cell proliferation in fin regenerates following LSN 2105786 treatment. Together, these data indicate that bone growth in zebrafish fin regeneration is improved by activating Wnt signaling.

40|$|When animals {{move around}} {{interacting}} with the environment, the nervous system has to solve several tasks simultaneously {{in order to produce}} and control the movements - notably propulsion, posture, balance, and associated movements. Basic motor tasks are controlled by neuronal networks organized into central pattern generators (CPGs) and reflexes, located in the spinal cord and brainstem. The overall aim of this work has been to study how supraspinal descending control systems for locomotion, including control of movement direction, and postural control interact with each other, and with the spinal locomotor CPG in order to produce purposeful and economic movements. Locomotion and postural corrections were studied in the lamprey, a lower vertebrate, in which the reticulospinal (RS) system is responsible for sensori-motor integration and descending control. Different aspects of locomotor activity - initiation, termination, and regulation of the intensity of locomotion, as well as steering and maintenance of a proper posture - were reflected in the activity of RS neurons in intact, freely swimming lampreys. In vitro studies have shown that groups of RS neurons in the middle and posterior rhombencephalic reticular nuclei are activated by vestibular and visual stimuli. Here, the activity of these neurons was correlated to the direction of fictive turns in a novel in vitro preparation. Commands for lateral turns can be initiated in rhombencephalon and are mediated by ipsilateral descending spinal pathways. Asymmetric descending command signals, such as the commands for turning and postural corrections, are amplified by a system of crossed reciprocal inhibition in the spinal cord and phasically modulated by the locomotor activity. The alternating locomotor pattern is also dependent on crossed reciprocal inhibition between {{the two sides of the}} spinal cord. Crossing inhibitory neurons are subject to inhibition from a class of propriospinal neurons, the lateral interneurons (LINs), which have been considered as a possible burst terminating factor in the locomotor CPG. The LIN activity, however, is only weakly correlated to the output of the locomotor network. LINs receive input from RS neurons and may mediate descending commands related to motor function instead. Inhibitory mechanisms were also investigated in a light and electron microscopic study. A proportion of synaptic terminals in the lamprey spinal cord display immunoreactivity against two co-localized inhibitory neurotransmitters: glycine and GABA. Computer modeling of the neural mechanisms of lateral turns showed that locomotor models depending on LINs for burst termination did not generate turn-like patterns when LINs were activated. A strong activation of crossing inhibitory neurons by the descending turn command was necessary to generate turns in models of the locomotor network in which bursts are terminated by intrinsic properties of the crossing inhibitory neurons. In many species of fish, the paired pectoral and pelvic fins are the main effector organs for stabilizing and changing the body orientation in the roll and pitch planes. Lampreys lack paired fins but the dorsal fin may provide better stability in the roll plane. Primary afferents from the fin appear to take part in a local monosynaptic resistance reflex that <b>activates</b> <b>fin</b> motoneurons...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an autonomously powered and controlled robotic fish that incorporates an active flexural joint tail <b>fin,</b> <b>activated</b> through conducting polymer actuators based on polypyrrole (PPy). The novel electromaterial muscle oscillator (NEMO) tail fin assembly on the fish could be controlled wirelessly in real time by varying the frequency and duty cycle of the voltage signal supplied to the PPy bending-type actuators. Directional control was achieved by altering the duty cycle of the voltage input to the NEMO tail fin, which shifted the axis of oscillation and enabled turning of the robotic fish. At low speeds, the robotic fish had a turning circle as small as 15 cm (or 1. 1 body lengths) in radius. The highest speed of the fish robot was estimated to be approximately 33 mm s− 1 (or 0. 25 body lengths s− 1) and was achieved with a flapping frequency of 0. 6 – 0. 8 Hz which also corresponded with the most hydrodynamically efficient mode for tail fin operation. This speed is approximately ten times faster than those for any previously reported artificial muscle based device that also offers real-time speed and directional control. This study contributes to previously published studies on bio-inspired functional devices, demonstrating that electroactive polymer actuators can be real alternatives to conventional means of actuation such as electric motors...|$|R
