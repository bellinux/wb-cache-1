5|$|Development for {{multiple}} platforms is profitable, but difficult. Optimizations needed for one platform architecture {{do not necessarily}} translate to others. Individual platforms such as the Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> develop for compared to their competitors, and developers are not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core processors and hyper-threading. Multi-platform releases are increasingly common, but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile systems {{do not have to}} operate under the pressure of $20 million budgets and the scrutiny of publishers' marketing experts.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E
5|$|Designed as {{a weapon}} with the longest reach in Soulcalibur, Ivy's sword Valentine {{consists}} of several smaller blades linked together by a chain, able to take either broadsword or chain whip forms. These forms are represented by different stances Ivy can use in the series, altering many of her attacks for each and applying different uses to either form of the weapon, with some, such as Spiral Lust, a component of an existing attack. In addition to these the sword can also have the segments be split apart, in which case they will attack the opponent in different ways before recombining on the sword's chain. Due to her variety, Ivy has been noted as being able to attack from any range, however she has also been described <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> properly use unless utilizing a range the opponent is weakest at. However, attacks such as Ivy Brambler allow her greater variety in range, and allow for chaining into other attacks upon a successful strike. Other attacks, such as Summoning Suffering and Calamity Symphony, involve grappling with the opponent to damage them, though utilize complex controller inputs that require them to be utilized in tandem with other moves. With the Xbox Live release of Soulcalibur, due to its complexity the former was utilized for an achievement.|$|E

50|$|Environmentalists on {{the left}} who support {{regulations}} designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control. They see natural resources <b>as</b> too <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> privatize, <b>as</b> well as legal responsibility for pollution or degrading biodiversity <b>as</b> too <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> trace.|$|R

25|$|Early PlayStation 3 reviews after launch were {{critical}} {{of its high}} price and lack of quality games. Game developers regarded the architecture <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> program for. PS3 was, however, commended for its hardware including its Blu-ray home theater capabilities and graphics potential.|$|E
25|$|Semi-savoy is {{a hybrid}} variety with {{slightly}} crinkled leaves. It {{has the same}} texture as 'Savoy', {{but it is not}} <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> clean. It is grown for both fresh market and processing. 'Tyee Hybrid' is a common semi-savoy.|$|E

25|$|The Montana state {{legislature}} enacted a groundwater rights claiming law in 1961. The law mimicked the 1885 filing right system.

25|$|The fiasco {{prompted}} {{many employers}} using the Bedaux System, and those derived from it, {{to change its}} terminology to more neutral and administrative language. This goes some way to explain why historical research into the enduring influence of the Bedaux System and its Bedaux Unit has been reported <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> undertake.|$|E
25|$|An {{absolute}} pacifist {{is generally}} {{described by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation as one who believes that human life is so valuable, that a human should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense. The principle is described <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> abide by consistently, due to violence not being available {{as a tool to}} aid a person who is being harmed or killed. It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence.|$|E

25|$|In 1648, {{when the}} Scots marched into England in the Campaign of Preston, Livingston served as lieutenant-general under the Duke of Hamilton, but Hamilton found him <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> work with as Leven had done previously, and his advice was mainly {{responsible}} for the defeat at the Battle of Preston. After Preston, Livingston escaped to Holland. In 1650 {{he was allowed to}} return to Scotland, but in 1654 his estates were seized and he was imprisoned (See Cromwell's Act of Grace). He came into prominence once more at the Restoration.|$|E
25|$|The second main {{school of}} thought, {{put forward by}} {{scholars}} such as McManus, is that ogham was invented by the first Christian communities in early Ireland, out {{of a desire to}} have a unique alphabet for writing short messages and inscriptions in the Irish language. The argument is that the sounds of Primitive Irish were regarded <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> transcribe into the Latin alphabet, so the invention of a separate alphabet was deemed appropriate. A possible such origin, as suggested by McManus (1991:41), is the early Christian community known to have existed in Ireland from around AD 400 at the latest, the existence of which is attested by the mission of Palladius by Pope Celestine I in AD 431.|$|E
25|$|However, Leeds {{started the}} 1985–86 badly and relegation to the Third Division became a real possibility, causing Gray to be sacked {{in favour of}} another Revie teammate, former Leeds and Scotland captain Billy Bremner. Bremner carried on where Gray had left off, but found it just <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> achieve promotion, though he did bring the club close to success. Under Bremner, the club were {{defeated}} 2–1 in the 1987 play-off final, after extra time, against Charlton Athletic and, in the same year, were beaten 3–2 (after extra-time) in the FA Cup semi-final, losing to eventual winners Coventry City. In October 1988, with the team standing at 21st position in the Second Division, Bremner was fired {{to make way for}} Howard Wilkinson.|$|E

25|$|Political {{scientist}} Elinor Ostrom, who {{was awarded}} 2009's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences {{for her work}} on the issue, and others revisited Hardin's work in 1999. They found {{the tragedy of the}} commons not as prevalent or <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> solve as Hardin maintained, since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves. For example, it was found that a commons in the Swiss Alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual benefit since 1517, in spite of the farmers also having access to their own farmland. In general, it is in the users of a commons interests to keep the common running and complex social schemes are often invented by the users for maintaining them at optimum efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Setsuna being a Kurd was an {{international}} decision by Sunrise. This was done as critique to Japan's apathy towards religion. Director Seiji Mizushima {{wanted to give}} viewers a close approach to the wars in the Middle East, believing the problem would not be solved in a long time. Mizushima aimed to make the viewers understand Setsuna's feelings {{as a result of}} living under war conditions. In regards to his personality, Mizushima wanted the series' protagonist that could not be related with the audience. This was done to contrast previous Gundam protagonists and appeal to young viewers. While he saw his past <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> understand he might look appealing as a result. The staff also wanted to create a character the audience could relate to. Late in the series, Setsuna's Quanta system was introduced in order to convey his message that he wants war to end through communication rather than violence. This idea was explored once again in the movie where the plot was written so that nobody except Setsuna could end the conflict.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of having periodically or occasionally paid recruits {{was that if}} their money had not arrived on time, they simply left the battlefield, or – in a worse scenario – they revolted, as has happened in several instances. Since {{they were the same}} skilled men-at-arms led by the same leaders previously fighting under the Hungarian flag, they were <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> eliminate as the Black Army was to its enemies. However, they could be outnumbered, since it was always a flank or division which quit the campaign. An easier solution was to have the captain accept some lands and castles to be mortgaged in return of service (in one occasion the forts of Ricsó (Hričovský hrad) and Nagybiccse (Bytča) to František Hag). An example of mass desertion occurred in 1481 when a group of 300 horsemen joined the opposing Holy Roman forces. One of these recorded insurrections was conducted by Jan Švehla, who accompanied Corvinus to Slavonia in 1465 to beat the Ottomans; but when they were approaching Zagreb, Švehla asked for royal permission to officially quit the offensive with his mercenaries due to financial difficulty. His request was denied, and as a consequence, he and two of his vice-captains left the royal banner along with their regiments.|$|E

500|$|... "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" [...] {{features}} instrumentation from guitar, marimba, harp and keyboard, with Dickson {{singing in}} a soprano voice. Author Mark Ross Clark noted in his book, The Broadway Song: A Singer's Guide, that her vocals portrayed different kind of emotions, with standard pitch correction in the lower middle C. Her vocals contrast the lyrics with an [...] "underlying coolness", while the light voice enabled Dickson to sing the lines [...] "So, what happens now?" [...] in sixteenth note, Emajor.

500|$|Unexpected {{attention}} {{for the single}} in the US prompted EMI to improvise new promotional plans, and the band shuttled {{back and forth between}} continents, playing more than 150 concerts in 1993. Radiohead nearly broke up due to the pressure of sudden success as the Pablo Honey supporting tour extended into its second year. The band members described the tour <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> adjust to, saying that towards its end they were [...] "still playing the same songs that [...] recorded two years previously... like being held in a time warp", when they were eager to work on new songs.|$|E
500|$|Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, the showrunners for {{the seventh}} and eighth seasons, {{believed}} that every season of the show should contain an episode starring Sideshow Bob. However, by the seventh season Bob had already {{been the focus of}} four stories, and writers were having trouble developing new ways to include him. Weinstein describes Bob's dialogue <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> write, due to his unique and refined style of speaking. Despite these challenges, however, creators of The Simpsons usually look forward to [...] "Sideshow Bob episodes"; the writers consider them enjoyable to write, and former director Dominic Polcino describes them as [...] "a treat" [...] to work on.|$|E
