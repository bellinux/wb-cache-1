40|$|The court fool of Shakespearean drama made snarky comments, sang {{nonsense}} verses, played tricks, {{and revealed}} weaknesses {{all at the}} expense and amusement of his superiors. Had any other character attempted such subversive acts, they would likely face punishment. However, because rulers sanctioned the fool’s positions in the court, his foolery was not seen as subversive. By employing Jonathan Dollimore’s three part model of social power (consolidation, subversion, and containment), and Bakhtin’s theory of the carnivalesque, I argue that the stock fool character falls {{in the category of}} consolidated power not subversion since he is licensed in his foolery. The fool can only be labeled subversive if he breaks beyond his job description. In 2 ̆ 2 King Lear 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Twelfth Night 2 ̆ 2 the viewer meets two fools who actually prove to be subversive.

40|$|The study explores teachers’ {{experiences}} in book clubs {{and how these}} {{experiences in}}form their pedagogical practices. Framed by a social constructivist epistemological stance, grounded {{in the work of}} narrative inquiry, and conceptualized by transactional reader-response theory, this study explores why teachers join and sustain book club membership, the ways books clubs are used to create meaning, how participating in a book club influences pedagogical practices, and ways in which clubs are used to negotiate aspects of their teaching identities and subjectivities. Through a multifaceted qualitative research design, I worked with thirteen teachers who belong to (or have recently belonged to) a book club as a separate entity from their teaching lives. I conducted interviews with thirteen teachers; attended three meetings of three separate book clubs to contextualize the study; and administered written reading profiles to explore participants’ reading practices. This research argues that teachers join and remain in book clubs for social interaction, intellectual stimulation and motivation to read ‘quality’ literature. Knowledges are created and validated by a community of readers capable of such recognition in a forum that does not otherwise exist. Club meetings are used in different and complex ways to negotiate teaching subjectivities <b>and</b> <b>push</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> fixed notions of the teacher identity. Further, this study showcases a myriad of ways that teachers’ experiences in book clubs enter the classroom both explicitly and implicitly...|$|E
40|$|While {{studies that}} examine {{religion}} in movements {{for social justice}} have increased in recent years, the intersections of race and religion remain understudied. Therefore, this dissertation is a relational and comparative study of Mexican American, African American, and Anglo Baptists in the Houston area as they engaged the struggle for civil rights through religious associations, churches, and leaders. It demonstrates that race and religion in Houston?s long civil rights movements produced changes in two directions: religion influenced Baptists? involvement with the movements, and the movement itself influenced Baptists? religious lives. I argue that from the 1910 s through the 1970 s, religion {{played a central role}} in Baptist efforts to both uphold and challenge the color line in Houston. Influential white Baptists attempted to protect white privilege and power by using their influence, religious organizations, and doctrine to enforce and protect the Jim Crow system toward both black and brown communities. At the same time Mexican American and African American Baptist leaders attempted to use the religious resources at their disposal to mitigate the effects of inequality <b>and</b> <b>push</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> racism. However, the long civil rights movement opened a space, a window of opportunity, for white, black, and brown Baptists to challenge racism in churches and in their denominations and to find new and creative ways of taking religious identity politics into the surrounding communities. And black and brown Baptists, sometimes with the help of progressive white Baptists, capitalized on the moment to mobilize religion and weaken the power of the color line and racial inequality...|$|E
40|$|Unlike the {{regulation}} of other heavy industries, frackingçin which companies create cracks in shale rock to extract gas, oil, or other substancesçhas been exempted from federal reach, leaving regulation to the states, which appear vulnerable to capture by energy interests. As fracking has expanded, become more complex, and generated considerable controversy, some states have sought to quash local government efforts to impose more stringent regulations. Citizens and activists have sought redress through the courts, and some states are fighting over the transport of waste disposal across state lines. The story is one of fractured, fragmented federalism that illustrates the key role played by regulated interests that prefer state to federal regulation, result-ing in a variable, often weak state regulatory regime. Much of regulatory policy scholarship has emphasized federal activity, {{with the federal government}} setting the broad parameters and state governments acting as the primary implementers. This is especially true in most social regulatory arenas, including environmental protection, where the federal government acts as overseer and gives states authority and discretion (Bowman and Kearney 1986; Crotty 1987; Lester and Bowman 1989; Welborn 1988). Given this, why did the federal government cut itself out of the regulatory picture in the area of fracking—ceding to states and industry primary authority over an issue that has many federal implications and precedents? Given the recent emergence of fracking, it is important to state that this article is an early attempt to describe what may be an idiosyncratic policy—or perhaps one that will become more common in future years. It is a story of dominant interests that have aligned themselves with federal and state governments to benefit the fracking industry <b>and</b> <b>push</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> their own local governments, citizens, and advocacy groups. This federalism regulatory scenario is unusual because, unlike a classic federalism problem in which states act in the absence of federal regulation, here the federal government has largely and deliberately cut itself out of the regulatory picture in ways that are seemingly more conducive to the big busines...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Designers of {{interactive}} technologies have long prioritized user engagement, and today’s popular end-user products are irresistibly engaging. Modern technology offers enormous value and convenience, {{but it has}} also led to widespread feelings of dissatisfaction, and users report wishing they had a different relationship with the technologies they use. Though families are avid technology users, this eager adoption has come with concerns about the impact of technology on family life and child development, and limit-setting is a salient topic in family contexts. This conversation is complicated by social narratives that pressure families to limit exposure to technology. My dissertation examines how families choose to integrate technology into daily life, how they wish they integrated technology into daily life, and what designers can do to help close the gap between the two. By building tools that families find easy to dynamically use and not use, as it suits their shifting needs, designers can support them in both making technology a meaningful part of daily life and also keeping it within bounds they feel good about. Here, I report first on a series of formative studies to understand families’ practices and values related to using technology. Across three investigations, I report on observational, interview, diary, and survey data from both parents and children. These studies show, for example, that many parents feel guilty when using personal devices in front of their children (even when they use them for only brief periods of time), children have a harder time complying with rules that ban technology in certain contexts (e. g., no phones at the dinner table) than rules that ban certain types of technology altogether (e. g., no social networking), and young children find it easier to transition away from screen media when the technology itself encourages them to do so than when parents encourage them to do so without the support of technology. Based on this background work, I next examine how designers might create systems that promote intentional usage behaviors. I present the design, development, and evaluation of two such systems: “MyTime,” created for adults, and “Plan & Play,” created for children. MyTime is a system-level persuasive technology for intentional smartphone use, and my deployment results indicate that it is effective in changing users’ habits in the short-term. Plan & Play translates evidence-based techniques for teaching self-regulation to preschoolers into a digital setting, and a lab study with parent-child pairs suggests that it supports children in engaging with tablets with intention. Across these studies, I examine how motivation, autonomy, family dynamics, and situated activities shape the ways in which families engage with <b>and</b> <b>push</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> technology. I argue that today’s parental controls, the primary design mechanism for limit-setting in family contexts, undermine children’s likelihood of self-regulating their own technology use and do not attempt to support families in mentoring children in becoming thoughtful consumers of technology. In a world where technology is available at every moment, managing one’s own media consumption has become an essential life skill. I hope that this work will shed new light on how designers can support users in engaging with technology with intention and leave them feeling more satisfied with their own behaviors...|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{fieldwork}} {{carried out}} between 2013 and 2014 in Singapore, I offer {{a case study}} of how students are shaped by <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> neoliberal discourses, by focusing on the ethnographic context of a local private education institute. Drawing on theorizations around the corporeal politics of value, this article examines the actual production of neoliberal subjectivities in light of a new rhetoric around the âlearning citizenâ in the globalising city-state. I demonstrate how private degree students engaged with practices of value coding that attempt to fashion themselves into âemployableâ future workers, but in ways that are informed by a different circulation of value meanings. These value practices â often defensive, anti-elitist, and subversive of a dominant subject of value (i. e. the âproperâ university student) â were aimed at recuperating and creating a separate domain of value worth. I argue that the actual production of neoliberal citizenship in education spaces need to be (re-) interpreted through a politics of value coding. This allows for a clearer view of how students themselves negotiate embodied forms of value, with and against those practices of alienation and exclusion that mark them as human capital...|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} the {{photographic}} camera {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} enabled the 'likeness' of an individual to be lifted with relative ease from its possessor and rendered with uncanny precision upon material. This fracturing of the subject into transportable, reproducible objects threatened a novel kind of harm, especially for women. This article brings new research to bear on the origins of the American 'right to privacy' (such as the Federal 1888 'Bill to Protect Ladies'), arguing that the foundational 1890 article by Warren and Brandeis was but one of numerous attempts to remedy the unauthorized circulation of women's photographic portraits. The gendered nature of this 'right' means it must also be contextualized within women's history and the broader struggle for equal citizenship. The 'right to privacy' cannot simply be dismissed as a purely conservative doctrine invoking feminine modesty. In its demands for the legal recognition of those pictured as active subjects, rather than 'pretty' objects, as individuals rather than nameless faces, as possessors of valuable property, rather than as valuable possessions in themselves, I argue that the 'right to privacy' challenged the masculine prerogative of copyright law <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the reduction of women to silent, compliant images that was occurring on an industrial scale, in the late nineteenth century...|$|R
