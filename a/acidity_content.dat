A. candidus may sometimes cause self-heating which increases the temperature of the contaminated crop, in order to increase its competitiveness with other fungi living in the organism or environment at low relative humidity. There have been cases reported where contamination by A. candidus resulted in an increase in surrounding temperature by 20-26&deg;C. A. candidus has also been reported to use and degrade straw lignin, arabinoxylan, and cellulose.|$|E
5000|$|The {{smoke point}} {{of an oil}} or fat is the {{temperature}} at which, under specific and defined conditions, an oil begins to produce a continuous bluish smoke that becomes clearly visible. Smoke point values can vary greatly, depending on {{factors such as the}} volume of oil utilized, the size of the container, the presence of air currents, the type and source of light as well as the quality of the oil and its <b>acidity</b> <b>content,</b> otherwise known as free fatty acid (FFA) content. The higher FFA in the oil to begin with, the quicker it will break down and start smoking. The higher in quality and the lower in FFA, the higher the smoke point. It is important to consider, however, that the FFA only represents typically less than 1% of the total oil and consequently renders smoke point a poor indicator of the capacity of a fat or oil to withstand heat. The smoke point of an oil correlates with their level of refinement. Many cooking oils have smoke points above standard home cooking temperatures: ...|$|E

This study aimed at determining {{the sensitivity of the}} alcoholic acidity and pH tests in soybean (GB 874 RR cultivar) grains with different quality standards obtained during storage. A completely randomized design, in a 3 x 6 x 5 (3 storage conditions x 6 storage times x 5 methods) factorial scheme, was used.

Additionally, rapid determination of gluten content and other physicochemical parameters including protein <b>content,</b> <b>acidity,</b> reducing sugar <b>content</b> and total reducing sugar content was performed. The classification performance of the sensor array was assessed by multivariate exploratory techniques. The physicochemical characterization of gluten free and regular flours, including gluten content prediction, was obtained by artificial neural networks (ANN) modelling. The reference values of gluten content in flour samples were determined by the ELISA method, while reference values of protein <b>content,</b> <b>acidity,</b> reducing sugar <b>content</b> and total reducing sugar content were determined by standard analytical methods. The application of the electronic tongue, combined with ANN, in the differentiation of gluten free and regular flour samples resulted in 95. 2 % and 100 % correct classifications, respectively. The developed ANN models for the prediction of gluten content in flour samples as well as protein <b>content,</b> <b>acidity,</b> reducing sugar <b>content</b> and total reducing sugar content, showed high potential of the electronic tongue as a simple and rapid technique for the prediction of gluten content and other physicochemical parameters of gluten free and regular flour samples.
