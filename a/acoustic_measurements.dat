40|$|The paper studies {{acoustic}} emission from air-plasma filament {{induced by}} a strong femtosecond laser pulse. Acoustic signal is detected with a sensitive directional microphone. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> provides a new method to determine {{the length of a}} filament. Compared with other methods, <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> is simpler, more sensitive, and with higher spatial resolution. Information of filament length is experimentally acquired through measuring acoustic pressure at different position of filament. On the basis of the relationship between acoustic signal and free-electron density in filament, profile of free-electron density is demonstrate...|$|R
50|$|Free field {{conditions}} can be artificially produced in anechoic chambers. In particular free {{field conditions}} {{play a major}} role in the field of <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> and sound perception experiments, since the results are influenced only by the sound of the sound source and not from reflections of the room.|$|E
50|$|Finnish is {{not really}} isochronic at any level. For example, huutelu ('shouting') and huuhtelu ('flushing') are {{distinct}} words, where the initial syllables huu- and huuh- are of different length. Additionally, <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> show that the first syllable of a word is (physically) longer than other syllables, {{in addition to its}} phonemic length (long or short). Thus, there are four distinct phonetic lengths.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a review of}} defect {{detection}} in rolling element bearings using vibration and <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> methods is considered. Localized and distributed categories of defect detection have been reviewed. Vibration measurement in both time and frequency domains along with sig-nal processing techniques such as the high-frequency resonance technique have been considered. As {{it is important to}} monitor the condition of the bearings and to know the severity of the defects before they cause serious damages. Therefore, the study of vibrations generated by these defects {{plays an important role in}} quality inspection as well as for condition monitoring of the rolling element bearings. <b>Acoustic</b> emission <b>measurements</b> for the detection of defects in roller bearings have been investigated in this paper. Other techniques like sound pressure and acoustic emission of <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> have been covered...|$|R

Everything from seismic signals, radiation, ground wave patterns, electromagnetic pulse, and <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> were studied at Gnome under Vela Uniform.|$|E
50|$|Brüel & Kjær {{was founded}} by Per Vilhelm Brüel (b. 6 March 1915 - d. 2 April 2015) and Viggo Kjær (b. 5 June 1914 - d. 25 July 2013) on 28 November 1942.The two men met while {{studying}} at The Polytechnic School in Copenhagen (now the Technical University of Denmark). After receiving their M.S. degrees in 1939 they decided to start a company developing instruments for <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements.</b> Holger Nielsen joined the company as third partner in 1945, and was with the company {{until his death in}} 1978.|$|E
50|$|Estill studied various qualities {{associated}} with {{different styles of}} singing, using techniques including EMG, electroglottography, voice signal analysis, X-rays of the phonating larynx, laryngeal fibre endoscopy, <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> and simultaneous videostroboscopy. This {{led to the development}} of a series of exercises to develop specific control over individual muscle groups and structures in the vocal mechanism. For example, Estill's endoscopic video recordings of the vocal tract during voicing demonstrated deconstriction techniques such as the 'silent laugh' that encourage the false vocal folds to retract. These exercises are now included within the Estill Voice Training system.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{assessment}} of fatigue degradation of C/PPS composites using simple <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> technique. Changes in natural frequency and attenuation decrement were chosen {{as indicators of}} fatigue damage accumulation in the studied composite material. New testing device was developed for <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement.</b> The experimental setup was designed to chime the specimen by repeatable force of stiff striker exciting a specific natural mode of vibration and to record the acoustic response of the specimen to the impact simultaneously. From the power spectral density of the signal the natural frequency was obtained. Using the same signal, the attenuation decrement was estimated from regression of the its envelope...|$|R

50|$|Even though today's MASINT {{is often}} {{on the edge of}} technologies, many of them under high {{security}} classification, the techniques have a long history. Captains of warships, in the age of sail, used his eyes, and his ears, and sense of touch (a wetted finger raised to the breeze) to measure the characteristics of wind and wave. He used a mental library of signatures to decide what tactical course to follow based on weather. Medieval fortification engineers would put their ear to the ground to obtain <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> of possible digging to undermine their walls.|$|E
5000|$|Advances in {{physical}} oceanography {{occurred in the}} 20th century. Sea depth by <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> of was first made in 1914. The German [...] "Meteor" [...] expedition gathered 70,000 ocean depth measurements using an echo sounder, surveying the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between 1925 and 1927. The Great Global Rift was discovered by Maurice Ewing and Bruce Heezen in 1953 while the mountain range under the Arctic was found in 1954 by the Arctic Institute of the USSR. The theory of seafloor spreading was developed in 1960 by Harry Hammond Hess. The Ocean Drilling Program started in 1966. There has been much emphasis on the application of large scale computers to oceanography to allow numerical predictions of ocean conditions and {{as a part of}} overall environmental change prediction.|$|E
5000|$|From 1985 onwards, Kolbe {{researched}} scale-model <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> with TDS and stage-acoustics. In 1986 and 1987, Kolbe {{contributed to}} the development of the first head-related ear-recording system for acoustic measurement and recording purposes. Kolbe said, [...] "Design criteria are always on the move and I have modified the LEDE concept End-Dead End studio control room technique to include the Reflection Free Zone (RFZ) manner of design. This gives the most uncolored sound possible in a given situation and provides a natural sound that can be the reference point. Of course, some of the original LEDE principles are still very valid such as the asymmetrical outer shell and completely symmetrical inner shell. The goal is to achieve as natural a sound as possible so that things such as equalization EQ can be used as an effect, rather than as an attempt to compensate for coloration and/or bad acoustics. The moment you have a neutral reference point I find that EQ settings tend to become less drastic and are often of the order of several dB or so. … As a studio designer I feel it is my duty to provide a neutral reference point; you then need a good engineer with good ears - and one who listens!” ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} weight measurement application and transducer positioning for the A Sort prototype that has been developed for automatic grading and sorting of timber. The prototype consists of a transportation system with hydraulic and electrical motors, a measurement system with laser scanners and <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> equipment and a control program for the automated process with CoDeSys. The objective was to integrate these parts in an automatic system process, controlling a prototype designed for <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> of logs. The devices were installed and configured to communicate via an existing fieldbus line using CANopen as communication protocol. A control program was made for each task and implemented in the control process for the automatic measurement of logs. Two load cells were installed beneath a moving tilt and the measurement equipment was tested and calibrated using three different logs with known weight. The testing showed {{that in order to}} get higher accuracy the construction needs to be modified. Photo cells were installed on the measurement frames and a program was made {{in order to make the}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> of the logs work properly...|$|R
50|$|The {{accepted}} gold-standard for quantitative <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> is the hydrophone. However, {{scanning the}} acoustic {{field with a}} hydrophone suffers from several limitations, giving rise to supplementary evaluation methods such as the schlieren imaging. The importance of the schlieren imaging technique is prominent in HIFU research and development.|$|R
50|$|Data {{acquisition}} hardware for <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> typically utilizes 24-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), anti-aliasing filters, {{and other}} signal conditioning. This signal conditioning may include amplification, filtering, sensor excitation, and input configuration. Another consideration is the frequency {{range of the}} instrumentation. It should {{be large enough to}} cover the frequency range of signal interest, taking into account the range of the sensor. To prevent aliasing, many devices come with antialiasing filters, which cut the maximum frequency range of the device to a little less than one-half the maximum sampling rate, as prescribed by the Nyquist sampling theorem. Dynamic range is a common way to compare performance from one instrument to another. Dynamic range is a measure of how small you can measure a signal relative to the maximum input signal the device can measure. Expressed in decibels, the dynamic range is 20 log (Vmax/Vmin). For example, a device with an input range of ±10 V and a dynamic range of 110 dB will be able to measure a signal as small as 10 µV. Thus, the input range and the specified dynamic range are important for determining the needs of your instrumentation system. Some well known vendors include OROS, HEAD acoustics, Norsonic, Brüel & Kjær, Prosig, National Instruments, LMS International and GRAS has a selection guide detailing the difference between microphones..|$|E
40|$|Methods are {{presented}} for making overall and directional <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> with forward velocity in the Lewis 9 x 15 V/STOL Wind Tunnel. Overall <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> are discussed first. The acoustic calibration methods, instrumentation features, {{and types of}} experiments {{are presented}}. Selected data are presented as examples of {{the various types of}} overall measurements that are possible. The method of making directional <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurements</b> is then presented.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{detecting}} loosened bolts in a structural joint based upon open-loop <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> is presented. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> is taken {{directly on the}} bolt head. The response of the bolt to a proximal hammer impact is evaluated and characterized using wavelet decomposition of the signal measured from the bolt head. Data were also taken from an accelerometer mounted longitudinally and transversely on the bolt head. Results from the stethoscope and the accelerometer are presented from a set of structural bolts in several conditions of preload and looseness. A stethoscope applied to the loose bolt and a proximal bolt during impact recorded a marked difference between tight, finger tight, and loose bolts. The study could enable a quick and simple method for detecting and evaluating detorqued bolts in structural joints...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{state-space}} formulation of a neuralnetwork-based hidden dynamic model of speech whose parameters are trained using an approximate EM algorithm. The training makes use {{of the results of}} an off-the-shelf formant tracker (during the vowel segments) to simplify the complex sufficient statistics that would be required in the exact EM algorithm. The trained model, consisting of the state equation for the target-directed vocal tract resonance (VTR) dynamics on all classes of speech sounds (including consonant closure) and the observation equation for mapping from the VTR to <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement,</b> is then used to recover the unobserved VTR based on Extended Kalman Filter. The results demonstrate accurate estimation of the VTRs, especially those during rapic consonant-vowel or vowel-consonant transitions and during consonant closure when the <b>acoustic</b> <b>measurement</b> alone provides weak or no information to infer the VTR values. 1...|$|R
