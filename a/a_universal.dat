5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E

40|$|A tree-based network N on X is {{universal}} if every rooted binary phylogenetic X-tree is a base tree for N. Hayamizu and, independently, Zhang constructively showed that, for all positive integers n, there exists <b>an</b> <b>universal</b> tree-based network on n leaves. For all n, Hayamizu's construction contains Θ(n!) reticulations, while Zhang's construction contains Θ(n^ 2) reticulations. A simple counting argument shows that <b>an</b> <b>universal</b> tree-based network has Ω(n n) reticulations. With this in mind, Hayamizu {{as well as}} Steel posed the problem of determining whether or not such networks exists with O(n n) reticulations. In this paper, we show that, for all n, there exists <b>an</b> <b>universal</b> tree-based network on n leaves with O(n n) reticulations. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare.|$|E
