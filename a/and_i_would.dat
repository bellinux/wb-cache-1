25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} things. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.|$|E

In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E

It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains.

25|$|Davydova {{was born}} in Voronezh, 500 {{kilometres}} south of Moscow.

Deciding {{she wanted to be a}} gymnast Elena went by herself to be enrolled in Voronezh's famous Spartak Gymnastics school, yet was turned away, as she was very small, and considered at the time to have the wrong physique for the sport."They would call me Kolobok after the little fairytale pancake".

Commenting on the new car, Toyota's Australian Divisional Manager National Marketing Brad Cramb said: ”The Toyota 86 lends itself perfectly to a concept that expands its appeal with added versatility while retaining its sleek and sporty coupe styling and sharp, responsive driving character”.|$|E

25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to state that {{there are quite a few}} Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E

25|$|Cohen and Batchellor {{ended their}} deal with Universal in 1934, and entered into an {{agreement}} with Pathe, to utilize their facilities and equipment. Cohen announced in August 1934 that C <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> produce 18 films in the 1934-35 schedule. In early 1935 Cohen survived a health scare, {{when he had to}} undergo emergency appendectomy procedure. Rumors began circulating in May 1935 that Cohen's company, along with Batchellor's, were to merge with Republic Pictures. Cohen denied those rumors. In December 1936, it was reported that Cohen was seeking to sell Invincible and begin producing for one of the major studios. Less than two weeks later, Cohen had signed agreements with Samuel J. Briskin to leave Invincible and had signed on with RKO to produce, which led to Invincible being disbanded. The remnants of Invincible were {{one of a number of}} Poverty Row studios taken over by Herbert Yates in 1936 and merged into his newly formed Republic Pictures in an attempt to create a dominant low-budget producer with enough power to take on the major studios. His first film at his new studio was 1937's Living on Love (originally titled Love in a Basement), directed by Lew Landers. Cohen's stay at RKO was short-lived however, and after his year-long contract expired, he left RKO.|$|E
