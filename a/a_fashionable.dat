5|$|Knightsbridge lies to {{the south}} of Hyde Park and on the road to Kensington. Beginning in the 1840s, with Thomas Cubitt's {{development}} of Albert Gate, the area changed from a hamlet into <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> suburb.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Polen {{was once}} known as <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> place to stay. The café-restaurant was closed {{at the end of}} 1974 and its {{location}} was subsequently rented to the furniture store Inden. The hotel remained open {{as a part of the}} Krasnapolsky Concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} Lord Frederick Verisopht in Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickelby {{lived in}} an apartment in Regent Street. This reflected {{the nature of the}} street in the mid-19th century when it was still <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> residence for the upper class.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} pubs {{have been based}} on Great Marlborough Street for centuries. The Coach and Horses at No.1 and the Marlborough Head at Nos.37–38 were both {{established}} in the 1730s. However, most of the 18th century buildings on Great Marlborough Street were later demolished, which led to the decline of its reputation as <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> street.|$|E
5|$|A steel corset in the Stibbert Museum, Florence, Italy, is {{dated to}} the mid-16th century, and {{thought to be}} similar to the metal stays {{recorded}} as having been made by a corazzaio mastro (master armour-maker) for Eleanor of Toledo and delivered to her on 28 February 1549. However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened corsets, it is thought that her steel bodice was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> garment.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} {{projects}} were focused in Brussels, where he constructed two large palaces, and Ostende, where a vast colonnaded arcade was built along the seafront {{in an attempt to}} turn the town into <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> seaside resort. During Leopold's reign, Belgium hosted five prestigious World Exhibitions, in 1885, 1888, 1894, 1897 and 1905, as well as a major national exhibition in 1880 to mark the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{east side}} of the city dates back to 1850 and has always {{contained}} higher end housing. The proximity and commanding view of the river kept these neighborhoods <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> address long after the original families departed. Lindsay Park, in The Village of East Davenport, was used as parade grounds for Civil War soldiers from Camp McClellan.|$|E
5|$|The gallery {{itself was}} <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> {{hit with the}} public. Newspapers carried updates of the {{construction}} of the gallery, down to drawings for the proposed façade. The Daily Advertiser featured a weekly column on the gallery from May through August (exhibition season). Artists who had influence with the press, and Boydell himself, published anonymous articles to heighten interest in the gallery, which they hoped would increase sales of the edition.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Mamilla Street {{extended from}} the Mamilla Pool to Jaffa Gate. Along this street, wealthy Arabs constructed homes, offices and stores in the 1800s. Toward {{the end of the}} 19th century, and especially during the British Mandate era, the street became <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> commercial district. Both Arab and Jewish businessmen operated high-end shops for furniture, textiles, housewares, art, photography, and automobile showrooms.|$|E

He once again wrote to the Home Office, saying that {{although}} he would still be prepared to be in command in Manchester {{on the day of the}} meeting if it was thought really necessary, he had absolute confidence in his deputy commander, Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange.|$|E
5|$|Though Eastbourne is a {{relatively}} new town, there is evidence of human occupation in the area from the Stone Age. The town grew as <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner, William Cavendish, later to become the Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town, but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration. The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a key feature of Eastbourne.|$|E

5|$|When {{it opened}} on 4 May 1789 at 52 Pall Mall, the Shakespeare Gallery {{contained}} 34 paintings {{and by the}} end of its run it had between 167 and 170. The Gallery itself was a hit with the public and became <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> attraction. It took over the public's imagination and became an end in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|Brudenell {{was a fine}} rider and, {{inspired}} by the decisive role of cavalry {{at the battle of}} Waterloo, his wish was to purchase a commission in <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, mindful of preserving the family pedigree from risk of battle, would not allow this. Instead in November 1815 he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He left in his third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite showing some aptitude, he did not take a degree.|$|E
5|$|Gunter's Tea Shop was {{established}} in 1757 at Nos.7–8 Berkeley Square by the Italian Domenico Negri. Robert Gunter took co-ownership of the shop in 1777, and full ownership in 1799. During the 19th century it became <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> place to buy cakes and ice cream, and was well known for its range of multi-tiered wedding cakes. The shop moved to Curzon Street in 1936 when {{the eastern side of}} Berkley Square was demolished. It closed in 1956, with the catering business surviving until 1976.|$|E

5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E
5|$|In the Georgian era, Norwich {{became an}} {{increasingly}} popular destination with travellers and developed into <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> shopping town. Buildings around the market were developed into luxury shops and coaching inns. The {{eastern side of}} the market was particularly fashionable and became known as Gentleman's Walk. The area around the market had become very congested by the 19thcentury, but the council was unable to raise funds for improvement and few alterations were made. Because many of the market's stalls were privately owned, the council was unable to rearrange the market into a more rational layout.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{part of the}} Millfield estate {{south of}} Tyburn Road (now Oxford Street), the street was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and was laid out around 1704. It was <b>a</b> <b>fashionable</b> address in the 18th century, but its {{character}} changed to commercial and retail use {{by the end of}} the 19th. Most of the street's original buildings have since been demolished. Great Marlborough Street has had an association with the law since the late-18th century; Marlborough Street Magistrates Court subsequently became one of the most important magistrates courts in London. The department store Liberty is on the corner of Great Marlborough Street with Regent Street and sports a Mock Tudor facade.|$|E
